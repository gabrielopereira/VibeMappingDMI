    "title": "Canned Reactions and FIFA Noise: The Specter of the Audience During a Pandemic",
    "abstract": "Synthetic crowd noise has been used in a variety of professional sports presentations since the onset of the pandemic. Sex dolls were used as seat-fillers during a professional soccer match in Korea in May of 2020. Technical compensations for the removal of crowds from stadiums indicate a dependency on the consistency of our media presentations. They also indicate a dependency on the kind of reproducibility that broadcast and presentation technology affords. This paper investigates—along McLuhanite and Baudrillardian lines—the significance of this inclusion of synthetic representations of an audience in order to legitimize the significance of these presentations and to pacify anticipated anxieties experienced by the television audience.",

    "title": "The Haunting of the Automated Gaze",
    "abstract": "This article analyzes the artistic exploration of machine vision in the video installation Modern Escape (2018) by Danish artist duo Hanne Nielsen and Birgit Johnsen. The artwork recreates a modern Western home pervaded by surveillance technologies and the automated vision of a robotic vacuum cleaner. The main conceptual idea of the work is the automated gaze , and with few exceptions, all the scenes in the video are filmed without a human behind the camera. As a result, the installation evokes the haunted atmosphere of a home penetrated by a gaze that drifts incessantly, opening up randomly strange and awkward vantage points of the interior. Specifically, the article offers a reading of Modern Escape in the light of Avery Gordon’s notion of “haunting” and argues that the modern Western home is saturated with traces of the military industrial complex through its commonplace technologies, which are haunted by a history of war, complicity, and masculine desires for control. Haunting, according to Gordon, is one way in which “abusive systems of power make themselves known and their impacts felt in everyday life” ( Ghostly Matters xvi). The present article discusses how Modern Escape responds to and questions the subtle militarization of the everyday the technologies carry into the estranged home, “that quintessential space of the uncanny, the haunted house” (Gordon, Ghostly Matters 50).",

    "title": "Jean Baudrillard and Feminism: Sara Ahmed and the Necessity to “Forget Baudrillard”",
    "abstract": "Jean Baudrillard’s work has had a turbulent relationship with feminist thought. Victoria Grace attributes this turbulence to a general refusal on the part of feminist critics to engage, borrowing from Rex Butler, with Baudrillard “in his own terms” (1). In this essay, I challenge Grace’s faith in Baudrillard’s work to wrest feminist thought from the clutches of hyperreality. Conversely, I argue that Grace’s lionization of Baudrillard’s theories as a panacea to the problems facing contemporary society is itself a replication of the very model of hyperreality that she, and Baudrillard, decries. To argue this, I perform two operations. Firstly, I present Baudrillard’s theory of the simulacrum arguing that its emergence does not mark the dissipation of the real in favor of the virtual but that it signals the emergence of a single world-view, or “integrated circuit,” that is taken as objectively real. Secondly, I turn my attention to Sara Ahmed’s feminist critique of Baudrillard’s work in “his own terms” and how this critique informs a need to push Baudrillard’s theories further than he himself pushed them. I conclude by suggesting that Baudrillard’s theories can be—and have been—used by",

    "title": "Baudrillard and the Prophetic: Reimagining the Twin Towers in Avengers: Infinity War",
    "abstract": "After 9/11, Jean Baudrillard proclaimed that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center (the Twin Towers) in New York City, would enter the imaginary space, that: “Even in their pulverized state… No one who knew them can cease imagining them …Their end in material space has borne them off into a definite imaginary space…” ( Spirit of Terrorism 36-37). This can now be considered a prophetic statement, not just in the realm of the human memory, a geographical imagination, but in the imaginary spaces of film. The Twin Towers are reimagined and revealed in presence and absence (maps and territories of the Real). They are present and have an origin story in Robert Zemeckis’ resurrection narrative The Walk , where the high-wire walk by Philippe Petite was credited with “giving them a soul.” They are present in their absence in the New York City skyline in Joseph Kosinski’s Oblivion . However, it is in Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War that the ruined and ghostly remains of the Twin Towers are reimagined, returning to haunt audiences on the screen, associated with one of the key plot elements, the Soul Stone, and its need for sacrifice. Avengers: Infinity War reimagines the Twin Towers as an architectural marker for the Soul Stone. To receive the stone, a sacrifice must be made of the beloved other, consistent with the history of the Twin Towers. What is the metaphoric transmission that their inclusion serves? This paper seeks to demonstrate the transmission of real-world trauma through Baudrillard’s works and his prophetic utterance on the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers that is fulfilled in the psychoanalytic geography of New York City through the filmic medium. In the film, Avengers: Infinity War , the",

    "abstract": "Facial recognition technologies are increasingly used outside of constricted, laboratory-like settings. While supporters of the technologies contend that they help in identifying threats by linking specific bodies to hard evidence, we argue that the indexical relations they exhibit are best described as experimental, pointing to specific situational constellations within which they were initially created. By revisiting key moments in the development of (semi-)automated facial recognition technologies from the late 1960s to the present, we identify varying situational assemblages of facial recognition that depend on different understandings of indexicality. These experimental indices rely on historical dynamics, including significant government interest in the development of facial recognition technology, expansion in the scale of experimental settings, and dissolution of the formerly strict boundaries between the social spheres of private image-sharing, commercial image distribution, and institutional image forensics for identification. In coupling experimental indices with the development of facial recognition technologies, we hope to show a way forward to comparing the histories of other evidential technical images too.",

    "title": "Hyporeality, the Society of the Selfie and Identification Politics",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the relevance of Baudrillard’s work for the contemporary era. It argues that the digital revolution that has escalated since his death in 2007 represents the extension of that productivist project he identified in western, semiotic societies: the desire to produce and realize the real. The liberation of each individual as a producer of images and content increases our stock of the real, but it has the reversive effect of proliferating and hollowing out the real, causing the mass-media age of hyperreality to reverse into the digital-age of hyporeality. It also reverses the fate of individuals and their subjectivity, as they move from being merely nodes of a network to being the center of their own, personalized media ecologies and networks. The self now absorbs the world in the society of the selfie. This is not, however, the unleashing of a real interiority but the expansion of that system of semiotic simulacral control Baudrillard had critiqued in his earliest work. This emphasis on the self and its identity can also be seen today in the rise of ‘identity politics.’ This paper argues that Baudrillard would have opposed this as caught within the dominant system and instead argues for the importance today, in a digital-era defined by the dominance now of ‘signal value,’ of an ‘identification politics’ that functions as the real mode of control. The model for this relationship, the paper concludes, is that of the experimental subject, wired and surveyed in its pains and pleasures.",

    "abstract": "In the discourses on photography, especially in the Anglo-American context, Jean Baudrillard has been regarded as the prophet of postmodern ‘hyperreality.’ This article argues for a different view of Baudrillard. By positioning his writings within historical, economic and social realities of the 1970s-1980s France, I argue that his legacy as a theorist and a practitioner of photography is best appraised with reference to his theory of simulacra and his lifelong preoccupation with objects — commodities, technological tools, artefacts, photographs. Considering Baudrillard’s theoretical appraisals of photography alongside his photographic practice, the article identifies a number of striking convergences between theory and practice, as well as important divergences, which are further clarified through a study of the photographic works of Baudrillard’s contemporaries, French artists Sophie Calle and the",

    "title": "Mediating Quarantine: Considering Netflix’s Homemade through Baudrillard’s Hyperreal and the Banal",
    "abstract": "Baudrillard has long been used to analyze media through critical, postmodern theory and as this paper shows, his work remains relevant as a lens through which to continue to view new works. This article considers how hyperreality and banality have made their way into viewers’ homes with international representations of life during the Coronavirus pandemic. By investigating production processes, artistic choices, and narrative content contained within Netflix’s Homemade series released in June 2020, this article considers how the remediation of quarantine exemplifies Baudrillard’s hyperreality and the banal. By considering how Homemade remediates quarantine’s social, cultural, physical, and economic realities, the films call attention to an age of increased information: we cannot escape the banal. Today, just as when Baudrillard first suggested it, the dissolution between reality and representation can be found throughout culture, leading to questions about the gap between art and the banal. As such, Baudrillard will remain a seminal media scholar who provides a distinct context through which to analyze and evaluate media and the world around us.",

    "abstract": "The name of Susanna Paasonen is well known to everyone working within media studies, affect theory, porn studies, sexuality studies, internet research, feminist theory, and several other fields. Her research engages with topics ranging from deep fakes to feminist humor, from the problems with online nipple censorship to the entanglements of drugs and technologies. The impressive breadth and interdisciplinarity of Paasonen’s research are matched by its rigor and lucidity. Her work productively draws on a diverse range of advanced theories and complex concepts, which are presented in a way that can spark insight with an experienced researcher as it can with an uninitiated reader. This rare mixture of inspired conceptual moves, boundary-pushing, and clarity is on full display in her several monographs, which include Carnal Resonance: Affect and Online Pornograph y (MIT Press 2011), Many Splendored Things: Thinking Sex and Play (Goldsmiths Press 2018), and Distracted, Frustrated, Bored: Affective Formations in Networked Media (MIT Press 2021). The latter offers a much-needed critique of reductive and totalizing cultural analyses, which diagnose digital media as the culprit of contemporary disaffection. According to different popular as well as theoretical accounts mapped by Paasonen, networked media cause addiction, bring about boredom, and atrophy our attention spans. By mobilizing the conceptual framework of ambiguity, Paasonen sets out to complexify these strong theories of digital media",

    "title": "Transparency and Sovereignty in Contact-tracing Networks",
    "abstract": "Threaded through Jean Baudrillard’s writings on society, politics, and technology is the notion of transparency. Transparency features in several works critiquing the digital era: by rendering everything overexposed and proximate, media technology has facilitated a frictionless or, using Baudrillard’s term, ecstatic flow of information. As transparency aligns itself semantically with frictionlessness and ecstasy, the question concerning the preconditions of transparency becomes pertinent. By advancing a reading of Singapore’s TraceTogether application, this article proposes that embedded within Baudrillard’s notion of transparency is the paradigm of friction: sovereignty. The TraceTogether team purports a non-invasive and privacy-preserving contact-tracing protocol. Circumventing the use of geo-location tracking, TraceTogether formulates a network of infected bodies based on proximity data by using Bluetooth Relative Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings between devices with the application installed. The reduction of all markers of identification and differentiation—or, points of friction—into the same frictionless code belies an imperative invocation of sovereignty. Drawing on a range of thought that obliquely confronts the question of sovereignty and friction, this article frames the inquiry within the parameters of Jean Baudrillard and other theorists whose deliberations on infrastructure like architecture and networks are wrought upon the concept of transparency. The sovereign power to suspend or collapse the friction/frictionless binary calls into question the right to retain one’s friction in this frictionless digital era. This article proposes a critical reading of topological transparency with a view to the political and bio-philosophical implications of what is at stake in proximity-tracing technologies.",

    "abstract": "When news media shared a video of outgoing president Donald Trump acknowledging the victory of president-elect Joe Biden, some social media users conspired that it was a deepfake, a synthetic image made with machine learning (ML) algorithms, despite evidence to the contrary. Employing this example in the following, I focus on how images generate veracity through the interrelated actions of human and machine learning (ML) algorithms. I argue that ML presents an opportunity to revisit the semiotic infrastructures of images as an approach towards asking how photorealistic images produce truth claims in ways that exceed the purely visual. Drawing from photographic theories of the image index and diagrammatic understandings of ML, I argue that meaning , described here as what images do in the world, is a product of negotiation between multiple technological processes and social registers, spanning data sets, engineering decisions, and human biases. Focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), I analyze sociopolitical and scientific discourses around deepfakes to understand the ways in which ML affords hegemonic ways of seeing. I conclude that ML operationalizes the evidentiary power of images, generating new thresholds of visibility to manage uncertainty. My aim is to critically challenge post-truth paranoias by analyzing how ML algorithms come to have ethicopolitical agency in visual culture, with implications for how images are made to matter in post-truth media ecologies.",

    "abstract": "A Series of Gaps Rather Than a Presence (2019) is a sound piece that critically inquires upon the persistence of modern/colonial listening practices in the recording and assessment of language, and more specifically of accent. The work is part of a long-term artistic and academic research project oriented at the use of so-called “accent recognition software” (sometimes “dialect recognition”) by the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, hereafter BAMF) in asylum seeking processes of undocumented migrants since late 2017 ( Drucksache 19/190 ). The introduction of automated evaluation, as of this writing exclusive to Germany, replaces other, similarly questionable sociolinguistic methods for determining the origins of people without papers—a common procedure for asylum processes both in the European Union and the UK. 1 The use of software",

    "abstract": "The “ We Can Do It!” of a female World War II war worker poster is considered an image of feminist empowerment. But its association with feminism is a largely late-20 th and 21 st -century development. This paper examines the image, and its modern re-appropriations, through the lens of Baudrillard ’ s concept of the simulacra and hyperreality. The image itself is part of the simulacra, developing meaning detached from historical facts about its origins and use during World War II. The paper specifically looks at the so-called inspiration for the original poster and a contemporary recreation of it that was later apparently adopted for use in a get-out-the-vote campaign. In both cases, the women represented pushed back at their image absorption, and the erasure of their identities within the simulacra. The paper demonstrates how the individual represented in the image struggles to maintain her own identity within the simulacra, often to mixed success.",
