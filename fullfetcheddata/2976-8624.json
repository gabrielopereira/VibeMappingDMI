    "title": "Multichannel networks in China's livestreaming industry: Failing industrial lore and limited intermediary roles  amidst platformization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I offer a critical view of the significance of studying multichannel networks as a renewed form of cultural intermediaries, with the conceptual lens of ‘friction’, in the context of platformization of cultural production. I first trace the historical formation of multichannel networks in China that is in tandem with the development of the livestreaming industry. Subsequently, drawing on 15 in-depth interviews with media practitioners and a 3-month participatory observation within a multichannel network institution in Guangzhou, China, I argue for a re-evaluation of multichannel networks’ intermediary positions in the increasingly complex platformization process where cultural production and commerce are deeply integrated. By comparing and analysing both the industrial lore (discourse) of multichannel network practitioners and their industrial practices, the findings demonstrate the messy, unstable, and contingent aspects of multichannel networks’ collaboration with platforms. As platform collaborators, or complementors, multichannel networks are not positioned in equality or sameness, and their collaboration does not necessarily produce communal good. Navigating the complex networks of people, products, and platforms as digital marketplaces, multichannel networks faced a precarious middleman position – their commercial activities were restricted and trapped by the industrial lore adhering closely to the platform logics of visibility and commodification. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study seeks to gain an understanding of the power relations in a failed platform-cooperativism initiative in Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2022. The project was started by a worker cooperative that acquired a Bibi Mob platform franchise and was supported by the city's solidarity-economy incubator. The project failed eight months after its inception. We examine the datafication process in the app in order to analyse how the power relations of global infrastructural platforms – Google and Amazon in particular – contributed to the end of the initiative. The workers’ local actions were constrained by disciplinary power imposed by the global platform ecosystem. Drawing on this Latin American experience, we argue that the infrastructural power wielded by dominant actors within the platform economy is exercised through a disciplinary apparatus, significantly restricting local actors’ autonomy, and acting as a form of what we term ‘disciplined autonomy’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, the networks of digital platforms are deeply intertwined with our everyday topographies. One of the giants of the industry is Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce company. Over the past decade, it has become our neighbour, employer and critical public infrastructure provider – a standard in modern city life. For the Ruhr metropolis in Germany, Amazon epitomizes a transformative force for shaping the historically industrial region into a warehouse for Europe. It brings with it the promise of turning the region into a service sector hub. With its extensive logistics and delivery operations, however, Amazon is building onto already existing (public) infrastructures, past and present: Drawing on the example of the logistical cluster at the Westfalenhütte in the north-east of Dortmund, a 612.000-resident city in Western Germany, this paper maps out how deeply rooted in (and dependent on) industrial histories ‘innovative’ contemporary developments by tech companies are. From the ground to the cloud, it reveals the various layers of public local infrastructure that Amazon is settling on to, profiting off of – or even taking over.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper delves into communications dynamics between social media platforms and their users as they navigate the opacity of governance policies. Using Meta and TikTok as case studies, we reveal that gaslighting – traditionally linked with relationship abuse where one partner undermines the validity of the other's experience – has become a pervasive communication strategy for platforms, manifesting in numerous instances where automated and human platform communications have directly contradicted users’ experiences, evidence and research. We analyse 36 diverse interview datasets and six public platform responses to content moderation issues, highlighting the systemic nature of this phenomenon within digital spaces. By moving beyond shadowbanning and isolated platform-to-user dialogue, we expand the scholarly understanding of platform gaslighting to encompass a broader spectrum of governance-related communications. Our dataset draws from seemingly disparate groups who share moderation experiences: Jewish creators engaged in combating antisemitism, Palestinian creators advocating for human rights and sex-positive creators, whose expertise and stories are dismissed and belittled by platforms. Our participants' experiences demonstrate that conceptualising platform communications as gaslighting can help expose corporate power imbalances in platform-user interactions, particularly in cases where platforms govern through undisclosed practices such as shadowbanning and de-platforming triggered by malicious flagging, along with ambiguous communication from their representatives. We demonstrate how the dismissal or minimisation of participants’ traumatic experiences by platforms’ automated processes and human teams is weaponised to inflict epistemic injustice, consolidate power, safeguard public image and evade accountability. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the under-explored role of the state in enabling platform capitalism by analysing Microsoft's infrastructural investment in Greece, as part of the country's post-pandemic ‘National Recovery and Resilience Plan: Greece 2.0’. While much of the critical literature emphasises platform companies’ control over infrastructure and data, we argue that state facilitation is a crucial component of platform capital accumulation. Through a case study of Microsoft's construction of three data centres in the region of Attica, we show how the Greek state actively facilitated this investment, framing it as a driver of modernisation and economic recovery. We base our study on a comprehensive document analysis of official communications, regulatory frameworks and legal documents. This involvement exemplifies how semi-peripheral states like Greece, shaped by neoliberal restructuring and economic dependence, contribute to consolidating the power of tech corporations, often at the expense of local communities and the environment. By integrating theories of state capitalism and techno-colonialism with critical platform scholarship, this article contributes to a deeper understanding of the political economy of platform capitalism, revealing the symbiotic yet exploitative nature of state-tech partnerships and urging a re-centring of the state's role in facilitating corporate dominance over digital infrastructures and global platform capitalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Algorithmic management has been a prominent focus of platform labour studies and is lately receiving increasing academic and policymaking interest. Conceptualisations of algorithmic management are mainly premised on ridehailing, crowdwork and food delivery platform research, while literature on algorithmic management of housecleaning and domestic work platforms is limited. This article draws on research in housecleaning platform labour in Denmark, demonstrating how algorithmic management unfolds in these platforms, which are the institutional devices which support algorithms in practice, and how platform workers experience, make sense of and resist this type of management. The analysis of the findings highlights two factors that greatly influence the algorithmic management process. The first is the role of customer support departments in underpinning – and sometimes substituting – the functions widely considered to be carried out by algorithms. The second factor is that intersectional subjectivities of – predominantly migrant and female – workers of Danish housecleaning platforms affect the ways in which workers experience and respond to their algorithmic management. The article concludes in proposing minor algorithmic management, as a concept more fitting to simultaneously describe the entanglement of human, social, and algorithmic components comprising housecleaning platforms’ algorithmic management and the contingent nature of migrant platform housecleaners’ compliance with such management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Hopes that the growth of platform work in Africa will provide new opportunities for women's employment have not yet been matched by empirical research. Based on a five-country survey of workers on 18 platforms across four sectors (ride-hailing, delivery, professional, microtasks), the research reported here makes the first direct, systematic comparison of men's and women's experiences of platform work in multiple African countries. The paper finds an absence of specific gender differences across many core operational structures of platform work including general shortcomings related to social protection, contracts, human/algorithmic management and representation being experienced similarly by both men and women. However, the paper also finds that these processes occur within a wider gender-unequal context in which gendered norms skew the presence of men and women in different sectors, and in which wider exclusions encourage women into platform work but lead them to experience greater precarity and dependency than men on that work. For example, women on average earn less than men because they work demonstrably fewer hours. This also limits the purported flexibility of platform work for women workers and denies them a pay premium to reflect their generally higher levels of education. While experienced by only a minority of women workers surveyed, gender-discriminatory cancellations, complaints and abuse were reported. The paper ends with recommendations for actions to address gender inequalities in platform work, and reflections on future research.</jats:p>",

These platforms, often associated with the Alt-Right, challenge mainstream social media by reinterpreting the value of safety. Using a mixed-method approach to study values promoted in social media policies, this study reveals that Alt Tech platforms reject traditional safety measures, viewing them as censorship, manifesting in three key strategies: advocating for unrestricted freedom of expression; reframing safety-oriented governance as censorship, and promoting an ideal of the digitally\n            <jats:italic>mature</jats:italic>\n            , user.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the emerging illicit, sprawling yet obfuscated global market for artificial social media engagements, which inflates follower counts and engagement metrics on social media profiles and posts. The organization of this market has previously been characterized using industrial metaphors such as “click farms,” “follower factories,” and “digital sweatshops” primarily based in the Global South. Using a mixed-methods approach that integrates ethnography with digital methods, this research delineates the platformization of the follower factory, highlighting a shift toward automation rather than manual interaction. This has facilitated the rapid expansion of a multi-sided market, enabling resellers to scale up and consequently necessitating a more complex labor organization that includes marketing and customer service, which have shaped cottage industries across the Global South. This market capitalizes on social media platform economies, using the existing infrastructure and user bases to operate. In other words, the engagement market has become centered on what we term a para-platform ecosystem, which, while operating alongside, remains reliant on social media platform infrastructure. By examining and conceptualizing platformization and platform ecosystems “from below,” as well as the conflictual asymmetry yet productive relationship between the para-platform ecosystem and social media platforms, this article provides an unprecedented description of the engagement market while challenging and expanding the boundaries of platform theory. </jats:p>",

We broaden its focus into a typology of four key sources of agency in the platformization process: policy, platform, workers and spatiality. We base our findings on two quite different care platforms: Mycare and My Homecare. Through document analysis, as well as interviews with care workers, we demonstrate how the four agencies shaped the two platforms in distinct and sometimes messy directions. Whilst the platformization process contributed to the rolling back of care worker rights and protections, whilst presenting frustrating barriers and even severe health risks, we also found it presented opportunities for the shared articulation of resistive care ethics, where a workforce comprized predominantly of women worked collectively to shape the path of platformization in their favour. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Feminists have long taken advantage of social media platforms for political and activist practices. While these efforts can take place in a varied digital media ecosystem, different platforms, with their distinct affordances and cultures of use, can help shape different modes of feminist expression. Drawing on 18 in-depth interviews with a varied group of feminist Instagram users, this article explores how Instagram, and particularly its Stories feature, can be used for feminist purposes. Adopting a holistic perspective, this article engages with participants using Instagram in different capacities – personal, professional, and activist – and is attentive to both highly visible social media practices and small acts of engagement, such as sharing to one's Stories, that embed feminisms in everyday social media uses. These interviews present a wide array of political action within Instagram, highlighting how Stories’ ephemeral affordances, interactive functionalities, and casual cultures of use can contribute to their perceived political potential. However, these interviews also help to foreground the tensions, complexities, and contradictions that can emerge in these feminist practices, addressing how political responsibility, platform logics of algorithmic visibility, and an uneasy relationship between the two can coalesce in pressures for constant online presence. This article thus offers a reflection on Instagram as an ambivalent vehicle for platformised feminisms, balancing platform limitations with critical users’ agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "When we (my co-authors Thomas Poell and Martijn de Waal) published The Platform Society. Public Values in a Connective World in 2018, the field of “platform studies” had just started to emerge. In our book, we tried to explain how platformization had started to affect entire sectors, exemplified by the news industry, urban transport, health care, and education. In the epilogue, we argued that “governing platform societies” requires not just a cross-sectoral approach but calls more profoundly for a transnational discourse of governance issues. Since 2018, we have seen a distinct rise in challenges concerning platforms and societies: the growing impact of Big Tech platforms on digital ecosystems around the globe; the rise of two “superpower” ecosystems which are in many ways interwoven with geopolitical forces; the mounting dependence of state and civil society actors on large digital infrastructures owned and operated by Big Tech; and the lasting impact of platformization not just on labor and business management, but on democratic processes and institutions.",

This paper explores the contested nature of the term 'platform,' which has been employed as a metaphor, a conceptual framework for interpretation, and a keyword in digital discourse. The initial section traces the origins of platform discourse and the evolution of platform thinking. The second section utilizes cultural semiotics to reconstruct the metaphor's utility as a pragmatic instrument of knowledge. The third section delves into the contested meanings of the 'platform' by mapping twenty metaphors employed by scholars in diverse fields, including management, political economy, software studies, urbanism, and economic sociology. This section also organizes the metaphors in four conceptual categories related to the operations of the digital platform. The final part offers reflections on the 'platform' as a novel organizational form and assesses the overall usefulness of the term in academic discourse. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent evidence indicates that the launch and establishment of firms such as Uber and other similar ride-hailing platforms, also known as Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), has not only provoked a technological change for traditional industries such as the taxi sector but also generated policy disruption. An interdisciplinary field around the gig economy is developing on these topics where multiple approaches in political processes converge, opening concerns around the governance of platforms and the possibility of their regulation, where it stands out in the case of urban transportation. This article reviews the scholarly debate around the politics of platform regulation in the ride-hailing market. We conducted a systematic search following the PRISMA methodology, synthesizing the main findings of 26 studies that examine policy responses over regulatory matters involving multiple stakeholders and ride-hailing platforms in diverse cities and countries. We identified four analytical categories throughout the thematic synthesis of the literature: Platform Power, Institutional Arrangements, Political Dynamics, and Ideas and Narratives. The findings show that even when the platform power approach is one of the most appealing and discussed in this literature, policy change is being shaped by several complementary factors, depending on contingent trajectories and institutional legacies where the interaction between governments, platform firms, and civil society brings particular paths for platform governance. Although some of the works reviewed provide geographical variety around the different local and national experiences, very few countries of the Global South are represented in those studies, reflecting the critical need to advance comparatively. We conclude by discussing some limitations and potential implications for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Researching on platforms through platforms poses challenges to researchers, particularly when observing subcultures and content at the margins. Inspired by Massanari's essay on researching under the ‘alt-right’ gaze, this paper uses autoethnography to address the impact the system of platform governance has on researcher vulnerability in data collection, persona management and results dissemination, particularly for researchers gathering data censored by platforms and for researchers constructing their public profile through digital media. My goal is to examine how the intersection of platform power, academic precarity and the creator economy affects researchers and academics. At the heart of this are the questions: How can researchers gather data, disseminate results and establish a professional profile under platforms’ all-encompassing gaze? What does platform governance and its focus on specific areas of control mean for researching content and users at the margins? What risks do platforms themselves pose to researchers’ work? And how does the broader precarity of particularly early-career academic work intersect with the effects of platform power? To this end, this paper discusses the increasing digital labour required by the ‘impact agenda’ and the difficulty of managing a researcher online persona in an age of growing digital censorship, sharing personal experiences of censorship in research to define ‘the platform gaze’ as gendered, raced, heteronormative and puritan surveillance, constructing a social reality where marginalised individuals and dissent are both hyper-visible and vulnerable to harassment and silencing. I conclude with considerations on activist interventions in the platform governance field. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Food delivery platforms constitute one of the largest objects of study in the field of the digital platform economy. However, to date, there are just a few studies that look at these platforms beyond aspects related to labour relations. This paper aims to advance in the theorization and empirical analysis of the development of the business model of food delivery platforms and analyse the relationship between platforms and providers. I argue that the development of the business model of platforms implies a process of marketization, given that platforms define and organise at least four elements that configurate a for-profit market (i.e. commodification, membership, governance and monetization). In the process of creating the ‘core’ market (i.e. the ‘food delivery market’), they create or develop other support markets: the ‘marketing market’ and the ‘gastronomy market’. For that reason, I assert that they are not only ‘market makers’, but ‘multiple market makers’ or ‘market developers’. In addition, in that process, the platforms establish power relations with the providers from the gastronomy sector (restaurants, fast food outlets, pizzerias) and exercise algorithmic and non-algorithmic forms of control over them. To make these claims, this paper is based on a qualitative study of food delivery platforms and their relations with providers in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I conducted in-depth interviews with members of chambers of commerce from the gastronomy sector and with providers and analysed contracts signed between the platforms and different types of food establishments. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> #BamaRushTok is a yearly viral event in which young women at the University of Alabama audition for spots in gender-specific social clubs (sororities). As a researcher working at the University of Alabama, I was uniquely situated in this viral phenomenon. I quickly became the expert called upon to explain this trend. However, being on the periphery of a viral event from my standpoint—social media researcher, lifelong resident of the U.S. South, tenure-track academic education—problematized everything I knew about the self and the research as I became subject, object, and spectator. Through this highly personal and reflexive digital autoethnography, I explore how I experienced context collisions—something normally thought of as collapsed audiences but invoked by me to explore what happens when researchers become physically entangled in the digital worlds they study. I experienced being subject, object, and spectator of these context collisions in three ways: At times I was in control; at times I was used; and at times I could only stand back and watch. My experience mirrored the visibility and precarity experienced by the girls of #BamaRushTok and the creators I have made a career out of studying. This speaks to the broader neoliberal conditions that structure platforms and American higher education. This work also underscores the importance of autoethnography as a valuable but underutilized method in Internet Studies research, as it is a way for those studying digital spaces to reach inside of themselves and understand vulnerable and liminal social media experiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Platformised services allow affluent others to socially reproduce themselves while reinforcing the barriers to reproduction for migrant workers. Drawing on participant observation and interviews with male migrant food couriers attempting to make a living in Helsinki, the article examines how the social reproduction of migrant platform workers’ labour power is shaped in the interstices between food delivery platforms and bordering processes. Through the notion of life's work, the article analyses how the couriers construct their lives around gig work, highlighting their agency in handling their life, labour and legal status. The argument put forth is that migrant platform workers’ social reproduction is not merely barred but reshaped in the intersection between, on the one hand, being subjected to the labour platform and welfare state bordering and, on the other, the subjective efforts through which migrants manage their life-making practices, revealing a mutual but contentious interdependence between labour platforms and migrant workers. The article enhances current understanding of the structural factors impacting migrant workers beyond just the platform itself, around which struggles emerge and which enable the extractive operations of platform capital. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platform-mediated labour is rapidly transforming African economies, expanding opportunities yet exacerbating precarity. This paper develops an empirical typology of heterogeneous platform worker experiences in Sub-Saharan Africa, grounded in interviews with 55 labourers across transportation, domestic services, IT and creative sectors in Rwanda, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Integrating neo-Marxist concepts of dispossession with postcolonial perspectives on enduring North-South domination reveals nuanced differences in autonomy constraints, income volatility, rating dependence and peripheral exclusion across five worker segments: high-skilled independents, low-skilled dependents, aspiring entrepreneurials, established entrepreneurials and discouraged peripherals. Findings show that high-skilled independents navigate autonomy and instability on global freelancing platforms while facing discrimination. Low-skilled dependents experience exploitative algorithms dictating terms of participation. Aspiring entrepreneurials leverage platforms strategically to launch startups. Established entrepreneurials transition from precarious work to launch equitable local platforms. Meanwhile, discouraged peripherals are denied access by opaque vetting. This typology provides traction to tailor protections addressing decent work deficits concentrated among particular groups.</jats:p>",

The country has been a key flashpoint in the debates around platform harm. Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was a champion of technocratic and compassionate leadership in navigating the country through the Christchurch mosque terror attack and COVID-19. At the heart of Ardern's political legacy was\n            <jats:italic>The Christchurch Call</jats:italic>\n            and adopting a ‘whole of society’ approach to fighting disinformation. In her on-going work she stands as a post-political, moral leader in fostering stakeholder conversations around platform harm, emerging tech and disinformation. This mode of governance is indicative of platform imperialism during the post-2016 Techlash. It is an administrative paradigm that views civil society partnership and big data epistemologies as the means to protect democracies rather than anti-trust measures or domestic platform and media policies. The lead policy entrepreneurs in the field of disinformation research in Aotearoa-New Zealand were The Disinformation Project (TDP). Their role was to furnish local media, government and researchers with a lexicon of “infection” and “subversion”, within which political conflicts are viewed as epiphenomena of disinformation warfare. The field is characterised by a moral, post-political discourse that perpetuates a fantasy of social wholeness and treats platforms as unalterable entities rather than dependent on regulatory carve-outs and arbitrage. The utility of this administrative research is on the wane as the Techlash window of opportunity has closed and with it research centres like TDP.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the online moving of Chinese Boys’ Love (BL) fans through the lens of platform ecology, exploring how they navigate censorship and create opportunity spaces across multiple digital platforms. Employing mixed methods combining participant observation, in-depth interviews, and secondary data analysis, the research maps the complex tactics BL fans used to maintain their community and content in a restrictive digital environment. The findings reveal that fans move between commercial, fan-run, and outbound-link platforms, to access different types of content and spaces. By combining platform affordances, fans create opportunity spaces that fulfill their desires for BL content, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increasing restrictions. The study contributes to both fan studies and platform studies by extending analyses beyond single-platform interactions and deepening the platform ecology heuristic. It highlights the importance of cross-platform mobility in equipping fan communities to withstand structural vulnerabilities imposed by censorship and platform governance. The research also integrates political-economic analysis with ecological thinking, balancing considerations of user agency and power imbalances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the spread of monetization features like tipping and paid subscriptions, social media increasingly incorporates financial transactions and blurs the boundaries between social and parasocial relationships. While research documents how creators and audiences navigate economic interactions, there has been little attention to the role of platforms, particularly outside of Western contexts. We leverage the case of Pocket48, the custom mobile application for Chinese pop idol girl group SNH48, to investigate how platforms infrastructure asymmetrical relationships and the implications for both cultural production and online sociality. Based on an ethnographically-informed walkthrough analysis, we argue that the app employs two primary strategies for channeling fan-idol relationships: underclassifying interactions and invoking the aesthetics of intimacy. To do so, we first expose how Pocket48's policies ambivalently construct the user and the relationship between idols and fans. Next, we show how the app's design cultivates an intimate environment and unobtrusively incorporates transactions. Finally, we discuss how idols customize app infrastructure and moderate transactional functions to guide fans toward desired affective states. We conclude by introducing the concept of parasocial media, defined as platforms that feature (1) asymmetrical relationships between different classes of users, (2) tiered access to content and/or communication, and (3) tools to directly monetize relationships. Parasocial media platforms infrastructure relational work, helping media personas facilitate and financially exploit intimacy with their fans. Yet, as the case of Pocket48 attests, monetizing fan support is compatible with and can even strengthen the position of traditional industry actors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the emergence of platformised multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes as a significant, yet understudied, phenomenon in the ongoing transformation of work and labour on digital platforms. Promising wealth, freedom, and community, platformised MLMs organise individuals into cycles of value extraction by leveraging aspirational narratives of financial independence and entrepreneurial success. Through a case study of iGenius, a global MLM firm working through local recruiters, the article analyses the strategic and progressive embedding of individuals into the MLM. The article focuses on the cyclic character of recruitment operations, and identifies three stages of the process, namely recruitment of customers on social media platforms, the commodification of customers through complex and obfuscated brokerage relationships with affiliate trading platforms, and, finally, the embedding of individuals into the MLM organisation as recruiters seeking new prospects, starting the process over again. Throughout the analysis, we show how the nature of work, the value extraction methods, and the control mechanisms intensify as people move from merely subscribing to engaging in financial trading and in the end, turning to recruitment for the MLM. In the concluding discussion, we situate the analytical findings in the broader discussion of precarious work relations and atomisation of the workforce as well as the broader context of investment schemes and online scams. Thus, the article contributes to the study of labour relations and data extraction relationships on platforms and in the digital economy more generally.</jats:p>",

Based on semistructured interviews with 23 cultural institutions and one Google employee, the study provides an empirical account of platform adoption beyond dominant commercial and social media contexts. Theoretically, it contributes to platform studies by analyzing how platformization unfolds in the cultural sector, where traditionally public institutions engage with external platforms under varying organizational constraints. Methodologically, it offers a situated perspective on how institutions make sense of platform governance, digital strategy, and content production in everyday practice. Findings reveal persistent challenges in aligning institutional needs with platform affordances. While institutions were drawn to GA&amp;C's promise of greater visibility, infrastructural support, and storytelling tools, these benefits were often undermined by limited technical resources, communication breakdowns, and logistical hurdles. Internal dynamics, from institutional memory to internal collaboration, proved to be the most significant factor shaping institutional participation, leading to fragmented and short-lived use of the platform. The kind of infrastructural alignment central to platformization never fully materialized. As a result, GA&amp;C remained a peripheral tool rather than an integrated component of institutional digital strategies, highlighting the contingent, partial, and often fragile nature of platform adoption in the cultural sector.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Using Google as a case study, this paper analyzes the online advertising sector's search industry. Arguing that search engines are not engines, it examines Google Search as a supply chain composed of five nodes: Crawler, Indexer, Ranker, Publisher, and Data Center. The final product of this chain is the search service presented to Google consumers, complete with ads and ancillary information. Empirically showing that production and exchange are one economic process in most of these supply chain nodes, we argue that treating them separately is neither accurate for description nor feasible for theory. In reality, Google Search produces and exchanges simultaneously. We observe that the social sciences lack an approach to analyze such unitary production/exchange relations in computational industries. Addressing this blind spot, the paper offers an alternative to describe how the search industry works by bridging supply chain literature in management and the economization approach in sociology. We introduce the digital–industrial economization approach to analyze Google Search's supply chain, in which a variety of nodes concurrently produce, exchange, barter, maintain, and/or store search products and their inputs. We present the term\n            <jats:italic>prodexchange</jats:italic>\n            to characterize these novel integrated production/exchange combinations.\n          </jats:p>",

    "title": "Intermediation of lending: Platforms, mobile money, and data transactions in India",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>With the establishment of Unified Payments Interface in 2016 and then the demonetization (notebandi) shocker by the Government of India in November of the same year, there was increased movement and accelerated circulation of digital money in Indian society. During the loan approval process, prior monetary transactions, social media activities, and consumer lifestyle purchases stored as tokens and records are scanned in search of alternative datapoints that guide decision-making. Digital transactions continuously transform money into data and vice-versa. The kind of risk-sharing arrangements that loan apps and lenders (NBFCs) get into, often remain opaque to the borrowers/customers, even as such operating relations shape data and money transactions involved in mobile lending. The delivery of loans by lending platforms might seem unmediated and direct, but through careful research, one will find myriad intermediaries such as third-party developers who provide APIs and SDKs as part of fintech infrastructure that drive automated decisions regarding authentication, verification, and loan disbursal. In this paper, I trace the distribution supply chains of payments and lending by mapping this fintech infrastructure, and in doing so, examine the intermediation process in the loan app ecosystem.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Amazonification of Royal Mail and postal worker identity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Postal work has undergone significant transformations with the advent of platformisation that follows on from broader structural changes in the consumption and delivery of communication infrastructure. In this context, an important question is how worker identity is affected, both in terms of sense of self and in terms of ‘who we are’ collectively as an organisation, especially within a sector like postal work that has a history of public service. We investigate this through a case study of Royal Mail based on in-depth interviews with postal workers in the UK. We argue that the organisational features by which postal workers understand and define their identity at Royal Mail are being displaced by features of Amazonification – the mimicking and adoption of Amazon's technologies and organisational culture and practices – which is contributing to a redefinition of postal worker identity and gives rise to new forms of identity struggle. The identity struggle we are pointing to is not purely embedded in processes of privatisation but in the emerging gig economy template and its accompanying algorithmic management techniques. As such, we see a transformation of the features of postal work into those of platform work, and the loss of protection and social purpose that this represents to postal workers. This focus, we contend, is a very significant but largely neglected aspect in current debates on platformisation and the future of work.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Platforms and the governmentality of political consumerism: A critical analysis of review bombing and de/politicization on Steam",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platforms often serve as sites for practices of political consumerism, and exposure to news and political content through platforms can lead to increased engagement in such practices as boycotting and buycotting. However, platforms regularly intervene, visibly and invisibly, with the goings-on among their users, favoring their own techno-commercial logics. This critical analysis explores this tension between platforms and consumer protesters, asking how platforms relate to political consumerism through how they problematize and govern its practices. Using a governmentality lens, I focus on the case of review bombing on the video game platform Steam, arguing that the practice serves as an informal participation in politics that has been problematized by Steam as a social wrong within its population of users. Combining an analysis of Steam's public and developer-oriented policy documents with a critical walkthrough of its user review system, I explain how Steam has modified its platform affordances and discourses to directly and indirectly encourage a “helpful” consumer identity for its users while simultaneously depoliticizing reviews, games, and consumerism as a whole. This ongoing process, a discursive negotiation between platform governors and the governed, reveals not only the tenuous nature and future of political consumerism on platforms but also concerns for the increasing disparity in how segments of society conceive of power relations—and how they desire their change.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article offers a two-decade overview of digital payments in Japan, with a focus on the role of convenience stores in the rollout of new payment systems. The aim is both to follow the recent development of code-based payment apps such as SoftBank's PayPay, while also interrogating the appeal to convenience by both the apps themselves and by academic literature on digital payments. The assumption of convenience as a default explanation for the adoption of digital payments in much literature must be resisted in view of Japanese government policy and large-scale incentive campaigns by payment providers encouraging users and retailers to adopt app-based payment systems. In Japan in particular, these incentives were meant to combat the default convenience of cash or other tap-to-pay prepaid cashless options introduced in the early 2000s. The role of convenience stores in the 2018–2019 “cashless payment wars” period under investigation here is to allow the perceived convenience of the retail forms to inflect the experience of the apps themselves. The article further uses this case as an opportunity to reflect on the temporality of convenience itself, as a retrospective explanatory framework for social shifts, and as a process of becoming-default of a new payment system. I term this process conveniencing. The conveniencing of otherwise inconveninent payment apps is the process under analysis here.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The rise of war influencers: Creators, platforms, and the visibility of conflict zones",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since February 2022, the war in Ukraine has ushered in a new era of war documentation, with TikTok emerging as a central platform for showcasing daily life in conflict zones. This shift has given rise to “war influencers,” a distinct group of content creators who transform war zones into consumable units of content by using platform-specific vernaculars to convey their lived experiences. We present a typology of war influencers: (1) Celebrity-War Influencers, who leverage their well-established mechanisms of fame to transition into wartime advocacy; (2) User-War Influencers, who harness the powerful dissemination capabilities of platforms to spotlight their sites of trauma, thus rising from anonymity to online fame. Utilizing digital ethnography, we analyze 97 videos from Ukrainian TikTok creators, examining User-War Influencers from the onset of the war. We identify three primary styles employed by these influencers: (1) POV storytelling, using point-of-view templates to connect audiences with personal war testimonies; (2) memetic content, juxtaposing war sights with trending memes to enhance engagement and shareability; and (3) playful politainment, combining entertainment and political commentary through features like LIVE to fundraise and mobilize global audiences. Bridging war photography, citizen journalism, and influencer culture, we argue that war influencers leverage platform affordances and user interactions to amplify war zone visibility, foster civic engagement, and shape global perceptions of conflicts. In doing so, they contribute to the construction of social epistemology, redefining the collective processes through which knowledge about war zones is mediated and understood online.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Injustice by design: A critical technocultural discourse and Latina feminist analysis of Amazon's ACX audiobook labor platform",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The commercial audiobook arena is a generative site for studying how the value laden designs of digital labor platforms are impacting workers along intersectional lines. Though a global multi-billion-dollar industry that can be traced back to Edison's invention of the phonograph, audiobooks remain relatively understudied, particularly as it relates to audiobook labor. If we are to construct an equitable and just digital labor future, it is critical that we understand how workers experience the work. Additionally, to develop worker protections and policies that are attune to the racialized and gendered dimensions of platform labor, we must be in conversation with diverse workers. This work takes a closer look at Amazon's Audiobook Creation Exchange (AXC) labor platform and centers the experiences of US-Latina audiobook narrators as Amazon has held a virtual monopoly of digital audiobooks. The lack of regulatory frameworks has allowed Amazon free rein to obfuscate and infuse unjust labor practices via the design of its platforms. This allows it to control and surveille the workers and the work, while keeping itself out of reach from accountability. I center U.S.-based Latinas in my analysis because they bring multidimensional perspectives that are critical to detangling how power is operationalized in the digital economy. And, while geographically located within the U.S., Latina voices are under-represented in media, policymaking, and digital/platform labor scholarship. Thus, the North/South binary does not offer a space but, instead, furthers US-Latina invisibility. By employing a braided Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) and Latina Feminist approach, I surface the ways that an emphasis on Latinas furthers our understanding of platform work. While some of their experiences may not be unique to Latinas, centering these women brings to focus issues and practices embedded within labor platform design that may not be considered from white and/or single-axis perspectives.</jats:p>",

While aiming to curb sex trafficking, FOSTA-enabled platforms to adopt U.S.-centric moderation practices that censor sexual content globally, regardless of national legal frameworks on sex work and both international and country-specific definitions of trafficking. Beyond their failure to effectively support antitrafficking efforts, platforms’ decision to align their policies to the language of U.S. legal discourse can be understood as a breach of state sovereignty. Through their punitive approach against content that fails to comply with their post-FOSTA policies, platforms effectively force users to internalize American legal consciousness, regardless of their geopolitical location. Sex workers are the ones who are most impacted by these decisions, even in countries where their work is not criminalized. To survive online and the offline harms of deplatforming, they readapt their social media behaviors to what we define as the technologies of the FOSTA-self, a set of self-disciplining and self-censoring practices aimed at bypassing platform surveillance and retaining visibility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Feminist media research has provided a wide range of studies exploring how individuals navigate and negotiate their identities within the neoliberal platform economy. Popular feminist ideas and social media representations are often criticized for their lack of diversity and strong focus on Western, white, able-bodied, upper-class ciswomen. In this article, we expand on existing literature by focusing on creators’ self-representations under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok. The nomenclature of #mixedgirlcheck implies to present a different form of girlhood (‘mixed’) with the potential to subvert popular femininity. Through critical discourse analysis, we analysed 100 TikTok videos to answer our research question: ‘How do creators represent their identities in videos posted under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok?’. Our analysis revealed four prominent patterns in this trend: (1) the embodied performance of ‘mixed’ heritage, (2) negotiating embodied ruptures in normative authenticity and belonging, (3) embodied heterosexual performativity and the idealization of the bourgeois family and (4) capitalizing on the performance of embodied individuality. We discuss how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic rewards performances of the ‘mixed girl’ that cater to a white, heterosexual, cisgender dominant gaze, uncritical of discriminatory structures such as racism, sexism or heteronormativity. This paper contributes to platform studies by critically examining how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic shapes and rewards identity performances under #mixedgirlcheck, revealing both its reinforcement of dominant discriminatory structures and its affordances for momentary ruptures in hegemonic discourses on ‘mixed’ girlhood.</jats:p>",
