    "abstract": "abstract:This article combines humanistic \"data critique\" with informed inspection of big data analysis. It measures gender bias when gender prediction software tools (Gender API, Namsor, and Genderize.io) are used in historical big data research. Gender bias is measured by contrasting personally identified computer science authors in the well-regarded DBLP dataset (1950–80) with exactly comparable results from the software tools. Implications for public understanding of gender bias in computing and the nature of the computing profession are outlined. Preliminary assessment of the Semantic Scholar dataset is presented. The conclusion combines humanistic approaches with selective use of big data methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Faster access to information was an overwhelming concern for Chinese reformists during the Republican era (1912–1949). They claimed that the nonalphabetical nature of Chinese characters presented obstacles to indexing, a fundamental technology for efficient information access and retrieval. In a matter of three decades, nearly one hundred new indices were invented for Chinese characters. Competition over which indices would prevail was fierce, especially among dictionary publishers, which stood to benefit greatly in the nascent Chinese dictionary market. This article follows the two main publishing houses in China, Commercial Press and Zhonghua Press, that invented indices in order to dominate the market from the founding of the republic in 1912 to the start of the war against Japan in 1937. As dozens of inventors of indices made clear, however, indexing technologies were situated within a larger social context, and the invention and destruction of indices were sites of political and financial contestation.",

In the process, the management of information became as central to the rise of the industry as the breeding of meatier stock. Information literacy rested as much on the ability of cowboys to read brands and “sign” as on office workers to control documentation. The industry developed a language of brands and vocabulary for managing cattle and created the new information-worker position of brand inspector. The information-driven transformation was accomplished within the working lives of cowmen who both led and were profoundly affected by it.\n      </jats:p>",

We report examples of these themes and suggest that open science advocates understand the movement as a value-driven ethos pursuing improved science through the use of technology. We contend that a belief in the open ethos is distinct from participation in open behaviors and that, consequently, open systems are used by two ideologically distinct user groups. We conclude by discussing the implications of this characterization of open science, focusing on the consequences of different user groups using the same technological systems.",

It explores the controversial attempts to commercialize the production of a particular data source (atmospheric profiles obtained with radio occultation) from the perspective of executives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), members of Congress, atmospheric and climate scientists, and the private sector. It addresses their opposing arguments by focusing, in particular, on the stresses and pressures within NOAA and its resistance to acquiring such data from commercial providers. In so doing, the article discusses the connections between commercial activities and meteorology and, more generally, the relations between science and commerce.",

Marketing academics have published historical studies in marketing journals since the 1930s, but over the past thirty years associational activities have greatly stimulated the growth of the literature, although it remains less developed than history subfields in accountancy, management, business, and economics. Historical studies published in mainstream marketing journals have favored explicit literature reviews, data borrowing, multiple types of primary sources, and transparency in research methods. We conclude with an assessment of marketing historiography as a legitimate discipline in its own right but with future challenges.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The revolutionary idea of a library for working women in New York City can be traced to 1830, but it remained dormant for twenty-eight years until a group of prominent New Yorkers revived the cause. In 1858 an address by Henry Ward Beecher and other influential citizens reviewed the benefits of such a library, and after two years of planning the women’s library became a reality. New York City was unique in providing a library just for women; however, financial support dwindled, and it was forced to be taken over by the Women’s Protective Union by 1870.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Not long ago, preparing to become an archivist was a complicated affair, as we see in examining Lester Cappon’s career as a teacher. Cappon ran a summer institute in historical administration at Radcliffe, participated in crucial debates about archival education, presented guest lectures in undergraduate and graduate courses whenever the opportunity presented itself, advocated for more rigorous graduate programs in archival work and documentary editing, and consistently argued about the synergy between teaching and publishing. In all that he did, history and historical scholarship were the central points of what one needed to know to become an archivist, an idea seemingly left behind as archival education has become ensconced in library, information science, and information schools. Although he failed to complete a book about historical and archival manuscripts that could be used in the classroom, Cappon’s commitment to the project and the publication of a few selected chapters mark his place as a pioneer in archival education.</jats:p>",

The article argues for reformulating and pinpointing legitimacy and relevance as core issues characterizing information history and for drawing on theoretical input from historical disciplines such as conceptual history and microhistory. Different notions about history reflect how the individual historian approaches information as an object for historical scrutiny that ultimately allows for multiple research strategies. Information history also deals with traditional history topics such as structures versus actors, change versus continuity, and context. The article argues for seeing information history as histories of information.",

While I discuss specific technologies and programs, I am less interested in the machines and much more concerned with the work they allow humans to do. By \"work\" I mean the epistemic and manual labor that is required to imagine, produce, and use border enforcement technologies. I integrate approaches from critical ethnic studies and geography to broaden how the mostly white fields of STS (science and technology studies) and military studies have treated border-making and enforcement technologies. Consequently, I argue that the machines, data networks, and human agents that constitute the modern border apparatus function as a sociotechnical articulation of the settler-colonial state.",

    "abstract": "In the 1970s artist Stephen Willats wanted to explore participation and interaction within an art context. He viewed participation and interaction as ways to help those involved in art gain control of their environments. With that in mind, he created the means to collect, sort, code, process, and use data to foster exchanges, essentially performing information flows using computers to help examine social systems. Willats expanded his art beyond any particular fixed object to stress the process of change. Meta Filter and the Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project enacted exchanges of information among groups, instantiating Willats’s cybernetic way of thinking.",

The 1844 trial of Francisco Bilbao had a direct impact on the development of the free press in Chile and, subsequently, in the rest of South America. Bilbao’s trial, one of the most talked about events in the subcontinent at the time, brought the liberal journalist before a conservative Catholic court, which fined him for the publication of an antireligious piece, “Sociabilidad Chilena.” The response of his peers to this trial changed the outlook of the publishing industry in Latin America.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Around 1940, a New York City organization known as the Dance Notation Bureau (DNB) began a decades-long effort to promote a system known as “Labanotation.” Designed to capture the ephemeral, three-dimensional complexity of dance on the flat surface of paper, the DNB believed that Labanotation held the key to modernizing the art form. Focusing on the period between 1940 and 1975, this article catalogues the Dance Notation Bureau’s efforts to make dance both “literate” and “scientific” and explores how these efforts contributed to broader transformations in the definitions of creativity, preservation, authorship, and dance itself.",

This article will map the parallels, contending that the similarities between the two practices are true \"propositions\" that radically question the way we apprehend the world, the way we draw our knowledge from it, and the way we then act within and upon it. Mindful of the limitations of such a comparative method, it will nevertheless attempt it by deploying a twofold approach. On the one hand, the article questions the epistemological nature of predictive analytics and examines their truth claims with regard to how they represent the future. On the other hand, it focuses on the ontological dimension of predictive analytics and investigates how they shape the world by bringing about the presence of the future in the here and now.",

    "abstract": "In Jump for Joy: Jazz, Basketball & Black Culture in 1930s America, Gena Caponi-Tabery argues that African Americans used music, dance, and sports as effective forms of resistance to the challenges found in American society during the first half of the twentieth century. Specifically, it was the development of swing music in the Midwest with band leaders like Count Basie that coincided with the creation of dances such as the Lindy Hop that would be responsible for transforming and elevating African Americans and their sense of individuality and freedom, especially those newly migrated from the South. According to Caponi-Tabery, both forms of artistic expression required participants to reach for the highest of heights in their respective performances. The emphasis on “jumping” was connected to the fast-paced rhythm and beat the swing bands performed, and the “good time” being had by those in attendance (p. 72). Jump for Joy suggests that the development of black expressive culture in the 1930s was a direct result of the migration of blacks into the more prosperous North where they collectively were able to elevate themselves and their sense of freedom. Even still, the success of athletes such as Joe Louis and Jesse Owens represented examples of “stamina, skill and courage” that working-class African-American men and women could gravitate towards for inspiration within the challenging racially-charged America of",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This article presents a study of preservationists implementing emulation workflows in three information institutions that collect and provide access to software: an academic research library, a university technology lab and archive, and a museum of technology. Drawing on participant observation and interviews (N = 25), I present a theory of emulation for preservation based on visions of accessing software, building a vocabulary to represent the temporality and durability of software as both an object and experience. The findings reveal issues preservationists now face in representing multiple temporalities when emulating software and software-dependent resources. These findings contribute to social studies of information institutions where emulation workflows are being planned and implemented as part of providing access to evidence and knowledge. The article also contributes to the study of the invisible technicians and information professionals who maintain computational infrastructure for long-term digital preservation.",

In the midst of Indonesian revolution against Dutch colonial rule, the intelligence agency of the Dutch army seized official documents from Indonesian government offices that would become known as the Djogdja Documenten. Despite coming from various sources originally, these documents were transformed into a single collection through the act of Dutch seizure. By reviewing the documents in question, searching for references to them in literature, and doing research in the archive of the National Archives of the Netherlands, I follow the postindependence relationship between the two countries starting just after the transfer of sovereignty, through President Sukarno’s anticolonial “Guided Democracy” period, and ending with President Suharto’s New Order and the increase in diplomacy between the two countries.",

Which topics did the congressional controversies “heat up” around, and which led to their “cooling off” so as to make the formulation of a new law possible? What were the issues at stake that led to the promulgation of four informatics laws in such a short space of time? What led these debates from market protectionism and national sovereignty to globalization and market competitiveness? These questions can be answered by the a priori definition of groups and interests. However, the choice in this article is to follow the actors and their own strategies of formation and dissolution of groups, focusing on the tracks left by the debates in Congress, especially those formally recorded in congressional documents and in the press.</jats:p>",

These demands helped shape the library’s collections, as subscribers eagerly took up the opportunity to engage with Continental trends, revealing in the process numerous literary fads of the 1840s and the diversity of the social groups that followed them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The British General Post Office (GPO) was one of the leading employers of women in Britain between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, first as telegraph operators and later in telephone exchanges. However, there were ongoing private discussions within the GPO as to the physical capabilities of women, as well as suitable working facilities and traditionally gendered spaces and occupations. These discussions shaped wireless telegraphy as a highly gendered and exclusively masculine profession until the exigencies of the First World War led to limited opportunities for women as domestic wireless operators for the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) from 1917 onward.",

    "abstract": "Drawing upon archival sources, this article reviews the historical background and discourse surrounding early descriptive developments at the US National Archives from 1935 to 1941. It identifies three discursive strands and discusses their implications for archivists today: how local and national differences might temper wholesale adoption of practices employed in other settings; the initial attempt to blend bibliographic and archival approaches at the National Archives; and the conceptualization and subsequent adoption of the record group as an institutional compromise. This compromise embedded conceptual principles identified by European archivists while simultaneously addressing specific pragmatic and physical considerations presented by federal records at the time.",

She used her father's library to barter access to learned circles and resources, negotiating with historians, scholars, Bowdoin College, and the American Antiquarian Society. Her access to the library, and her ability to dispose of it, fueled her publications advocating for women's rights and female education, showcasing the close relationship between her resources, access, and advocacy.",

Which topics did the congressional controversies “heat up” around, and which led to their “cooling off” so as to make the formulation of a new law possible? What were the issues at stake that led to the promulgation of four informatics laws in such a short space of time? What led these debates from market protectionism and national sovereignty to globalization and market competitiveness? These questions can be answered by the a priori definition of groups and interests. However, the choice in this article is to follow the actors and their own strategies of formation and dissolution of groups, focusing on the tracks left by the debates in Congress, especially those formally recorded in congressional documents and in the press.",

    "abstract": "The enduring notion that Victorian readers avoided French novels—predominantly on the ground of immorality—is challenged by the archives of the London Library, founded in 1841. This article argues that the London Library found the highbrow, exclusive image it endeavored to project constantly shaken by the demands of its subscribers, who made contemporary, and often risqué, French fiction a central part of their leisure reading. These demands helped shape the library’s collections, as subscribers eagerly took up the opportunity to engage with Continental trends, revealing in the process numerous literary fads of the 1840s and the diversity of the social groups that followed them.",

The ideal sources for carrying out this kind of scholarship would be large bodies of correspondence or large numbers of diary entries that discuss particular everyday activities, spread across long periods of time. Given the general lack of availability of these kinds of sources, historically minded everyday information behavior scholars need to find alternative source materials to employ in their research, even if these sources give only indirect rather than direct information about individuals’ everyday information behavior. This article discusses a number of these alternative sources (consumer magazines, popular magazines, corporate marketing literature, guidebooks, reviews, and various kinds of advertising) and shows how they were used in historical studies on car buying and eating out in America.</jats:p>",

This historical analysis will address information in the architecture industry and consider the development of CAD and BIM in the changing use of information in architecture by drawing on architectural theory and industry publications. The adoption of various computer technologies for architectural practice since the 1960s highlights how the ability to effectively manage and communicate complex information remains a central responsibility of an architect.\n\t</jats:p>",

They were a response to a rapidly changing corporate and commercial environment, acting as adjuncts to both the rise of systematic industrial research and the office management revolution that accompanied the implementation of scientific management. A survey of American corporate libraries in 1916 by the British manufacturer Rowntree and Company provides a snapshot of their operations and perceived value. The survey was repeated with a selection of today’s corporate librarians. Their responses are strikingly similar to those of their early twentieth-century counterparts, despite intervening technological change. As it was a century ago, the value of the corporate library, even if it cannot be quantified, is accepted.",

We document the expansion of public libraries in the United States using data drawn from library surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Education. We then review causal accounts for that expansion. Exploiting cross-state and temporal variation in the data, we use statistical techniques to assess a number of plausible demand-and-supply factors affecting the pace of library development. Social and economic variables in the analysis include state income or wealth, urbanization, ethnic composition, and gender ratios. We also examine the effect of institutional innovations, such as state library commissions and library associations, that likely affected the establishment of public libraries. We confirm that library expansion was robustly related to urbanization and greater ethnic (immigrant) diversity and to institutional innovations and that it was greatly delayed in southern states.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "abstract:Over the course of the past decade, coding has been positioned as a silver-bullet solution for several key issues in the US tech industry. The coding bootcamps that have sprung up in response to the contemporary coding obsession may appear innovative, but they bear a remarkable resemblance to the electronic data programming (EDP) schools that proliferated during the \"software crisis\" of the 1960s and 1970s. By comparing the current coding craze and coding bootcamps to the software crisis and EDP schools, this article not only draws attention to the remarkable similarities between the two periods and institutional forms but also identifies specific qualities and problematic practices of EDP schools that threaten to repeat themselves with coding bootcamps. It then concludes with some reflections about why certain \"forgotten\" histories of computing are more relevant now than ever.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The 1878 Mississippi Valley yellow fever outbreak was one of the worst disasters in US history. During the epidemic, quarantines attempted to thwart the spread of the disease. Quarantines, however, not only limited the movement of people and goods but also threatened the flow of information. This article explores the epidemic's impact on postal communication. A close examination of the outbreak highlights the ongoing importance of postal communication in the United States during the late nineteenth century, and it foregrounds the importance of a set of overlooked informational practices—\"postal disinfection\"—that were essential to maintaining complex communication networks during periods of epidemics.",

    "abstract": "In the early 1970s, conventional database management systems were challenged by relational database models. Relational search procedures, as proposed by Edgar F. Codd, offered both improved data independence and an enhanced combinatorial freedom for the user. At the same time, late modern concepts of an open text boosted a reader's interpretative independence, bringing to an end the heyday of hermeneutics. This politically significant change of technocultural patterns led to wild debates, and not only among intellectuals. Likewise, the change meant big trouble for software engineers. Advocates of user independence tried to promote their concepts, destabilize adversative suggestions, and gain allies by aggressive claims, heroic narratives, and cooperative publication strategies.",

Using ethnographic and historical data, I describe how these are predicated upon and create southern forms of expertise via the construction of equivalency. I define this as how southern experts are recognized on the basis of embodied experience and their production of southern geopolitical, historical, and scientific similarities. This does not erase place from scientific knowledge but valorizes it, making locality a key criterion for expertise, at least in some contexts. This challenges the very histories and legacies of scientific knowledge production in the Global South, how authoritative scientific knowledge is evaluated, and who is defined as a scientific expert.",

The operative and the report, Pinkerton's principal surveillance technologies, are analyzed here in relation to each other and in their historical development as information technology, drawing on Pinkerton's fictionalized accounts of cases, secret reports, and other agency documents. Pinkerton management was consistently preoccupied with strict compliance of operatives, their deployment in a network, and the regular submission of reports. This study suggests that information can lead to uncertainty and that the surveillance state was and is compartmentalized, entrepreneurial, and other-than-public.",

In this era, questions of mechanical intelligence came to the forefront in public media. In Britain the BBC broadcast radio talks by many leading practitioners in these fields in which they discussed their work and speculated on its implications for conceptions of intelligence. Generally, speakers were either skeptical or unskeptical toward the issue of intelligent behavior in machines. The skeptics, who tended to have backgrounds in physical science and mathematics, usually took reductive approaches to argue that machines could not be intelligent. The non-skeptics, who tended to have a biological orientation, usually avoided reductive approaches and conceded that the distinction between machines and animal brains might not be clear-cut. These differing interpretations of new technology, their association with distinct intellectual traditions, and their promotion via a wide-reaching and respected medium are seen as instances of social shaping of technology in action.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In the final decades of the twentieth century, experts in a wide variety of disciplines—such as computer science, evolutionary biology, management studies, and educational theory—introduced the concepts of modular design into their professional discourses and practices. In each of these disciplines, modular systems called for standardized, interchangeable components (or modules) that could be recombined within a predefined system architecture. This article explores the modern history of modularity as it was imagined and applied in two specific settings: the architectural theories of Albert Farwell Bemis in the 1930s and the construction of electronic computers in the 1950s and 1960s. By framing this account as a history of an ordering concept, I hope to persuade information historians to look across traditional disciplinary boundaries and examine the more general set of concepts, strategies, organizations, and technologies that humans have used in their unending efforts to order and make sense of information.</jats:p>",

Situating the Library of Congress within Foucauldian approaches to studying public institutions while building upon them, the article provides a broad overview of Library of Congress policies and actions since 1985 that signal a neoliberal turn. It also offers an analysis of some of the reports on knowledge organization issued and commissioned by the Library. The article calls for further critical analysis of the Library of Congress’s policies and strategies.</jats:p>",

Although navigators developed the logbook with practical concerns in mind, toward the close of the seventeenth century, administrators in England, France, and the Netherlands co-opted it for more idealized ends. Their thirst for detail sparked resistance from practitioners, some of whom began to subvert the very shipboard routines that had once authenticated the daily reports. Despite the logbook's eventual ubiquity, I argue that it ultimately failed as an epistemic tool and thus serves as a suggestive counterexample to the prevailing progressive histories of observation.</jats:p>",

Gracy II is very well known for his advocacy for archives and the study of archives, an enthusiasm that he has been communicating to students from the 1970s through the first decade of the twenty-first century.

In this article I discuss the development of a discourse about and cadre for archival education in the United States, counterpointed by developments at UT from the perspective of Gracy’s career as it intersected with the social worlds of state, local, and national archives and archivists; national postsecondary education for archivists; and the national professional association of archivists.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The Gilded Age and Progressive Era were pivotal times for those state libraries founded in the colonial era. Like many such institutions, the State Library of Pennsylvania (SLP) was initially established to archive and supply information pertinent to legislators and government officials. Into the 1860s staff found the notion of circulating collections “simply preposterous” and affirmed that the SLP’s mission was to “facilitate the business of government.” Yet after the Civil War, successive state librarians broadened the SLP’s concerns, activities, collections, and spheres of influence. Examination of librarians’ reports, news coverage, and other sources illustrates how their vision of the possibilities and responsibilities of state libraries expanded over time, embracing the concerns not only of government officials but also of citizens, fellow practitioners, and posterity.",

That is to say, as our interactions and activities become less dependent on the movement of atoms and more focused on the manipulation of bits, they seem less limited by the constraints of physical reality. But when we look closely at the material underpinnings of the information economy—from the minerals that make up digital devices to the massive amounts of energy and water required to power data centers—it becomes clear that information technologies are firmly grounded in the physical environment. In fact, information technologies continuously shape not only the physical environment but also representations of the relationship between natural and built worlds.",

    "abstract": "abstract:This article reports on the first part of a two-part study that traces the evolution of the Canadian Museum of History's catalog of its ethnological collections from 1879 to the present day. Drawing on the insights of rhetorical genre studies, we examine how the catalog has been implicated in the formation and shaping of anthropological knowledge in the museum over the course of its history. In this first part, we focus on the ledgers that served as the catalog between 1879 and 1960 and examine how they participated in collecting, ordering, and transforming knowledge within the museum during that time period. In specific terms, we explore the sociohistorical context in which the ledger catalog emerged, the kinds of knowledge it communicated through its structure and content, and the particular understanding of Indigenous material culture as embodied knowledge it communicated and perpetuated over time.",

Unlike staff magazines in private enterprises, which predate them by two decades, library staff magazines were more truly the product of employees, inaugurated and operated as they often were by staff associations. This study is based on an analysis of staff magazines in three public library systems in Britain in the first half of the twentieth century: Croydon, Sheffield, and Leeds. Against backdrops of growing popular education, organizational enlargement, changing management styles, and increasing professionalization, the library staff magazine provided opportunities for employees to write. This was undertaken as a pastime; as a form of organizational learning and networking; as a contribution to labor and occupational solidarity; and, finally, as a vehicle for professional advancement and professional identity formation, though one that contained an element of “othering” of the public as well as of junior and female staff.\n\t</jats:p>",

In the 1980s, histories of personal computing published in the popular press preserved a memory of the open letter that was later taken up by advocates of the free and open-source software movement.

    "abstract": "Abstract:As a form of writing that reveals the diarist's personality, conveys biographical and genealogical data, contains details of everyday and family life, and provides insight into the past and the sociopolitical and cultural circumstances in which the diarist lived, diaries have been a rich source of information for scholars of various research interests. Diaries that contain a lot of references associated with reading and books are of particular interest to book historians. Based on the content analysis of the diary of Dragojla Jarnević, a famous female author from the period of the Croatian National Revival, this article demonstrates diaries' research potential as sources for the history of reading.",

Certain strands in the twentieth-century philosophy of technology can throw light on these developments in terms of (1) Martin Heidegger's suggestion that the expanding influence of 'Technik' tends toward the treatment of persons as exploitable things, or \"standing reserve,\" and (2) Jacques Ellul's contention that humans would in time and of necessity assimilate themselves to vast and autonomous technological system. Young people are now being largely shaped by \"social physics,\" as big data–derived fodder for the creation of a hive mind in the interests of technocratic social control and corporate profiteering.",

He viewed participation and interaction as ways to help those involved in art gain control of their environments. With that in mind, he created the means to collect, sort, code, process, and use data to foster exchanges, essentially performing information flows using computers to help examine social systems. Willats expanded his art beyond any particular fixed object to stress the process of change. Meta Filter and the Edinburgh Social Model Construction Project enacted exchanges of information among groups, instantiating Willats’s cybernetic way of thinking.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Sensitivity reading (SR)—the expert, ameliorative assessment of literary texts for superficial, inaccurate, or degradative depictions of oppressed groups—is a hotly contested service in the book industry, one that some hold is censorious. This article explicates how these detractors’ critiques function as informal suppression, drawing inspiration from Joanna Russ to expose key rhetorical strategies that reinforce a pernicious distinction between “literary” insidersand “nonliterary” out siders. The construction and propagation of this distinction ultimately encodes minoritized editors as “sensitive readers” who constitute a threat to the literary enterprise itself, thereby rationalizing their continued marginalization on aesthetic grounds.",

Although literacy and information technologies have long existed as part of China’s infrastructure, the social ideal of widespread access to information is remarkably recent and has largely been influenced by library collaboration and cooperation with other nations. Using a tripartite information access model, this article explores the role international collaborations played in building the foundations of physical, intellectual, and social infrastructures of libraries in China during the twentieth century and recommends future actions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Conservation scientists are looking to widen their lens on the landscapes they seek to protect. Using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) fitted with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), ecologists hope to hone their abilities to account for and render visible precious wildlife and to better allocate resources for governing environments. What can a close analysis of the development of UAS tell us about conservation science itself and its relationship to GIS technologies? This article uses the example of the development of UAS by innovators at the University of Florida's Unmanned Aerial Systems Research Program (UASRP) to explore the governing rationalities undergirding growing excitement for drone technologies in conservation practice, to understand the historical continuities these novel machines embody, and to reveal a multidimensional understanding of the motivations and logics of contemporary conservation science.",

During the 1950s, the nation’s leading libraries converted their buildings into fallout shelters and disseminated survival information to millions of Americans. However, libraries became increasingly disillusioned with civil defense during the late 1960s, and they largely abandoned civil defense in favor of peace advocacy in the 1980s. The article concludes with ideas for current libraries based on this chapter of information history.</jats:p>",

By 1610 they were kept in the State Paper Office, remaining there until 1854, when they were subsumed into the Public Record Office.

To do so, it looks at the key archival processes of appraisal, and arrangement and description, as well as exploring whether, like modern archives, the records were understood contextually or, like a modern library, they were regarded as discrete containers of information.",

    "abstract": "New topics in the history of technology develop through stages. For the history of the online world, different stages have been marked by different dominant interpretations, moving from technical and teleological narratives about just a few favored systems and individuals to a more eclectic mix. Narratives are also influenced by still-living pioneers. But these changing stories are not just interesting for the historiography of cyberspace. They directly affect what source material gets valued and thus preserved, an effect hugely amplified by the fragility of digital media. Early biases can become self-fulfilling by erasing the source materials that could support competing points of view. This article details practices that have developed in response to such challenges at collecting institutions, using the Computer History Museum as a case study in the hope that it may prove useful to others.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A new dataset (N = 7,456) analyzes women’s research authorship in the Association for Computing Machinery’s founding thirteen special interest groups (SIGs), a proxy for computer science. ACM SIGs expanded between 1970 and 2000; each experienced increasing women’s authorship. But diversity abounds. Several SIGs had less than 10 percent women authors, while university computing centers (SIGUCCS) exceeded 40 percent. Three SIGs experienced accelerating growth in women’s authorship; most, including a composite ACM, had decelerating growth. This research may encourage reform efforts, often focusing on general education or workforce factors (across “computer science”), to examine understudied dynamics within computer science that shaped changes in women’s participation.",

    "abstract": "This book details the structure-property relationship and application of a wide variety of polyesters. There are many polyester-based materials, including films (Mylar), fibers (Dacron), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), liquid crystal polyesters, and bulk molding fiber-filled polyesters. After a historical review, the book covers the various types of polymerization mechanisms, kinetics, mass transfer, and reactor design. The details, including graphs, chemical structures, and data, greatly help to explain the polymerization steps of the major types of polyesters in use today. While satisfying the polymer chemist with chemical reaction theory, the engineer who uses polyesters also would be pleased with this book in that it ties together the effect of the chemistry on engineering properties of these materials. There are sections on how various additives can affect strength performance such as glass and carbon fiber additives. The additives to make engineering grade polyesters such as Rynite, Petra, and Impet will give the reader an understanding of how these additives make the polyesters possess unique properties. In addition, there are manufacturing and applications discussed throughout the text. One section of personal interest is in the unsaturated polyesters that are included but not in sufficient detail. There could be more coverage on bulk molding compounds (BMC) and fiber fillers and a description of the various molding processes for BMC materials. There is probably less coverage on these BMC materials because they have less annual usage. For our readers, those who develop polyester films and bulk insulation would find this book very informative from a reaction and synthesis understanding. Those in academia also will be able to use the theory and reaction portions, including the extensive reference base, as a learning tool. Engineers who use polyesters and who want to understand the chemistry behind the materials in order to select the proper material and perhaps to select the proper additive also will find this to be a very informative book.",

    "abstract": "State libraries began to form in the United States around 1800, but the collections on which some were based had been established long before. The New Jersey State Library provides an example of this pattern. Though the generally recognized date for its founding is March 18, 1796, by that time the library’s collection had already been serving the needs of the state government for much of the eighteenth century. Drawing on entries in the New Jersey General Assembly’s minutes, this article provides an account of the growth and use of this collection beginning in 1704. It goes on to describe the evolution of this legislative reference collection to a state library and concludes with a brief look at the library after 1796.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the collection, organization, and dissemination of business information during the past seventy-five years. Transforming millions of “data bits” to intelligence for better decision making remains a challenge. However, we have come a long way since the late 1930s by building databases, connecting nodes and networks, and constantly upgrading the quality of business information. Classification schemes, search techniques, retrieval methods, delivery speed, and storage capacity have all increased exponentially. The key forces contributing to such transformation were public-private cooperation, the dedication of pioneers who “grew the field,” and the entrepreneurial ventures of data consolidators and research agencies. The social, economic, and organizational forces brought about changes that were coupled with the requisite technology; this paved the way for the creation of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many related features that range from mobile communication to visualization techniques.",

This approach has been widely criticized as unrepresentative of computing’s wider context but is, in any case, becoming increasingly awkward as historical attention turns to the era of small, cheap, undistinguished personal computers and standardized networking. This article presents a range of more user-focused display approaches for consideration. In particular, I address the value and practicalities of period “set dressing” for hardware and hands-on interaction with software and call for greater hybridization between approaches devised for static galleries and for mobile displays.",

A survey of American corporate libraries in 1916 by the British manufacturer Rowntree and Company provides a snapshot of their operations and perceived value. The survey was repeated with a selection of today’s corporate librarians. Their responses are strikingly similar to those of their early twentieth-century counterparts, despite intervening technological change. As it was a century ago, the value of the corporate library, even if it cannot be quantified, is accepted.\n\t</jats:p>",

By turning other energy resources into electricity, power systems have transformed the American landscape. In the early 1900s utilities gathered and calculated information by hand to improve efficiency, lower costs, and manage primary energy resources. By 1920 the quantity of data available outstripped the ability to process and use it in a timely fashion. Utilities adopted information technologies to better and more quickly under stand the systems they managed. The modern turn to the digital for environmental goals has deep roots in the history of the electric power industry.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In the United States the words “telephone surveillance” bring to mind contemporary security concerns about smart phone tracking, the NSA warrantless wiretapping scandal, and the telecommunications provisions of the Patriot Act. Yet telephone surveillance is as old as telephony itself, dating back to the nearly simultaneous commercialization of the telephone and phonograph. This article examines telephone surveillance by American law enforcement agencies from the inception of telephone service to the passage of the Federal Wiretap Law in 1968, focusing on the challenges an advancing, proliferating, and shrinking technology posed for Fourth Amendment law. To highlight the technological, institutional, and cultural interactions that have shaped Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the article deploys Jack Balkin’s theory of cultural software and Anslem Strauss’s concept of a negotiated order and brings together major cases, federal legislation, and evidence of government surveillance. The article argues that during the first ninety years of telephone usage in America, laws on search and seizure developed not from constitutional consistency or logic but as the result of a complex negotiation process involving new media and human agency.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Our cultural institutions host large collections of audio recordings comprising important cultural artifacts. Some of these recordings date back to the nineteenth century and up to the present day. These recordings include music but also poetry readings, field recordings, and presidential speeches and phone calls, as well as the only recordings of languages, oral traditions, and voices that we no longer remember. We have dedicated significant resources to digitizing these collections, yet, even digitized, these artifacts are only marginally accessible for listening and almost completely inaccessible for new forms of access and scholarship. In order to discover convergences in seemingly divergent theories that may guide how we build information infrastructure around our sound heritage, this article considers how early information theory, much of which was crafted within the context of developing communication and sound technologies, can provide a framework for thinking through how to build an information infrastructure that facilitates inquiry with digital audio collections in the humanities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Privately owned by the Macao Chamber of Commerce, the Octagonal Pavilion Library was the first free Chinese library service as well as the most used Chinese public library in Macao from its establishment in 1948 until the late twentieth century. With a total surface area of 1,130 square feet, it is possibly the smallest library in the world. Despite its diminutive size, its educational and cultural impact on the community make it unique. Its relationship to “the foreign-Chinese divide,” to Ho Yin (Macao’s most important twentieth-century historical figure), and to other libraries in Macao are of particular interest. Its architecture, classification system (centered on the Three People’s Principles), and nontechnical operations in the current technical environment also make it a meaningful library service case study.",

In recent years, self-illuminated screens (like those of computers, phones, and tablets) have been identified by scientists, journalists, and concerned individuals as particularly pernicious sources of sleep-disrupting light. By tracing the history of circadian research, the effects of light on sleep patterns, and the recent appearance of software like \"f.lux,\" Apple's \"Night Shift,\" and \"Twilight,\" this article shows how media-prophylactic technologies can individualize responsibility for preventing harm while simultaneously surfacing otherwise ignored forms of chronic suffering.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In this article we report on a historical study of the calendars and guides published by the Public Record Office (PRO) of Great Britain between 1838 and 1968. Drawing on rhetorical genre theory, we conceive of these finding aids as sociohistorical texts and trace their evolution across three dimensions (textual features, composing processes, and social roles). Our study suggests that the calendars and guides were not simply tools for making the PRO’s holdings accessible to the public; they also shaped and were shaped by ideas and beliefs about what it meant to make records accessible to the public and the most effective means of accomplishing that end. These ideas and beliefs were linked, in turn, to the PRO’s sense of its purpose and identity in relation to the communities it served. The generic evolution of the calendars and guides reflects and, to some extent, embodies that evolving sense of purpose and identity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Those who have never penetrated the darkest depths of tragedy may fail to hear its call. In Ethics of Tragedy: Dwelling, Thinking, Measuring, Finnish critical legal theorist Ari Hirvonen argues convincingly that tragedy represents not so much a bygone era or even a canonic art form. Rather, tragedy speaks loudly to our times of “brutal capitalism” and its “paranoid epistemology,” which seek to control time in order to avoid uncertainties and surprises. Hirvonen suggests that tragedy forces us to rethink the limits that seem to have disappeared from sight, without the comfort of returning to divine beings or fixed moral norms (14). While the book appeals to Greek tragedy, the mood is not one of nostalgia for a golden age that never was and that would any case foreclose the possibility to rethink ethics (29). The point of departure for thinking Greek tragedy may be Athens (30), but it is our present that is being interrogated in the context of the tradition of theatre and philosophical thinking (31, 39). But if “we have to listen to tragedy” (31), how can an ethics of attuned responsibility be revealed in our contemporary world? Hirvonen performs a patient exercise of dwelling, thinking, and measuring with echoes of Heidegger, Lacoue-Labarthe, and H€olderlin, but the book offers much more than philosophical exegesis, with excellent chapters on catharsis (chapter 4), tragic conflict (chapter 5), caesura (chapter 10), and perhaps most compellingly, the scene (chapter 11). Each chapter works to clear the forest, lifting layer after layer of settled dust. All philosophical readings enrich the whole, but none suffices, as tragedy always resists the attempts of philosophers to domesticate it. Hirvonen’s central task is to unearth a philosophical ethics that turns away from ideas of the good, moral codes and principles, human essence, or the abstract universalism of the moral imperative towards thinking the singularity of the situation (15). According to Hirvonen, “the theatre puts at the stage an ethics” (181), which discloses non-metaphysical measures and limits in our beingin-the-world. What these measures and measurement themselves might be is elaborated through H€olderlin’s poem “In Lovely Blue” (201–202), which challenges the old Protagorean assertion, repurposed in capitalist societies, that “man is the",

Women’s clubs quickly formed in many settlements, determined to re-create the literary culture left behind. Under the leadership of women’s club activist Lucy Johnston, a system of traveling libraries was developed in Kansas. Letters written to Johnston at the start of the program reveal the acute yearning for books on the prairies and the power of disenfranchised women to rally for a cause in turn-of-the-century Kansas.",

Findings show that the main conflict concerned the interpretation of the desired level of citizen participation and the degree of equality between bureaucracy and citizen, which also caused differing opinions of goals and methods related to governmental information.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the historiography of information. It argues that information history is represented by (at least) six well-defined subdisciplines (archival history, book and publishing history, communication history, computing history, information science history, and library history), each in agreement about its own methods and core literature, but which it shares with none of the other five. The article identifies books that could be read in graduate-level courses on information history that are taught either chronologically or thematically. It also identifies historical questions that cut across the six subdisciplines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Produced between 1943 and 1947, the Armed Services Editions comprised 1,322 titles and 122,951,031 books. A central part of middle-brow culture's institutionalization, they democratized reading for servicemen, setting the stage for a massive consumption of middlebrow print culture postwar. Further, the Editions illuminate the ways in which this culture dovetailed with anxieties about masculinity. While the Editions shored up GIs' morale, they helped revitalize long-standing concerns about men's reputed softening and even effeminacy. In consuming middlebrow print culture, critics argued, men opted for the weak and spurious instead of the virile and vigorous—a dereliction of duty in Cold War America.",

Furthermore, extensive footnoting would have helped to separate technical information from the overall narrative of each chapter. The Grand Designers is an approachable and informative study for anyone interested in the history of technical design, iconic British and American aircraft, and the development of aeronautical engineering.",

    "abstract": "abstract:Media scholars and historians are well aware of major gaps within the archival record, gaps that have fundamentally shaped the theories and methodologies of media studies as a discipline. However, much of the valuable media studies research that has been done to interrogate ideological work within \"the archive\" is actually research into the politics of one specific archival process: acquisition. This article focuses instead on the process of archival description. Comparing the rhetorical strategies present in the press surrounding the Harry Ransom Center's (HRC) acquisition of Matthew Weiner's Mad Men materials with the HRC finding aid's description of the collection itself, this article demonstrates a historiographical imperative for media scholars to cultivate basic archival literacies drawn from the archival disciplines themselves. I argue that by better valuing the intellectual labor of archivists, media scholars will be well-positioned to make use of the considerable archival record that does remain.",

Yet the subsequent development of spiritual software and the management of religious data have been underexplored. The production, collection, and ownership of religious data—whether Bible translation, sermons, commentaries, or scholarship—resulted in the development of unique digital tools designed for religious purposes. Pastoral research programs, sermon databases, and Bible software turned prior religious media into data accessible through novel digital infrastructures designed for Christian professionals and practitioners alike. A historical account of spiritual software highlights the ways that these emerging systems of information gathering and retrieval shape and are shaped by long-standing strategies for the production, analysis, authorship, and ownership of religious texts.",

In order to unionize semiconductor plants, activists associated with SCCOSH and United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, a left-wing union, attacked corporate negligence regarding worker safety and health. SCCOSH later allied itself with the Central Labor Council of Santa Clara County to push for the cleanup of aquifers contaminated by the semiconductor industry. The activists ultimately failed to organize Silicon Valley, but their campaigns led to a revolution in safety among microelectronics firms and to large-scale remediation efforts conducted under the EPA's Superfund program.",

While individuals frequently used phones to engage with the sites, they did not use the affordances of their internetconnected devices: they took many pictures for themselves but infrequently shared them, and they did not consume additional online information to compensate for a lack thereof on-site because they believed it should have been provided at the memorial. Overall, the lack of online interaction was caused by few incentives: the sites are not recognizable enough as sites of tourism, which is why photographs are not shared, and there are no prompts on-site to consume additional information, which is why individuals do not research online. This article shows that visitors' full interactive engagement with the sites, employing online and offline modalities, does not seem to occur without incentives.",

I define this as how southern experts are recognized on the basis of embodied experience and their production of southern geopolitical, historical, and scientific similarities. This does not erase place from scientific knowledge but valorizes it, making locality a key criterion for expertise, at least in some contexts. This challenges the very histories and legacies of scientific knowledge production in the Global South, how authoritative scientific knowledge is evaluated, and who is defined as a scientific expert.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:The Digital Future Coalition (1996–2002) was an unprecedented public interest coalition on internet and copyright policy with much farther-ranging effects than has been recognized previously. Uniting commercial and noncommercial stakeholders to push back against intellectual property maximalism on the nascent internet, it altered both treaty and legislative language, entered a trope (“balance”) into national discourse on copyright policy, blocked US copyright protection for databases, enhanced popular engagement with fair use, and set the stage for the Right to Repair movement. This historical research was accomplished primarily by interviewing representatives of the Digital Future Coalition (DFC) and opposing groups, as well as one ex-official, and by consulting a hitherto-untapped private archive of documents relevant to the prehistory and 1996–2002 history of the DFC.",

    "abstract": "The diffusion of innovation is a multilayered process that involves five main steps: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Between 1951 and 1963 California State Librarian Carma Zimmerman Leigh utilized several methods to introduce and eventually develop public library cooperative systems statewide. But the process was not easy. A study conducted by Ed Wight provided the knowledge needed to persuade the state’s librarians to adopt (or decide on) a library master plan for California, which was finally implemented with the passage of the Public Library Development Act in 1963. Confirmation occurred shortly afterward with the successful creation of public library systems statewide.",

It contributes an international perspective to the history of information by analyzing corporate information technology decisions outside the United States and by tracing exchanges about information technology between insurance managers in the United States and Germany. The article argues that Allianz managers, claiming that electronic information processing would reduce office operating costs, meticulously sought to document these savings to legitimate their computer acquisition in an otherwise adverse economic and political climate.",

One of these, named Ajeeb, came to the United States, spending much of the time from 1885 into the 1930s in New York and taking occasional tours around the country. The advent of electronic computers in the mid-1940s encouraged attempts to play games using machines in both Britain and the United States. By the late twentieth century, a Canadian-written computer program, Chinook, had defeated world champion and mathematician Marion Tinsley. More recently, developers of Chinook announced that checkers could be played to a draw against any opening.",

    "abstract": "The claim that genes encode and transmit information is a central conceptual tenet in biomedicine. Historians have placed the origins of this claim in the rise of molecular biology after World War II, and philosophers still debate the utility of understanding genes as information for biomedical research. In this article, I will investigate how “genetic information” as both a concept and a model for experimental practice was affected by the emergence in the mid-1970s of technologies that enabled scientists to determine the sequence of chemical units of DNA, the molecule that constitutes genetic material. I argue that DNA sequencing, rather than changing the meaning of genetic information, transformed the possibilities of what could be achieved with this concept and directed it to large-scale enterprises such as the Human Genome Project. Thus, my argument suggests that scientific concepts should be regarded as entities that, beyond abstract thinking, enable researchers to do things—in this case, embarking on a multi-million-dollar project aimed at sequencing the information encoded in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "abstract:This special issue asks what digital state-making means in border zones, cities, and landscapes. As a complement to discussions of such processes in cyberspace and virtual territory, we elaborate by exploring connections to physical territory. Authors provide firsthand accounts from a number of global locations where tech surveillance is especially apparent: the US-Mexico border; the city of Los Angeles; and the Uyghur borderlands of Northwest China. In these contexts, physical territory is important as a crucial linking point between massive databases in the cloud and technical systems on the land. It is where the state can surveil bodies and movements in order to identify them, codify them, and enter their features as data to be used later. This is happening at multiple levels of governance from national, regional, to city departments. And the differential impact on marginalized groups is evident throughout.",

Gracy II is very well known for his advocacy for archives and the study of archives, an enthusiasm that he has been communicating to students from the 1970s through the first decade of the twenty-first century. He has been involved during his career with most initiatives having to do with furthering archival education through both continuing education for working archivists and, at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), crafting a full program of postgraduate archival and preservation education. In this article I discuss the development of a discourse about and cadre for archival education in the United States, counterpointed by developments at UT from the perspective of Gracy’s career as it intersected with the social worlds of state, local, and national archives and archivists; national postsecondary education for archivists; and the national professional association of archivists.",

    "abstract": "In a report for the Society of Bookmen in 1928, British publishers estimated that between a quarter and two-thirds of all the books they published went to the big four circulating libraries: Boots, W. H. Smith, Mudie’s, and the Times Book Club. This article examines the literary impact of one of the largest of these, Boots Book-lovers’ Library (1899–1966), which by 1935 had around four hundred libraries attached to its high-street pharmacies catering for the literary tastes of over one million subscribers a year. The article considers the impact of the Boots Book-lovers’ Library on authors’ practices of writing and revision and on literary marketing and censorship, focusing in particular on James Hanley’s The Furys (1935) and using unpublished correspondence in the Chatto & Windus archive at the University of Reading to demonstrate how the publisher’s sense of the tastes and expectations of the Boots library reader influenced the revisioning process.",

The article argues that computer dating should be understood as a media phenomenon and demonstrates how computer dating ads complicate teleological narratives about contemporary dating technologies, offering an alternative history of how computers became \"personal.\"",

This compromise embedded conceptual principles identified by European archivists while simultaneously addressing specific pragmatic and physical considerations presented by federal records at the time.</jats:p>",

Historians have placed the origins of this claim in the rise of molecular biology after World War II, and philosophers still debate the utility of understanding genes as information for biomedical research. In this article, I will investigate how “genetic information” as both a concept and a model for experimental practice was affected by the emergence in the mid-1970s of technologies that enabled scientists to determine the sequence of chemical units of DNA, the molecule that constitutes genetic material. I argue that DNA sequencing, rather than changing the meaning of genetic information, transformed the possibilities of what could be achieved with this concept and directed it to large-scale enterprises such as the Human Genome Project. Thus, my argument suggests that scientific concepts should be regarded as entities that, beyond abstract thinking, enable researchers to do things—in this case, embarking on a multi-million-dollar project aimed at sequencing the information encoded in the human genome.</jats:p>",

We analyze the County Business Patterns microdata files for the 1970s and identify a variety of early computer clusters. We explore the economic factors that led to the formation of these clusters, including preexisting conditions and Marshallian externalities, and suggest that a combination of these factors goes a long way toward explaining the location patterns we observe in the data. Part 1 of our study analyzes the clustering patterns of the early computer industry. Part 2 develops explanations for those patterns.

In this era, questions of mechanical intelligence came to the forefront in public media. In Britain the BBC broadcast radio talks by many leading practitioners in these fields in which they discussed their work and speculated on its implications for conceptions of intelligence. Generally, speakers were either skeptical or unskeptical toward the issue of intelligent behavior in machines. The skeptics, who tended to have backgrounds in physical science and mathematics, usually took reductive approaches to argue that machines could not be intelligent. The non-skeptics, who tended to have a biological orientation, usually avoided reductive approaches and conceded that the distinction between machines and animal brains might not be clear-cut. These differing interpretations of new technology, their association with distinct intellectual traditions, and their promotion via a wide-reaching and respected medium are seen as instances of social shaping of technology in action.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This article surveys several academic literatures that discuss accountability with the intention of introducing these literatures to information scholars who may want to bring them into their arsenal as they address the role of misinformation in the world. I begin with a definition of accountability and several closely related correlates and discuss what key Western philosophers have had to say about the concept. I discuss accountability in professional life, in the health care field, and in politics and governance. I also discuss accountability in private life and examine two examples of the social construction of accountability.",

    "abstract": "abstract:Much of humanity's most important digital heritage is under corporate control, which poses several threats to its longevity and authenticity. However, public institutions have little authority to intervene and preserve it, and their doing so is not always a desirable alternative. The goal of this article is to propose a mitigation of this dilemma. I do so in three steps. First, I introduce the concept of digital world heritage, which denotes digital artifacts with a value beyond their utility to any single individual or community. Second, I specify three ways commercial management threatens digital world heritage. Third, I argue that many of these threats may be mitigated by the introduction of a digital world heritage label. This proposal, I contend, does not interfere with the integrity of private data controllers since it does not involve the donation of data archives, yet it does support the long-term preservation of digital heritage.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a case study of the development of archival education at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. The study investigates the emergence of an archival concentration within the Department of History and the transition of that concentration to a jointly run interdisciplinary program more closely aligned with the School of Library and Information Science. This progression demonstrates both the challenges and the benefits that the lack of an independent institutional home had on the development of archival education, particularly in regard to curriculum development and administration. It argues that the transition has been especially difficult because different groups involved with the administration and growth of the archival curriculum had varying notions of the primary purpose of archival education.",

Historians often ascribe these attributes to the narrow bandwidth of early telegraphy, overlooking decades of innovation that expanded its information-carrying capacity. This article argues that telegraphic story qualities lodged in journalism when the network delivered too much, not too little, information. The news industry discovered that a story's telegraphic qualities contributed to the efficiency of processing texts and suited marketing. Journalists and journalism educators embraced telegraphic style as a reporter's stock-in-trade that distinguished newswriting from other forms of presenting information.",

Through hygiene recommendations related to eating, drinking, and dusting, these discourses warned that computers' \"health\" depended upon humans. Importantly, they interpreted care as individual responsibility by putting the onus on users to behave properly. Within this frame, such texts described repairs as unfortunate medical interventions resulting from neglect. The piece argues that computing discourses have historically defined \"care\" and \"repair\" in opposition, as acts of doting prevention and undesirable intervention, respectively.",

    "title": "The Contribution of Ægidius Fauteux and Edmond Desrochers to Quebec Librarianship in the Twentieth Century",
    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">At the start of the twentieth century, Quebec libraries had a different look from those in the rest of North America. The Catholic clergy, whose power extended over all aspects of Quebec society, had imposed a parish library on a population learning to read, which inhibited the development of public libraries for French speakers in Quebec. The head of the Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice in Montreal (both a research and a public library), Ægidius Fauteux, gave this institution a large cultural influence from 1915 to 1931. In the third quarter of the twentieth century, a Jesuit librarian, Edmond Desrochers, became a leader in the development of libraries in Quebec. The impact of his work was felt in professional associations, in the university training of librarians, and in the promotion of public, college, and university libraries for French speakers. Fauteux and Desrochers represent two generations of librarians who had an outstanding influence on the development of libraries in Quebec throughout the twentieth century.</jats:p>",

Using examples drawn from a large-scale ethnographic study, I show how members of the Persian community in Israel (Israelis of Iranian origin) reaffirm and oppose excluding dominant Israeli collective memory narratives of the Holocaust through rereading historic Iranian-related stories of Holocaust occurrences. The article thus aims to both discuss the ongoing struggle of Mizrahi communities to criticize exclusionary practices within Israeli sociocultural discourses and reflect on the research opportunities and limitations social media create in studying collective memory construction online as a whole and in the context of minority groups in particular.",

In the colonial context of the Uyghur region in Northwest China, surveillance systems—checkpoints, cameras, digital forensic tools, and nearly sixty thousand low-level \"grid workers\"—build forms of infrastructure power that make hidden or resistant populations appear legible, decoded, and editable as \"enemy intelligence.\" Drawing on a recently obtained internal police database of thousands of Chinese-language digital files, ethnographic observations, and interviews with Muslims who recently fled from China to Kazakhstan, this article argues that in this location at the frontier of the neoliberal and illiberal East, a smart city functions in part as a neo-Taylorist assembly line that employs an army of grid workers to produce Muslim enemies and non-Muslim friends.",

    "abstract": "Electrical grids have long depended upon information infrastructures—systems for exchanging information about electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and use. But only in the last decade has the notion of a “smart grid” captured the imagination of policymakers, business leaders, and technologists. Smart grid promoters promise that information technology will simultaneously improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of the grid. This article shows how these goals have come into tension as the grid’s information infrastructure has shaped, and been shaped by, government policies. It advances a three-part argument. First, digital technology and digital utopianism played a significant and underanalyzed role in restructuring the electricity industry during the 1980s and 1990s. Second, industry restructuring encouraged utilities to deploy information technology in ways that sacrificed reliability, security, and even physical efficiency for economic efficiency. Third, aligning the many goals for a smart grid will require heterogeneous engineering—designing sociopolitical and technological worlds together.",

The journal system served numerous fundamental needs within the scientific community and encouraged a climate of increased sharing of knowledge. As the rhetoric of scientific discourse evolved over time, a highly stable format emerged to govern the research article as a genre. In the contemporary era of networked science, however, informal scientific communication is also growing in importance as researchers turn to online collaborative tools for even more rapid sharing of results and work in progress.",

In the 1980s, histories of personal computing published in the popular press preserved a memory of the open letter that was later taken up by advocates of the free and open-source software movement.

Standardization and computerization initially emerged as separate threads, but these threads started to coalesce in the mid-1970s and soon became intertwined in a project of systematization. This project of systematization took as its focus the creation of finding aids, and archivists ceased to engage with the development of the principles of the new information technology and the ways in which meaning was being structured, represented, and manipulated inside these new “machines.”",

    "abstract": "Each realist novel collects, interprets, and transmits information about what it means to be human in a certain time and place. Part of information history, realist novels help us understand the psychology of human beings and the dynamics of their political and social interactions. Although fictional, novels contain information about material conditions, social customs and values, the organization of institutions, and individual perceptions and identities. Readers understand that each novel includes, constitutes, and transmits information. Novels are not reference books; rather, they are “information systems” that describe fictional worlds with critical relevance to our understanding of history, politics, social organization, and individual development. Describing material conditions, information in the realist novel outlines socioeconomic and political conditions and problems. This essay looks at two cases: Charles Dickens’s Little Dorrit (1855–57) and Margaret Drabble’s Radiant Way trilogy of novels—The Radiant Way (1987), A Natural Curiosity (1989), and The Gates of Ivory (1991). These works offer accounts and critiques of social hierarchies and inequities by incorporating historical and social information into their overall thematics of plot, character, and setting.",

With a rhetorical analysis of the design features and curation processes of the CR/10 website, this article discusses the functions of CR/10 as a Warburgian memory atlas that shape the nonlinear, multifaceted narratives of a historical incident. Alongside this rhetorical analysis, I also conducted three sets of user experience studies with over thirty participants both within and outside the academy, including an ethnographic conference observation, a virtual ethnography of an online book group, and several semi-structured interviews, to examine CR/10's usability and propose new design opportunities to empower the interface. This article offers a strong case for the datafication of cultural memories and contributes to digital archives and humanities interface design with an innovative theoretical lens.",

    "abstract": "abstract:Complicating the notion that personal surveillance is always ubiquitous and pervasive, this article investigates the macro-, meso-, and microlevel \"gaps\" that confound the study of self-tracking. Literature from human-computer interaction, critical data studies, and archival science, as well as insights from qualitative research by the authors into the long-term value of self-tracking data, is used to expand a typology of \"gaps\" that exist as part of the activities, behaviors, technologies, and data practices of self-tracking. In this article an emphasis is placed on elucidating microlevel accountable and expressive gaps, articulating how people respond to and make sense of the temporal absences in their own self-tracking data. In the process, the authors argue for self-tracking research to reorient from a perspective that seeks to mitigate all data gaps to one in which data gaps are viewed as an opportunity to connect individuals with meaningful changes in the patterns of life.",

In conclusion, the article expands beyond existing research's previous focus on outright fabrication, showing that early QAnon participants' information practices are also defined in large part by suspicious and idiosyncratic modes of reading authentic sources, not simply the propagation of falsehoods.",

In the midst of Indonesian revolution against Dutch colonial rule, the intelligence agency of the Dutch army seized official documents from Indonesian government offices that would become known as the Djogdja Documenten. Despite coming from various sources originally, these documents were transformed into a single collection through the act of Dutch seizure. By reviewing the documents in question, searching for references to them in literature, and doing research in the archive of the National Archives of the Netherlands, I follow the postindependence relationship between the two countries starting just after the transfer of sovereignty, through President Sukarno’s anticolonial “Guided Democracy” period, and ending with President Suharto’s New Order and the increase in diplomacy between the two countries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> Abstract: This study drew upon schema theory and Gestalt theory to explore the impact of congruence on the boundary between word of mouth and sponsored content on social media. Specifically, it delved into how congruence influences unconscious fixation behavior and enhances product attitude toward sponsored content during the preattention stage. Utilizing eye-tracking technology, we conducted two experiments, closely analyzing participants’ eye movements. Our findings revealed that both fixation length and fixation count are significantly higher in influencer posts exhibiting congruence between the product and influencer compared to those with incongruent product combinations. Additionally, posts with congruent product-background color combinations exhibit longer fixation length and higher fixation count than those with contrasting color combinations. Increased fixation length and count correlate with more positive product attitudes toward sponsored content. These insights contribute valuable perspectives on the impact of influencer marketing on users’ attention and product attitude on Instagram.</jats:p>",

Thus, the objectivity that became central to identification was tied to an object, to paper, that facilitated an understanding that these documents “contained” objective information.</jats:p>",

Matched by creative programming that recognized children’s inclination to do and make, as well as read, this trend was quashed as library leaders sought consistency in the resources and services provided throughout the public library.",

    "abstract": "There is very little published literature on the display of computing technology in museums and galleries. This article reviews a variety of displays, from the early 1970s to the 1990s, to show how computing and communication technologies shifted from a taxonomic approach that inferred an element of progression to displays that take a more socially and culturally embedded approach. The article argues that by changing their focus away from computing per se to considering the history of sociocultural information networks, museum professionals can create more engaging experiences for visitors while reflecting the current concerns of the sociology of technology and historiography. Using insights drawn from the development of the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum in London, the article argues that while the shift toward information and communication networks is not without conceptual challenges, it brings to the fore the importance of infrastructure, the role of users in the coconstruction of networks, and the challenge of software in display.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The quality of research on American archival history has been uneven and the quantity not very impressive. This essay reviews some of the highlights of American archival history research, especially the growing interest in cultural and public history that has produced some studies of interest to scholars curious about the history of archives. The essay also focuses more on why such research still seems so far removed from the interests of most archivists. The essay will consider some hopeful signs, such as the reemergence of records and recordkeeping systems as a core area for study, for a renewed emphasis on American archival history. While much needs to be done, I am optimistic that the golden age of historical research on American archives lies ahead.",

    "abstract": "Staff magazines in British public libraries emerged in the early twentieth century. Unlike staff magazines in private enterprises, which predate them by two decades, library staff magazines were more truly the product of employees, inaugurated and operated as they often were by staff associations. This study is based on an analysis of staff magazines in three public library systems in Britain in the first half of the twentieth century: Croydon, Sheffield, and Leeds. Against backdrops of growing popular education, organizational enlargement, changing management styles, and increasing professionalization, the library staff magazine provided opportunities for employees to write. This was undertaken as a pastime; as a form of organizational learning and networking; as a contribution to labor and occupational solidarity; and, finally, as a vehicle for professional advancement and professional identity formation, though one that contained an element of “othering” of the public as well as of junior and female staff.",

The New Jersey State Library provides an example of this pattern. Though the generally recognized date for its founding is March 18, 1796, by that time the library’s collection had already been serving the needs of the state government for much of the eighteenth century. Drawing on entries in the New Jersey General Assembly’s minutes, this article provides an account of the growth and use of this collection beginning in 1704. It goes on to describe the evolution of this legislative reference collection to a state library and concludes with a brief look at the library after 1796.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "At the start of the twentieth century, Quebec libraries had a different look from those in the rest of North America. The Catholic clergy, whose power extended over all aspects of Quebec society, had imposed a parish library on a population learning to read, which inhibited the development of public libraries for French speakers in Quebec. The head of the Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice in Montreal (both a research and a public library), Ægidius Fauteux, gave this institution a large cultural influence from 1915 to 1931. In the third quarter of the twentieth century, a Jesuit librarian, Edmond Desrochers, became a leader in the development of libraries in Quebec. The impact of his work was felt in professional associations, in the university training of librarians, and in the promotion of public, college, and university libraries for French speakers. Fauteux and Desrochers represent two generations of librarians who had an outstanding influence on the development of libraries in Quebec throughout the twentieth century.",

    "abstract": "Our cultural institutions host large collections of audio recordings comprising important cultural artifacts. Some of these recordings date back to the nineteenth century and up to the present day. These recordings include music but also poetry readings, field recordings, and presidential speeches and phone calls, as well as the only recordings of languages, oral traditions, and voices that we no longer remember. We have dedicated significant resources to digitizing these collections, yet, even digitized, these artifacts are only marginally accessible for listening and almost completely inaccessible for new forms of access and scholarship. In order to discover convergences in seemingly divergent theories that may guide how we build information infrastructure around our sound heritage, this article considers how early information theory, much of which was crafted within the context of developing communication and sound technologies, can provide a framework for thinking through how to build an information infrastructure that facilitates inquiry with digital audio collections in the humanities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:This study examines the first ten years of the journal now known as Information & Culture. Founded in 1966 as the Journal of Library History, the Journal has been shaped according to the values, habits, and competencies that its contributors brought to changing circumstances so as to transform the Journal into an erudite interdisciplinary publication distant from its beginnings as a compendium of entertaining vignettes and didactic notes on the writing and uses of library history. The article authors use historical perspectives to frame various crises in scholarly communications, which are treated chronologically as they confronted the Journal, drawing on archival sources, secondary sources, interviews, participant observation by Gonzalez, and close reading of the publication to construct a narrative about the Journal in its relation to higher education, scholarly publication, and professional and disciplinary developments in librarianship and companion fields under the increasing influence of technology on these fields. The authors interpret characters, actions, and settings through the sociological lens of Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of social field, habitus, and multiple forms of actual and metaphorical capital.",

    "abstract": "abstract:During ruptures in state power in both 1991 and 2003, varying groups and individuals seized many Iraqi state archival records, with some later taken outside of the country. Different Iraqi groups gathered unprotected archival records, as did US troops in 2003, while other records were destroyed on the ground in Iraq, likely by state employees, to maintain the records' secrets. Would the information in these records be revealed, destroyed, or used by others to leverage power? Using the concept of information asymmetry, this article explores the battle over information held in Iraqi state archival records by tracing the shifting power relations and attempts to write Iraqi history based on the information the records contain. Accordingly, this article takes up the question of scholarly engagement with the displaced records.",

Situating the Library of Congress within Foucauldian approaches to studying public institutions while building upon them, the article provides a broad overview of Library of Congress policies and actions since 1985 that signal a neoliberal turn. It also offers an analysis of some of the reports on knowledge organization issued and commissioned by the Library.

    "abstract": "It has been nearly fifty years since the first issue of the Journal of Library History rolled off the press at Florida State University. The journal’s inaugural issue appeared in January 1966, and within two years Michael Harris had crafted the first review of historical writings in “The Year’s Work in American Library History, 1967.”1 This essay, therefore, follows a hallowed tradition of nearly a half century whereby the writings on American library history are surveyed and commented upon.2 Each time the survey is published, I am surprised that despite the relatively small space historical scholarship occupies on the library and information science stage, a remarkable number of books and articles are consistently generated dealing with the broad expanse of topics that concern our discipline. Easily over 150 items appeared over the past two years that deserve attention within the pages that follow. I have maintained the traditional subject rubrics, although this time I added a category called the “History of Information,” which reflects the burgeoning literature devoted to that rather amorphous and still developing aspect of our historical pantheon.",

    "title": "Death Glitch: How Techno-Solutionism Fails Us in This Life and Beyond by Tamara Kneese (review)",
    "abstract": "This Life and Beyond takes a close look into the uncomfortable intersections of death, technology, and commercialism. With the rise of an abundance of new and changing digital outlets and social media, the question of how these infrastructures create a new sense of mourning of the digital afterlife demands attention. The preservation of digital data is particularly important to these processes, as it has now been integrated into our everyday life practices. The book breaks down the complexity of death and techno-solutionism, be ginning with a lengthy introduction and continuing in four chapters: “Social Memorials,” “Networked Death,” “Disrupted Inheritance,” and “Haunted Objects.” Each chapter in cludes collections of case studies that point out the messiness of death and commercialism. - - Each chapter offers a glimpse into what Kneese calls “death glitches.” Death glitches draw attention to things that were previously unaccounted for, not seen, or not work ing. These glitches become obstacles, but at the same time they lay bare questions that were never realized or answered during life or immediately after death. When people die, they leave behind materials that Kneese calls “digital remains,” referring to the digi tal counterparts of the physical remains of a person. In the “Social Memorials” chapter, Kneese addresses the ways that aging platforms must adjust their policies to “deal” with the dying. The author points out how these death glitches allow us to think about digi tal remains as materials that live on beyond death. The following chapter, on networked death, puts emphasis on this phenomenon by exploring case studies of death bloggers who write about what death means to people even after they are gone. Her chapter “Disrupted Inheritance” questions issues of privacy and the frequent lack of digital estate manage ment within the confines of death. She explores the many new startups",

The control chart is a graphical construct that uses probability theory to analyze deviations from expected levels of performance within systems of repetitive action. Although Shewhart’s innovative use of probabilistic information focused on monitoring conformity to production standards in mass manufacturing, his basic concepts continue to affect modernity through their extensive application in data analysis in business, engineering, and science.",

    "abstract": "Historians have demonstrated how systems like Usenet and Minitel fostered the social practices that we now associate with the TCP/IP Internet, but no one has considered networked computing in education. From 1965 to 1975, Minnesota implemented interactive computing at its public schools and universities with time-sharing systems—networks of teletypewriter terminals connected to computers via telephone lines. These educational networks, created with different priorities from military-sponsored networks, were user oriented from the start and encouraged software sharing and collaboration. Focusing on the educational setting gives us a history of the Internet firmly grounded in the social and political movements of the long 1960s.",

While historians have rightly stressed the continuities between centralized office work, punch-card tabulation, and computerization, the shift from decentralized to centralized information work by means of a computer has received little attention. In this article I examine the case of Ferranti and Martins Bank and employ elements of Anthony Giddens's structuration theory to highlight the difficulties of transposing old information practices directly onto new computerized information work.</jats:p>",

The growth was due primarily to Carnegie monies for buildings, which Iowa’s communities individually and enthusiastically pursued without official oversight by Tyler.

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Electrical grids have long depended upon information infrastructures—systems for exchanging information about electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and use. But only in the last decade has the notion of a “smart grid” captured the imagination of policymakers, business leaders, and technologists. Smart grid promoters promise that information technology will simultaneously improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of the grid. This article shows how these goals have come into tension as the grid’s information infrastructure has shaped, and been shaped by, government policies. It advances a three-part argument. First, digital technology and digital utopianism played a significant and underanalyzed role in restructuring the electricity industry during the 1980s and 1990s. Second, industry restructuring encouraged utilities to deploy information technology in ways that sacrificed reliability, security, and even physical efficiency for economic efficiency. Third, aligning the many goals for a smart grid will require heterogeneous engineering—designing sociopolitical and technological worlds together.</jats:p>",

For the history of the online world, different stages have been marked by different dominant interpretations, moving from technical and teleological narratives about just a few favored systems and individuals to a more eclectic mix. Narratives are also influenced by still-living pioneers. But these changing stories are not just interesting for the historiography of cyberspace. They directly affect what source material gets valued and thus preserved, an effect hugely amplified by the fragility of digital media. Early biases can become self-fulfilling by erasing the source materials that could support competing points of view. This article details practices that have developed in response to such challenges at collecting institutions, using the Computer History Museum as a case study in the hope that it may prove useful to others.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This issue witnesses a number of changes for the journal: a new title, a new scope of coverage, and a new editor. For the past six years, Libraries & the Cultural Record has principally focused on library history but occasionally covered other topics that fall under what the previous editor, David Gracy, calls the history of the “information domain.” By that term, David meant the history of archives, museums, conservation, and information science, in addition to library history. In the journal’s new configuration, as Information & Culture: A Journal of History, it will continue to publish in all of these areas but will also expand the scope to the entire history of information, as broadly conceived. Over the past decade, there has been a major change in the library and information school community. The so-called information school, or iSchool, movement has broadened the set of topics that are covered and has vastly expanded the use of technological and social science approaches, in addition to the humanities approaches that have been the hallmark of library studies. The School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, long the institutional home of this journal, is one of the library and information schools that have been transformed by this movement, and the intention is that Information & Culture will be faithful to the mission of its home institution. Thus, it will cover the history of any topic that might be taught or researched in this or other iSchools. The term “information history” is shorthand for what Information & Culture will publish. There are few people today who actually call themselves “information historians,” and the boundaries of a field of study called “information history” have yet to be determined. This is a work in progress, and Information & Culture is delighted to be part of the defining process. Perhaps as time goes by, what falls within the boundaries of information history will become clearer. Some things are already clear. Information history is about many topics, including:",

Between 1951 and 1963 California State Librarian Carma Zimmerman Leigh utilized several methods to introduce and eventually develop public library cooperative systems statewide. But the process was not easy. A study conducted by Ed Wight provided the knowledge needed to persuade the state’s librarians to adopt (or decide on) a library master plan for California, which was finally implemented with the passage of the Public Library Development Act in 1963. Confirmation occurred shortly afterward with the successful creation of public library systems statewide.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "abstract:While socialist movements at the turn of the twentieth century emerged in distinctive contexts and faced unique challenges, they were bound together by the importance each attached to literacy and reading as the best means to awaken socialists' class consciousness and win new adherents. Through an examination of both flagship socialist newspapers and the memoir literature, this article traces the global emergence of socialist movements during the period 1880–1914, analyzing the role of both books and reading in the making of socialism, as well as government responses to the threat posed by socialist thought, from censorship and imprisonment to exile.",

    "abstract": "abstract:Using the case study of 1920s stock photography pioneer H. Armstrong Roberts, this article argues for a historical perspective on the iconomy, or the cultural condition in which images circulate according to market logics. The article argues that compression is a predigital cultural technique that coordinates physical, technical, and narrative structures. Using custom-cut cards, contact prints, a ready-made card catalog system, and an original subject-based alphanumeric ordering system, Roberts produced an analog image database that compressed his visual inventory into discrete bits of information, reflecting a broader conception of the image as alienable content and creating a new commercial aesthetic.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Computation in the sciences does not sufficiently account for aesthetics, which prevents information from being corroborated. This argument is made through a comparison between virtual earth modeling communities and epistemic culture and an elaboration on modeling methods as exemplary of the negotiations between scholarly knowledge, aesthetics, and computer resources necessary for visualization. The salience of these negotiations to institutionalized epistemic practice is reinforced through three histories of visualization in the sciences: computation in ecology, empirical modeling and physically based rendering, and visualization in scientific computing. The article flags the significance of this argument for its role in shaping public policy.",

The research documents the activities and events within the early 4-H movement where written literacy had a role, analyzes the idea of the 4-H movement as an agent and a sponsor of written literacy, and uncovers the view of the world that the 4-H movement was imparting through its early record books. In doing so, the article documents some of the key exogenous and endogenous forces at play during the Progressive Era that had an impact on children’s everyday information creation practices.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:It has been argued that the Dewey Decimal Classification system—the DDC—is Hegelian, that the primary division of the system is based on Hegel’s philosophy. This article argues against this claim. It demonstrates that the underlying principle for the distribution of subjects in the DDC is not Hegelian and that the support for this idea was always weak. It also demonstrates that, as a classification principle, the supposed philosophy underlying the DDC is inconsequential and implies a reactionary image of knowledge. Fortunately, the DDC makes very little, if any, use of this philosophy. Hegel’s philosophy involves a sophisticated and detailed method for knowledge organization that has been completely unexplored. This article clears the ground for such exploration by disentangling Hegelian philosophy from the dated metaphysics allegedly underlying the DDC.",

From 1965 to 1975, Minnesota implemented interactive computing at its public schools and universities with time-sharing systems—networks of teletypewriter terminals connected to computers via telephone lines. These educational networks, created with different priorities from military-sponsored networks, were user oriented from the start and encouraged software sharing and collaboration. Focusing on the educational setting gives us a history of the Internet firmly grounded in the social and political movements of the long 1960s.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The creation of academic libraries at the end of the nineteenth century was a fundamental element in the rapid growth of higher education in the United States. This was the period when college and university libraries began their transformation from book depositories into centers of information retrieval, access, and dissemination. Academic libraries, however, have seldom been studied on a statewide or regional basis. Using a state as the basis of investigation provides a suitable set of examples for comparative analysis and historical insight. North Carolina is a good illustration of academic library development because it was neither first nor last in this process of transformation. The state also enjoys a wealth of archival materials about academic libraries, which facilitates their examination against a scholarly background of local and national research.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Structuring Information Work: Ferranti and Martins Bank, 1952-1968",
    "abstract": "The adoption of large-scale computers by the British retail banks in the 1960s required a first-time dislocation of customer accounting from its confines in the branches—where it had been dealt with by paper-based and mechanized information systems—to a new collective space: the bank computer center. While historians have rightly stressed the continuities between centralized office work, punch-card tabulation, and computerization, the shift from decentralized to centralized information work by means of a computer has received little attention. In this article I examine the case of Ferranti and Martins Bank and employ elements of Anthony Giddens's structuration theory to highlight the difficulties of transposing old information practices directly onto new computerized information work.",

    "abstract": "In 1900 the Iowa Legislature authorized the creation of the Iowa Library Commission, which immediately hired Alice S. Tyler as its first secretary to promote library growth. During her tenure of thirteen years, there was phenomenal growth in the number of libraries and library buildings. The growth was due primarily to Carnegie monies for buildings, which Iowa’s communities individually and enthusiastically pursued without official oversight by Tyler. It is evident from Tyler’s publications that she was not a proponent of Carnegie funding, and her writings reveal the strategies she developed to attempt to mitigate the perceived negative consequences of Carnegie library grants.",

    "abstract": "In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—well before concepts like usability, user-centered design, or human factors existed—producers and consumers began negotiating issues about pushing buttons. This article details the conflicts that occurred between creators and their users around the push-button interface. While button enthusiasts imagined a new breed of user who could control, communicate, and consume with the simple touch of a finger, reports of actual experiences tell a different story about first-generation button pressers. The study interrogates how rhetoric about buttons as “easy” persists today, overwriting complexities and challenges that occur when interacting with information and communication technologies.",

    "abstract": "abstract:Museums are participating in the capturing of global data for the perceived benefit of improved relationships with the public. This article proposes a framework for critically analyzing the datafication of museum visitors and visitor engagement, combining a critical lens from data studies with a social view of datafication as practice—a set of practices within a sociotechnical assemblage that is continuously reproduced by the choices made within and outside the museum. Museums are situated at the intersection of Pierre Bourdieu's economic, cultural, and political fields; thus, I highlight some of the external social and technological pressures driving datafication in museums. Relying on public accounts and previous case studies, I argue that datafication of visitor engagement is made to work through data loops: circular processes between institutional practices of museums and social practices of audiences where data are collected, processed, and decided upon.",

Dickinson lobbied for the establishment of a sex education library at the academy for medical practitioners and the public, using the annotated cards to make his case. He enlisted Alfred Kinsey to support the project. This article describes the library activism of two influential sexologists who believed sexual information should be available to a wider public.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:The human desire to collect objects is long recognized in historical and cultural studies where emphasis has been placed on memory institutions and their role in public life. Individual collecting, however, has been addressed primarily through the lens of wealthy obsessives or hoarders. Yet between these extremes, an interdisciplinary research literature has emerged since the late decades of the twentieth century that moves our understanding and focus from the psychoanalytic study of inner drives to the empirical study of objects in identity presentation and group membership. The normalization of collecting as a human activity offers a richer understanding of our relationship to objects through time and can accommodate the emergence of digital collectibles in contemporary studies. A model of collecting is presented that treats the collecting process as normal, extended, and representative of an individual's lived experience.",

    "abstract": "Situating the early modern nautical logbook and its northern European users within the histories of information, scientific observation, and expertise, this survey highlights the interdependence of utility and credibility on the high seas and the pitfalls of interdisciplinarity. Although navigators developed the logbook with practical concerns in mind, toward the close of the seventeenth century, administrators in England, France, and the Netherlands co-opted it for more idealized ends. Their thirst for detail sparked resistance from practitioners, some of whom began to subvert the very shipboard routines that had once authenticated the daily reports. Despite the logbook's eventual ubiquity, I argue that it ultimately failed as an epistemic tool and thus serves as a suggestive counterexample to the prevailing progressive histories of observation.",

Put another way, while the rhetoric of the smart city promises a utopia of transparency, efficiency, and well-being, the practical application of smart city tools is cast through their opposites: preventing waste, crime, disaster, and so on. Detailing two administrative projects that aim to prevent through prediction—crime prevention and homelessness prevention—this study asks, What does the coupling of prevention logics and predictive analytics do? I suggest that rendering preferable futures by avoiding unwanted ones expands the epistemic infrastructure of the smart city and, with it, reliance on surveillance.",

I argue that various boosters held the KRM up as a symbol of technological solutionism that promised to fully enroll blind people into the US political economy. However, the success of the KRM as a symbol belies its technical flaws, the federal subsidies needed to bring it to fruition, and the structural barriers to its use that were elided by its utopian promise.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In the early 1970s, conventional database management systems were challenged by relational database models. Relational search procedures, as proposed by Edgar F. Codd, offered both improved data independence and an enhanced combinatorial freedom for the user. At the same time, late modern concepts of an open text boosted a reader's interpretative independence, bringing to an end the heyday of hermeneutics. This politically significant change of technocultural patterns led to wild debates, and not only among intellectuals. Likewise, the change meant big trouble for software engineers. Advocates of user independence tried to promote their concepts, destabilize adversative suggestions, and gain allies by aggressive claims, heroic narratives, and cooperative publication strategies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience, which offers comprehensive summaries by persons of African descent about persons of African descent throughout the world, appeared in 1999, but its origins have eluded scholars. They attribute the project’s idea to W. E. B. Du Bois. But archival evidence tells us the conception of such an encyclopedia emerged independently of him. Proceeding from an effort contemporaneous to Du Bois’s project backward to a much earlier conception of this publishing goal reveals that the idea to publish an encyclopedia of the African diaspora was not handed down by members of its intellectual elite but bubbled up to meet the needs of their ordinary lives.",

During the 1950s, the nation’s leading libraries converted their buildings into fallout shelters and disseminated survival information to millions of Americans. However, libraries became increasingly disillusioned with civil defense during the late 1960s, and they largely abandoned civil defense in favor of peace advocacy in the 1980s. The article concludes with ideas for current libraries based on this chapter of information history.",

Sexual Nomenclature's authors aimed to create and to deploy sex-specific terms that other libraries could use to improve user access to and knowledge of sex-related materials. An examination of Sexual Nomenclature's functionality in the past and present demonstrates both the difficulty and necessity of keeping controlled vocabularies for sexological concepts up-to-date.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach to information seeking: the research self (RS). A flexible and holistic model, the RS articulates the various relationships between identity, emotion, epistemology, and research practice. It is rooted in sense-making methodology, lifeworlds, and critical information literacy. This work emerged from a grounded theory study with twelve participants researching one of three topics traditionally labeled “conspiracy theories”: collusion in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; UFOs and extraterrestrials; and the Missing 411 phenomenon. The RS can function both as a multifaceted information-seeking model and as a methodology for fostering reflexivity specifically and information literacy broadly. This article also introduces the concept of counterestablishment research—any kind of research activity, conducted systematically, that goes against establishment institutions, norms, or consensus. Having emerged from counterestablishment research, the RS may be particularly effective for fostering reflexivity among epistemically diverse populations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Internet demonstrates the interweaving of two parallel threads: the rise of the internet and the emergence of “transgender” as a term to define a shared community identity. The result is a social history of trans activism and an internet history that centers the trans-gender community as users. Dame-Griff guides the reader through the inner workings of the transgender community’s use of communication technology. These workings include linguistic and etymological discussions of a collective community’s term of identification, as well as debates on who is considered a legitimate member of the community. Full of an-ecdotes, documents from the Digital Transgender Archive and the Queer Digital History Project, and firsthand accounts from Dame-Griff himself, this work reflects the trajectory, successes, and struggles of the transgender community with care, respect, and dedication. Methodologically, Dame-Griff conducted significant media archaeology and archival research from the 1980s to the present day; many of the documents shared in this work have been selected and preserved by the author himself as part of the Queer Digital History Project. These resources are complemented by Dame-Griff’s use of the Wayback Machine, a digital archive of content produced on the World Wide Web. Dame-Griff used these archival sources, which include newsletters, advertisements, clip art, comics, screen shots, blog posts, and forum discussions, to create a narrative of trans digital connection and community building. In this respect, The Two Revolutions is an excellent accompa niment to Cait McKinney’s Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies , as both pieces document how communication and media technologies can be leveraged to support the labor and connections necessary in fostering social movements and underrepresented",

However, the form that data sharing took in genomics was a result of specific technological practices. Biologists developed and adopted technologies of the nascent World Wide Web and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities for sharing biological information. These technologies supported decentralized, collaborative, and nonproprietary modes of production in biology. Such technologies were appealing not merely because they were expedient for genomic work but because they also offered a way of promoting a particular form of genomic practice. As the genome sequencing centers scaled up their sharing efforts, a small group of computer-savvy biologists used these tools to promote the interests of the public genome sequencing effort. The agreements at Bermuda should be understood as part of this attempt to foster a particular form of genomic work.\n\t</jats:p>",

He bequeathed them to the next of his descendants to enter the ministry, but his daughter, Hannah Mather Crocker, ended up in control. She used her father's library to barter access to learned circles and resources, negotiating with historians, scholars, Bowdoin College, and the American Antiquarian Society. Her access to the library, and her ability to dispose of it, fueled her publications advocating for women's rights and female education, showcasing the close relationship between her resources, access, and advocacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": ": This article provides a comprehensive conceptual analysis of information. It begins with a folk notion that information is a tripartite phenomenon: information is something carried by signals about something for some use. This suggests that information has three main aspects: structural, referential, and normative. I analyze the individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for defining these aspects of information and consider formal theories relating to each aspect as well. The analysis reveals that structural, referential, and normative aspects of information are hierarchically nested and that the normative depends on the referential, which in turn depends on the structural.",

    "abstract": "History is a heavily document-driven field. The character of these documents varies from era to era and from case to case, and their content constitutes what can be broadly called “historical information.” Historical information, however, is not fixed, stable, or even cumulative; rather, it is enacted through the epistemic culture and practices of historians. Our study of two well-known historical cases in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—the monopolistic practices of railroad operators in the American West and the Dust Bowl phenomenon in the Midwest—show how historians enact information by adopting a fluid strategy toward their sources of information and their changing notions of evidence. At the same time, they also show that these enactments maintain a certain degree of consistency and continuity with the overall body of knowledge of the scholarly community, giving them a more “educated” character and differentiating them from the routine enactments of daily life. In this article, we explore the historiographical practices engaged by historians that enable this kind of enactment.",

That is, we attempt to identify the historical processes that led to the formation of the early clusters of computer production in the United States. Here we explore explanations for the genesis of the agglomerations identified in part 1. We suggest that the clusters we observe in the early 1970s arose from the locational decisions of three waves of companies: the computer start-ups of the late 1940s and early 1950s, the large conglomerates that entered the computer industry during the 1950s, and the minicomputer and peripheral-making companies that entered later on. We argue that a combination of preexisting conditions and Marshallian externalities generated the clustering patterns for computer production we observe in the early 1970s.",

Adopting a history-of-knowledge approach, the authors analyze methods of knowledge circulation attending early print, nineteenth-century mechanics’ institutes and public libraries, early radio broadcasting, and explanatory journalism, providing a comparative historical framework for a recent new-media platform for distributing knowledge, The Conversation network. Appealing to a socially broad audience has consistently been a challenge. Efforts to distribute knowledge also reflected differences in prevailing media ecosystems, national systems of political economy, and contemporary social/political concerns.",

This article reviews a variety of displays, from the early 1970s to the 1990s, to show how computing and communication technologies shifted from a taxonomic approach that inferred an element of progression to displays that take a more socially and culturally embedded approach. The article argues that by changing their focus away from computing per se to considering the history of sociocultural information networks, museum professionals can create more engaging experiences for visitors while reflecting the current concerns of the sociology of technology and historiography. Using insights drawn from the development of the Information Age gallery at the Science Museum in London, the article argues that while the shift toward information and communication networks is not without conceptual challenges, it brings to the fore the importance of infrastructure, the role of users in the coconstruction of networks, and the challenge of software in display.\n\t</jats:p>",

Like many such institutions, the State Library of Pennsylvania (SLP) was initially established to archive and supply information pertinent to legislators and government officials. Into the 1860s staff found the notion of circulating collections “simply preposterous” and affirmed that the SLP’s mission was to “facilitate the business of government.” Yet after the Civil War, successive state librarians broadened the SLP’s concerns, activities, collections, and spheres of influence. Examination of librarians’ reports, news coverage, and other sources illustrates how their vision of the possibilities and responsibilities of state libraries expanded over time, embracing the concerns not only of government officials but also of citizens, fellow practitioners, and posterity.\n\t</jats:p>",

This article considers how competition with other cultural heritage organizations and relationships with ethnic donors affected collecting strategies. While the society’s mission was scholarly, the politicization of multiculturalism influenced its collecting process in significant ways.

The study investigates the emergence of an archival concentration within the Department of History and the transition of that concentration to a jointly run interdisciplinary program more closely aligned with the School of Library and Information Science. This progression demonstrates both the challenges and the benefits that the lack of an independent institutional home had on the development of archival education, particularly in regard to curriculum development and administration. It argues that the transition has been especially difficult because different groups involved with the administration and growth of the archival curriculum had varying notions of the primary purpose of archival education.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Key Role Played by WAAC British Post Office Female Staff in Army Signal Units on the Western Front, 1917–1920",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:There is a gaping void in the historiography of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC), later called the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps QMAAC), brought about by the absence of an informed understanding of the crucial role played by the young women seconded from British post office exchanges to serve as telephonists and telegraphists in France in 1917. Specifically attached to Royal Engineers' signal units in British Expeditionary Force army bases and all three echelons of its General Headquarters, their arrival ensured the continued smooth operation of the army's vital lines of communication. This article examines how their key role as professional technologists within a tightly secured military sector made a significant contribution to the final successful outcome of the conflict. Questions can be raised why their skills were never later addressed within the historiography, and it may be concluded that adequate recognition is long overdue.",

We have examined the literature, developed an assessment framework, and used the framework to analyze twenty-one online platforms in order to answer this question. Our framework identifies five characteristics of Indigenous digital projects with accompanying evaluative questions: (1) traditional knowledge protection, (2) design and interaction, (3) description and classification, (4) community relationships, and (5) sustainability. Our analysis shows the range of work being done in this complex area of digital practice. Our goal is to offer a set of questions that encourage critical reflection, not a one-size-fits-all requirement checklist for those working on digital projects in cultural heritage institutions.",

    "abstract": "How do new disciplines develop in certain universities more than in others? The history of computing in France suggests a model to describe the development process that shapes the geography of science. In the 1950s a few professors of numerical analysis, often associated with a school of electrical engineering, created threefold structures comprising courses in applied mathematics, a computing facility, and a research laboratory. Such local configurations initiated a cumulative development process, attracting more resources and opening the field to novel investigations in computer science. In other universities, these configurations were not completed, and computing remained confined to technical training. In the 1960s pioneers became leaders in the growing field and controlled the definition of computer science curricula. As the institutes they had created reached considerable size, these leaders began to spin off junior professors toward other universities. The centers remain major academic institutions in the discipline today.",

American leaders of the time hoped to protect the vital documents that the nation would need to function after a war, as well as safeguard materials related to the nation’s cultural heritage. Planners used vaulting, dispersal, and duplication as their three main protection strategies, and these strategies gave rise to “shadow libraries,” remote storage facilities often constructed underground.",

    "abstract": "During the half-century between the American Civil War and World War I, the cattle industry, for which Texas is well known, grew from the disparate activity of hardy individuals into an industry on a business footing comparable to that of industries of similar magnitude. In the process, the management of information became as central to the rise of the industry as the breeding of meatier stock. Information literacy rested as much on the ability of cowboys to read brands and “sign” as on office workers to control documentation. The industry developed a language of brands and vocabulary for managing cattle and created the new information-worker position of brand inspector. The information-driven transformation was accomplished within the working lives of cowmen who both led and were profoundly affected by it.",

The analysis of quantitative data (N = 216) and qualitative data demonstrates significantly positive correlations between time spent watching TikTok and young children’s use of Standard Chinese in verbal communication. This suggests an earlier occurrence of Standard Chinese fluency in young children in dialect-speaking areas of China. The research findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the newly emerging and increasingly popular form of screen media—short-form video clips—and its impacts on young children’s language practices.",

    "abstract": "The Bermuda Principles (1996) have been celebrated as a landmark for data sharing and open science. However, the form that data sharing took in genomics was a result of specific technological practices. Biologists developed and adopted technologies of the nascent World Wide Web and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities for sharing biological information. These technologies supported decentralized, collaborative, and nonproprietary modes of production in biology. Such technologies were appealing not merely because they were expedient for genomic work but because they also offered a way of promoting a particular form of genomic practice. As the genome sequencing centers scaled up their sharing efforts, a small group of computer-savvy biologists used these tools to promote the interests of the public genome sequencing effort. The agreements at Bermuda should be understood as part of this attempt to foster a particular form of genomic work.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  Not many word pairs sound as exotic to the Western ear as “Soviet” and “cybernetics.” Yet this article argues that what may be most significant about the history of Soviet cybernetics—however full of fascinating figures and tales of an alternative imagination for a midcentury information society—is precisely how normal or representative the Soviet experience with cybernetics appears in the larger context of Soviet history. The article explores how the twists and turns in the Soviet experience with cybernetics follow preexisting political dynamics, debate patterns, rituals of discourse, strategies for intellectual defense, alliance forging, institution building, and other variables. By demystifying the seemingly exotic, this article aims to help spark insight into some of the historical contingencies and conditions behind the contemporary information age.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "title": "“Hemisphere Training”: Exporting the Psychological Self at the Inter-American Popular Information Program",
    "abstract": "Abstract:This article examines the Inter-American Popular Information Program (IIP), a midcentury attempt to apply a set of psychological techniques in mass communication practices oriented to poor and \"illiterate\" populations in Central and South America. I argue that this program offers an instructive contrast to conventional accounts of social reconstruction and of the history of the \"social\" as an analytical category. These conventional accounts often frame postwar order narrowly as a grand political-economic compromise in which the \"social\" is conflated with the space of domestic social stability or a reified national space. The case of the IIP, however, emphasizes the multiplicity of ways—and geographies—in which the \"social purpose\" of world order was imagined especially in colonial and postcolonial settings. For the IIP, \"social stability\" was not to be achieved through the language of social security or domestic intervention but through the construction of a particular kind of homology between self and a world order, the construction of psychological selves \"fit\" for the requirements of a new internationalizing world order. Drawing upon archival records, this article argues for the importance of more complex and diverse accounts of postwar order and the social purposes in which it was implicated.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Upon the nationalization of the British telegraph system in 1870, a set of processes at work inside London's Central Telegraph Office that was dictated by the bodily and spatial ordering of the era and combined with competing modes of Victorian class-inflected respectability produced gender-specified information labor. One of the effects of this process on telegraphy in London's Central Office in the first decade of nationalized telegraphy was the creation of high-status circuits catering to the state, international trade, sporting life, and imperial business and low-status circuits directed toward the local and the provincial. These distinct telegraphic orbits were connected to different types of telegraph instruments operated by differently gendered telegraphists. The human components of the telegraph system embodied the stratifications of the ascendant telecommunications era.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This research offers a critical context-sensitive discourse-historical analysis of a speech by James E. Shepard, the Black president and founder of North Carolina Central University. Shepard’s speech negotiated his identity as an educated Black man in the Jim Crow South by using perspectivation to switch between the point of view of an African American and that of a North Carolinian, thus establishing a bond with white members of his audience based on locational loyalty. A better understanding of how language is used by oppressed populations contributes to LIS scholars’ understandings of the usage of information in society.",

While the image of the public library as a social equalizer is often attributed to its origins in the free libraries movement, and while the first chairman of its board characterized TPL as a \"literary park\" for \"the rich and poor alike,\" historical efforts to extend the public library into social work–like activities remained short-term, ad hoc experiments that failed to generate transformational change. This article presents the challenges faced by a large Canadian urban public library as it attempted to position itself not only as an educational institution but also as a social service. TPL's activities in settlement neighborhoods reinforced rather than subverted the cultural status quo largely because it had no intentions to make radical program departures.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Social media influencers’ popularity can be attributed to their ability to balance appealing to an audience with the need to sell a brand. However, this also raises questions about their agency. Relying on structuration theory, field theory, and the principle of profilicity, this research examines how YouTube influencers negotiate between the need to appear as authentic and their need to perform for financial gain and how these needs interact to impact user agency. Interviews, observations, and content analysis were used to explore the relationship between agency, commodification, and perceived authenticity in influencers’ performances. The findings show that perceived authenticity and agency are inexorably linked and constrained by the commodification inherent in influencers’ performances, pointing to a need to reconceptualize structures as emergent and embodied, and highlighting how influencers face a hierarchy of choices that both enable and constrain their agency.",

Cappon ran a summer institute in historical administration at Radcliffe, participated in crucial debates about archival education, presented guest lectures in undergraduate and graduate courses whenever the opportunity presented itself, advocated for more rigorous graduate programs in archival work and documentary editing, and consistently argued about the synergy between teaching and publishing. In all that he did, history and historical scholarship were the central points of what one needed to know to become an archivist, an idea seemingly left behind as archival education has become ensconced in library, information science, and information schools. Although he failed to complete a book about historical and archival manuscripts that could be used in the classroom, Cappon’s commitment to the project and the publication of a few selected chapters mark his place as a pioneer in archival education.",

Drawing on rhetorical genre theory, we conceive of these finding aids as sociohistorical texts and trace their evolution across three dimensions (textual features, composing processes, and social roles). Our study suggests that the calendars and guides were not simply tools for making the PRO’s holdings accessible to the public; they also shaped and were shaped by ideas and beliefs about what it meant to make records accessible to the public and the most effective means of accomplishing that end. These ideas and beliefs were linked, in turn, to the PRO’s sense of its purpose and identity in relation to the communities it served. The generic evolution of the calendars and guides reflects and, to some extent, embodies that evolving sense of purpose and identity.",

    "abstract": "Architects began using computers to create architectural drawings in the 1960s. Since then, the development of computer-aided design (CAD) programs and, more recently, building information modeling (BIM) software in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries have changed the way architects create drawings, store information, and communicate intentions. This historical analysis will address information in the architecture industry and consider the development of CAD and BIM in the changing use of information in architecture by drawing on architectural theory and industry publications. The adoption of various computer technologies for architectural practice since the 1960s highlights how the ability to effectively manage and communicate complex information remains a central responsibility of an architect.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  In this article, we investigate the collection, organization, and dissemination of business information during the past seventy-five years. Transforming millions of “data bits” to intelligence for better decision making remains a challenge. However, we have come a long way since the late 1930s by building databases, connecting nodes and networks, and constantly upgrading the quality of business information. Classification schemes, search techniques, retrieval methods, delivery speed, and storage capacity have all increased exponentially. The key forces contributing to such transformation were public-private cooperation, the dedication of pioneers who “grew the field,” and the entrepreneurial ventures of data consolidators and research agencies. The social, economic, and organizational forces brought about changes that were coupled with the requisite technology; this paved the way for the creation of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and many related features that range from mobile communication to visualization techniques.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Empires are built around the control of information, with an often-overlooked aspect of empire building being the construction of tools of reference. These tools incorporate in summary form the multiplicity of inscriptions that are a product of the empire's epistemological operations. In order to shed some light on this face of empire, this article focuses on three readings of the minor forest products bulletins published by the Bureau of Forestry of the Philippines in the early twentieth century. The first of these readings sees the bulletins as demonstrating the Bureau of Forestry's mastery of the forest domain in the face of natural and human resistance to the bureau's work. In the second reading, we can see the bureau's efforts to create and assist \"botanical entrepreneurs\" capable and willing to exploit forest products in an efficient manner. Finally, we can read the bulletins as particular manifestations of the botanical guide as a genre. In this case, the bulletins created a series of \"inscription clusters\" that served to enhance the authority of the Bureau of Forestry as a mediator between users and the forests of the Philippines.",

This article examines the mathematical practices Doodson employed and, through analysis of his financial backers, why the calculations were carried out. Doodson utilized new calculation practices both to increase the complexity and amount of computations that could be carried out and to argue for further funding. Historians of science, including mathematics, can benefit from simultaneous analysis of both the practices and the patronage of scientists.</jats:p>",

This article attempts to conceptualize translation beyond the linguistic confinement. It begins by reviewing the mainstream translation conceptualizations. It adopts information as the fundamental concept underlying translation and reveals concepts like source and target text, meaning transfer, and language to be more of special cases of the information-based concept of translation; translation is, as a result, expanded to include not only human actions of creation and behaviors, but also actions of other life forms, inanimate or artificial substances that are capable of meaning-making. The article thus proposes the information theory of translation (ITT). It defines translation as a meaning-making process of an agent within its specific informational boundary and time limit to achieve goals. Finally, key problems in translation studies are discussed.",

Meditations on his artistic persona are used to support their argument, as is a direct quote about copyright that is cited with surprising frequency despite lacking proper citation. This research locates the source for Guthrie's copyright quote and corrects several false assumptions about its meaning, as well as about Guthrie's wider copyright activities. For proponents of public domain expansion who have mythologized Guthrie, this research thoroughly debunks that myth.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  History is a heavily document-driven field. The character of these documents varies from era to era and from case to case, and their content constitutes what can be broadly called “historical information.” Historical information, however, is not fixed, stable, or even cumulative; rather, it is enacted through the epistemic culture and practices of historians. Our study of two well-known historical cases in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—the monopolistic practices of railroad operators in the American West and the Dust Bowl phenomenon in the Midwest—show how historians enact information by adopting a fluid strategy toward their sources of information and their changing notions of evidence. At the same time, they also show that these enactments maintain a certain degree of consistency and continuity with the overall body of knowledge of the scholarly community, giving them a more “educated” character and differentiating them from the routine enactments of daily life. In this article, we explore the historiographical practices engaged by historians that enable this kind of enactment.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The period 1870–1930 witnessed the emergence of the local public library as a widespread and enduring American institution. We document the expansion of public libraries in the United States using data drawn from library surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Education. We then review causal accounts for that expansion. Exploiting cross-state and temporal variation in the data, we use statistical techniques to assess a number of plausible demand-and-supply factors affecting the pace of library development. Social and economic variables in the analysis include state income or wealth, urbanization, ethnic composition, and gender ratios. We also examine the effect of institutional innovations, such as state library commissions and library associations, that likely affected the establishment of public libraries. We confirm that library expansion was robustly related to urbanization and greater ethnic (immigrant) diversity and to institutional innovations and that it was greatly delayed in southern states.",

    "title": "Negotiated Order: The Fourth Amendment, Telephone Surveillance, and Social Interactions, 1878–1968",
    "abstract": "In the United States the words “telephone surveillance” bring to mind contemporary security concerns about smart phone tracking, the NSA warrantless wiretapping scandal, and the telecommunications provisions of the Patriot Act. Yet telephone surveillance is as old as telephony itself, dating back to the nearly simultaneous commercialization of the telephone and phonograph. This article examines telephone surveillance by American law enforcement agencies from the inception of telephone service to the passage of the Federal Wiretap Law in 1968, focusing on the challenges an advancing, proliferating, and shrinking technology posed for Fourth Amendment law. To highlight the technological, institutional, and cultural interactions that have shaped Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the article deploys Jack Balkin’s theory of cultural software and Anslem Strauss’s concept of a negotiated order and brings together major cases, federal legislation, and evidence of government surveillance. The article argues that during the first ninety years of telephone usage in America, laws on search and seizure developed not from constitutional consistency or logic but as the result of a complex negotiation process involving new media and human agency.",

In recognition of the journal’s 50th anniversary, this study uses data derived from Google Scholar to identify the articles in JLH and its successors that have been cited most often. Additionally, this essay reveals the journal has contained scholarship that cites library history both inside and outside the discipline of library and information science.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  How do new disciplines develop in certain universities more than in others? The history of computing in France suggests a model to describe the development process that shapes the geography of science. In the 1950s a few professors of numerical analysis, often associated with a school of electrical engineering, created threefold structures comprising courses in applied mathematics, a computing facility, and a research laboratory. Such local configurations initiated a cumulative development process, attracting more resources and opening the field to novel investigations in computer science. In other universities, these configurations were not completed, and computing remained confined to technical training. In the 1960s pioneers became leaders in the growing field and controlled the definition of computer science curricula. As the institutes they had created reached considerable size, these leaders began to spin off junior professors toward other universities. The centers remain major academic institutions in the discipline today.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:In 2021 China passed the Personal Information Protection Law. One of the most important features of the law is its regulation of sensitive personal information processing. This article examines how Chinese legal frameworks treat sensitive personal information and analyzes how the Personal Information Protection Law protects sensitive personal information by creating general rules for personal information processing and specific rules for sensitive information. This article also analyzes three obstacles to sensitive personal information protection: context sensitivity, the influence of widespread use of digital technologies, and the balance among various interests. In response, this article proposes three solutions: (1) a contextual strategy for risk governance, including contextual risk analysis and resilience; (2) algorithm compliance, including the algorithmic impact assessment and algorithmic supervision; and (3) a two-step test for balancing various interests.",

    "abstract": "In the first half of the twentieth century, the increasing use of documents to record everyday interactions generated information that became the basis of official identification practices. Based on this change, this article makes two arguments: (1) the increased use of documents in identification redefined identity in terms of procedure (systematic recordkeeping), and (2) it made concrete a relatively new conception of information as a “substance” that had presence in the world and was objective. Thus, the objectivity that became central to identification was tied to an object, to paper, that facilitated an understanding that these documents “contained” objective information.",

These required lengthy calculations by human “computers.” One such computer, Arthur Thomas Doodson, became prominent in both antiaircraft ballistics and tide calculations. This article examines the mathematical practices Doodson employed and, through analysis of his financial backers, why the calculations were carried out. Doodson utilized new calculation practices both to increase the complexity and amount of computations that could be carried out and to argue for further funding. Historians of science, including mathematics, can benefit from simultaneous analysis of both the practices and the patronage of scientists.",

Both nations stand out in the region for their implementation of science and technology development programs during the twentieth century. The Internet relies on many layers of infrastructure, technologies, and capacities; this work examines the commonalities and differences around its adoption in these national contexts. The essay combines an institutional analysis, which provides an understanding of the main processes that led to the establishment of the Internet in the two countries, with key concepts from the literature on technology appropriation. The tensions generated by new forms of networking due to the worldwide dissemination of TCP/IP are assessed in the framework of the paradigm shift in telecommunications reform during the 1990s.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This article examines attitudes toward the female telephone operator in the British press and a range of literary and cultural sources. Perceptions of female telephonists were rooted in both reactions to the increasingly visible employment of women in white-collar work and uncertain responses to the telephone as a new communication medium. Such perceptions of the female telephonist became stereotyped and static, though there were some later challenges and attempts to nuance these perceptions as well. The General Post Office took over the service and implemented a number of changes, but ultimately the organization and telephonists themselves had to coexist with these stereotypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:This article was originally drafted just four weeks after the publishing of Dataclysm, a 2014 book by Christian Rudder that sought to popularize data and data science by, in part, dismissing the social sciences and humanities as obsolete approaches to knowledge production. In looking for a potential way of responding to data scientists like Rudder, this article examines a 1948–50 essay about data that was written by Lionel Trilling (1905–75). Trilling frames data as part of our broader cultural history, which includes literature, drama, epic poetry, and the arts. This article argues that what Trilling models in the essay is a line of writing and thinking about data—a type of data criticism—that today offers tremendous promise for responding to data science and to evangelists like Christian Rudder.",

    "abstract": "In the final decades of the twentieth century, experts in a wide variety of disciplines—such as computer science, evolutionary biology, management studies, and educational theory—introduced the concepts of modular design into their professional discourses and practices. In each of these disciplines, modular systems called for standardized, interchangeable components (or modules) that could be recombined within a predefined system architecture. This article explores the modern history of modularity as it was imagined and applied in two specific settings: the architectural theories of Albert Farwell Bemis in the 1930s and the construction of electronic computers in the 1950s and 1960s. By framing this account as a history of an ordering concept, I hope to persuade information historians to look across traditional disciplinary boundaries and examine the more general set of concepts, strategies, organizations, and technologies that humans have used in their unending efforts to order and make sense of information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:In 1968 students and faculty at Yale University protested against plans for a new underground library. The protests reflected and refracted increased student and faculty campus activism, anxieties generated by urban renewal projects in New Haven, and concerns about the university's place in the city. This study challenges the assumption that the academic library was a passive spectator to events on campuses during the 1960s and analyzes how factors like changing space needs, the growth of published information, evolving information technologies, and campus activism impacted library planning and design at one of the country's largest academic libraries.",

Finally, based on the establishment of emotional bonds between users and museums, a design proposal is proposed for the interaction mode of digital museums. This article uses the QEM algorithm. The practical results can be useful for website developers in the process of creating online exhibitions for the Palace Museum. Museum personnel can also turn to this article to find strong and weak points of exhibition organization.",

Having established this pattern of change and its importance for encyclopedism, the article will then evaluate the factors determining the change. The early growth of encyclopedias was above all a consequence of competition, perceptions of the market for encyclopedias, and publishers’ and contributors’ psychology, while the most important causes for encyclopedias’ lack of growth after 1840 were the standardization of encyclopedias as products, the cost of compilation, and financial conservatism among encyclopedia-makers.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "title": "Information in the Novel and the Novel as Information System: Charles Dickens’s Little Dorrit and Margaret Drabble’s Radiant Way Trilogy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Each realist novel collects, interprets, and transmits information about what it means to be human in a certain time and place. Part of information history, realist novels help us understand the psychology of human beings and the dynamics of their political and social interactions. Although fictional, novels contain information about material conditions, social customs and values, the organization of institutions, and individual perceptions and identities. Readers understand that each novel includes, constitutes, and transmits information. Novels are not reference books; rather, they are “information systems” that describe fictional worlds with critical relevance to our understanding of history, politics, social organization, and individual development. Describing material conditions, information in the realist novel outlines socioeconomic and political conditions and problems. This essay looks at two cases: Charles Dickens’s Little Dorrit (1855–57) and Margaret Drabble’s Radiant Way trilogy of novels— The Radiant Way (1987), A Natural Curiosity (1989), and The Gates of Ivory (1991). These works offer accounts and critiques of social hierarchies and inequities by incorporating historical and social information into their overall thematics of plot, character, and setting.</jats:p>",

Proceeding from an effort contemporaneous to Du Bois’s project backward to a much earlier conception of this publishing goal reveals that the idea to publish an encyclopedia of the African diaspora was not handed down by members of its intellectual elite but bubbled up to meet the needs of their ordinary lives.</jats:p>",

Under the leadership of women’s club activist Lucy Johnston, a system of traveling libraries was developed in Kansas. Letters written to Johnston at the start of the program reveal the acute yearning for books on the prairies and the power of disenfranchised women to rally for a cause in turn-of-the-century Kansas.\n\t</jats:p>",

To understand the changing values and concerns of microcomputer owners, we analyzed 1,285 reader letters published in Softalk magazine between 1980 and 1984. During this period, a preoccupation with programming was displaced by discussions of software applications, products, and services. This transition illustrates the separation of users from hobbyists, reflecting changes in the software industry and attitudes toward amateurism, professionalization, gender, and expertise.",

However, such challenges also open new opportunities for wider negotiations of cultural heritage and rethinking what cultural heritage institutions and practices are. This special issue brings together scholars from different disciplines to provide critically and empirically grounded perspectives on the datafication of cultural heritage institutions' exhibition and collection practices.",

Why, then, must firms like the Renault automobile company constantly recall the rules? My thesis is that these instructions, repeated in parrot-like fashion, reveal a failure of the head staff to control a technology in constant evolution that was adopted at minimum cost and assimilated by employees who adapt it to their own practical needs. I assert that visual documents constitute an interesting option in internal communication, one that literature on management has historically underestimated. How might they question the supremacy of written archives, on which most historical studies are based? What do visual documents specifically offer to the history of corporate telephone practices and oral business communication?",

Few people lived near the earthquake’s epicenter, so the earthquake was small in terms of damage and loss of life, but it still was felt from San Diego to San Francisco.

Californians made sense of the earthquake without standardized timekeeping or modern scientific theories. The descriptions and explanations of the earthquake that surfaced were shaped by and reflected the 1857 information infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:This article examines the role of information in the early years of the English East India Company (EIC). It examines different aspects of the organizational behavior of the EIC between the years 1600 and 1623 and shows the interplay between physical expansion and the transformation of information-handling practices from several perspectives. Although the focus is on a single organization, this case study provides insights into the informational challenges faced by early modern trading companies and similar organizations coordinating operations on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  Computer history displays in museum galleries and exhibitions traditionally focus on iconic machines and progressive lineages of hardware production. This approach has been widely criticized as unrepresentative of computing’s wider context but is, in any case, becoming increasingly awkward as historical attention turns to the era of small, cheap, undistinguished personal computers and standardized networking. This article presents a range of more user-focused display approaches for consideration. In particular, I address the value and practicalities of period “set dressing” for hardware and hands-on interaction with software and call for greater hybridization between approaches devised for static galleries and for mobile displays.\n\t</jats:p>",

The Post Office Act of 1792, which transformed the informational environment by formalizing a nationwide communications network, banned letter opening, a norm that became the cornerstone of American privacy law. The article analyzes the circumstances that led to the articulation of this norm, contending that it rested on two pillars: a civic rationale that rejected government interference in personal communications, and a commercial rationale that prioritized user trust and market expansion. A comparison between the eighteenth-century discourse and current debates over digital surveillance is offered.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In a report for the Society of Bookmen in 1928, British publishers estimated that between a quarter and two-thirds of all the books they published went to the big four circulating libraries: Boots, W. H. Smith, Mudie’s, and the Times Book Club. This article examines the literary impact of one of the largest of these, Boots Book-lovers’ Library (1899–1966), which by 1935 had around four hundred libraries attached to its high-street pharmacies catering for the literary tastes of over one million subscribers a year. The article considers the impact of the Boots Book-lovers’ Library on authors’ practices of writing and revision and on literary marketing and censorship, focusing in particular on James Hanley’s The Furys (1935) and using unpublished correspondence in the Chatto &amp; Windus archive at the University of Reading to demonstrate how the publisher’s sense of the tastes and expectations of the Boots library reader influenced the revisioning process.</jats:p>",

These documents have changed our worldviews about science and have raised our expectations of them as tools for knowledge justification. This article explores the complexities surrounding the digital document by revisiting Michael Polanyi’s theory of tacit knowledge—the idea that “we can know more than we can tell.” The theory presents to us a dilemma: if we can know more than we can tell, then this means that the communication of science via the document as a primary form of telling will always be incomplete. This dilemma presents significant challenges to the open science movement.",

    "abstract": "From the very earliest days of electronic computing, flowcharts have been used to represent the conceptual structure of complex software systems. In much of the literature on software development, the flowchart serves as the central design document around which systems analysts, computer programmers, and end users communicate, negotiate, and represent complexity. And yet the meaning of any particular flowchart was often highly contested, and the apparent specificity of such design documents rarely reflected reality. Drawing on the sociological concept of the boundary object, this article explores the material culture of software development with a particular focus on the ways in which flowcharts served as political artifacts within the emerging communities of practices of computer programming.",

In 1858 an address by Henry Ward Beecher and other influential citizens reviewed the benefits of such a library, and after two years of planning the women’s library became a reality. New York City was unique in providing a library just for women; however, financial support dwindled, and it was forced to be taken over by the Women’s Protective Union by 1870.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t  Chess-playing automata that also played checkers were built in Europe from the late eighteenth century. One of these, named Ajeeb, came to the United States, spending much of the time from 1885 into the 1930s in New York and taking occasional tours around the country. The advent of electronic computers in the mid-1940s encouraged attempts to play games using machines in both Britain and the United States. By the late twentieth century, a Canadian-written computer program, Chinook, had defeated world champion and mathematician Marion Tinsley. More recently, developers of Chinook announced that checkers could be played to a draw against any opening.\n\t</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:This article describes the unfolding idea of the literary archival collection through the early history of the Poetry Collection at the University at Buffalo (UB). The influence of founder Charles Abbott’s innovative idea on special collections libraries, literary study and pedagogy, and book history helped to change these fields in dramatic and unforeseen ways, most provocatively by insisting that materials that were once assumed by librarians, scholars, and university administrators to be trash had the potential to be some of the most valuable artifacts for scholarly pursuit and collegiate education. The Poetry Collection was assembled from the efforts of its staff and the cooperation of its authors rather than from the tastes of an individual collector, demonstrating what it means for an institutional repository to design and compile its own collection democratically.",

    "abstract": "During the 1990s, when the Internet became a common communication medium in the United States, its history was recounted in numerous works that were intended for popular American audiences. In the context of the new legitimizing discourse of the technopolitical order of post-Fordist society, which views network technology at the center of an emancipatory social transformation, this article critically analyzes the role of the authors, as well as the main characters, actions, plot, and narrative of these works. The authors wrote for specific intended audiences, casting the history of the Internet into the mythopoetic form of the technological romance that dramatizes the eroticized prodigious work of the so-called Internet pioneers.",

It suggests that although the motivations between these two initiatives were starkly different, their motivations dovetail within the more recent phenomenon of large-scale digitization of the sort pursued by the Google Books Library Project and the Internet Archive. The article also interrogates the role of the public (or lack thereof) in the initial shaping of all three phenomena: public libraries, digital libraries, and large-scale digitization initiatives.",
