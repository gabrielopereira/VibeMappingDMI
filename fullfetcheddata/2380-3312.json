    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article analyzes the United States biosecurity state’s orchestration of the COVID-19 phenomenon into a public health emergency, tracing the legal platforms that made this mobilization possible. Leaning on the longstanding reverberations between political and biological discourses around immunology, I argue that the polis entered into a state of autoimmune disease where its public/private biosecurity organisms attacked its own body politic. COVID-19 constitutes the culmination of a development that had been in the making for several decades. Besides parsing the central legislative inventions that form the basis of this operation, the article analyzes the most central medical countermeasure deployed as the ostensible remedy to the public health emergency. A novel technological platform (mRNA transfection) is introduced as the solution to the threat of infection (falsely promising immunity). This platform is equally built on autoimmune logic, not traditional immunity. Unlike previous vaccine technologies, synthetic mRNA transfections coerce the body’s cells to produce the antigen against which the immune reaction is mounted. The immune system will then attack those cells that express the antigen, the most publicly acknowledged example being myocarditis. The feedback loop between biological and political discourses on autoimmune disease has begun to restructure societies globally.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Encroaching Borders and Defencelessness of Migrants at Checkpoints in Southern Mexico",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>After an intimidating experience I had during a checkpoint on the southern border of Mexico in 2023, I began to investigate the prevalence and impacts of immigration checkpoints. Despite having been declared unconstitutional by the Mexican Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (Supreme Court of Justice) in 2022, checkpoints are still one of the most common and least regulated practices to detain people on the move, especially in the context of anti-drug operations. In this paper, I show how checkpoints have become a violent infrastructure dispersed across the Mexican territory. The flexibility and mobility of checkpoints and the actors administering them—governmental actors, extra-legal groups, and criminal networks—expose migrants to racialized and gendered forms of extreme violence and human rights violations. I present the findings of research conducted in 2022 and 2023 in the city of Tapachula, Chiapas, and its surroundings, consisting of participant observation and interviews with migrants who interacted with the Guardia Nacional (National Guard) during waiting, transit, or detention. I also interviewed ten civil society organizations that provide psycho-legal assistance to migrant people detained at checkpoints throughout the country. I analyze how, in hazardous conditions, being stopped in a checkpoint while traveling in Mexican highways can generate intimidation and defenselessness against all kinds of human rights violations.\nResumen\nTras haber vivido una experiencia intimidante durante un control fronterizo en el sur de México en 2023, comencé a investigar la prevalencia y los impactos de los retenes en carreteras para las personas migrantes. A pesar de que en 2022 la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación declaró la inconstitucionalidad de las revisiones migratorias al interior del país, los retenes siguen siendo una de las prácticas más comunes y menos reguladas para detener a las personas en movilidad, especialmente en el contexto de los operativos antidrogas. En este artículo analizo los retenes en carreteras que funcionan como infraestructuras violentas dispersas por todo el territorio mexicano. Tanto su flexibilidad y movilidad, como los actores que los operan—actores gubernamentales, grupos extralegales y redes criminales—exponen a las personas migrantes a formas de violencia racializadas y de género y a serias violaciones de los derechos humanos. Presento los resultados de una investigación realizada en 2022 y 2023 en la ciudad de Tapachula, Chiapas, y sus alrededores, que consistió observación participante y entrevistas con personas migrantes que interactuaron con la Guardia Nacional durante los procesos de espera, tránsito o detención. Incluyo las entrevistas realizadas a diez organizaciones de la sociedad civil que brindan acompañamiento psico-jurídico a personas migrantes detenidas en retenes a lo largo de todo el país. Analizo cómo, en condiciones de riesgo, la detención en un retén por las carreteras mexicanas puede generar intimidación e indefensión ante todo tipo de violaciones de derechos humanos.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>I&#x0D;\nn this article we discuss unique free software-based digital infrastructures and networks that were developed in Brazilian communities, presenting situated models of resistance. We will discuss the background of the networks and characterize their practice and infrastructure, that are largely under-studied. The analysis we pursue highlights the importance of minorized decentralized technological practices that convey integral organizational models opposing capitalist hegemony. In order to describe the intersection of these alternatives in the Brazilian context, we will mobilize a feminist epistemology which considers necessary principles of “intra-action” (Barad 2007) across heterogeneous sociotechnical spaces.&#x0D;\nWe will describe how different projects intersect, among them: Baobáxia, “a rota os Baobas” an eventually connected network, that can exist both on the larger internet and disconected from it, as a local local network, which nodes are located in quilombolas communities; “Metareciclagem”a collective of Brazilian technologists promoting the “up-cycling” of discarded computing technologies and their usage for artistic expression through “Gambiarra” (“makeshift”) re-appropriations; and another political articulation of the reflection about the appropriation of digital technologies that has given rise to an international network and practices which are identified by activists and artists as “Technoshamanism.”&#x0D;\nThe role and place of digital activism in the Brazilian context is uniquely tied to specific needs of the communities at a moment in time. This led to unique examples of construction of what we have called “singular technologies”, we mean: \"intentional and contextual technologies, developed specifically by a community to respond to their specific context.\" In Brazil, they emerge from a decolonial position and cultural narrative re-appropriation, supported by a benevolent policy. This brings us in the conclusion to qualify the construction of singular technologies that stem from the need to characterize daily practice by citizen groups that deploy their successful institutional arrangements and affordances under the radar and outside the competency of traditional institutions. These concepts do not try to define any tangible essence, but rather articulate social dynamics of the studied groups. We will qualify these social dynamics as the unique relation that technological processes emerge from.</jats:p>",

In this image-text paper we wonder with CS (Careful Slugs)––the materiality and metaphor that they generate as they encounter computational infrastructures, digital design, and interfaces. Through queer playfulness and promiscuous metaphorical practice, we propose CS as an opening metaphor for CS (Computer Science) departments where the hardened muscular lines of models and predatory based solutionisms beckon some defensive slime. As those that traverse ever-shifting and undone grounds, CS (Careful Slug) emerges from a critical disability studies perspective. We outline to practice, CS (Careful Slug) is to practice a slow “soft gooey”; to shield using protective mucous layers; to make chemical binds sticky enough to hold in-place inconclusively yet with possibilities of lubricating accountability. We invite you to sink with us into soft gooey worldings of slug-imaginings not to overburden the slug but to speculate how metaphors, might contribute to trans*feminist technoscience, accessibility, and CS (Computer Science) concerns.\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, Agent Orange has re-entered scholarly discourse as a fertile site for investigating the confluence of slow violence, intergenerational trauma, and the molecularization of chemical regimes. This study analyzes how the political economy that gave way to the discovery and tactical use of Agent Orange “abroad” during times of “war,” finds several new homes on US soil. First, I discuss how Agent Orange was tested domestically at Eglin Air Force Base in the western Florida Panhandle, prior to and during its use in Vietnam, to trace how civilian workers who worked on base were made into surplus labor through banal daily exposure to the chemical compounds. Second, I analyze how Vietnamese refugees were transported to Eglin Air Force Base in 1975 as it became one of four relocation centers used as temporary “homes” for refugees awaiting sponsorship by US American families. Finally, I trace how herbicides are being reintroduced in the Mekong Delta within rural farming communities to help maintain the demand of global agricultural circuits. By tracing these three interwoven examples of how military herbicides were domesticated, this essay weaves analyses of the spectacular violence of chemical warfare, with their more mundane iterations, to home in on the forms of toxicity that linger and are reproduced at home.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Pollination is a lynchpin anchoring multispecies survival, but in the racial capitalist configurations of condensed environment agriculture, pollination politics are informed by life-depleting and carceral logics, as well as imaginaries steeped in racial hierarchies and sex binaries that ground future survival in colonial, heteropatriarchal, and normative terms. This article argues that pollination politics are focused on intensifying agriculture and increasing yield within carceral infrastructures, and that the orchestration of pollination is governed by socio-sexual schemas about fitness and fecundity that are governed by a normative reproductive futurism. Joining feminist STS and queer theory, the article traces how forms of life in greenhouses and other agricultural infrastructures are “gardened” in the interests of modes of sustainability that are fundamentally exploitative. Biodiversity is domesticated and depoliticized, and all forms of human and non-human vitality are directed towards increased yield. The naturalization of sexual difference influences how plant life is managed, but also how temporary foreign labor is biopolitically managed in controlled environment agricultural infrastructures. The article reads the perverse politics of scarcity through the South African film Glasshouse (2021) and ends by speculating on how “wild pollination” might present more decolonial, anti-racist, queer, and liberatory sustainable futures.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Pornography’s White Infrastructure",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In preparing my talk for a panel on “Whiteness and Technoculture” for the Society for the Social Study of Science in Boston, I wanted to think about the relationship of my research on the technocultures of the online pornography industry to the events in Charlottesville, which occurred only weeks earlier. Two trends within the online pornography industry came immediately to mind. The first is the aesthetic of “white innocence” as sexual fantasy that reveals a cultural conversation between the mainstream gay pornography industry and white nationalism in the United States. The second is the emergence of affiliate networks that aim to curate content for “unique male viewers” because the internet is, curiously, awash in “female-focused” content. Both of these phenomena seem particularly relevant at a time when white fragility, toxic masculinity, “men’s rights,” and xenophobia have been given explicit approval by the newly elected U.S. President, Donald Trump. These forces have long defined the United States, but they also reveal the way in which this presidency is uniquely awful and dangerous.  </jats:p>",

Curative imaginaries in the field often situate transplant as a cure and a return to health, producing bifurcated temporalities of before and after transplant and proposing futures that erase disability and disabled bodies. This Special Section centers the frictions in transplant temporalities, offering examinations of how transplant troubles the binaries of life and death, self and other, and illness and health through attending to frictions of futures and cure in transplant medicine. We question how new technologies perpetuate, exacerbate, and complicate the promises of curative imaginaries in transplant medicine; interrogate tropes and technologies of transplant as destination; trace practices of inequitable access to transplantation and livable futures; foreground transplant’s looping, haunting temporalities; and introduce more-than-human lessons and the necessity of imagining collective futures. Developed with attention arts-based and experimental ways of knowing transplant through a feminist STS and critical disability studies ethos, this Special Section invites the undoing and unfolding of conventional, harmful logics of transplantation.</jats:p>",

This collaboration, led by feminist anthropologists, brings together anthropology, environmental-public health, and environmental engineering researchers to analyze how neighborhoods as “socio-techno-bio systems” shape how people trust or distrust water. Our project follows the infrastructures and social structures that move water in and out of neighborhoods, households, and bodies making them trust it more or less. At the same time our multi-disciplinary research team inhabits different epistemic research environments that creates tensions about how we make knowledge and what counts as data. Trust and distrust then shapes how we constitute both our object of inquiry and how we know it.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers the ways in which these new GPS watches becoming commonplace among Ethiopian athletes are changing how women professional athletes in Ethiopia (who have the potential to bring in substantial earnings in Ethiopia) are monitored by husbands, coaches, agents, and sponsors. In the past 2-3 years, however, digital self-tracking devices (DSTDs) have come close to replacing shoes as the most sought after training aid. Watches – that track pacing, kilometers, miles, steps, caloric output, elevation gain, and heart rate – are bought and brought home from international competitions and gifted by agents, managers, and fans from abroad. Some sponsored athletes’ data are even instantaneously transferred to Nike laboratories in Portland after they finish practice in Addis Ababa. Drawing on participant observation and interviews, the paper address the new pressures and working conditions that this type of monitoring can introduce by considering how husbands, brothers, coaches, and agents – all men (Ethiopian, European, American, etc.) –  monitor these devices and reflect or change existing the gendered dynamics of working in elite sport. It asks: What are the working implications of this new kind of monitoring? How do they intersect and contest gendered norms that exist through and outside of sport and surveillance studies? And how does this impact conceptions of the body both within and outside of professional athletics?</jats:p>",

It consists of  a rectangular digital collage whose foreground depicts a square enclosed by a thin red border, containing dynamic and abstract color fields, and a background consisting of faint, digital artifacts in purple and teal arranged across a field of muted yellow-gray. In dialogue with El Lissitzky's About Two Squares, this work contends that through novel forms of collaboration and communication, metaphor's power can be wrested from the State, towards horizons of revolutionary possibility. \nFor more about Alex Cruse’s work, please visit https://alexcruse.xyz.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Ectogenesis is for Feminists",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this critical perspective, I call for interdisciplinary feminist research to reclaim the subject of artificial womb technology from anti-abortion discourse. In 2017, scientists announced the successful animal trials of a highly advanced incubator that replicates the conditions of the uterus and was used to gestate lamb fetuses from the equivalent of approximately 22-24 weeks human gestation through to term in good health. This technology, now being prepared for human trials, has generated a new wave of research on ectogenesis, the process of gestating a pregnancy outside the body. But while ectogenesis raises many pressing ethical concerns, the discourse has frequently reverted to one claim: that by allowing the fetus to be removed from the pregnant person’s body without causing its death, ectogenesis will “solve” abortion. I argue that authors who make these claims fail to understand why feminists fight for abortion rights, take a narrow approach to reproductive freedom, neglect the social construction of “viability”, and fail to acknowledge the dependency of the fetus on care. Finally, I identify areas for future feminist intervention.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Technologies and self-help protocols associated with menstrual tracking have gained popularity over the past decade, with wellness consultants such as Alisa Vitti at the helm. Through careful monitoring and lifestyle changes, such techniques promise to unleash an inherent hormonal advantage that can extend one’s personal and professional pursuits. Though seemingly new, these approaches to menstrual monitoring have an historical lineage born of corporate management. Now being sold as feminist, they draw on a belief in menstrual deficit, or an understanding of menstruation along productivist lines focused on curbing workplace absenteeism and enhancing personal optimization. In bringing together cases from over the last century, this paper seeks to establish a through line of economization and imagine instead how workplace tracking might be leveraged toward worker mobilization and bargaining for collective gains.</jats:p>",

It demonstrates that “design thinking” articulates a racialized understanding of labor, judgment, and the subject and attempts to maintain whiteness at the apex of global hierarchies of labor.“Design thinking” is a form of expertise that poses design not as form giving, but as a form of empathic reason by which executives can plan products, services, and accumulation. Silicon Valley, business schools, and reformers promote it as a form of caring technical expertise by which some guide futures for others. The paper will examine the history of the concept of “design thinking” – a category forged by Silicon Valley designers in the face of mounting competitive pressures on design professions in the United States in the mid-2000s. By drawing on artifacts, documents, public debates about the design profession from this period, I will demonstrate how champions of “design thinking” responded to expanded availability of design labor globally by figuring Asians and machines as the creative subject's Other.</jats:p>",

Both prose fiction and comics told from an animal point-of-view can offer unique insights into cultural understandings of animal behavior, nature, and the environment more broadly. This article delves specifically into dinosaur point-of-view fiction, which at times has even been written by or with support from professional paleontologists. Through several popular examples of dinosaur fiction and comics published from the 1990s to the 2010s, this article will examine how these texts illustrate how fictional representations of scientific understandings conform to or challenge dominant narratives around the natural world, gender, and power. These stories, including Stephen Bissette’s unfinished comic series Tyrant (1993–1996), and Robert Bakker’s novel Raptor Red (1995), and most recently Tadd Galusha’s graphic novel Cretaceous (2019), use creative storytelling techniques to entertain readers, while also representing and participating in scientific discourses of paleontology and animal behavior.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Homes are intimate spaces where many bodies come together in space and time to deeply learn and understand the processes that have created one another. Ecology, the study of the relationship between organisms and their environment, is based on the study of a home. Yet ecologists are trained in patriarchal, heteronormative, and otherwise Western articulations and understandings of nature that prevent access to this ecological home. In this article, I argue that through (re)constructing ecology as a home, ecologists can better understand the social and ecological processes that shape an organism. To (re)construct ecology as a home, I first dissect conflict with wildlife as a concept that reinforces taxonomical hierarchies and prevents humans from making a home with wildlife. I then leverage Queer theory to flatten taxonomical hierarchies and create a landscape that invites the (re)construction of ecology as a homemaking discipline. Lastly, I sit within the ecological home to examine urban wildlife and the environmental pressures they are subjected to—using the urban coyote as an example. This work leverages Queerness to collapse taxonomical hierarchies and push traditional ecology towards a boundless relationality with wildlife to more holistically understand the various social and ecological pressures that ultimately create their phenotype.</jats:p>",

Looking at the lives and deaths of Audre Lorde and Henrietta Lacks, I argue that transcendent narratives, and the connections they draw between past and future, living and dead, offer a degree off liberatory flight in the face and aftermath of terminal cancer. Narrative connectivity resists the silencing, medicalizing, and structural violence of cancer in the context of a racist medical system, by allowing for Black women, their families, and those who love them to tell their stories, reaching other Black women, rather than being flattened into patients, into single moments in time, into resources for extraction. Instead, through a continuing care network of readers and family, Lacks, Lorde and millions of less famous but no less important Black women who have died from cancer, live on in these moments of interconnectivity through memory, freed from the boundaries of time itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Transported through colonial technologies such as Wardian cases and imperial ships, or simply popped in envelopes and sent via the postal service, the reproductive bodies of plants have been extracted, commodified, reproduced, and proliferated to satisfy human needs and desires. The ongoing and historical movement of plants and their reproductive capacity—known now through the disembodied clinical term germplasm—for economic, social, political, and agricultural purposes provides a lens through which global fertility chains can be studied. I study one such fertility chain: the movement of seeds of plants into frozen vaults known as “seed banks.” While colonial plant movements are associated with exploitative control, newer plant extractions for seed banking are shielded from rebuke because they embody the unquestionably positive valence of “biodiversity conservation.” The view from Australia captures the awkwardness of seed banking as a reproductive technology because the ongoing tensions between Indigenous struggles and settler-colonial nation building, and the urgency around climate change, are far from resolved. The politics of the Anthropocene are particularly poignant in Australia because anthropogenic destruction looks very different when viewed from the perspective of either Indigenous people or settlers.</jats:p>",

More precisely, we ask how our notions of immunity and especially autoimmunity have changed over the last three years.

In this way, we connect our inquiries both to the history of recent epidemics—most notably HIV/AIDS—and to broader philosophical and cultural investigations of what immunity means and does. The writings grouped here focus their attentions in different and complementary ways. Some train their analysis on issues of temporality, others on ontology (Does the virus live?). Still others focus on geopolitics and other fields of specialization such as feminist and queer theory, science and technology studies, disability studies, critical race theory, and health humanities. Taken together, we imagine strategies of care and collective survival through notions of autoimmunity that model different, more queerly entangled and cripped understandings of bodies and environments that reach beyond myths of autonomy and sovereignty, eradication, and cure.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this essay, we offer a prehistory of contemporary bubbles used in the mitigation of viruses, told through the late 1980s case of Eliana Martínez, an HIV-positive (HIV+) and developmentally disabled Puerto Rican child who was ordered to be confined to a glass chamber within her Florida classroom. Eliana’s mother, Rosa, challenged the use of this chamber as a reasonable disability accommodation in a high-profile lawsuit. We draw on disability studies, critical access studies, and a postcolonial critique to put forward a theory of the bubble as a “structure-within-a-structure”—a zone of limited, restricted, or filtered interaction with the broader social world. Eliana’s bubble demonstrates how institutional practices of accommodation can easily transform into techniques of containment, sanctioned to manage the “infectious subject” within institutions and systems. The bubble is a gathering of social forces and bodily relations. In Eliana’s case, it gathers the necropolitical arrangements of different populations, the coloniality of Puerto Rico, the innocence of childhood, the fatality of an AIDS diagnosis, and the politics of design and disability.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Science and technology studies (STS) researchers integrated into interdisciplinary research projects learn important lessons of collaboration dynamics by analyzing the lived experience of the research participants. Previous approaches of STS researchers included laboratory studies and reimagining the collaborative process as a research method. However, previous research on interdisciplinary projects repeatedly cites recurring challenges, indicating that more sharing of this lived experience is needed. My autoethnography of an interdisciplinary project interrogates the various positionalities I embodied as research technologies. In adopting a feminist analytical approach, this paper forefronts emotional affect and interrogates technological labels of the social science researcher to understand power dynamics and interpret what is meant by “good science” across disciplines. These findings help us understand how individuals appraise interdisciplinarity, setting realistic expectations for addressing future interdisciplinary collaborations more deliberately. Lastly, I also consider the ethical considerations necessary to care for the ethnographer in interdisciplinary collaborations, as they are often caught in the crosshairs of the frustrations in collaborating. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary self-tracking systems signal a new era of biological monitoring now entangled with the politics of ubiquitous computing. Is self-tracking technology, which is connected to major stakeholders in healthcare, essential for filling in gaps in care, or is it fueling an increasingly commercialized medical industry? This essay examines the complex biases embedded in self-tracking technologies and introduces three manifestations of feminist science that subvert the monetization of personal health information: feminist art collective subRosa, which investigates how personal genetic information is developed into marketable medical products in their web-based project, Cell Track: Mapping the Appropriation of Life Materials; media artist and biohacker Mary Maggic, who makes self-synthesized hormone therapy accessible with their Open Source Estrogen project; artist-researcher Heather Dewey-Hagborg, whose biohacking products provide a DIY science in a world marred by genetic policing. Against the lure of connectivity, feminist science looks to circumvention as a method for understanding and disrupting the gendered and raced politics embedded in self-tracking technology. Tracing alternative techno-politics in these three new media projects, this essay reveals the necessity for artistic interventions in the contemporary healthcare landscape. &#x0D;\nFeminist art collective subRosa investigates how personal genetic information is developed into marketable medical products in their web-based project, Cell Track: Mapping the Appropriation of Life Materials. Drawing attention to the corporate ownership of biology, Cell Track adds new meaning to the idea of tracking. Similarly emphasizing the potential in citizen science, media artist and biohacker Mary Maggic makes self-synthesized hormone therapy accessible with their Open-Source Estrogen project. Both subRosa and Maggic are interested in bypassing institutional gatekeepers, not unlike artist-researcher Heather Dewey-Hagborg whose biohacking products suggest a DIY science in a world marred by genetic policing.&#x0D;\nFeminist science aims to circumvent tracking and institutional biopower against targeted populations. Against the lure of connectivity, feminist science looks to circumvention as a method for understanding and disrupting the gendered and raced politics embedded in surveillance. Working through the three bioart projects above, this essay reveals the necessity for artistic interventions in the contemporary healthcare landscape. Where commercial self-tracking products shortchange consumers by requiring them to share their health data with third-party companies, a feminist science framework and practice critically examines – and in some cases offers a departure from – the neoliberal biotechnology and medical industries.</jats:p>",

Tracking the fate of washing machines and householder well-being, this essay traces the militarized genealogies running contemporary settler colonial occupation in Australia. We are particularly interested in how the colonizing project decants militarized operations into the intimacies of domestic inhabitation. Where once this project facilitated a gendered labor reserve, today it enables the continued pathologization of Indigenous residents, such that renewed interferences and dispossessions may be authorized at policy convenience.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This is an interview with Catriona Sandilands, an environmental literary critic and ecocultural scholar whose work brings together questions of ecology, gender and sexuality, and multispecies biopolitics. She coined the term queer ecologies to describe and intervene in the manifold intersections running between sexuality, nature, and power in contemporary ecological conversations. The concept has made a powerful contribution to feminist and queer environmental scholarship, and to the larger environmental humanities. An intuitive gardener as well as plant scholar, she writes about plants in a unique way that pairs wonder about botanical materiality and evolutionary history with a concern about the biopolitical mechanisms that govern both vegetal and other, nonhuman and human, forms of life. Cate is a Professor of Environmental Studies at York University in Ontario, Canada. She is the author of The Good-Natured Feminist: Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy (1999) as well as over 80 essays, reviews, journal articles, and chapters in edited collections. She edited, with Bruce Erickson, the much-celebrated scholarly volume Queer Ecologies: Sex, Nature, Politics, Desire (2010); her edited collection of creative writing Rising Tides: Reflections for Climate Changing Times will be published in September, 2019. Marianna Szczygielska and Olga Cielemęcka caught up with Cate on Galiano Island, BC, to discuss the recent vegetal turn in the humanities, feminist commitments to critical plant studies, and the lessons to be learned from paying close attention to the plants around us.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cindy Patton is Professor Emeritus of Sociology and Anthropology at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. An early AIDS activist in Boston, she holds a PhD in Communications from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. After inaugurating her academic career at Temple University (Rhetoric and Community) and Emory University (Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts), she accepted a Canada Research Chair in Community, Culture and Health at Simon Fraser (2003-15). In that capacity, she worked with more than two dozen groups to develop small community-driven projects related to HIV/AIDS, housing, social welfare, mental health, while achieving, culminating in the creation of the Community Health Online Digital Research Resource, a catalogued, open-access, full-text collection of the materials from those groups (www.chodarr.org). Her academic publications span the social study of medicine, especially AIDS; social movement theory; gender studies; and media studies. She is the coeditor of Queer Diasporas (2000) and a special issue of Cultural Studies on Pierre Bourdieu (2003). She is the author of such works as Globalizing AIDS (2002), Cinematic Identity: Anatomy of a Problem Film (1997), Fatal Advice: How Safe-Sex Education Went Wrong (1996), Inventing AIDS (1990), and LA Plays Itself/Boys in the Sand: A Queer Film Classic (2014).\nTaken collectively, Patton’s scholarship and activism has laid the foundation for insights in the health humanities, particularly AIDS studies, that consider the inextricable connections between epidemiology and ideology. Patton’s theorizations of stigma and discrimination patterns, her deconstruction of “truth” discourses subtending science, her critical re-evaluations of axioms associated with risk, safe sex, community, and knowledge production have been crucial interventions in the understanding of health and illness as cultural and discursive scripts. Among Patton’s most enduring contributions has been her theorization of how “African AIDS” was invented and circulated—that is, the notion of geographically bifurcated HIV pandemics split by the essential linkage between Africa and blackness generally with pathogenesis. Equally influential has been her elaboration of the insurgent queer research practices that fused with antiracist struggle to combat this split. \nIn the interview below, Travis Alexander and Nishant Shahani engage Patton in a discussion on a range of topics—from (dis)continuities between the HIV/AIDS and COVID pandemics to the role of queer activism in forging epidemiological counter-publics and the geopolitics of medical bureaucracy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What are the advantages of a concrete, embodied relationship between human subjects and their non-human objects of care for the veterinary process of knowledge production? The scientific reductionism that frames formal studies makes much of the knowledge gained in those studies questionable or severely limited, since many important factors of real life illnesses and their causation and cure are excluded from consideration for the sake of clinical control and traditional scientific objectivity. This essay narrates my experience with my mare Lilly who suffered from a rare auto-immune disease; at the same time, it describes and analyzes the history and strategies of the world's largest internet-based equine patient advocacy network on metabolic illness, a network that supported my journey of knowledge acquisition and contribution, through our case history, to a larger alternative veterinary cause of knowledge production. Located between Feminist Science Studies and Critical Animal Studies, this project explores the notion of touch and raises questions about the biomedical field's present-day heavy reliance on visual diagnostics. What is the relation between visual technologies and the detached, disembodied knowledge \"from nowhere\" that conventional science believes in? How much of the alternative to this way of knowing lies in touch, embodied assistance, relationality, and intuition?And finally, in observing and documenting the relationship at the heart of this venture around knowledge, my essay also suggest that this is a queer project where queerness is understood as the careful but radical reconfiguration of kinship in the context of Haraway’s recent call to “make kin, not babies.” </jats:p>",

In addition, the specific domain helps us see this category of technology anew, illuminating its taken-for-granted assumptions.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>People living with food allergies in the United States use a variety of strategies to ensure that their food and homes are clean, free of allergens, and therefore safe for their specific needs. Yet the pursuit of purity is not merely a practical or material matter, but a semiotic one as well, and it is shaped by histories of race, gender, class, and family structure in the United States. I call this material-semiotic configuration of purity the hygienic sublime. The hygienic sublime relies upon and reproduces social norms and hierarchies concerning gendered labor in the home, racialized expectations of who can be considered pure, class anxieties expressed through aspirational consumption, and normative family structure. Written against the backdrop of resurgent debates concerning sexual, national, and personal purity in the second decade of the 21st century, this paper demonstrates the broader historical and political stakes of purity politics, especially when they are centered around caretaking activities in the private space of the home.</jats:p>",

This manifesto calls attention to the powerful, messy, non-innocent, contradictory, and nevertheless crucial work of what we name as “crip technoscience,” practices of critique, alteration, and reinvention of our material-discursive world. Disabled people are experts and designers of everyday life. But we also harness technoscience for political action, refusing to comply with demands to cure, fix, or eliminate disability. Attentive to the intersectional workings of power and privilege, we agitate against independence and productivity as requirements for existence. Instead, we center technoscientific activism and critical design practices that foster disability justice.</jats:p>",

In doing so, we suggest that debates over Y chromosome degeneration involve a form of abduction – tacking back and forth between different pasts, presents, futures – that frames templates for producing and securing sexed and gendered presents. Here we are using ‘sexed’ as a way of talking about physical bodies and ‘gendered’ as social ways of constructing those sexed bodies. We suggest that arguments over Y chromosome degeneration are as important for current debates surrounding sex, gender, science, molecular biology and a “crisis of masculinity” as they are for (ascertaining) the future of human evolution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper incorporates and reflects on Steinberg’s particular vantage as a dying person whose blog engages the transforming ecologies of mourning and the place(s) of dying in the emergent spaces of social media. The paper homes in on the distinction between the repudiation of death and the repudiation of mourning in the collective project of “re-imagining without oneself,” that is, of re-imagining another life, another death, beyond the liberal coordinates of a “you” and a “me.” As an “intermediating” place, we argue that the blog serves as a virtual portal that both problematizes and (re)mediates the personal and the political. In so doing, the paper touches on key feminist political questions concerning bodily self-sovereignty; the broader racialized, classed, and gendered cultural imaginary; and the place of mourning in the analogy of the personal body in crisis with the myriad crises of the body politic at this significant and difficult cultural moment. Particularly, with the outcomes of Brexit and the Trump victory in the American election, this is a time of loss as the complex consensus of liberal democracy has broken down and neoliberal body-affective practices morph into isolationist nationalisms and the resurgence of movements against social justice and equality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tampon-associated toxic shock syndrome (TSS) has disproportionately affected women, and specifically, menstruators.  By 1980, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that women limit their use of superabsorbent tampons since the risk for TSS increased with greater levels of absorption.  However, women had no way of following this advice since products did not have consistent absorbency labels.  A standard to set absorptive capacity as well as nomenclature was required, and the consensus process to do so was governed by ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials).  Esther Rome from the Boston Women's Health Book Collective participated as a consumer representative, and solicited feminist scientist Nancy Reame to help generate data on their behalf.  Importantly, they rejected the use of blue saline and \"blue goo\" as a menstrual fluid in the syngyna—the synthetic vagina simulacrum lab instrument—to test tampon absorbency, and insisted upon heparinized blood instead.  They challenged the process by which a standard is established, the method by which variables are controlled, and the erasure of menstrual fluid from tests about tampon absorbency. The feminist science yielded both usable and valid outcomes, with results that challenged the design of the experiment upon which standards were to be based. </jats:p>",

Through a parodic rewrite of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate scenarios, I challenge the rise of geoengineering technologies as a mitigation \"solution\" for the current ecological crisis. Showing that the IPCC is offering capitalocentric visions of ecological futurity and more-than-human economies that contribute to mainstreaming dangerous, hubristic geoengineering, I advance that feminist imagination and conviviality is a more capacious way to face climate change, one that climatology would benefit learning from. I do this drawing from Isabelle Stengers’ conceptualization of stupidity, which I argue can describe the IPCC’s futurology, and from her figuration of the idiot, a conceptual character who poses questions that cause us to pause and think, opening up possibilities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This Special Section broadens and qualifies the terms through which the relationship between home and militarization has been understood. We do this by joining a vibrant and growing field of transdisciplinary scholars who address the militarization of everyday life by attending to domesticity and practices of domestication. We grapple with how the home naturalizes and becomes a catalyst for militarism:  How do ordinary and domestic objects, technologies, spaces, and infrastructures make violence feel at home in the world? We are concerned with the domestic life of militarization as oikos: the household, habitat, and milieu of violent material relationships that are both ongoing and latent. The domestic is not just a discrete, private space; it also extends into public spaces like neighborhoods, local businesses, waste disposal infrastructures, hospices, and crop fields. Developed within an editorial process rooted in a feminist ethos, the articles collected here provide critical and alternative methodologies and disciplinary forms for considering militarism's aesthetics, affects, and modes of appearance. This collection resists conventional spatialities, temporalities, and incarnations of war while calling attention to the obscuring of violence through practices of care and marketing operations.</jats:p>",

This essay draws on new materialism and feminist theories of nature, embodiment and technology in order to analyze the disabled cyborg body as an epistemic site of feminist science. In particular, I analyze my own experience of adopting and using networked technologies—specifically, an insulin pump and glucose monitor--to manage Type 1 diabetes and the kinds of scientific practices that I engage in on a daily basis. These technologies and practices deserve attention in terms of what they can teach us about common discourses around science, innovation and infrastructure and, ultimately, about ourselves. </jats:p>",

Lived experience with borderline personality disorder often involves long and repeated periods of suicidal ideation and self- harm, yet these experiences are often misunderstood and framed in  ways that invalidate emotional distress.  The author outlines the ways in which vulnerability as method and radical acceptance of emotional contagion (Brennan, 2004) can foster 'differential responsiveness' (Barad, 2007; 2014) to marks on bodies and allow for the emergence of 'borderline narratives' to emerge and intervene within expert knowledge systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In May 2019 the photographic cellphone application Snapchat released two company-generated image filters that were officially dubbed “My Twin” and “My Other Twin,” though users and media labeled them as feminine and masculine, respectively. While touted in most commentary as a “gender swap” feature, these digital imaginaries represent a unique opportunity to consider what features contribute to classification of faces into binary gender buckets. After all, the commonly considered “male” filter makes various modifications—including a broader jaw and addition of facial hair—to whichever face is selected in the photograph. It does not ask and cannot detect if that face belongs to a man or woman (cis- or transgender) or to a non-binary individual. Instead, the augmented reality that it offers is a preprogrammed algorithmic reinscription of reductive gendered norms. When interacting with a novel face, humans similarly implement algorithms to assign a gender to that face. The Snapchat “My Twin” filters—which are not neutral, but rather human-designed—offer an analyzable projection of one such binarization, which is otherwise rarely articulated or visually recreated. Here I pair an ethnographic exploration of twenty-eight transgender, non-binary, and/or gender diverse individuals’ embodied experiences of facial gender legibility throughout life and with digital distortion, with a quantitative analysis of the “My Twin” filter facial distortions, to better understand the role of technology in reimaginations of who and what we see in the mirror.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Ladybugs: The (Natural) Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend? Enlisting Ladybugs into the War on Insect Pests",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Gardeners around the United States often call in reinforcements for pest control—ladybugs. Ladybug sellers claim that in contrast to chemical pesticides, ladybugs are natural, but the reality is more complicated. Conscripting ladybugs into the war on insect pests at home in the garden is a continuation, not a departure, from the long history of militarized pest control in the US. This trajectory was not inevitable. The divergent discussions and management of the convergent ladybug and the harlequin ladybug reveal a tension. Similar to the other lifeforms that traveled from Asia to the US, the harlequin ladybug is not merely unacknowledged as an effective garden predator but is instead blamed for a wide range of ills. And the longer the harlequin ladybug is around, the less clear it is who the enemy really was, as in modern war. Militarized pest control practices and imaginations have framed insects as both enemy and soldier in the garden, but there are other possibilities beyond seeing ladybugs as good and bad, natural enemy or just enemy.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For ages, science has told divisive stories about the world, especially along racial lines: who is more human; who is fit to rule; who matters. And yet, science continues to enchant us, sustaining wonder within its mission to help us grasp and put into words the unknown. This review essay follows how three recent monographs that straddle STS and Black studies seize upon this seeming contradiction. I argue that they do so by cataloguing the elements of science’s stories: genres, beginnings, plotlines, grammars, characters, and endings. In so doing, these texts not only diagnose scientific racism, but they offer a horizon for telling different scientific stories. They gesture toward a science that reveals new arrangements of the physical world already in front of us. With their focus on relationality, insistent that the story of science entails humanity’s entwined and plural stories, these texts offer lucid and captivating templates for pursuing a decolonial study of science freed from differentiation, classification, opposition, and the hierarchies they architect.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Military Utopias of Mind and Machine",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The central locus of my study is southern California, at the nexus of the Hollywood entertainment industry, the rapidly growing game design world, and military training medical R&amp;D. My research focuses on the rise of military utopic visions of mind that involve the creation of virtual worlds and hyper-real simulations in military psychiatry. In this paper, I employ ethnography to examine a broader turn to the senses within military psychology and psychiatry that involve changes in the ways some are coming to understand war trauma, PTSD, and what is now being called \"psychological resilience.\" In the article, I critique assumptions that are made when what is being called \"a sense of presence\" and \"immersion\" are given privileged attention in military therapeutic contexts, diminishing the subjectivity of soldiers and reducing meaning to biometric readings on the surface of the body. I argue that the military's recent preoccupation with that which can be described as \"immersive\" and possessing a sense of presence signals a concentrated effort aimed at what might be described as a colonization of the senses – a digital Manifest Destiny that envisions the mind as capital, a condition I am calling military utopias of mind and machine. Military utopias of mind and machine aspire to have all the warfare without the trauma by instrumentalizing the senses within a closed system. In the paper, I argue that such utopias of control and containment are fragile and volatile fantasies that suffer from the potential repudiation of their very aims. I turn to storytelling, listening, and conversations as avenues towards healing, allowing people to ascribe meaning to difficult life experiences, affirm social relationships, and escape containment within a closed language system.  </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The participation of women in the landscape of warfare is increasingly visible; nowhere is this more evident than in the US military’s global endeavors.  The US military’s reliance on cultural intelligence in its conceptualization of engagement strategies has resulted in the articulation of specific gendered roles in warfare. Women are thought to be particularly well suited to non-violent tactile engagements with civilians in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan because of gender segregation in public and private spaces.  Women in the military have consequently been able to argue for recognition of their combat service by framing this work in the war zone as work only women can do.  Women reporters have been able to develop profiles as media producers, commentators, and experts on foreign policy, women, and the military by producing intimate stories about the lives of civilians only they can access.  The work soldiers and reporters do is located in the warzone, but in the realms of the domestic and social, in the periods between bursts of violent engagement.  These women are deployed as mediators between civilian populations in Afghanistan and Iraq and occupying forces for different but related purposes.  Soldiers do the auxiliary work of combat in these encounters, reporters produce knowledge that undergirds the military project.  Their work in combat zones emphasizes the interpersonal and relational as forms of tactile engagement.  In these roles, they are also often mediating between the “temporary” infrastructure of the war zone and occupation, and the “permanent” infrastructure of nation state, local government, and community.  The work women do as soldiers and reporters operates effectively with the narrative of militarism as a means for liberating women, reinforcing the perception of the military as an institution that is increasingly progressive in its attitudes towards membership, and in its military strategies.  When US military strategy focuses on cultural practice in Arab and Muslim societies, commanders operationalize women soldiers in the tactics of militarism, the liberation of Muslim women becomes central in news and governmental discourses alike, and the notion of “feminism” is drawn into the project of US militarism in Afghanistan and Iraq in complex ways that elucidate how gender, equality, and difference, can be deployed in service of warfare.</jats:p>",

Amidst the enthusiasm, longstanding problems with ways in which research data in Nairobi is conceived, collected, and shared are easily glossed over. This article advances thinking about the politics of qualitative data, unraveling normative concepts like ethics and transparency by both examining existing data practices and modeling alternatives. I describe the sociotechnical infrastructure underlying the ethnographic project, detailing tactics for deploying an instance of open source software—the Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE)—to draw research interlocutors into collaborative effort to understand and build decolonized qualitative data infrastructures. Through such processes I learned that collaborating on data not only refreshes the social contract of qualitative work; it can also enhance its robustness and validity. I advise scholars to better document our own knowing practices in order to attend to the inevitability of margins created through all data practices, including our own</jats:p>",

This critical commentary considers how this scholarship extends environmental justice research on pollution. We are concerned with two key questions: How can we do/design ethical research with chemicals? And, what methods allow for researching chemicals without resorting to an imagined space of purity? We consider unfolding projects which reorient relations with chemicals from villainous objects with violent effects, to chemical kin. We imagine chemical kinship as a concept, an analytical tool, and a mode of relating. Emerging through feminist and anticolonial work with chemicals, it involves a tentativeness towards making normative claims about chemicals because, like kin, these materials are never entirely good nor bad, at once they can both be enabling and harmful. This commentary considers what the unfolding research with chemicals generates, and consolidates conceptualisations of chemical kinship; we ultimately articulate an agenda for ethical research with chemicals as an experimental process of invention.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this introduction to the special section “Computing in/from the South,” we position the South as a method to change dominant frames about the past, present, and future of computing. We discuss three narratives frames—developmentalist, postcolonial, and decolonial—to trace a significant body of thinking on computing otherwise. We argue that each of these frames provides a different optic to emphasize the contributions of non-Western, feminist, and queer epistemologies to computing worlds. Rather than thinking of these co-constructions as replacing one another linearly, we argue that they each create a different kind of relation among computing’s spaces and places, its pasts and its futures. These relations, and the switches between them, comprise what we describe as computing in/from the South as both an empirical and a methodological framework. The introduction first centers developments in computing worlds that are taking place outside centers of power. Based on an analysis of these developments, we then move beyond the limited twinned frames of exploitation and resistance to unpack the relational, political, and affective undercurrents that run through data-driven worlds from perspectives in and through the South.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Virgin birth is a common theme in religious myths, science fiction, lesbian and feminist imaginaries, and sensational news stories. Virgin birth enters a laboratory setting through biologists’ use of the term parthenogenesis (Greek for virgin birth) to describe various forms of development without sperm. Scientific consensus holds that viable mammalian parthenogenesis is impossible; that is, mammalian embryos require both a maternal and a paternal contribution to develop completely. This essay investigates the historical development of that consensus and the evolving scientific language of parthenogenesis after the birth of Kaguya, a mouse with two mothers and no father. I qualitatively analyze 202 scientific publications that cite the Kaguya experiment and find unconventional interpretations of sex and parenthood, even in publications that maintain the impossibility of mammalian parthenogenesis. Though many scientists insist that males are necessary, they also describe eggs as paternal, embryos as sperm-free, and bimaternal sexual reproduction as something distinct from parthenogenesis. I argue that the scientific language used to explain the Kaguya experiment both supports a heteronormative reproductive status quo and simultaneously challenges it, offering bimaternal sexual reproduction as a feasible alternative.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article considers wide-ranging heart-centered approaches to understanding bodies, objects, and personhood. It puts these into in tension with other ways of approaching questions of life and embodiment, especially ones inspired by neuroscience, to argue that thinking with the heart has value for feminist theory. The heart that is my object traverses scale, and the paper’s analysis moves from the inside out – from heart cells, to hearts and circulatory systems, to women interpellated into heart health, to public debates on personhood that mobilize fetal heartbeats and contested cases of women on life support. I draw on biological and lay ways of understanding the heart, and on mundane intimacy of knowledge of the heartbeat as a sign of life and personhood. Articulating the body through the heart provides opportunities to theorize the body and the object in new ways, pushing back against rhizomic and egalitarian aspirations and toward nuanced accounts of power. The engagement with the heart is speculative and wide-ranging, a provocation for feminist theorists to think with the heart.</jats:p>",

In contrast, by examining interviews with feminists and pro-choice people about their recent abortions (n=27) and my own experiences as an abortion counselor, I find that no singular “abortion” exists; rather, there are many embodied abortions. I discuss how participants negotiate medical and natural ideologies, arguing that these ideologies produce the conditions under which people come to experience abortion in the United States. I also discuss the material consequences of defining abortion as a standard event. I find that universalizing abortion leads to the underrepresentation of marginalized stories, a lack of personalized support, and racialized and classed disparities in who can achieve their desired biosocial state (“normal” or “natural”). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This photographic essay explores experiential meanings of haunting in deceased organ transplantation. Where life is often figured as presence and death as absence, this piece delves into how one may be both dead and alive, present and absent. In so doing, it creates space for how death may be vitality and how afterlives continue in the form of collective being. The photographic essay, as a genre, is examined as a turning towards the more-than-one in the self and death as constitutive of life. Photography becomes one way to foreground haunting as both material presence and visual absence. In turn, double exposure opens up the possibility of deceased donor presence and absence in the form of disappearing bodies, body doublings, two beings in and of the self, and ecologies in and of bodies. Haunting – through the technique of double exposure and this uncertain meeting of language and images – creates the possibility of giving visual presence to the dead in the self, to deceased organ donors in transplanted bodies. In so doing, the essay suggests that haunting is integral to the experience of transplantation, to transplant temporalities, where pasts are unknowable and lived, and futures are simultaneously foreclosed and yet to be realized.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I argue that “seeing with sound\" is a fraught political process with the potential to both obfuscate and assist Indigenous claims to land. I do so by analyzing the Portland District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ 2007 sonar images of Celilo Falls on the Columbia River. I take up feminist materialist analytics developed by Native American and Indigenous Studies scholarship on cartography and refusal, and place them in conversation with the sonic geographies of Columbia River Indigenous writers. Namely, I use Elizabeth Woody’s poem Waterways Endeavor to Translate Silence from Currents (1994) to investigate how overlapping and conflicting deployments of sonic imaging play a major cultural, political, and material role in the (re)mapping of Celilo Falls. First, I present a theoretical framework that considers the role of what I call sonic knowledges in unsettling colonial visual cartographies. I use archival Army Corps’ maps and critical sonar studies literature to show how the Army Crops’ 2007 riverbed sonograms emerge from a longer context of US settler practices of enclosing land with maps and surveying water with sound. I then turn to a close reading of newspaper articles and state legislation to analyze how the sonograms take on a present political life in ways that repackage ocularcentrism and assuage settler guilt, thus authorizing ongoing US enclosure of Indigenous lands. Yet, I also bring to bear Indigenous sonic knowledges that position imaging processes as potentially antithetical to addressing questions of access to land and self-determination. Through examining newspaper interviews, public testimonies, and Elizabeth Woody’s poem, I elucidate deployments of sonic knowledge that can help us think about what anti-colonial (re)mapping practices demand of contemporary cartographic imaging processes. Attending to sonic knowledges under conditions of settler-ocularcentrism, I suggest, might assist anti-colonial feminist science studies engagements with processes of imag(in)ing Indigenous space.</jats:p>",

The article argues that understanding such phenomena requires developing methodologies that engage fields of knowledge production that appear unrelated. The article uses the dynamics of temporality and belonging underlying population genetics as a case study. I show how two seemingly incompatible fields of knowledge production – queer theorization of temporality and population genetic technologies and practices – can together engender new insights on the ways in which temporality and belonging organize population genetic knowledge. I argue that neither field of knowledge production could achieve such insight alone; instead, insight emerges from the unexpected resonances as well as friction between the two fields. I develop this argument through an analysis of the configurations of temporality and belonging on the Genographic Project website.</jats:p>",

Instead of simply expanding the framework of neoliberal subject to the question of health and the phenomenon of tracking and sharing data of “smog jog” in the Chinese context, this article addresses the following two inter-related questions: (1) how might an investigation of the practices of self-tracking “smog jog” in the context of postsocialist china afford a reconsideration of health; (2) how might an examination of the ways in which health is interpreted, performed and negotiated through practices of monitoring, measuring and recording a jog and the air quality in postsocialist China rework the conception of self-tracking. This article examines posts on Sina Weibo, which is one of the most popular social media platforms in China, in which Weibo users record and describe their jog in the smog. It argues that the configuration and performance of health and the embodied self-tracking subjects are multiple, and are informed by, negotiated with and find expressions in the environment in postsocialist China.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines universities’ adoption of WellTrack—a self-tracking mobile phone application modeled on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques—as a solution to reported increases in the prevalence and severity of student mental health conditions. Drawing from a feminist materialist perspective that understands discourse and the material word as co-produced, this article argues that the app’s design, marketing, and reception are deeply intertwined with the political rationality of neoliberalism, which centers self-responsibility and the market economy. The article first situates the development of the WellTrack app within larger institutional and political shifts towards digital education governance. It then contextualizes the app’s use within the history of college mental health services in the United States, revealing how longstanding socio-medical discourses concerning student wellness individualize structural and systemic factors of ill health. Through close reading and immanent critique of the marketing and media reception of the WellTrack app’s introduction into universities, the article provides an account of how universities are socializing students to relinquish data to private firms in exchange for health services. Students are encouraged to engage in constant self-examination and strive towards a vision of student wellness that precludes an analysis of the structural conditions and intersecting oppressions contributing to poor student mental health. These conditions are social and pervasive, requiring institutional analysis and critique of the university itself.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Author order is crucial; it is the currency of academia. Within STEM disciplines, women and junior researchers--those who are the primary constituents of our lab-- consistently receive less credit for equal work. Our Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR) is a feminist marine science laboratory at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Recognizing that the stakes are high for CLEAR members, we have developed an approach to author order that emphasizes process and equity rather than system and equality. Our process is premised on: 1) deciding author order vy consensus; 2) valuing care work and other forms of labour that are usually left out of scientific value systems; and 3) taking intersectional social standing into account.  Although CLEAR’s approach differs from others’, we take author order seriously as a compromised but dominant structure within science we must contend with. That is, rather than attempt to circumvent author order, we stay with the trouble. This article outlines this process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article traces different devices and practices (i.e., ultrasound scan, fine needle aspiration and breast examination) involved in the clinical diagnostic practices for breast cancer and suggests that they might be productively considered as “visualization apparatuses.” Drawing on auto-ethnographic data and medical literature, it explores how these apparatuses make visible and help materialize a particular bodily configuration (e.g., a simple cyst as a benign breast disorder). In examining side by side the practices and devices commonly characterized as medical imaging such as ultrasonography and the more mundane apparatuses such as syringes or trained eyes and fingers, the article draws attention to the non-given nature of image and imaging, and to the equally non-given nature of the distinctions between vision, touch and hearing as modes of sensing and knowing. In doing so, it seeks to problematize the traditional partitioning of experience into separate and separable perceptual and epistemological modalities, while at the same time reclaiming vision, touch and hearing as metaphors for responsible and accountable knowledge-making. Bringing together feminist (Haraway, 1988; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2009; Barad, 2007; 2012) and post-phenomenological (Ihde, 2007; Ingold, 2000) work on knowledge-making and perception with the concept of synesthesia (Harris, 2016; Hayward, 2010; Marks, 2002), it argues for a certain knowledge politics beyond “sense atomism,” which helps us to rethink not only the apparent distinction in the different sensorial universes but also, more broadly, the questions of knowledge, politics, responsibility and accountability.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Body armor is no longer limited to war and security-oriented occupations. Bulletproof fashion for civilians has joined a domestic “secret arsenal” of sorts, as families with concerns about security acquire technologies to protect body, property, and household members. Bulletproof fashion thrives in the context of fear and anxiety, helps normalize the proliferation of guns and gun violence in US society, and encourages the privatization of what should be regarded as a social problem.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract: The 2013 sequencing of the epigenome and genome from Henrietta Lacks’s HeLa cell line illuminates the bioethical intersections of genomics, race, and gender. Subsequent announcements by Francis Collins and reports in the scientific media referring to Henrietta Lacks as a matriarch, expose the missing political and resource allocations alluded to by the quasi-viral matriarchal designation, an assemblage I term Bioethical Matriarchy. Drawing from field, media, biomedical archival research, I am concerned with the ways African-descent and matriarchal status reproduce the social order, reflecting racialized and gendered histories of kinship, desire, and status inequality. I address these concerns through an anthropological engagement with African American/Diaspora studies and Feminist technoscientific scholarship in both the social sciences and humanities. I build on Richard Hyland (2014), by arguing that unequal and gendered forms of exchange (re)produce wealth and obligations to give, but not necessarily to reciprocate. I discuss why the bioethical, intellectual property, and legal implications of these asymmetrical relationships necessarily take our discussion beyond issues of consent and inclusion to engaging larger questions of reparative and restorative justice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines digital labor and community through an ethnography of a discussion board supporting short-term digital contract workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). First, we give a thorough overview of mTurk, the crowdsourcing marketplace, and Turker Nation, a discussion board for workers on mTurk. We trace the experience of interacting with this infrastructure on mTurk as worker and employer. Following, we look at scholarship on software infrastructure and autonomous Marxist theorizations of contemporary work. We demonstrate how the labor of participating on the discussion board Turker Nation helps to counter the abstraction the infrastructure provides. We show how workers on Turker Nation use the platform to structure time, build socializing spaces at work and initiate collective organizing. In doing so, we argue that workers’ labor belies conventional class classification, such as white-collar and blue-collar labor and instead lays the groundwork for how to structure future digital workplaces. We argue that this laboring resists the assumed logic of capitalism for digital labor that subsumes and takes over workers’ lives and conclude by looking at the limitations of the community’s collective organizing in terms of agreeing on points to communicated to the public.</jats:p>",

Emerging from an ongoing research project that started during the global pandemic and grounded in ethics of care approaches, our project critically interrogates how such infrastructures not only create conditions for care but also reconfigure care itself to align with their underlying ideologies and discourses. Drawing on theories of care, particularly María Puig de la Bellacasa’s (2017) conceptualization of work-affect-politics, the article examines the politics and practices of care shaped by grant management infrastructures that underpin academic work. These infrastructures are framed as contexts where social actors and technological artifacts interweave into unified systems, and in the context of this article refer to the lived experiences of conducting research. Ultimately, the article argues that sociotechnical infrastructures function as “conditions of possibility” for care, and as indicative of the now-endemic ways that work-affect-politics is enmeshed in sociotechnical infrastructures.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The HeLa Bomb and the Science of Unveiling",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay reads the narratives of HeLa cell contamination as accusations of racial and gender passing. It argues that the passing narrative is much more complex, rarely confined to an individual’s autonomous will, and far more entrenched in state building and concepts of social progress than previously considered. I urge us to move away from the desire of the passing subject, and back to our own to ask after the sort of anxiety, excitement, and panic that animate our attempts to see, classify, and regulate bodies. Thus, what becomes significant is an examination of an “ethics of knowing” within science. The paper draws on a collection of correspondence, lab notes, published articles, and newspaper clippings related to Henrietta Lacks and HeLa from the George O. Gey Collection at the Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (1918-1974) and articles on HeLa published in scientific journals, science journalism, and cultural studies articles (1950-present). In doing so, it traces the narratives of science (and its complex of industries—journalism and cultural studies) and HeLa’s passing. Tracing the reactions to HeLa contamination, the paper asks after the ways national, racial, and sexual desire, fantasy, anxiety, and paranoia have animated the cells through time. Particularly it examines the agency of HeLa, a cell line that is passed through race and genders and ideas of mortality, as it makes clear its own vital, creative, and destructive forces.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Memes on Trial: From Permit Patty to Karen",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper articulates a theory of Black complaint by engaging feminist theories of complaint and Black critical theories of visuality. It focuses on the late 2010s viral video trend of alliteratively nicknamed White women (e.g., “Permit Patty,” “Cornerstore Caroline”) calling the police on Black people and the later Karen meme. Connecting these memes to Simone Browne’s (2015) concept of dark sousveillance, the paper shows that, rather than simply rendering Black people out of sight of the White gaze, the Karen and Permit Patty memes instead place Whiteness and White supremacy on trial by creating a visual archive that legitimizes the testimony of Black individuals living in a climate of anti-Blackness. This paper argues that these memes, viral videos, and the Black online counterpublics that circulate these images comprise an important register for Black grief and activism and suggest an alternative form for demanding redress for Black injury outside the American criminal justice system.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I argue for an antinormative bioethics based in disability experiences drawn from memoirists’ accounts of idiosyncratic needs and desires that are obscured by normative impulses in mainstream bioethics. Bioethics has long been shaped by a commitment to the normal, which often casts disabled people and the category of disability as anterior to bioethical concerns about individual rights, protections, and property. Focusing on disability experiences and the category of disability—as developed by disability studies scholars and supported by materialist feminist science and technology studies—provides a grounding for an inclusive bioethics that creates livable lives through careful and creative alliance building in and beyond the contexts in which bioethics has traditionally operated. I focus herein on the non-unitary experience of autism and the facilitation of people who identify as autistic to develop this inclusive and responsive bioethical praxis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, the feminist and postcolonial frameworks of distributed reproduction and frontstaging a chemical are used to further explore the concept of global fertility chains. In particular, these approaches are used to trace reproductive bioeconomies that are traveling at the molecular and physiological levels and that link the chemical compound methyl isocyanate (MIC) involved in the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy to the recent growth of reproductive technologies and surrogacy services in the very same city of Bhopal. The goal of this paper is to identify and contextualize the vertical and horizontal transmission of MIC-mediated chemical toxicity through different generations of human and nonhuman actors, and to understand how this toxicity connects to reproductive bioeconomies as we continue to map out global fertility chains and give particular importance to matters of place, scale, and biological borders. Distributed reproduction allows us to rethink the scope of reproduction and make legible the colonial infrastructures that support the molecular and physiological transmission of toxicities. Frontstaging the chemical MIC allows us to trace the specific pathways of colonial legacies that have assumed unfettered access to raw materials and biolabor extracted from the soil, plants, animals, and humans in Bhopal. The paper explores the role that the chemical MIC plays as a catalyst for the transplacental migration of biopolitics—thereby contributing to an extended appreciation of global fertility chains at new molecular and physiological scales.</jats:p>",

I consider what it means to be attached to a Science that earned its epistemic authority through its co-constitution with colonization and slavery. I argue that passion for science may act to strengthen the relationship between Science and Truth and conversely, willful refusal and failure may be used to break the bond.

This article focuses on the interrelatedness of vitality and death, and the nexus between biopolitics and necropolitics, through an analysis of adoption and surrogacy. It reinscribes the transnational circulation and exchange of persons, substance and bodily capacities within the logics of multiple genealogies of war, violence, and extraction in the globalized borderlands between Guatemala and Mexico. The article charts the simultaneous demise of transnational adoptions in Guatemala and growth in surrogacy arrangements in the southern Mexican state of Tabasco, as well as the inception of oocyte harvesting for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in reproductive medicine providers in Guatemala City. The article then tracks forms of expertise and technical infrastructure across national borders and domains of knowledge and practice. It shows the proximity between reproductive medicine and forensic science evident in DNA analysis used in forensic anthropology to document human rights violations, but also offered as commercial services in an expanding reproductive medicine sector. This configuration of biolabor encompasses the extractive practices tied to reproductive medicine and forensics, as persons, bodily substance, and, increasingly, bioinformation transverse contexts, jurisdictions, and social and racial formations.</jats:p>",

We suggest that there is a tendency for bot ethics to revolve around the desire to differentiate between bot and human, which does not address what we understand to be the cultural anxieties at stake in the blurring boundaries between human and technology. Here we take some tentative steps towards rethinking and reimagining bot-human relationships through a feminist ethics of responsibility as response by taking as our starting point our own experience with bot creation, the Twitter bot “Hello30762308.” The bot was designed to respond with a “hello” to other Twitter users’ #hello, but quickly went in directions not intended by its creators. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Window: Spatializing Occupation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this short intervention, I ask, What is at stake, politically and conceptually, in understanding militarism not as stable and unfolding similarly across geographies, but as deeply contingent on historical and contextual specificities? How might we then unpack the question of home becoming a catalyst of militarism? What constitutes home under saturated state control and occupation where militarism is neither subtle nor benign but enforced through violence? Emplacing the vignette of a window that came up during my ethnographic fieldwork in Srinagar, Kashmir, I reflect on the conditions of gendered vulnerability, fear, violence, and everyday negotiations of survival that become urgent concerns for people surviving a colonial occupation.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The uneven, sometimes violent relationship between “here” and “elsewhere” is evoked powerfully in Martha Rosler’s House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home—two linked sets of photomontages that engage the gender and racial politics of domesticity in the US as well as the geopolitics of empire. Troubling mythologies of warfare and documentary realism with dazzling wit and critical fury, these works refer materially and specifically to places and times of war in solidarity with protest movements while also raising questions of historical linkages and political accountability. Suturing their times and spaces into discontinuous contact, the two series bring together seemingly incommensurate elements—exquisite domestic interiors, glamorous consumer commodities often associated with conventional femininity, and the landscapes and bodies damaged and destroyed by warfare--to produce images of great immediacy and visceral power. Across the long arc of the wars waged by the US from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan, Rosler has shown us how the modernist aestheticization of US domesticity in the affluent post-World War II era promised personal empowerment and hopeful futures yet, emerging from warfare itself, only brought about more war.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2019 the US Department of Defense (DOD) published a report describing cyborg soldiers equipped with powerful implants, to be deployed by 2050. The DOD’s cyborg enables transhuman fantasies of controlling, augmenting, and weaponizing the body and the environment. The Cyborg Foundation, non-profit organization run by two artists, offers a different approach. These artists identify as cyborgs who aim to perceive the world differently, connect with nature, and expand normative human bodies and senses. In these human/machine fusions, and in cyborg theory, hybridity is an essential part of the cyborg’s appeal. Hybridity, however, can also reinforce binary oppositions or provide the veneer of choice under the mantle of self-regulation and governmentality. Calculated illegibility might afford a different vantage point into cyborg politics, negotiating the sites at which the body is identified and known, and the possibility for opacity, sousveillance, or subversive misrecognition. The Cyborg Foundation offers a useful illustration of calculated illegibility, a way of performing cyborg identity and embodiment that runs counter to traditional cyborg narratives. This article engages a close reading of the DOD report and the Cyborg Foundation, and an interview I conducted with one of the organization’s founders, Moon Ribas, to argue that illegibility better aligns with Donna Haraway’s call for a cyborg politics that disrupts and recodes the hegemonic communication systems and militarized control over the body and the planet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Autoimmunity often refers to a medical condition, yet it was used by Jacques Derrida to theorize the conflict between religion and science as well as Islam and the West. Derrida’s use of the term autoimmunity became widespread after he used it to diagnose the “American Organism” in the aftermath of the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11, 2001. Most commentary on Derrida’s political diagnosis have focused on his reading of Islam as an Other within the US body politic. This essay takes a different approach and reads Derrida’s diagnosis within the tradition of Islamic Medicine. If we are to truly rethink the othering of Islam as a viral autoimmune disease in the body politic of the US empire, we need to understand Islamic thought as forming the very basis of the West’s image of itself. I argue that Islam is far from a self-contained category opposing the West: a virus or a plague attacking it from the outside. Rather, Islam is the swallowed-within of the West itself, to which, the West continuously returns/reacts in an autoimmune fashion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Outdoor images predominate in our cultural conceptions of “air pollution” even though indoor air quality (IAQ) is typically tenfold more contaminated.   New modeling of LA smog in Science suggests that source emissions from indoor and personal care products contribute more to that city’s infamous poor air quality than vehicular combustion.  In similar paradox, even as outdoor smoke from California wildfires in 2017 pushed PM2.5 levels past red into unprecedented magenta alerts, children were sickened inside school classrooms after new carpets were laid.  This auto-ethnographic paper chronicles our ongoing struggle to remove those carpets from “Beacon” Elementary, a bilingual Mexican-American school in California's Central Valley that has suffered decades of racialized neglect of its facilities. Forging through the uncertain epidemiology of environmental illness, “Beacon” mothers began documenting their children’s ailments after the new carpet installation, but the school district dismissed the mothers' citizen science.  The Superintendent continued to vouch for the carpet’s safety based on the industry’s voluntary “Green Label.”  A historical section of this article therefore recounts how and why the carpet industry invented this label in the aftermath of a scandal in which new carpets sickened a fifth of the EPA workforce at their headquarters in Washington, DC between 1987 and 1988.  Thirty years later, once again, three California environmental regulatory agencies are scrutinizing the carpet industry for hazardous ingredients.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Home Drone: How to Militarize the Smart Home with the Ring Always Home Camera",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Amazon launched the Ring Always Home Camera with a promotional video featuring the mobile security drone flying into action to stop a home intruder. The addition of the domestic security drone into the housewife’s arsenal expands the everyday militarism of security subjectivity, even as it imagines a “better” domestic laborer—one trained not only to be watchful but also to patrol the home and protect property. The Ring Always Home Camera suggests that to be a good securitized citizen is to make the home transparent, not only to the optical eye of the drone’s camera but also to its machine vision navigation apparatus. Networked to Ring’s home security system, the depiction of the appliance in the video forwards a new corporate vision of domestic security—one that introduces networked aeriality, as well as militarized modes of perceiving and knowing into domestic space.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this essay, I engage the makings and evolution of queer Chicana theorist and feminist philosopher of science Gloria E. Anzaldúa’s generative engagements with Indigenous onto-epistemologies and syncretized spiritualities, as well as her (re)visionary disidentifications with the biosciences for matters of speculative visioning and social justice. Stitching together the rich insights of the fields of Chicanx/Latinx studies and queer feminist science and technology studies, I survey how Anzaldúa treads the boundaries between the humanities and biosciences as a means of complicating and rewriting new narratives of identity and belonging. Borrowing from the lexicon of the animal, plant, and other life sciences, Anzaldúa risks repurposing vexed evolutionary metaphors—namely, for the purposes of this essay, the “tree of life” image—to instantiate one part of what I call her “affiliative biofuturities.” Thinking from and through a border/nepantla space, Anzaldúa sifts through and remixes humanistic, scientific, esoteric, and spiritualized modes of inquiry to fashion alternative ways of knowing, seeing, and being in the world. Ultimately, I suggest that Anzaldúa’s Chicanafuturist œuvre radically reconceptualizes and expands our understanding of identity and our relationality to other beings/species while taking seriously the liberatory potentialities of “unruly” knowledge-making practices in times of socioecological crises.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Resumen\nActualmente, la observación y registro de las aves realizado por personas en todo el mundo suele asociarse con prácticas de ciencia ciudadana promovidas por distintas instancias que persiguen diferentes propósitos, casi siempre alineados con la identificación taxonómica y la producción de bases de datos mundiales sobre biodiversidad. Algunas de estas prácticas han sido cuestionadas por omitir las condiciones de vulnerabilidad ambiental y los vínculos entre humanos y más que humanos que dan lugar a estas observaciones, descontextualizando la información producida. En este trabajo propongo que las aves y las personas se constituyen en coagentes para la construcción de la frontera a través de un análisis de las prácticas de observación y documentación de aves realizadas por personas que viven en Ciudad Juárez, una metrópoli ubicada en la frontera norte de México, vulnerada por la contaminación industrial y el desecamiento del Río Bravo. Desde una perspectiva más que humana y en diálogo con estudios feministas de la ciencia, se muestra cómo las observaciones que realizan estas personas responden a intereses diversos, desde los científicos hasta aquellos relacionados con el reclamo ciudadano de contar con más espacios públicos, las prácticas artísticas y de denuncia por un entorno lastimado y vulnerado en ambos lados de la frontera. Se trata de prácticas que buscan poner atención en las distintas formas de vida que participan en la construcción de las ciudades y las fronteras e involucrarse con su cuidado.\nAbstract\nThe observation and recording of birds by people around the world are often linked to citizen science initiatives aimed at various goals, primarily focused on taxonomic identification and the creation of global biodiversity databases. However, some of these practices have faced criticism for ignoring the conditions of environmental vulnerability and the connections between humans and more-than-humans, which can lead to a decontextualization of the information produced. In this paper, I suggest that birds and people can be seen as co-agents in constructing the border, particularly through an analysis of bird observation and documentation practices by residents of Ciudad Juarez, a northern Mexican metropolis affected by industrial pollution and the depletion of the Rio Bravo. Adopting a more-than-human perspective and engaging with feminist science studies, I illustrate how these observations reflect various interests, ranging from scientific inquiry to community demands for more public spaces, artistic expressions, and advocacy for a healthier environment on both sides of the border. These practices emphasize the importance of acknowledging the diverse forms of life that contribute to the shaping of cities and borders, and they advocate for greater involvement in their care and protection.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Baked for Anzac Day in April but eaten all year, Anzac biscuits memorialize the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) participation in the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I. The chemical and culinary capacities of one of the biscuit’s key ingredients, golden syrup, offer strategies for figuring snaps, breaks, and refusals. Golden syrup catalyzes a feminist digestion of a food often perceived as culturally conservative or nationalistic. Sara Ahmed describes “feminist snap” as a moment of fury that confronts and changes history. Snap can additionally refer to crispy batter-based desserts that often call for golden syrup. Classified as an “invert syrup,” golden syrup was formulated from sugar refining waste products that were fed to pigs before being adapted for human consumption. “Invert” refers to the assessment of syrups using a beam of light, which inverts its angle of rotation as fructose and glucose separate. Reading the chemistry of inverting sugar alongside the feminist-led “anti-Anzac” day movement of the 1980s, this paper proposes that edible everyday militarisms might be snapped, inverted, spun, and reshaped. Anzac biscuits bring domestic everyday militarisms into Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand kitchens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil refineries and settler colonialism are not typically how feminist and environmental frameworks scope the problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Instead, it is much more common to find EDCs described as a problem of packaging, plastics, and consumer goods, and to characterize their effects as a problem of bodily damage, and particularly as injuries or alterations to the reproductive and sexual development of individuals. This paper seeks to disrupt these individualized, molecularized, damage-centered and body-centered frames, and to strengthen decolonial feminist frameworks for understanding EDCs. We contend that our understanding of EDCs must expand to the structures of settler colonialism and racial capitalism that accompany oil extraction and refining, as well as to the distribution of emissions to airs, waters and lands. Building on the argument that pollution is colonialism, we hold that EDCs are materially a form of colonial environmental violence, disrupting land/body relations, and at the same time, are made possible by a permission-to-pollute regulatory regime.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Incipient Infertility:  Tracking Eggs and Ovulation Across the Life Course",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tracking in/fertility—through ovulation biosensing, menstrual and perimenopausal apps, and ovarian reserve testing—is becoming increasingly commonplace amongst relatively privileged women in the Global North. Taking place on and through platforms comprised of devices, bodies, and discourses, such self-tracking articulates forms of in/fertility and reproductive futures that are, we argue, closely entwined with emerging forms of biomedical capitalization. While reproductive medicine focused on the creation of children has been entwined with corporate interests since the development of in vitro fertilization in the 1980s, fertility as an asset, or future value, is increasingly targeted by the new innovation sectors as a specific capacity, separable from reproduction per se, in which women should invest if they are not to fall prey to incipient infertility. Synthesizing our separate empirical work in this field, this paper theorizes the connections between the emergence of self-tracking logics and cultures, the burgeoning of consumer-oriented, clinical services, and contemporary social anxieties around fertility decline. Even in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom, where birth rates are stable, (some) women’s fertility is being refigured as precious and vulnerable, something to be tracked, documented, and attended to in the name of individual future happiness and fulfilment. Women with enough financial and cultural capital are encouraged to monitor their periods, come to know their ovulation patterns, and become aware of their ovarian reserve, and, importantly, to act prudently on such knowledge to safeguard their reproductive futures.</jats:p>",

Drawing from my five-week action research project, teaching and learning digital art making through digital game modifications, this paper explores the repeated moments of technological breakdowns, failures, and troubles during pedagogical practices through the metaphor of troubleshooting that guided how we framed and approached these troubles. Specifically, I argue that to troubleshoot is to standardize our situated contexts to universal terms, to engage in a relationship premised on the framework of control, and to invest in the temporal order of technological development as predetermined knowledge. As such, I foreground a desire for a different metaphor and turn towards the metaphor of troublecaring to speculate how to respond to the offers of inquiry made by these moments of technological breakdowns, failures, and troubles.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper incorporates and reflects on Steinberg’s particular vantage as a dying person whose blog engages the transforming ecologies of mourning and the place(s) of dying in the emergent spaces of social media. The paper homes in on the distinction between the repudiation of death and the repudiation of mourning in the collective project of “re-imagining without oneself,” that is, of re-imagining another life, another death, beyond the liberal coordinates of a “you” and a “me.” As an “intermediating” place, we argue that the blog serves as a virtual portal that both problematizes and (re)mediates the personal and the political. In so doing, the paper touches on key feminist political questions concerning bodily self-sovereignty; the broader racialized, classed, and gendered cultural imaginary; and the place of mourning in the analogy of the personal body in crisis with the myriad crises of the body politic at this significant and difficult cultural moment. Particularly, with the outcomes of Brexit and the Trump victory in the American election, this is a time of loss as the complex consensus of liberal democracy has broken down and neoliberal body-affective practices morph into isolationist nationalisms and the resurgence of movements against social justice and equality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the growing trend of mastectomy tattoos as an alternative to reconstruction and their implication on the (de)regulation of women's bodies in the digital context. I explore how tattoos are incorporated into a \"breast cancer culture\" (King, 2010) as a form of self-care in the recreation of areola pigmentation after breast reconstructive surgery and in cosmetic masking of post-operative mastectomy scars. I am concerned with how online discourses of tattooing practices are drawing women's bodies into an emergent 'biopolitics' (Foucault, 1990; Rose, 2001), a productive type of power concerned with the risk management of a 'biomedicalized subject' where women are encouraged to care for their health through informed decisions via online media (Pitts, 2004) and through consumption and beautification techniques in line with normative femininity (King, 2006). Yet, online media can potentially operate as a site for the creation of new publics wherein women can retell the stories of their bodies through new practices of inscription outside of medicalized and masculinist reconstruction narratives. I perform a discourse analysis of Canadian expert and popular discourses in health websites, plastic surgery and cosmetic service websites, tattoo parlour websites and in social media, including P.ink, (an organization that supports mastectomy tattoos). I argue that within digital media competing medical, pop cultural and feminist narratives intersect in ways that can contribute to an \"awkward feminist politics\" (Smith-Prei &amp; Stehle, 2016) where women's hybridized medical, digital, tattooed bodies can operate as material obstacles to normative correlations between health, femininity and sexuality.</jats:p>",

What role have the new virtual reality therapies that so resemble other forms of military simulation played in this reconfiguration? In this article, I draw upon feminist science and technology’s (STS) theorization of human-machine interaction into order to interrogate how contemporary therapies for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reconfigure agency in the practice of healing.  Analyzing trauma therapy as a site of reconfiguration, I show how new exposure-based therapies for PTSD—both with and without virtual reality—configure aspects of human subjectivity, such as memory, affect, and behavior, as objects for technological intervention. Through comparative analysis of different modalities of PTSD treatment, I show that the politics of therapy is especially enacted through the therapeutic remediation of trauma narratives: the mediational practices through which a traumatic memory is made available for therapeutic reworking. Therapeutic remediation practices configure therapists, patients, and nonhuman actants as subjects and objects with different forms of agency.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I argue that the Zora Neale Hurston’s early twentieth-century anthropological work and the Combahee River Collective’s 1977 Black Feminist Statement can be read as part of a genealogy of Black feminist empiricism: a minor empiricism that rejects positivist empiricism, strategically mobilizing dominant scientific practices while also developing an onto-espistemology specific to Black English and what Combahee terms “black women’s style.”  Their works make tactical use of positivist empirics to critique and counter legal and medico-scientific circumscription of Black women’s lives, while simultaneously participating in this counter-practice of Black feminist empiricism.  As both Combahee’s statement and Hurston’s first ethnography, Mules and Men (1935), reveal, Black feminist empiricism is grounded not in traditional scientific virtues such as transparency and objectivity, but instead in opacity and subjectivity, which make it unavailable for use for purposes of legal subjection, while simultaneously revealing the raced and gendered implications of a legal system dependent on positivist values.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, scientific knowledge, especially about the brain, has been leveraged within policies and programmes aimed at parents of infants and young children. However, the ways in which parents engage with (neuro)science, and how they value recommendations based on this vis-à-vis other forms of expertise, is not often examined. Drawing on 22 interviews, we present an analysis of how parents and care-givers in Scotland negotiated (neuroscientific) ideas about parenting that they encountered through one of two voluntary parenting programmes alongside broader advice they received (e.g., through books, friends, families). We examine how parents’ negotiations were related to particular configurations of the past and the future, and analyse how these temporal imaginaries help to justify accounts of parenting practices. Scientific knowledge encountered through parenting programmes was appreciated by many, but enjoinders based upon it were not wholeheartedly adopted. Importantly, constructions of possible futures (and pasts) contoured our participants’ engagements with advice and expertise. Consequently, we demonstrate that temporal imaginaries can play an important role in how parents’ reflexively develop and situate their own epistemologies of parenting.</jats:p>",

This article uses case studies to profile four women living with metastatic breast cancer who turn to social media to tell their stories: Sally, a former civil rights attorney turned breast cancer activist, who uses social media platforms to organize and mobilize Stage IV patients to advocate on their own behalf; Jane, who plows through databases of dense medical research to find treatments to save her own life; Jenny, a young mother dying of metastatic breast cancer who shares her experiences on a YouTube channel; and Grace, who participates in an early-stage clinical trial that she believes “cured” her, a term eschewed by both the medical establishment and fellow metavivors.</jats:p>",

    "title": "From Mother/Fetus to Holobiont(s): A Material Feminist Ontology of the Pregnant Body",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Across scientific, medical, legal, political, popular, and religious discourses, the “mother” and the “fetus” are regarded as being separated by a physical boundary. Time and time again, feminist theorists have proposed ways to disband the mother/fetus division derived from Cartesian self/other binarism and individualism. The goal of this article is to introduce and explore an alternative ontology of the pregnant body I call the motherfetus. I follow material feminist Karen Barad (2007) in contending that the “fetus” does not preexist as an object with a distinct agency who interacts with the “mother,” but only materializes through what Barad calls intra-action. I argue that the pregnant body can be reconfigured in such a way that the material distinction between the “mother” and the “fetus” disappears. This endeavor entails re-interpreting material “evidences” provided by twenty-first century technosciences while mobilizing the motherfetus as an apparatus of bodily production. Through a lens that insists on rejecting the genetic, immunological, anatomical, and physiological separation of the “mother” and “fetus,” this article will borrow elements from immunology, microchimerism, and the human microbiome to generate multiple incarnations of the motherfetus as a material-discursive product. In the conclusion, I will examine how the motherfetus as a feminist theory can alter the ways in which the pregnant body is dealt with in feminist activisms as well as in scientific studies and medical practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the figuration of the home automation device Amazon Echo and its digital assistant Alexa. While most readings of gender and digital assistants choose to foreground the figure of the housewife, I argue that Alexa is instead figured on domestic servants. I examine commercials, Amazon customer reviews, and reviews from tech commentators to make the case that the Echo is modeled on an idealized image of domestic service. It is my contention that this vision functions in various ways to reproduce a relation between device/user that mimics the relation between servant/master in nineteenth- and twentieth-century American homes. Significantly, however, the Echo departs from this historical parallel through its aesthetic coding as a native-speaking, educated, white woman. This aestheticization is problematic insofar as it decontextualizes and depoliticizes the historic reality of domestic service. Further, this figuration misrepresents the direction of power between user and devices in a way that makes contending with issues such as surveillance and digital labor increasingly difficult.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers the ways in which silences and absences are a central part of research that relies on automated data collection from social media or the internet. In recent years, automated data collection driven or supported research methods have gained popularity within the social sciences and humanities. With this increase in popularity, it becomes ever more pertinent to consider how to engage with digital data, and how both engagement and data are situated, messy, and contingent. Based on experiences with “missing” data, this paper mobilizes the framework of hauntology to make sense of what relationships may be built with missing data and how silences haunt research practices. Ultimately, we argue that it is possible to reimagine absent data not as a limitation but as an invitation to reflect on and establish new methods for working with automated data collections.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper, positioned at the intersection of anthropology, science and technology studies, and feminist affect theory, considers shifts in memory and neurological disturbances that accompany traumatic brain injuries. Anomia, or anomic aphasia, is the inability to recall certain words, names, or colors caused by damage to the parietal or temporal lobes in the brain. Anomia is a disorder ‘on the verge’ – there but not quite, a forgotten memory, reluctant to be conjured. How might experimental ethnographic memoir help us uncover such forgotten memories and make sense of neurological disturbances pathologized by science and medicine? My account contributes to a growing body of literature that uses ethnographic memoir as political critique, blending the personal and theoretical, situating the intimate within larger historical and social contexts. It suggests that ethnographic memoir, with attention to the affective interiority of memories, merged with theoretical analyses and political critiques of medicine and/or therapeutic interventions, offer new understandings of being and temporality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), conventionally known as Teflon, has remarkable properties: it doesn’t combine with oxygen; no solvent can corrode it; it doesn’t conduct electricity; and it is among the slipperiest substances on earth. Although it is most widely known as a non-stick coating for pots and pans, one of the first applications of the polymer was for seals and gaskets of the separation process of uranium hexafluoride that was key to developing the nuclear bomb. These lesser-known military applications of Teflon are, I argue, part of the slippage from the military to the household. Employing the slipperiness of Teflon as both a quality of its materiality and a provocative concept, this paper will explore how Teflon moved from the large-scale catastrophic fallout of the Manhattan Project to the slow dispersion of everyday toxicity in the home.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

Starting from the two activist campsites set up in Seoul and the historical backgrounds of occupational health movement, I draw on two documentary films, The Empire of Shame (2014) and Factory Complex (2015), that depict workers who became ill and those who died due to toxic exposure at semiconductor manufacturing plants. Beyond commemoration, necro-activism emerges in the form of persistent involvements of dead bodies, mourning, and objects representing death as important agents for making claims for justice. Taking into account political and historical differences of locations in which disabled people are positioned differently in the global order redirects us from the language of worth toward sociality, collective reframing of suffering and disability, and justice as an ongoing practice of everyday life and afterlife.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Declaración del artista: A diferencia de la concepción más tradicional de la fotografía como práctica de extrañamiento y construcción de otros fotográficos, mi interés como artista visual está marcada por procesos de empatía y reconocimiento. Esto supone asumirme como parte de lo que mira y es mirado, en una suerte de efecto espejo que trasciende la mera curiosidad antropológica para abrazar, en cambio, el acto gozoso de participación colectiva y la mirada voyeur. Pero esta mirada no es una mirada universalista o atemporal, sino la mirada de una artista mujer en una de las ciudades más grandes del mundo, la Ciudad de México. Habitar el lugar del voyeur en espacios donde la mirada hegemónica es masculina supone cambiar de posición para ser, por un lado, la artista que mira desde el anonimato, y por el otro, la que experimenta con la imagen fija y la imagen en movimiento, en un impulso constante por registrar los vestigios de la urbe. Es así que concibo mi mirada detenida a través del lente de una cámara como un acto semejante al de mirarse en un espejo. Me miro, reconozco y diferencio en otros y otras. Para luego poder mostrar la imposibilidad de todos esos intentos, con elementos fundamentales como el tiempo, ya sea en video, instalaciones fotogénicas o la poesía.\nEste tipo de mirada es una intervención radical en un país como México donde las relaciones sociales se encuentran sujetas y determinadas por roles de género y de clase; donde la invisibilización de los individuos es un elemento de control. Me interesa incidir en las artes visuales de las Américas desde planteamientos fotográficos en clave expandida, nuevos formatos, soportes y soluciones expositivas, pero desde un situacionismo social, epistémico y creativo. A lo largo de 10 series y dos libros, he construido a la Ciudad de México como escenario de la mirada y al mismo tiempo, como un personaje más que determina el transitar de sus habitantes.\nPara más información sobre la obra de Nirvana Paz, visite: www.nirvanapaz.com\nArtist statement: Unlike the more traditional conception of photography as a practice of estrangement and the construction of photographic others, my interest as a visual artist is marked by processes of empathy and recognition. This involves acknowledging myself as part of what sees and is seen, in a sort of mirror effect that transcends mere anthropological curiosity to embrace, instead, the joyful act of collective participation and voyeuristic observation. However, this gaze is neither universalist nor timeless; it is the gaze of a woman artist in one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City. To inhabit the voyeur’s perspective in spaces where the hegemonic gaze is masculine implies shifting positions—to be, on one hand, the artist who observes from anonymity, and on the other, the one who experiments with still and moving images, driven by a constant impulse to document the vestiges of the urban landscape. Thus, I conceive of my gaze through the camera lens as an act akin to looking into a mirror. I see myself, recognize, and differentiate myself in others. Then, I aim to reveal the impossibility of all those attempts, using fundamental elements such as time, whether through video, photogenic installations, or poetry.\nThis kind of gaze represents a radical intervention in a country like Mexico, where social relationships are subject to and shaped by gender and class roles, where the invisibilization of individuals serves as a form of control. I am interested in influencing the visual arts of the Americas through expanded photographic approaches, new formats, media, and exhibition solutions, but always from a social, epistemic, and creative situational perspective. Across 10 series and two books, I have constructed Mexico City as both the stage for the gaze and a character itself, shaping the journey of its inhabitants.\nFor more about Nirvana Paz's work, please visit: www.nirvanapaz.com\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article takes up shifting meanings of the population sex ratio in select times and places. Through historicization and contextual analysis, I seek to identify possible origins and continuities of the gendered imperial and racialized logics that undergird current dilemmas for feminists related to the sex ratio. I argue that sex ratios, like other numerical abstractions that stand in as representations of empirical reality, are tricky tools for addressing social problems. Regardless of whether they are viewed primarily as natural, biological, cultural, racial, or even social, they have been both friend and foe to feminist struggle. Feminists might invest in interpretations of the ratio as a mutable, social indicator of the status of women and girls in need of improvement. Yet this idea runs the risk of misappropriation and conflation with diehard interpretations of sex ratios that reproduce hierarchy based on race/ethnicity and nationality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data-driven environmental governance within the standard regulatory regime routinely relies on unmeasurable, missing, or abjected data. Technocrats typically use data surrogates to alleviate this pervasive problem. By combining feminist technoscience and critical environmental justice approaches, this article argues that data surrogates are far more than fungible substitutes and rely on more than scientific rationality and transcendent objectivity. Through a case of intersecting environmental governance and justice work in the Portside Community in San Diego, this article exposits a broader conceptualization of data surrogates by developing a partial typology of operations they perform: calibrating, weighting, and validating. The politics and labors of these operations are crucial to analyze how data acquire material and discursive power in environmental governance. I propose an analytical shift from examining the work of data surrogates in terms of substituting to one of hosting. This shift reveals and better explains how data surrogates negotiate relationships between body, place, and property across state, market, and civil society actors. Moreover, it demonstrates how data surrogates interrupt the dominant regulatory regime by resisting fungibility through acts of social reproduction. Far from being subordinate to technocratic tools, the work of social reproduction makes governing with scientific and technical instruments both possible and contestable.\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For many cosmopolitan urban Germans and Europeans in Berlin in the late 2000s, social media platforms were a site where gender and class were enacted through articulations of emergent nerd masculinity or hip, ironic femininity. But these platforms, such as Facebook or Pinterest, encoded normative assumptions about masculinity and femininity in their visual and interaction design, excluding women and acceptable femininity as subjects of technological expertise. Sites that presented themselves as neutral spaces for connection and interaction, like Twitter or Facebook, instantiated gendered understandings of technology that rendered public space implicitly masculine, white, and middle class. Visually based sites like Pinterest and Etsy, in contrast, were marked as domains of feminine domesticity, representing not only a shift to visual communication but to visual modes of interaction that structured gender online. Although many young people resisted hegemonic notions of gender, their social media practices stabilized their class status as aspiring urban cosmopolitans. In this article, I consider how gender and class stabilized temporarily through material-semiotic engagements with technology interfaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a speculative mapping exercise as a feminist resistance method with the aim of rendering surveillance technologies and their fields of view visible. The focus is on the North Avenue Smart Corridor, located in Atlanta, Georgia, which is one of the world's top ten most surveilled cities. Through the design of these speculative maps, I question our relationship with surveillance. More specifically, I show that unnoticeable materiality and invisible processes of smart surveillance technologies prevent the public from forming an opinion on their intrusion into daily life. Acceptance of these technologies allows powerholders to protect and enhance their power over marginalized communities. Therefore, by mapping the intensity of surveillance, this study aims to raise awareness against the lure of technocracy in so-called smart cities. It situates the reader in the position of surveillance sensors and allows the reader to speculate on what they can see. In doing so, it seeks to highlight the oppressive agency of these technologies and question their appeal to objectivity with the potential to disrupt their patriarchal powers. Can we free ourselves from the oppressive gaze of smart surveillance by mapping, seeing, and understanding its remarkably limited fields of view?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Building on a rich body of feminist scholarship on estrogen, this account interrogates how potent estrogenic cosmetics and consumer product labels emerged together, through the regulatory practices of scientists and lawyers, in mid-century Canada. Composed from archival and other primary sources, the story traces the development of Canada’s first cosmetic regulations – which applied only to cosmetic products containing estrogens. In 1944, “sex hormones” had been the first substances for which the Department of National Health and Welfare adopted labels in lieu of dose or potency standards under the Food and Drugs Act. With dose-response thresholds thus written out of the Sex Hormone Regulations, in 1949, regulators devised a new type of consumer product label that warned women to use estrogenic cosmetic products “with care”. Further regulatory amendments in 1950 appeared, on their face, to require positive proof of safety for estrogenic cosmetics, However, through varied administrative and enforcement practices that hinged upon “directions for use” in product labels, National Health officials quietly reintroduced dose-response logics back into estrogen regulation. As legal technologies for disciplining women consumers to regulate their own exposures, product labels were becoming instrumental. With labeling, estrogen catalyzed an early example of risk regulation in Canada.</jats:p>",

My claim is that heart transplantation in particular marks a fluid assemblage and intertwining of self and other at both the biological and ontological level, where personal identities and the conventional limits of life and death are deeply problematized.  Nonetheless, those disturbing and inescapable challenges to conventional binaries are rarely explored within the authorized narrative of the clinic.  \n </jats:p>",

For more than three decades, misoprostol has enabled activists to accompany and facilitate self-managed abortions safely in settings where access is restricted. In Argentina, where abortion was legalized in 2021, misoprostol has been harnessed by feminist activists not only as a pharmaceutical technology, but also, as I argue here, a biopolitical one fostering a distinctly feminist “biopolitics from below” (Biehl 2016). Building on an analysis of informative and narrative materials publicized by activist groups, I trace the affective mechanisms by which feminist activists contest hegemonic subjectivities. I focus on feminist knowledge productions about misoprostol and the affective paradigms made possible through them to suggest that its pharmaceutical properties have enabled activist practices that link the commanding of scientific knowledge to the production of political knowledges. Through these practices, feminist activists have turned misoprostol into a technology for shaping counter-hegemonic subjectivities as embodied, affective, and relational.</jats:p>",

Simultaneously, biotechnological advances have led to the increasing availability of pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT), which enables the (de-)selection of embryos following in vitro fertilization and prior to implantation. This paper uses the patent debates as an opening through which to examine the nexus of patent law, technoscientific capitalism, and reproductive genetic technologies—specifically, a form of pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT-M) that identifies specific genetic sequences that contribute to disease. Using feminist science studies and reproductive justice frameworks, I argue that the gendered imaginary of “high-risk” investment and health risk management, coupled with the privatization of biomaterial disproportionately produced by women, may exacerbate racial and economic inequities in access to reproductive healthcare.</jats:p>",

We argue towards a theory of BFHSS that builds on social justice science, which has as its focus the health and well-being of marginalized groups. We would like to move towards a social justice science that understands the health and well-being of people to be its central purpose. This formulation of BFHSS provides evidence of the co-constitutive nature of medical science and popular perception, underscoring the need to engage them simultaneously. Health is both a desired state of being and a social construct necessary of interrogation because of the ways that race, gender, able bodiedness, and other aspects of cultural production profoundly shape our notions of what is healthy (Metzl &amp; Kirkland, 2010).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This contribution to the “Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” intimately explores the domestication of toxicity through two pieces of material culture: a Bracero Program (1942–1964) identification card and a residential gardening business card. Both cards belonged to my father. I use these cards to tell how my father’s access to the domestic space of the nation’s agriculture fields and into the domestic exterior space of people’s gardens in Southern California was predicated on his availability to chemical exposure as a racialized body. In the wake of my father’s death from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, both images have been reworked and reimagined with a ghostly imprint of a saturating but barely visible history of toxic exposure. I have reworked each card by adding the chemical compounds for DDT and glyphosate. This entry seeks to query how the domestication of war and toxicity accumulates more for certain bodies and how these histories of exposure might also be reworked to imagine otherwise foreclosed forms of sociality and memory.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Feminist Crops: A More-than-Human Concept for Advancing Feminist Crop Breeding for Development",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Gender matters in agriculture, and crop breeding teams are increasingly being asked to develop plant varieties that respond to the needs and preferences of men and women. Achieving gender-responsive crop breeding requires communication and cooperation across disciplines, not least between crop breeders and gender specialists. The coming together of plant sciences and gender studies necessitates novel ideas, concepts, and approaches that unite nature with culture and the material with the social. However, the development of such approaches is still in its infancy. Empirically grounded in experiences in and observations of social and natural scientists working at the intersection of gender and crop breeding in an African context, this article contributes to filling this gap by proposing the concept of the “feminist crop.” The feminist crop captures the entanglement of crops with women’s embodied practices, knowledges, capabilities, and power, and contributes to an ethico-onto-epistemological and methodological investigation of how intersectional gender identities and relations are embedded in plant–people entanglements. Using examples from banana, yam, and cassava, I explore how the feminist crop can expand the boundaries of how we think about agency, power, and empowerment in agriculture, as well as how plant genome editing grounded in the feminist crop concept may be used as a feminist tool to entangle plants and people in more socially just ways. Ultimately then, the feminist crop contributes to advancing feminist crop breeding.</jats:p>",

More specifically, it narrates the making and happenings of what we call a queer synthetic curriculum in an early childhood centre. Drawing attention to plastic in order to reframe children’s relationship to it, the article engages with three main questions: How might we refashion waste practices from children’s ubiquitous plastic relations? How might we speculate on the kinds of response-able worlds that might be remade through new kinds of interactions between child and plastic bodies? What might the Chthulucene synthetic futures of early education entail? The queer synthetic curriculum also experiments with creative strategies to learn to live with plastic toxicities without necessarily celebrating them; it embraces the mixed affects that plastic affords (its sensorial pleasures and possibilities as well as the guilt embedded in their toxicity); it plays with the provocative idea that we can no longer separate our fleshy human bodies from synthetic polymer bodies; and it treats plastic as chthonic queer matter. We argue that, by staying with the trouble these risky attachments bring, conditions for futures other than those already determined by synthetic, toxic petrocapitalist modernity and coloniality might emerge in early childhood education.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tracking in/fertility—through ovulation biosensing, menstrual and perimenopausal apps, and ovarian reserve testing—is becoming increasingly commonplace amongst relatively privileged women in the Global North. Taking place on and through platforms comprised of devices, bodies, and discourses, such self-tracking articulates forms of in/fertility and reproductive futures that are, we argue, closely entwined with emerging forms of biomedical capitalization. While reproductive medicine focused on the creation of children has been entwined with corporate interests since the development of in vitro fertilization in the 1980s, fertility as an asset, or future value, is increasingly targeted by the new innovation sectors as a specific capacity, separable from reproduction per se, in which women should invest if they are not to fall prey to incipient infertility. Synthesizing our separate empirical work in this field, this paper theorizes the connections between the emergence of self-tracking logics and cultures, the burgeoning of consumer-oriented, clinical services, and contemporary social anxieties around fertility decline. Even in countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom, where birth rates are stable, (some) women’s fertility is being refigured as precious and vulnerable, something to be tracked, documented, and attended to in the name of individual future happiness and fulfilment. Women with enough financial and cultural capital are encouraged to monitor their periods, come to know their ovulation patterns, and become aware of their ovarian reserve, and, importantly, to act prudently on such knowledge to safeguard their reproductive futures.</jats:p>",

Our scientific understanding of mushrooms and other fungi have been shaped and indeed impeded by mycophobia, a condition of fear and revulsion that we compare here to queerphobia. In this work, we argue that mycology relies upon queer methodologies for knowledge acquisition given both the nonbinary, cryptic, and subversive biological nature of fungi as well as society’s determination that fungi are perverse and unworthy of formal investigation. We further argue that the queer methodologies of mycology that developed in response to these conditions have enhanced rather than hindered our knowledge of fungi. Because our ultimate quest as scientists is the pursuit of “truth,” as best as can determine, we suggest that Science as a culture would do well to meaningfully reconcile with the inescapable and oftentimes queer reality of bias and subjectivity.</jats:p>",

Given these knowledge and research gaps, this paper investigates how sanctuaries develop medical knowledge about chickens, focusing on hens bred for egg production. I develop the concept of “witnessing” as it has been used in science studies, feminist theory, and animal activism, arguing that sanctuary science and medicine can be understood as queer witnessing. Then, I discuss how sanctuaries put queer witnessing into practice, through aspirational archiving, transposition, and reorienting health. Though queer witnessing has its limits and problems, it offers a way of doing activist science, at sanctuaries and beyond.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay, co-written by three art and technology humanities scholars from standpoints of autoimmune experience, takes up the longstanding critique of historical self/non-self models of the immune system to introduce a discussion about biopsychosocial and political affect in autoimmune experience of the 2020s. They argue that an ethos of tolerance and intolerance, long operative in biopolitical strategies of state power (Brown 2009), continues to factor into newer 21st century models of autoimmunity as biopsychosocial, ecological, distributed, and networked response. Drawing provisionally on the danger model (Matzinger 1994), which posits that immune responses are triggered by the perception of threat and not by the presence of “foreign” entities, the authors highlight the kernel of negative political affect in the signaling of danger. Drawing on the work of Silvan S. Tomkins, they describe, theorize, and interpret the role of sustained negative affect signaling, specifically (d)anger, distress, and disgust, in their own respective autoimmune experiences, which they describe as unfolding in achronic time (Freeman 2010, 126). It is proposed that closer scrutiny is needed for the negative affects that shape the infrastructure of (in)tolerance and care that gives life to autoimmune symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment experience in the 2020s, an era in which post-Covid autoimmune conditions unfold achronically in ongoing Covid-19 pandemic time.        </jats:p>",

Specifically, I show how the open sharing of patient stories in social media, blogs, and other public domains collides with privacy regulations and normative assumptions in the US health care system that prevent integration of those stories into electronic health record (EHR) systems. I argue that publicly told stories based on personal experiences of illness are valuable sources of health care information in part because they are subjective, richly detailed, and open ended. Yet, precisely because of their public nature, these patient stories are unprotected sources of data that are barred from integration into health care data ecologies where clinical action takes place. Consequently, an impermeable barrier exists between the officially sanctioned accounts in the clinical record and the contextual richness of patient stories on the social web. The tensions between these two approaches to narrative and data create an opening for exploitative digital profiling practices that can ─ and already do ─ harm patients. Examples are drawn from Hugo Campos and Medtronic, PatientsLikeMe, Apple Health Records, Google Health, Microsoft Health Vault, IBM Watson Health, and OpenNotes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Borders are complex configurations intertwined with political regimes, ecosystems, flows of bodies, objects, technologies, and affects. Feminist STS, with its attention to infrastructure and its intimacies, more-than-human relationalities, and investigative aesthetics, is ripe for a re-engagement with contemporary securitized borders and their lifeworlds. Using a mix of Spanish and English, we perform and theorize the importance of pocho linguistic third spaces for feminist community and offer practical tools for reading beyond English to frame the Spanish-language contributions in this Special Section. We ask how we can “know borders” otherwise and offer three emergent paths of reflexive engagement: Materialidades: Intimate Infrastructures, Ecologías: More-than-Human Migrations and Ecologies of Care, and Estéticas: The Research-Creation Nexus. After a curated review of the literature on borders and migration in the United States and Mexico, we suggest the analytic power of these lenses to nurture feminist attention to both the vibrancy and violences of contemporary borders and foster a grounded and generative politics of care and solidarity.\nResumen\nLas fronteras son configuraciones complejas entrelazadas con regímenes políticos, ecosistemas y flujos de cuerpos, tecnologías y afectos. Los estudios feministas de la ciencia, con su atención puesta en la infraestructura y sus intimidades, las relaciones más-que-humanas y las estéticas investigativas, están maduros para un nuevo compromiso con las fronteras contemporáneas securitizadas y sus mundos de vida y muerte. Transitando entre el español y el inglés, y habitando lo que llamamos aquí un espacio de práctica pocho, exploramos y teorizamos sobre las posibilidades de los terceros espacios lingüísticos para la comunidad feminista y ofrecemos herramientas prácticas para leer más allá de los marcos interpretativos anglosajones hegemónicos. En esta sección especial abordamos la cuestión de cómo “conocer las fronteras” de otro modo, y ofrecemos tres vías emergentes de compromiso reflexivo: Materialidades: Infraestructuras íntimas, ecologías: Migraciones más que humanas y ecologías del cuidado, y estéticas: El nexo entre investigación y creación. Tras llevar a cabo una revisión cuidadosa de las literaturas sobre fronteras y migración en los Estados Unidos y México, sugerimos el poder analítico de estos lentes para nutrir la atención feminista tanto a las violencias como a la vitalidad y las potencias que se despliegan en las fronteras contemporáneas, abogando por una política situada de la solidaridad y el cuidado. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 has been a crisis represented and interpreted through models. Models are metaphors that illustrate one phenomenon in and through another that is better understood or seemingly more transparent. In this article, we consider digitally driven COVID-19 models that draw on the certainty of data from smartphones and social networks to make predictions about a poorly understood virus. Network data normally used to model information spread drive models of an actually existing biological virus. A return to HIV network models of the 1980s helps map the social implications of this latest turn to modeling. These earlier models were used to hone stigmatizing viral metaphors about behavior, risk, and exposure, in the shadow of an emerging digital culture. Thinking across COVID-19 and HIV modeling demonstrates how models can support personal responsibilization, be used to blame “bad” actors, and justify the creep of new surveillance practices under the rubric of “Data for Good” programs. Drawing on critical HIV and queer studies, we argue that the people and behaviors that are opaque to viral models and their methods of capture present potential avenues for speaking back to digital virality’s terms. We highlight these exceptions, which show how certain lives make trouble for models and their sensibilities, telling of queer forms of life, desire, and contact that evade modeling altogether.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This piece interrogates anti-Black racism and coloniality in global health reporting on antibiotic use in Africa. I focus on New York Times discourse, imagery, and films, reading these intertextually with wider political and public health rhetoric. In critically attending to mediated imaginaries of Nairobi, Kenya as “unhygienic,” I demonstrate how this figuration comes to index local pharmaceutical practices that appear “non-Scientific.” The situated knowledge informing such practices is disregarded or, worse, presented as a threat to be targeted and eliminated. Such biomedical transgressions are indexed in the NYT by racialized references to waste, dirt, and excrement, turning the (structurally white) reader-viewer into what I call a shit voyeur. Building on Sylvia Wynter’s conceptualization of Man, I argue that Man-the-shit voyeur disregards his own culpability in rising antimicrobial resistance, locating health risks instead in the contaminating nature of Others. This racialized grammar is further subtended by the logic of the spherical—the illusion that the world-as-sphere is a totality that Man can perceive with a unidirectional gaze. Global health reporting that is racialized via the logics of the spherical and shit voyeurism not only fails to accurately represent medical concerns in Africa but also perpetuates biomedical hegemony and/as global white supremacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article locates an alternate paradigm of hacking in feminist cyberfiction, notably, James Tiptree, Jr.’s proto-cyberpunk novella, “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” (1973). I argue this story critically reorients our understanding of how information technologies and their material artifacts construct and reinforce norms of able-bodiedness and ability. Drawing on archival materials from Bell System, early information theory, and crip theory, my reading reveals that Tiptree’s portrayal of disability is tied to a cybernetic conception of error and noise. These frictions between users and their machine interfaces materialize unexamined performances of critical labor and noncompliance that I link to the emerging field of crip technoscience. Tracking these disruptions in cybernetic feedback across “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” and in historical accounts of the telephone switchboard operator, I show that error and noise underpin an early example of a feminist hacking ethos, and also crip accounts of electronic disembodiment often imputed to information society and cyberpunk fiction.</jats:p>",

Two trends within the online pornography industry came immediately to mind. The first is the aesthetic of “white innocence” as sexual fantasy that reveals a cultural conversation between the mainstream gay pornography industry and white nationalism in the United States. The second is the emergence of affiliate networks that aim to curate content for “unique male viewers” because the internet is, curiously, awash in “female-focused” content. Both of these phenomena seem particularly relevant at a time when white fragility, toxic masculinity, “men’s rights,” and xenophobia have been given explicit approval by the newly elected U.S. President, Donald Trump. These forces have long defined the United States, but they also reveal the way in which this presidency is uniquely awful and dangerous.  </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Stroke is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects African Americans. In a 2009 PSA campaign, the American Stroke Association’s Stroke’s No Joke campaign collaborated with African American stand-up comedians to promote symptom recognition and discourage delays in care seeking among African Americans. Rather than frankly articulating their disproportionate incidence of and death from stroke, however, this campaign hailed African Americans and their stroke risk using an overly broad construction of blackness. This article joins the others in this special feature in examining how blackness becomes an object of knowledge production in medicine by considering how stroke risk becomes racially and culturally coded.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As data-driven technologies and business models pervade on a global scale, China’s enormous digital economy often signals its dominating power by dint of data extraction. Complicating this view, this critical commentary focuses on knowledge production, an important dimension for examining the ways in which postsocialist China transpires in global political economy in the age of Big Data analytics. First, I show how Chinese commercial surveillance analytics profits from legitimation lent by the West-centric hierarchical academe. Then, I move to transnational academic repurposing of Big Data from China, which becomes increasingly common. Such social research tends to yield specters of China that are untethered to the lived realities of those whose data are taken. Drawing on decolonial thinking and feminist care ethics, this commentary concludes by urging social scientists to “stay with the trouble,” making China “legible” in their computing of Chinese Big Data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Metaphors are critical sites of analysis for feminist scholars of science and technology because of what they both conceal and divulge about the conditions of their historical emergence and the persistence of those conditions. As researchers and editors, we find ourselves oriented to work that takes up the task of contesting uncontested metaphors, considering how metaphor “invades” (Tuck &amp; Yang 2012, 3) and evacuates meaning. This Special Section carries on the dynamic practice in feminist STS of taking the work, and ambivalent potentiality, of metaphor seriously. In this Introduction, we draw together scholarship that informs what we identify as the \"metaphor-work\" of feminist STS—the work of allegory, myth, metaphor, figurative and associative discourse, and their analysis—as central to the methods by which we make and remake meanings that matter to feminist technocultures. Throughout the metaphor-work collected here, the contributors propose that paradigm change comes through the collective refusal of some metaphors, through the re-evaluation of others, and the introduction of new metaphorical frames and figures to reorient our work.\n </jats:p>",

I study the bio-politics of the recasting of Kew’s role as arbiter of colonial botanical knowledge to keeper of botanical futures through seed banking. While the MSBP is a part of Kew’s vision to stay at the cutting edge of conservation and environmental governance, its relationship to colonial botany and political economy must also be interrogated in the light of its legacy. I revivify the origin story of the MSBP to show how Kew Gardens’ long tradition of plant extraction, accumulation, and exchange, as well as nationalist zeal motivated by the potential loss of ‘native species,’ were integral to the ‘rebranding’ of Kew as the MSBP.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the growing trend of mastectomy tattoos as an alternative to reconstruction and their implication on the (de)regulation of women's bodies in the digital context. I explore how tattoos are incorporated into a \"breast cancer culture\" (King, 2010) as a form of self-care in the recreation of areola pigmentation after breast reconstructive surgery and in cosmetic masking of post-operative mastectomy scars. I am concerned with how online discourses of tattooing practices are drawing women's bodies into an emergent 'biopolitics' (Foucault, 1990; Rose, 2001), a productive type of power concerned with the risk management of a 'biomedicalized subject' where women are encouraged to care for their health through informed decisions via online media (Pitts, 2004) and through consumption and beautification techniques in line with normative femininity (King, 2006). Yet, online media can potentially operate as a site for the creation of new publics wherein women can retell the stories of their bodies through new practices of inscription outside of medicalized and masculinist reconstruction narratives. I perform a discourse analysis of Canadian expert and popular discourses in health websites, plastic surgery and cosmetic service websites, tattoo parlour websites and in social media, including P.ink, (an organization that supports mastectomy tattoos). I argue that within digital media competing medical, pop cultural and feminist narratives intersect in ways that can contribute to an \"awkward feminist politics\" (Smith-Prei &amp; Stehle, 2016) where women's hybridized medical, digital, tattooed bodies can operate as material obstacles to normative correlations between health, femininity and sexuality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, I discuss the embodied labor of policing child pornography through the ways in which algorithms and human reviewers like Linda see abuse images. I employ the concept of “apprehension” to suggest that the ways that reviewers “see” child pornography is always already oriented toward the capture and arrest of suspected offenders. As I have argued elsewhere (Author 2017; Forthcoming), the use of new digital techniques to find child pornography has fundamentally transformed and expanded policing into a distributed network of labor increasingly done by computer scientists and technology companies. Rather than suggest new software is the cause of these transformations, I draw attention to the constitutive and mutually defining relation between computing and corporeality, or how image detection algorithms need the work of human perception to put their detective skills to work.            I argue further still that the case study of child pornography detection offers an entry point into examining the algorithmic management of race. I suggest that childhood innocence is coded as whiteness, and whiteness as innocence, in the algorithmic detection of victims and abusers. By taking ‘detection’ as a dynamic practice between human and machine, I make an intervention into critical algorithm studies that have tended to focus solely on the programming of racial bias into software. The algorithmic detection of child pornography hinges, crucially, upon practice and the tacit observation of human reviewers, whose instinctual feelings about child protection and offender apprehension become embedded within the reviewing and reporting process as cases escalate for law enforcement.</jats:p>",

This article uses case studies to profile four women living with metastatic breast cancer who turn to social media to tell their stories: Sally, a former civil rights attorney turned breast cancer activist, who uses social media platforms to organize and mobilize Stage IV patients to advocate on their own behalf; Jane, who plows through databases of dense medical research to find treatments to save her own life; Jenny, a young mother dying of metastatic breast cancer who shares her experiences on a YouTube channel; and Grace, who participates in an early-stage clinical trial that she believes “cured” her, a term eschewed by both the medical establishment and fellow metavivors.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The article argues that transnational adoption and surrogacy from South Korea and India are shaped through US and British imperial and colonial histories in Korea and India respectively. We focus on the reproductive labor of “native companions” in early British India and kijich’on (camptown) women in post–World War II Korea. The management of native women’s sexuality was crucial for maintaining social order, political stability, and for consolidating capitalism through the commodification and devaluation of colonized reproductive labor. The configuration of historical legacies is unpacked through the idea of coloniality, the constitutive dark side of modernity, which reproduces subalternity and exploitation of racialized bodies. The reproductive labour of Korean birth mothers and Indian surrogate mothers is formed and shaped by the colonial and imperial formations of gender, sexuality, kinship and family, in which white supremacy and exploitation of Indian and Korean women was at the core. We argue that these formations are re-configured in the present through three mechanisms that enable contemporary practices of adoption and surrogacy: the transformation of waste into profit, the erasure of non-white mothers, and the trope of the white savior.</jats:p>",

As a group of theorist-practitioners, the contributors to the Lab Meeting share an interest in bridging the conceptual and material via a scrappy mode of making and inquiry that does not seek to remediate chaos but rather engage it, in all its complexities.

Together, they offer insights into the liberatory promise of material engagements.</jats:p>",

With these experiments, I ask, how might material bias inform ongoing analysis of cultural bias within machine learning systems?

Upon examination, we see that some reasons behind this perceived failure are due to institutional systems of power that seek to neutralize transformative feminist pedagogy as performative repair, resulting in the maintenance of existing curricula. Instead of fully engaging with transformative pedagogies, these teaching and learning methods are used as tools to provide a cursory fulfillment of the deep need for social justice education in games. We examine the ways in which structures and systems continually devalue and de-resource pedagogical work, specifically pedagogies that are centered in feminist, anti-racist, and critical approaches, as well as our own complicity within these oppressive structures at times. We draw connections with relevant disciplinary perspectives on higher education, and conclude by offering a framework for understanding the pitfalls that can hamper work with transformative pedagogical aims, characterized by the types of labor used to maintain the status quo, as well as a set of recommendations for moving beyond the frame of repair to sustainably and radically disrupt dominant pedagogies in games and related disciplines.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Misogynoir describes the co-constitutive, anti-Black, and misogynistic racism directed at Black women, particularly in visual and digital culture (Bailey, 2010). The term is a combination of misogyny, the hatred of women, and noir, which means black but also carries film and media connotations. It is the particular amalgamation of anti-Black racism and misogyny in popular media and culture that targets Black trans and cis women. Representational images contribute to negative societal perceptions about Black women, which can precipitate racist gendered violence that harms health and can even result in death. As philosopher Linda Alcoff asserts, racism depends on perceptible difference to determine which bodies are expendable, and in this cultural moment of Black hypervisibility, Black women are particularly vulnerable (Philosophy). I use two culture examples to explore the real life impact of misogynoir in medical media. I explore the ways in which the biomedical knowledge produced by physicians reinforces certain bodies as normal and others as pathological. The case of Caster Semenya as well as the trial of R&amp;B star R. Kelly, allow me to introduce Black feminist health science studies as a critical intervention into current medical curriculum reform conversations.</jats:p>",

Through a series of vignettes illustrating violent experiences of “inclusion,” I explore how the institution is reproduced in neoliberal constructions of inclusion, liberation, and justice. I then integrate critiques of liberation within neoliberal frames with crip imaginings of justice-in-relation to explicate how fractal mechanics can be understood not only as a method of oppression but also a method for revolution. I close with a series of imaginaries that encourage us to prefigure, or dream, a fractal politic of intercommunal connection.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article focuses on the scientific and political transformations that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to engender through its impact on the epistemological and ontological foundations of autoimmunity. By discussing an online seminar taught during the COVID pandemic winter of 2020–21, the article considers how the viral autoimmunities involved in severe and long-haul COVID pathogenic mechanisms have fostered transformative pedagogical and therapeutic experiences, spaces, and events. As a highly contagious viral disease, COVID highlights disparities in access to healthcare, whereby certain (racialized, disabled, ageing) bodies are unequally burdened with the labor of staying alive. Predicated on a foundational separation between inside and outside, or between the internal, vulnerable, visceral space of the individual(ized) “human” body and an external(ized), hazardous, contaminated, foreign environment, COVID measures for avoiding viral exposure became paramount, reciting a genealogy of distancing, protection, containment, and isolation. By examining how concepts and practices of autoimmunity animate cutting-edge biomedical research, this article asks, How does autoimmunity undo normative models of health predicated on a militarized model of immunity? How might the viral shift our understanding of autoimmunity and what might autoimmune conditions teach us about virality? In short, what can autoimmunity and the viral show us about uncertainty, care, and transformation in therapeutic and pedagogical contexts?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An inquiry into onto-epistemology, this essay investigates the reciprocal production of aesthesis and empiricism, both the seemingly scientific and the perceptual knowledge that signifies otherwise under conditions of imperial Western humanism. In a reading of Nalo Hopkinson’s Brown Girl in the Ring (1998), I argue that as an enabling condition of imperial Western humanism, the black mater(nal) is foreclosed by the dialectics of hegemonic common sense and that the anxieties stimulated by related signifiers, such as the black(ened) maternal image, voice, and lifeworld, allude to the latent symbolic-material capacities of the black mater(nal), as mater, as matter, to destabilize or even rupture the reigning order of representation that grounds the thought-world relation. In other words, the specter of the black mater(nal)—that is, nonrepresentability—haunts the terms and operations tasked with adjudicating the thought-world correlate or the proper perception of “the world” such as hierarchical distinctions between reality and illusion, Reason and its absence, subject and object, science and fiction, and speculation and realism, which turn on attendant aporias pertaining to immanence and transcendence. Exploring the mind-body-social nexus in Hopkinson’s fiction, I contend that in Brown Girl vertigo is evoked as both a symptom and a metaphor of inhabiting a reality discredited (a blackened reality) that is at once the experience of the carceral and the apprehension of a radically redistributed sensorium. I argue the black mater(nal) holds the potential to transform the terms of reality and feeling, therefore rewriting the conditions of possibility of the empirical.</jats:p>",

Two decades later, the 2011 census was linked up with National Health Service records to provide death statistics disaggregated by ethnicity. This article explores the consequences of these statistics for Britain’s claims of post-raciality, given that the Office for National Statistics reported the “mixed and multiple ethnic” category as dying at amongst the highest rates of suicide in the UK between 2012 and 2019. In this article, I use feminist data science methods to research the UK’s ethnicity statistics and surrounding discourses in order to analyze the co-existence of celebratory narratives of mixedness and high rates of suicide. Drawing on Rajani Bhatia’s articulation of the male/female sex ratio as a “tricky tool” for feminist struggle, I consider the UK’s ethnicity statistics as a tricky tool for research on mixedness at the intersections of the overrepresentation of mixed lives and the underrepresentation of mixed deaths in “post-racial” Britain.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez, numerous animal protection organizations seek to rescue street dogs that have been abandoned or abused. Many of these organizations seek to place previously abused dogs in “forever homes” in the United States. To accomplish this, the dogs often go through a transformation that transforms them into objects of care, making them adoptable. In this article, I analyze how narratives and photos used in social media enable this transformation by creating individual animal biographies. These animal biographies are not innocent stories; rather, they show how care is constructed in specific contexts. The construction of these biographies is presented as a non-political attempt to make the lives of abandoned dogs better; these biographies are, in fact, filled with political implications of what the Mexico-US border is like. Thus, I argue that animal biographies have a significant social role, particularly through social media, and have to be understood as political devices that can create, challenge, or strengthen ideas about life, care, and ethics.\nResumen\nEn la ciudad fronteriza de Ciudad Juárez, México, las organizaciones protectoras de animales buscan rescatar perros abandonados, víctimas de abuso, o en situación de calle. Muchas de estas organizaciones intentan que los perros rescatados sean adoptados de manera permanente en los Estados Unidos. Con esta finalidad, los perros generalmente son transformados en “objetos de cuidado”, haciéndolos adoptables. En este artículo analizo cómo las narrativas y las fotos que se usan en las redes sociales permiten llevar a cabo esta transformación al crear biografías animales individuales. Estas biografías animales no son historias inocentes, más bien demuestran cómo el cuidado se construye en contextos específicos. La construcción de dichas biografías que intenta transformar, para bien, las vidas de los perros, aparenta ser un acto apolítico. Sin embargo, estas biografías están repletas de implicaciones políticas sobre la vida fronteriza entre México y los EEUU. Por lo tanto argumento que las biografías animales tienen un significado social, particularmente en las redes sociales, y que tienen que ser entendidas como artífices políticos que pueden crear, desafiar y fortalecer concepciones sobre la vida, el cuidado, y la ética. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Designing ethnographic research on the technoscience workforce according to intersectionality theory presents both opportunities and constraints. On the one hand, the pursuit of justice in technoscience requires attending to differences between scientists who have been disenfranchised from knowledge production due to racism and sexism. On the other hand, sharing the lived experiences of severely underrepresented members of technoscience heightens the risk of harm. I introduce a practice called Sheltering, inspired by the computer science technique of “black boxing” and feminist methodology of “strong objectivity.” The opacity of the shelter in which some data resides is balanced with the transparency of the researcher’s positionality. Combining reflexivity, refusal, and performative design, Sheltering contests dominant norms in science, while minimizing risks of retaliation to collaborators. It also balances communal responsibilities with research integrity. It not only requires consideration for the researcher’s relationship with collaborators, but also attention to power in the worlds they navigate and solidarity in their struggles. Sheltering, a repertoire of care tactics to protest epistemic and social injustice in US knowledge production, can help transform who gets to produce science and reimagine other ways of knowing.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I explore how nature metaphors are used within communities related to the Allied Media Conference (AMC) in Detroit. The AMC celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 2018, and took place annually in Detroit for twelve years leading up to that milestone (Allied Media Projects 2022b). Beyond AMC’s commitment to Detroit, the conference offers a compelling set of case studies for considering dialogue between intentional praxis of gathering and important issues related to environmental racism, popular education, and science fiction. AMC is designed to explore methods of building and sustaining within media-based organizing, while the conference itself models practices of building and sustaining within its own network. Primarily focused on adrienne maree brown’s book Emergent Strategy (2017) and the mobile multimodal art installation Beware of the Dandelions (2015–2016) from the collective Complex Movements, this paper argues that AMC uniquely weaves components together that create the conditions for studying organizational process through understandings of the natural world.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, I discuss the embodied labor of policing child pornography through the ways in which algorithms and human reviewers like Linda see abuse images. I employ the concept of “apprehension” to suggest that the ways that reviewers “see” child pornography is always already oriented toward the capture and arrest of suspected offenders. As I have argued elsewhere (Author 2017; Forthcoming), the use of new digital techniques to find child pornography has fundamentally transformed and expanded policing into a distributed network of labor increasingly done by computer scientists and technology companies. Rather than suggest new software is the cause of these transformations, I draw attention to the constitutive and mutually defining relation between computing and corporeality, or how image detection algorithms need the work of human perception to put their detective skills to work.            I argue further still that the case study of child pornography detection offers an entry point into examining the algorithmic management of race. I suggest that childhood innocence is coded as whiteness, and whiteness as innocence, in the algorithmic detection of victims and abusers. By taking ‘detection’ as a dynamic practice between human and machine, I make an intervention into critical algorithm studies that have tended to focus solely on the programming of racial bias into software. The algorithmic detection of child pornography hinges, crucially, upon practice and the tacit observation of human reviewers, whose instinctual feelings about child protection and offender apprehension become embedded within the reviewing and reporting process as cases escalate for law enforcement. </jats:p>",

Arguing that scientific studies support their observations and suspicions that agricultural pesticides subtly produce neurological and cognitive harm, concerned groups continue to demand US regulatory agencies to ban this chemical. Their narratives demonstrate how the maintenance of unequal racial and capitalist orders across generational time is tied to small chemical exposures permitted by state regulatory agencies during critical temporalities in the life course. This essay shows the importance of including local perspectives in research that seeks to understand how concerns for the mass neurological and cognitive disabling emerge from lived experiences entangled in histories of racism, exploitation, and neglect. Interweaving feminist science and technology studies, queer theory, and critical disability studies, this analysis contributes to the limited scholarship on cognitive disabling in contexts of environmental injustice through exposure to industrially produced chemicals.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Media reports of the COVID-19 pandemic in India have highlighted the important role that India’s female community health workers, the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), have played in managing COVID infections in India. This paper explores the epistemic basis of ASHA work to understand the significance of their role. Through a discourse analysis of textual media articles, we show that the ASHAs’ routine and COVID-related caregiving practices are a form of embodied, intimate labor rooted in their situated, community-oriented knowledge. This labor is devalued as emotional and feminized care work, which denies the ASHAs professional status in the public healthcare system of India and, in turn, reflects a hierarchy among health practitioners that stems from the status of objectivity/disembodiment in biomedicine. We find that, despite their low status in the public health system, ASHA workers develop a self-concept that enables them to self-identify as healthcare professionals, motivating them to continue providing essential healthcare services during the pandemic. We argue that an official recognition of the epistemic value of ASHA work would help to overcome the age-old nature/culture dichotomy that informs what counts as valuable, legitimate, formal medical knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis provides a critique of the gendered devaluation of care work within a political economy of health increasingly dictated by a neoliberal logic.</jats:p>",

Yet the era of global “endless wars” stretches behind and before us, challenging both our longstanding intellectual theories of violence and our political strategies for combating entrenched imperialism. This essay reviews three monographs in the emergent field of “everyday militarisms,” a new direction forward for understanding and criticizing global war in the past, present, and future. Threading connections between feminist science studies, cultural studies, and women of color and transnational feminisms, these texts ask us to more closely consider how elements of war show up in ordinary formations. I highlight how these books and the field of everyday militarisms more broadly makes us question what is understood as feminist work in both theory and method, through their shared and novel feminist theories of temporality. Together they open new understandings of ongoing systemic and state violence in the world today and different political paths forward in the face of seemingly intractable conflict.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>An exhibit at the Museum of the American Military Family provides a springboard from which to investigate spray starch. The exhibit elicits recollections of military ironing as a masculine labor of precision, rather than unskilled feminized work. A starched and ironed uniform signals military conformity and discipline; the illusion of race- and gender-blind meritocracy; and sanitized, honorable warriors. Braiding together the military roots of this Cold War–technology with its cultural history reveals the domestic labor that produces spray starched militarized masculinity.\nThis essay is a part of the Roundtable called “The Housewife’s Secret Arsenal” (henceforth HSA); a collection of eight object-oriented engagements focusing on particular material instantiations of domesticated war. The title of this roundtable is deliberately tongue-in-cheek reminding readers of the many ways that militarisms can be invisible to their users yet persistent in the form of mundane household items that aid in the labor of homemaking. Juxtaposing the deliberately stereotyped “housewife” with the theater of war raises questions about the quiet migration of these objects and technologies from battlefield to kitchen, or bathroom, or garden. Gathered together as an “arsenal,” their uncanny proximity to one another becomes a key critical tool in asking how war comes to find itself at home in our lives.\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper draws on archival materials to read two demonstrations of FlatWorld, an immersive military training simulation developed between 2001 and 2007 at the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies. The first demonstration is a video recording of a guided tour of the system, staged by its designers in 2005. The second is a documentary created by the US Public Broadcasting Service as part of their “embedded” media coverage of the system while it was installed at California’s Camp Pendleton in 2007. I critically attend to the imaginaries that are realized in the simulation’s figurations of places and (raced, gendered) bodies, as well as its storylines. This is part of a wider project of understanding how distinctions between the real and the virtual are effectively elided in technoscientific military discourses, in the interest of recognizing real/virtual entanglements while also reclaiming the differences that matter.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Reproductive Empires and Perverse Markets: Unpacking the Paradoxical Dynamics of ART Market Expansion in Non-urban India and Beyond",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The global use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) to address structural infertility has burgeoned since the early 2000s. Large corporate in vitro fertilization (IVF) providers from the metropolitan north quickly identified India as a prime location for service delivery, creating satellite clinics in its metropolitan centers. Having learnt from their European masters the colonizer’s art of exporting ART services from the metropolitan core to the periphery, a leading cabal of senior Indian reproductive specialists have since created their own “reproductive empires” perfusing service provision into peri-urban and even semi-rural localities in India and equally underserved emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. In this paper, we chart the contours of these new empires and explore the implications of this progressive colonization for the quality of service delivery. We argue that the vast scale of expansion has resulted in unwelcome stratification as unscrupulous providers dilute the quality of services to render them affordable to lower socioeconomic groups. Weakly formulated iterations of ART legislation have also allowed this market to thrive under chaotic and uncertain conditions. These dynamics, we argue, create perverse markets that increase, rather than reduce, patient infertility, by holding unsuspecting clients in extended regimes of indentured therapy. In unpacking the drivers of this phenomenon, we identify several key factors: the neoliberalism of health service provision in India; the privatization and corporatization of care; gendered competitiveness; and potent cultural preferences for biologically related children.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article critically considers the relation between simulation design and human experience through the analysis of three-dimensional military training simulation scenarios developed between 2003 and 2012 at the Fort Irwin National Training Center in the Mojave Desert of California. Following news reports of torture at Abu Ghraib, the US military began to implement “cultural awareness” training for all troops set to deploy to the Middle East. The military contracted with Hollywood special-effects studios to develop a series of counterinsurgency warfare immersive-training simulations, including hiring Iraqi-American and Afghan-American citizens to play villagers, mayors, and insurgents in scenarios. My primary question centers on the military technoscience of treating human bodies as variables in a reiterative simulation scenario. I analyze interviews with soldiers and actors, my own experiences videotaping training simulations at the fort, and the accounts of many other visiting journalists and filmmakers across time. From this, I contend that the stories participants tell about simulation experiences constitute one key outcome of the simulation itself, blunting dissent and aiding the fort’s long-term efforts to retain clout and funding in the face of wars whose intensity fluctuates. I treat the ongoing cinematic performances on the fort as a kind of “simulation body” unbounded by skin, a theoretical framework drawn from Vivian Sobchack’s (1992) film phenomenological concept of the “film body” and affect theory grounded in the work of Kara Keeling (2007), as well as Eve Sedgwick (2003), Sedgwick and Adam Frank (1995), and Lisa Cartwright (2008), by way of American behavioral psychoanalyst Silvan Tomkins (2008).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Psychosomatic medicine was an interdisciplinary medical field established in the late 1930s in response to growing dissatisfaction with the Cartesianism assumed in both general medicine and psychiatry. Seeking a method that could address the many health conditions that fell outside the scope of any particular specialisation, advocates of this movement were doctors, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who insisted on treating the organism as a whole. Among these was Helen Flanders Dunbar, an enigmatic psychiatrist and philosopher, who insisted that the success of medicine rested on its ability to apprehend the interrelationality of mind and body as an object in its own right. This article shows that Dunbar’s ambition to develop a practice of medicine that would more faithfully address the organism as whole, rather than fragment, evokes the larger issue of how we can know and study life objectively. Drawing on the works of feminist STS scholars Karen Barad and Donna Haraway, I show that Dunbar grappled with the situatedness of knowledge practices – and specifically, the relationship between object and method – as a central concern of her discipline. I argue that psychosomatic medicine is an example of feminist thought as science because its very practice relies on holding alive questions about the nature of objectivity, truth and the ontological entanglement of ‘what’ and ‘how’ we know</jats:p>",

    "title": "Autistic Mental Schema and the Graphical User Interface circa 1968",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Evelyn Fox Keller calls the form of organisms a “devious” problem. How and why do such forms arise? Models, Keller argues, are necessary inroads to these questions. The speculative-propositional mode of computational and mathematical models permits scientists to question the physical and mental processes that shape matter into elegant form despite the “void” of certainty opened by the complexity of vitality. This article documents the use of the LOGO programming language in model-mind making as well as in experimental coding pedagogies for special needs students circa 1968. It provides a historical and philosophical background for interpreting clinical observations of two young autistic students, David and Joey. The article demonstrates that the designers of LOGO understood their design choices in terms of philosophical debates about the nature of purposive orientations in organisms. The author argues that cautious engagement with those debates—guided by Keller’s philosophy of models and Catherine Malabou’s understanding of Immanuel Kant’s concept of schema—can open for humanists an interpretive project aimed at elucidating the historical meaning of the graphical user interface. Insights into the aesthetics of resistance from autistic rhetorician Remi Yergeau and philosopher-poet Fred Moten allow neuroqueer ephemera, lingering in the archives of LOGO, to illuminate a politicization of mental variety nascent in digital screens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on many years of fieldwork with US veterans, this essay examines the production of “toxic subjects” through three types of toxic exposures in the history of US soldiering—from Agent Orange during the Vietnam war, to still unspecified exposures that produced Gulf War Syndrome in the first Gulf war, and to the burn pits used for waste disposal on bases throughout the US occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.  While all toxic subjects are at odds with established systems of medicine and law, we argue that toxic subjects in military formations are especially challenging. Deeply entrenched ideas about soldiers’ able-bodied masculinity and readiness for sacrifice (coupled with the logics of entrenched legal and biomedical systems) make toxic soldiers particularly difficult to account and care for. We describe the experiences, structural positioning, dispossession and resistances of toxic soldiers at different historical conjunctures, pointing to cultural logics that connect them. Working with an especially literal instantiation of “the subaltern,” we hope to help toxic soldiers speak, so to speak, giving them “access to metonymization” (Spivak, 2004)—capacity to understand and experience their conditions collectively, politically and culturally.  We cast toxic subjects as sentinel figures of “late industrialism,” a historical juncture characterized by pervasive contamination (of bodies, landscapes and political systems) and out-of-date infrastructure (conceptual, biomedical, legal, technological).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental chemical toxicity evokes both individual action and relational interconnection. On the one hand, there is the diffusion of risk and harm through time and space, which complicates assigning fault, responsibility, or regulatory jurisdiction. On the other hand, toxicity begs the question of what individuals can do to feel a sense of agency and mitigate the damage done by daily necessities of living. I call this tension a double bind and suggest that it is mirrored by childbearing, arguing that childbearing offers a particularly compelling site for thinking through the possibilities and limits of consumer politics as a response to chemical toxicity. Childbearing and toxicity both disturb conventional ideas about individual actors in such a way that it makes the necessity of collective political action apparent even to those most invested in consumer politics. By building on new materialist philosophy and reproductive justice critiques of consumer choice, I consider both social and ontological problems with a politics based on individual agents. Ultimately, I argue that despite their flaws, consumer choices can be important acts of care alongside collective political action, and that childbearing can be a catalyst for ecological approaches to politics in which relations of responsibility and care are foregrounded.</jats:p>",

A reparations initiative that allows victims of police brutality to regenerate organs is well underway. A major new component of the initiative will be unveiled for the fiftieth anniversary of the Ferguson uprising, but the largest biobank in the country has been repeatedly hit by raiders intent on selling stem cells on the white market. Aiyana and her team of Risers have to find a way to secure the cell depository and revitalize the movement. Fictions, in this sense, are not falsehoods but refashionings through which analysts experiment with speculative methods, challenge ever-present narratives of inevitability, anticipate new racial formations, and test different possibilities for creating more just and equitable societies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Law and regulation are often seen as the panacea for the ills of science and markets: regulation minimizes risks by setting out clear rules, calls out abuses when those rules are not obeyed, and disciplines actors, institutions, and states to behave according to collectively agreed upon principles. In this article I challenge this liberal narrative of regulation by looking at how cross-border surrogacy arrangements are currently debated in private international law. I first demonstrate that technosciences are intimately linked to regulatory and legal frameworks. Here, recombinant knowledge has led to new formations of legal parenthood while obscuring other forms of kinship in quite paradoxical ways. Second, the liberal story of law and regulation erodes the history and political economy in which law has come to represent itself as universal and moveable. I examine how a gendered, racialized, and (post)colonial context of global fertility chains is lost in the legal instruments designed to protect the people involved in international surrogacy arrangements, preferring instead neoliberal forms of kinship. Finally, the liberal story of law also embraces the story of individualism. I show the conflicts that arise when such individualist forms of law are transplanted to non-individualist contexts, both in non-Western and Western contexts. I argue that by subjecting non-liberal others (across the Global North-South divide) to bioethical frameworks that intervene in kinship ontologies, private international law runs the risk of prolonging the logic of colonial and imperial thinking.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The title of Shu Lea Cheang’s 3x3x6 which represented Taiwan at Venice Biennale 2019 derives from the 21st century high-security prison cell measured in 9 square meter and equipped with 6 surveillance cameras. As an immersive installation, 3x3x6 is comprised of multiple interfaces to reflect on the construction of sexual subjectivity by technologies of confinement and control, from physical incarceration to the omnipresent surveillance systems of contemporary society, from Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon conceptualized in 1791 to China’s Sharp Eyes that boasts 200 million surveillance cameras with facial recognition capacity for its 1.4 billion population. By employing strategic and technical interventions, 3x3x6 investigates 10 criminal cases in which the prisoners across time and space are incarcerated for sexual provocation and gender affirmation. The exhibition constructs collective counter-accounts of sexuality where trans punk fiction, queer, and anti-colonial imaginations hacks the operating system of the history of sexual subjection. This Image and Text piece intersperses images from the exhibition with handout texts written by curator Paul B. Preciado (against a grey background), as well as an interview between special section co-editor Paula Gardner and the artist that brings the extraordinary exhibition into further conversation with feminist technoscience scholarship.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Computer scientists, and artificial intelligence researchers in particular, have a predisposition for adopting precise, fixed definitions to serve as classifiers (Agre, 1997; Broussard, 2018). But classification is an enactment of power; it orders human interaction in ways that produce advantage or suffering (Bowker &amp; Star, 1999). In so doing, it obscures the messiness of human life, masking the work of the people involved in training machine learning systems, and hiding the uneven distribution of its impacts on communities (Taylor, 2018; Gray, 2019; Roberts, 2019). Feminist scholars, and particularly feminist scholars of color, have made powerful critiques of the ways in which artificial intelligence systems formalize, classify, and amplify historical forms of discrimination and act to reify and amplify existing forms of social inequality (Eubanks, 2017; Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018). In response, the machine learning community has begun to address claims of algorithmic bias under the rubric of fairness, accountability, and transparency. But in doing so, it has largely dealt with these issues in familiar terms, using statistical methods aimed at achieving parity and deploying fairness ‘toolkits’. Yet actually existing inequality is reflected and amplified in algorithmic systems in ways that exceed the capacity of statistical methods alone. This article outlines a feminist critique of extant methods of dealing with algorithmic discrimination. I outline the ways in which gender discrimination and erasure are built into the field of AI at a foundational level; the product of a community that largely represents a small, privileged, and male segment of the global population (Author, 2019). In so doing, I illustrate how a situated mode of inquiry enables us to more closely examine a feedback loop between discriminatory workplaces and discriminatory systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Debates over the environmental costs of industrial resource extraction in Alberta, Canada—home to a petrochemical industry that plays an outsize economic and political role—are reaching a fever pitch in response to government regulations on industry, data on climate change threats, and social movements pushing for environmental protection. Away from the news headlines, scientists are developing new metrics and models to calculate biodiversity loss and other outcomes of industrial environmental contamination. But these data are not only used to provide evidence of environmental harm. Practitioners of settler science like the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute employ such data in combination with the metaphor of environmental “intactness,” generating colonial mythologies of terra nullius anew, and enabling industrial extraction to continue. This paper theorizes a technology of settler colonial concealment. It shows how settler technologies of quiescence operate through the strategic use of scientific metrics, thereby concealing evidence of colonial harm and promoting a fiction of environmental “intactness” in a province that is home to one of the most environmentally destructive industries in the world.</jats:p>",

Drawing on specific instances of tunneling in science fiction film, video games, and digital platforms, I reveal how this metaphor has been mobilized to cast vanguard forms of online connectivity and networked transgression in terms that are distinctly white, masculine, upper class, and adhering to liberal tenets of individual mastery. This analysis suggests why we must question what kinds of politics and which subjects are privileged or undervalued in the metaphorical discussions of online borders and so-called border resistance. Only then can we respond to dominant and reactionary forms of transmission and connectivity across the internet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past several years, robots that help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to develop social skills have emerged as an archetype of “warm robots” in South Korea’s public science and technology discourses. This paper critically examines the socio-historical and conceptual meanings of this phenomenon. First, it traces how these robots have come to bear the “warmth” imaginary of new techno-society at the juncture of two national trends: the promotion of humanist pursuits of new technologies since the 2010s, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution initiated by the 2016 Davos Forum. Second, it analyzes the thermodynamics entailed by the current idea of therapy robots—that these robots bear the warmth of an imaginary techno-society, while the human warmth of autistic children remains bracketed and their mothers’ caregiving serves to insulate these human-robot interactions from broader sociality. By illuminating the complex social implications of such thermodynamics, this paper aims to move beyond the liberal humanist critique of machinic dehumanization of people with autism by criticizing its undergirding scheme of robots as surrogates for devalued gendered, racialized, and colonial labor. In doing so, this paper opens space for re-envisioning a more inclusive and diverse techno-society in South Korea and elsewhere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last decade, two influential new reproductive technologies have been introduced that are changing the face of in vitro fertilization (IVF): egg freezing for “fertility preservation” and time-lapse embryo imaging for embryo selection. With these technologies emerge alternative visual representations of the assisted reproductive process and its relation to time. First, frozen egg photographs provide a lens onto contemporary reconfigurations of reproductive aging and stage a life-death dyad between the frozen cell and the embodied self, which drives treatment rationales for egg freezing. Second, time-lapse embryo imaging creates visual recordings of developing embryos in the incubator; the resultant quantified visual information can then be repurposed as a tool for predicting embryo viability. As these two sets of prenatal images reference dying eggs and non-viable embryos, they demonstrate a necropolitics of reproductive time, in which not only the generativity of new life but also the encounter with the death, finitude and fallibility of reproductive substances drives a widespread and intensified engagement with reproductive technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>New media artists working on interactive installations often rely on different monitoring techniques, such as variable sensors in the design and the production of responsive environments and objects. In this short commentary, I will inquire into my installation Mother, Child (2011/2000) to address a new media art practice as productive alignment of agencies at the interface. The term body-sensor co-performance is used to foreground both the performative nature and the fundamental integrity of the technology and the body in interactive art. I will suggest that the setting of threshold values for different measuring operations can be understood as the boundary-making process, through which the installation feeds off the embodied liveliness of its audiences for its responsive actions. Drawing on Karen Barad’s work, these thresholds can be thematized as agential cuts. A number of specific examples in using sensors for interactivity are then addressed in order to inquire into the ways in which the questions of ethics and aesthetics entangle in creative and collaborative labors for Mother, Child.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, we examine how insulin pens and pumps – two major devices for delivering insulin, the anabolic hormone used to treat Type 1 diabetes – are designed to conceal and fashion insulin delivery around their appearance as key communication technologies. Insulin pens and insulin pumps transform the aesthetics of insulin delivery away from the medicalized appearance of syringes toward that of beautiful technological artifacts. They both hide and draw attention to their status as technological artifacts and their medical use through a set of desirable, though sometimes incongruous, device aesthetics. Deliberately marketed around their resemblance to pens or pagers, insulin delivery devices are examples of skeuomorphs that “materialize the metaphor” of writing instruments and telecommunication tools into their design. We analyze how diabetes education and marketing materials present insulin delivery devices through skeuomorphic performances of use that uphold norms of concealment in diabetes self-management in conditions of social and medical surveillance. Drawing on patents, educational and marketing materials, and our own experiences with these devices, we argue that the skeuomorphic design of these devices morally regulates the embodied performance of diabetes. &#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

Increasingly, the field is recognized as a site of sexual and racial harassment and abuse. By making visible the racialized subplots in the history of US geology, which include entrenchment in racial science and land dispossession, I posit that the curated origin stories repeated today perpetuate processes of gendered and race-based exclusion and subjugation in field geology.</jats:p>",

I show that unmanned systems are dissociative, not dualistic. I turn to Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991) to reflect on how drones rework limits ranging from the scale of bodies to geopolitical territories, as well as the political challenges they entail. The analysis has two parts. The first considers how Cold War drones fit into cybernetic discourse. I examine the Firebee, a pilotless target built in the aftermath of World War II, and explore how the system acts as if it were guided by machine responses even though human control remains integral to its operation. The second part considers how contemporary discussions of drone aircraft, both for and against the systems, rely on this dissociative logic. Rather than critiquing unmanned aircraft as dehumanizing, I argue that responses to drones must address the interconnections they produce and call for a politics that puts together the dissociations on which unmanned systems rely.</jats:p>",

Silicon Valley, business schools, and reformers promote it as a form of caring technical expertise by which some guide futures for others. The paper will examine the history of the concept of “design thinking” – a category forged by Silicon Valley designers in the face of mounting competitive pressures on design professions in the United States in the mid-2000s. By drawing on artifacts, documents, public debates about the design profession from this period, I will demonstrate how champions of “design thinking” responded to expanded availability of design labor globally by figuring Asians and machines as the creative subject's Other.</jats:p>",

    "title": "\"El tabaco se ha mulato\": Globalizing Race, Viruses, and Scientific Observation in the Late Nineteenth Century",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article traces the earliest identified recorded descriptor for viral infection: the racialized Spanish expression \"el tabaco se ha mulato\" (\"the tobacco has become mulatto\"). The phrase appears in the late nineteenth-century travel writing of French colonial scientist Jules Crevaux, written as he journeyed through post-Spanish Independence Colombia and observed the demise of the once-thriving tobacco industry. I theorize the literary translations and visualizations, or what I call \"visual translations,\" of the phrase across scientific and historical texts that cite Crevaux to track the refraction of racial, gender, and sexual discourses in virology. I argue that the phrase refers to the historically dispossessed Indigenous and Black subjects of the nascent Colombian republic and their resistance to subjection when forced to work the tobacco fields.  The article historicizes virus discovery at the juncture between science, nation-building, global industrialization, and the disciplining of race and sex under the long shadow of Euro-American empire.  Drawing upon Ed Cohen's concept of \"viral paradox,\" Nayan Shah's notion of \"strangerhood,\" and Mel Y.  Chen's framework for thinking about \"queer animacies,\" I deconstruct the visual, conceptual, and etymological roots of the phrase \"el tabaco se ha mulato\" to argue that the expression renders the virus as both \"queer\" and \"strange\" to the nation. The virus signifies the mulato subject as a stubborn challenge to racial hierarchies and to the host-guest-parasite relation, both of which are foundational to the social organization of the nation and polis. This signification insistently refuses the human/non-human binary that undergirds racial regimes and biological conceptions of life. In turn, I expand historical thinking about race, submit that pandemics result from global industrial resource extraction rather than merely poor hygiene, and offer a framework for \"queer decolonizing.\"</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is an abundance of scholarship on knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes related to safer sex technologies and practices, including a growing body of work that analyses the politics of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, there is comparatively little research that applies a queer feminist science and technology studies lens to safer sex technologies and practices other than condoms and PrEP. This paper draws on archival research and thirty-two in-depth interviews with queer- and trans-identified adults about how they make sense of safer sex practices and technologies, in particular gloves and dams as barriers. I argue that the social world of queer safer sex is marked by ambivalent technologies. For users and non-users, the main affective investment in using gloves and dams is one of ambivalence as they attempt to make sense of their own bodies, relationships, and communities while navigating discourses around risk and sexual health. Ambivalent technologies are also entangled with discourses of risk, governmentality, and community care. Attending to the social worlds of queer safer sex technologies provides insights that are not attainable through behavioral or epidemiological research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the late 1980s, Professor of Immunology Ana Soto accidentally discovered the presence of synthetic estrogens in her lab equipment. Her lab had designed an experiment to test the effect of estrogen on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF7). Based on previous findings, Soto and her research partner Carlos Sonnenschein believed that, contrary to popular wisdom, the introduction of estrogen would not directly induce the proliferation of the cells, but would instead interfere with a naturally occurring inhibitor in the blood. But the control setup containing positive and negative controls (used in the past without problem) was now producing odd readings: although no estrogenic compound had been introduced, the cancer cells were still proliferating. Soto and Sonnenschein methodically removed each item in the control setup that might be producing the estrogen-like result. When they discovered that the estrogenic activity leached from the plastic centrifuge tubes used to store components of the cell culture medium, they called the manufacturer to find out what could have changed. The manufacturer let them know that the constituent materials of the tubes had recently been modified in order to reduce the possibility of breakage during centrifugation but declined to reveal what specific changes had been made. So Soto’s lab turned to studying the tubes themselves. After a year of further research, they concluded that the estrogenic activity was due to the additive that had been introduced by the manufacturer—nonylphenol, an antioxidant used in numerous other applications, some of which are meant for human use (e.g., spermicide) and the synthesis of detergents. Soto and Sonnenschein’s  assay is called E-SCREEN and  has been enormously influential; in fact, most of the environmental estrogens discovered in the 1990s rely on it.&#x0D;\nConducted by Gracen Brilmyer at UCLA during the Chemical Entanglements Symposium, this 2017 interview with Soto highlights her experiences of sexism in the sciences and how those experiences have shaped her thinking on language, science, and scholarship</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The “canary in the coal mine” metaphor is used by the chemically sensitive community to make sense of and crip spaces containing low-levels of toxic atmospheric petrochemicals. This article reflects on the technocultural genealogies entrenched within the metaphor. A by-product of the imperial exotic bird trade, canary companion species played a formative role in early technoscientific understandings of toxic exposure starting in the nineteenth century as animal sentinels in coal mine rescues. Chemically sensitive people mobilize the canary metaphor to situate themselves within toxic environments as sentinel and experimental subjects, potentiating a feminist knowledge about chemical disability. Identifying as a human canary underscores how consumer commodities are universally structured for the chemical capacities of able-bodied male subjects, revealing gendered and ableist technocultural logics. The metaphor may also conjure a universal form of sacrificial life that ignores how canaries and self-identifying chemically sensitive people are differently situated in the colonial surround of racial capital. Canary knowledges arise from practicing metaphor as meaning and method—they offer a trajectory for crip-led community practices to build more capacious knowledges of exposure by extending anti-colonial and anti-racist commitments towards relational productions of accessibility. Reclaiming technoscientific experimental subjecthood can thus encourage new collective possibilities to address the global onslaught of chemical violence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Practices of health datafication and inadequate privacy policies are redefining the meaning of online patient narratives. This article compares patient-driven illness narratives and clinic-driven illness narratives to uncover a set of unrecognized assumptions about trust and privacy in health discourses. Specifically, I show how the open sharing of patient stories in social media, blogs, and other public domains collides with privacy regulations and normative assumptions in the US health care system that prevent integration of those stories into electronic health record (EHR) systems. I argue that publicly told stories based on personal experiences of illness are valuable sources of health care information in part because they are subjective, richly detailed, and open ended. Yet, precisely because of their public nature, these patient stories are unprotected sources of data that are barred from integration into health care data ecologies where clinical action takes place. Consequently, an impermeable barrier exists between the officially sanctioned accounts in the clinical record and the contextual richness of patient stories on the social web. The tensions between these two approaches to narrative and data create an opening for exploitative digital profiling practices that can ─ and already do ─ harm patients. Examples are drawn from Hugo Campos and Medtronic, PatientsLikeMe, Apple Health Records, Google Health, Microsoft Health Vault, IBM Watson Health, and OpenNotes.</jats:p>",

Applying feminist theory and social justice pedagogy within the chemistry classroom can help focus the student’s learning experiences away from hierarchical outcomes that perpetuate discriminatory practices toward change agency and the pursuit of equity, especially in regard to the design of safer chemicals. Most would agree that it is not ethically acceptable to continue to design and produce chemicals that cause adverse human health effects and environmental pollution; however, changes in the chemistry classroom to redirect this outcome has been slow. Emphasis on designing safer chemicals driven by the precautionary principle can advance the role of students and teachers as change agents in their communities.. When considering feminist theory and social justice pedagogy in the chemistry classroom, classrooms become inclusive and learning outcomes shift toward focusing on how to reduce health disparities due to chemical exposures and how to interact with systems of domination and decision making in the workplace and beyond. New chemistry curriculum is needed in these areas to help prepare a new generation of “precautionary principle chemists” who will advocate for all of our communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scientists are oft trained to think that “feeling” is not simply irrelevant but antithetical to their methodologies. That scientists are not simply objectively trained minds but also bodies that feel has been an important feminist contribution towards reimagining scientific knowledge—not as the product of self-directed teleological discovery, but as situated in time, place, and transformed through relations that oft exceed the binary logics of scientific representation; those founded upon rationalist distinctions between feeling/knowing, body/mind, object/subject. Through a collaborative methodological lens we (ethnographer + scientist) are calling radicle empiricism, we ask how a scientist comes to make sense of feeling and knowing—and the relations “between”—throughout shifting configurations of a pea plant decision-making apparatus. By focusing this study at the level of the apparatus (Barad, 2007), we provide an empirically based description—not a proposed model or theory—of some of the material-discursive relations through which the concepts of “feeling” and “knowing” are (re)configured through a scientist’s unexpected encounters with pea plant root tips or radicles. As such, we offer a perspective that does not assume “feeling” or “knowing” as distinct categories of a scientist’s knowledge making endeavors, nor as categories of experience that function independently of the historical, social, and material conditions through which they are made perceptible. Immanent to this description is an invitation to explore creative and collaborative practices of science-making in which the phenomena we study—whether pea plants or other persons—have the opportunity to reformulate not only our categories of “feeling” and “knowing” but the conditions through which they are made possible.</jats:p>",

I critically question the dominant narrative of “AI for social good” that has been widely adopted by various stakeholders in the healthcare industry towards solving development challenges through the introduction of AI applications targeted towards the sick-poor. Using feminist theory, I argue that AI systems should not be seen as neutral products but complex sociotechnical processes embedded with gendered knowledge and labor. I analyze the layers of expropriation and experimentation that come into play when AI technologies become a method of using diverse bodies and medical records of the sick-poor as data to train proprietary AI algorithms at a low cost in the absence of effective state regulatory mechanisms. I posit that an overwhelming focus on “spectacular technologies” such as AI derails public efforts from solving the actual needs of populations targeted by the “AI for social good” narrative, and from the development of sustainable, responsible, situated healthcare solutions. Lastly, I offer social and policy recommendations that would enable us to envision inclusive feminist futures in which we understand and prioritize the needs of underserved populations over capitalist market logics in the development, deployment, and regulation of AI systems.</jats:p>",

I engage the fields of critical Indigenous studies, critical whiteness studies, and Indigenous science, technology, and society. I argue that social deprivation indexes produce and surveil “deprived” geographic food zones according to metrics of whiteness. I make three central arguments through the empirical context of food insecurity interventions for Indigenous people in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. First, accounting for food insecurity through social deprivation indexes produces food insecurity because it does not accurately depict sources of food outside of what has been deemed appropriate (see: “healthy”) through logics of whiteness. Second, solely imagining food insecurity through logics of social deprivation results in interventions of whiteness, which overdetermines how inner-city urban space is designed, surveilled, and made carceral. Third, if food studies does not interrogate and make serious efforts to undo its own whiteness, it will continue to be deficient in its renderings and understanding of food geographies beyond whiteness.</jats:p>",

The Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, for example, has promoted hospice home care and respecting patient autonomy to improve the quality of end-of-life experiences. However, this study finds that end-of-life care is not automatically personalized or empowering for patients. From the theoretical perspective of care practices, this study accentuates the importance of family carers’ invisible work in achieving these goals for patients. Drawing from in-depth interviews and twelve months of participant observation in a medical center in northern Taiwan, the study found that family caregivers are meticulously attuned to the patient’s condition to provide care, which includes rearranging the place, coordinating resources and other carers, and practicing care. This paper reveals that the practice of hospice home care does not depend merely on the patient’s autonomy but also on the family caregivers’ and medical team’s work, which is relatively invisible within the health insurance system.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Building from Karen Barad’s “diffractive methodological approach” (2007, 71), this article combines Mariella Pandolfi’s notion of the female body as a transgenerational “physiological memoir” (1990, 255) with functional medicine perspectives on mitochondria and advances in quantum physics around “entanglement” to explore a new concept—“mitochondrial memory.” Recent findings in biological research depict a communicating collective of mitochondria distributed across different “human” organs and describe how this collective controls many aspects of human health through epigenetic mechanisms. Since exact copies of mitochondria are inherited through the maternal line, I draw from anthropological theory, functional medicine research, and recent discoveries in physics to offer a speculative and poetic interpretation of mitochondria as vessels containing a multilevel sense of self, allowing for connections within the same maternal line of descent across time and space. I offer autoethnographic anecdotes highlighting the struggles of immigrant women of color—women Donna Haraway might refer to as “cyborg entities” (1991, 149)—thereby framing mitochondrial memory as formed through “naturecultural” and intersectional “intra-actions” (see Barad 2007, 97; Crenshaw 1989; and Haraway 2007, 249).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring fecal material from a donor to a recipient. To think about more expansive and inclusive possible futures for FMT, in particular for people in the United States, it may be helpful to think with termites—their communities, the communities within them, and the community they may inadvertently provide to humans. This essay thinks with termites to explore several frictions in FMT in the US that shape its possible futures. The first friction explored is that FMT is human and (has always been) more than human, discussing both termites as ambivalent kin and the struggles of the regulation to understand FMT as transplantation. The second friction is that the curative imagination for FMT is discordant; examining medical researcher and practitioner discussion of potential FMT donor criteria and potential recipients illuminates the inconsistent insistence that people and guts are both malleable and fixed. FMT renders some donors and microbe communities as good or bad, healthy or sick, donor or recipient, but it’s much more complicated. The third friction is that FMT may be over, with recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals of pharmaceuticals that claim to supplant FMT. Thinking with other life forms that use and perform their own kinds of FMT, such as termites, may help inspire alternative, more inclusive futures for FMT.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>California’s arid San Joaquin Valley was once inundated by lakes and wetlands. Through settler colonial discourses of contamination, a network of canals and aqueducts drained these lakes and wetlands in the late nineteenth century. Now, the Valley’s air and water are contaminated by pesticides, nitrates, and hydrocarbons from oil extraction and large-scale agriculture. Building from archival research and participant observation with environmental justice activists, this paper bridges settler colonial and critical Indigenous studies, work on racial capitalism, and feminist science studies to investigate logics of contamination in the production of private property through hydraulic projects. California’s hydrologic history shows that ideas of contamination were contested alongside emergent ideas of the racialized body. Hydraulic infrastructure, then, was not only an economic project but functioned within a larger logic of contamination that further articulated racial formations and settler sovereignty claims. Yet chemical contamination can also induce futurities, intimacies, and collectivities in powerful ways, as environmental justice activists in the valley consistently highlight. I argue that a critical analytic of contamination can trace how racial categories are ecologically produced and reconfigured, not only through differential relationships to land, but through changes in the land itself.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent advances in science and engineering have facilitated the development of artificial intelligence voice assistants. While this is true from a technical aspect, smart speakers and voice assistants did not develop in isolation from the rest of human society. The devices may be new, but the practices and patterns in their development and use are not. Using Lévi-Strauss’s structural anthropology, I map homologous practices of smart speaker interaction onto historical conceptions of supernatural magic use. This structural comparison suggests that practices and patterns that were essential to magic use have re-emerged in smart speaker utilization in similar forms. Some of these practices are noteworthy for their homology alone. However, other homologous behaviors revive patterns of inequity that, in Western magical traditions, had privileged the traditionally educated man. The goal of this paper is to elucidate the ghost in the machine: the prejudiced social practices of supernatural magic that were asserted to be eradicated yet which are now, nevertheless, newly instantiated within our most cutting-edge devices.</jats:p>",

In this context, public health campaigns seek an overactive and overrepresented focus on historically marginalized and at-risk populations, resulting in a targeting that places both the self of the body politic and the non-self of the targeted population at risk for infection. The persistency of autoimmunity as public health is evident in the America Responds to AIDS campaign of the 1980s and 1990s and Ohio’s Together Ohio and More than a Mask campaigns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using these examples, the article examines the paradox of distinguishing and blurring the self and non-self by emphasizing collective risk and collective action and overrepresenting Blackness, demonstrating a latent autoimmunity of prejudice that informs public health messaging and its reception.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental epigenetics is a field of molecular biology that studies how signals from the environment (e.g., food, toxicants, and even our social milieu) affect gene expression. Although, for some, environmental epigenetics promises a new and dynamic account of the relationship between organisms and their environments, current research using model organisms often relies on stereotypical assumptions about gender, race, class, and sexuality in humans (Kenney and Müller 2017). In this article, rather than simply critiquing dominant narratives, I tell a different story—a feminist fable about small crustaceans called Daphnia, who display remarkable epigenetic responses to their environments. For example, many species of Daphnia are made up of clonal females who reproduce asexually, but when resources are scarce they produce males and practice sexual reproduction. In the presence of predators, they grow helmets and neckteeth, passing these adaptations along to their clonal daughters—a potentially epigenetic inheritance. Working within the metaphoric tissue of technoscience, I bring recent research on Daphnia epigenetics together with the story of Daphne and Apollo from Ovid’s Metamorphoses in order to activate new possibilities for understanding the relations between humans and animals, organisms and their environments. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In addressing the issue of harmful bias in AI systems, this paper asks for a consideration of a generatively wild AI that exceeds the framework of predictive machine learning. The argument places supervised learning with its labeled training data as primarily a form of reproduction of a status quo. Based on this framework, the paper moves through an analysis of two AI modalities—supervised learning (e.g., machine vision) and unsupervised learning (e.g., game play)—to demonstrate the potential of AI as mechanism that creates patterns of association outside of a purely reproductive condition. This analysis is followed by an introduction to the concept of the technology of the surround, where the paper then turns toward theoretical positions that unbind categorical logics, moving toward other possible positionalities—the surround (Harney and Moten), alien intelligence (Parisi), and intra-actions of subject/object resolution (Barad). The paper frames two key concepts in relation to an AI in the wild: the colonial sublime and black techné. The paper concludes with a summation of what AI in the wild can contribute to the subversion of technologies of oppression toward a liberatory potential of AI.</jats:p>",

The paper explores the multidimensional ways the groups create a countercultural memory, opposing Guatemala’s state of what can be remembered and what cannot. 8 Tijax is a grassroots group formed during the wake of March 8, 2017, a day that fifty-six girls were victims of a fire at a state-operated shelter, Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asuncion. Through accompaniment and spreading awareness about the case, the group has linked with other feminist groups across borders. One group is GuateMaya Mujeres Resistiendo-Los Angeles (GMR-LA), a multigenerational group in the diaspora that continues to amplify the cultural memory of the disappeared. Both groups are committed to what I call healing cartographies, weaving memory, movement, and embodied testimonios across imaginary lines. The groups honor their loved ones’ memories by installing public altars, photos, art, and poetry as counter memories. This paper explores the concept of healing cartographies and the ethnographic work I employed in Guatemala and Los Angeles from 2019 to 2023 as part of my dissertation. By producing a countercultural memory, the groups challenge state-imposed boundaries of what should be remembered, challenging border-thinking and working towards a hemispheric memory of expansiveness, fluidity, and transformation.\nResumen\nEste artículo examina la memoria transformadora de dos grupos feministas guatemayas a través de las fronteras coloniales. El artículo explora las formas multidimensionales en que los grupos crean una memoria contracultural, oponiéndose al estado de Guatemala de lo que se puede recordar y lo que no. 8 Tijax es un grupo de base formado durante la estela del 8 de marzo de 2017, un día en que cincuenta y seis niñas fueron víctimas de un incendio en un refugio estatal, el Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunción. A través del acompañamiento y la difusión del caso, el grupo se ha vinculado con otros grupos feministas más allá de las fronteras. Un grupo es GuateMaya Mujeres Resistiendo-Los Ángeles (GMR-LA), un grupo multigeneracional en la diáspora que continúa amplificando la memoria cultural de los desaparecidos. Ambos grupos están comprometidos con lo que yo llamo cartografías sanadoras, tejiendo la memoria, el movimiento y los testimonios  encarnados a través de líneas imaginarias. Los grupos honran la memoria de sus seres queridos instalando altares públicos, fotos, arte y poesía como contramemorias. Este artículo explora el concepto de cartografías sanadoras y el trabajo etnográfico que empleé en Guatemala y Los Ángeles de 2019 a 2023 como parte de mi tesis. Al producir una memoria contracultural, los grupos desafían los límites impuestos por el Estado de lo que debe recordarse, desafiando el pensamiento fronterizo y trabajando hacia una memoria hemisférica de expansión, fluidez y transformación. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper “queers” the history of autism science through an examination of the overlap between the regulation of autism with that of gender and sexuality in the work of Ole Ivar Lovaas. Lovaas is the founder of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), the most commonly used and funded autism intervention today that seeks to extinguish autistic behaviors, primarily among children. Less commonly recognized is Lovaas’ involvement in the Feminine Boy Project, where he developed interventions into the gender identities and behaviors of young people. Turning to Lovaas’ published works, we perform a “history of the present” and argue that a queer disability studies lens opens up the richness of autism as a cultural nexus, and deepens understandings of intersecting and contested histories of science, professional scopes of practice, and dominant futurities. The article makes a significant and timely contribution to understanding the disabling material effects of autism science in the lives of autistic persons. In particular, this case study highlights the need for feminist science studies to further investigate the historical and contemporary links between dominant scientific constructions of disability, gender, and sexuality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the emergence of Quebrar, a community-led drug recovery program, as a dynamic and evolving alternative infrastructure within New Mexico’s complex historical, political, and social contexts. Established in 1968 by a coalition of activists, drug users, and individuals in recovery, Quebrar aimed to address the pervasive lack of support for drug addiction in a region marked by racial violence, land dispossession, and the criminalization of drug use. Through ethnographic research and archival sources, this paper explores the processes and strategies through which Quebrar transformed a decommissioned site into a drug recovery program. Quebrar’s infrastructure serves as a “thing-in-motion” by resisting and reimagining colonial and carceral systems tied to addiction treatment. This exploration raises questions about how alternative infrastructures can evolve in response to histories of colonialism and what they offer for future reimaginings of care and justice. Finally, it considers how these themes intersect with the practice of research itself, asking how embodied knowledge can be incorporated into the research process.\nResumen\nEste artículo explora el surgimiento de Quebrar, un programa de rehabilitación de drogas dirigido por la comunidad, como una infraestructura alternativa dinámica y en evolución dentro de los complejos contextos históricos, políticos y sociales de Nuevo México. Creado en 1968 por una coalición de activistas, consumidores de drogas y personas en proceso de recuperación, Quebrar pretendía hacer frente a la omnipresente falta de apoyo a la drogadicción en una región marcada por la violencia racial, el despojo de tierras y la criminalización del consumo de drogas. A través de la investigación etnográfica y fuentes de archivo, este artículo examina cómo Quebrar transformó un lugar abandonado en un programa de rehabilitación de drogas y cómo su infraestructura resiste y reimagina los sistemas coloniales y carcelarios vinculados al tratamiento de la adicción. De este modo, la infraestructura de Quebrar se convierte en un «objeto en movimiento» que evoluciona en respuesta a las condiciones históricas y materiales. Este artículo también plantea cuestiones sobre cómo pueden evolucionar las infraestructuras alternativas en respuesta a las historias de colonialismo y qué ofrecen para futuras reimaginaciones del cuidado y la justicia. Por último, se reflexiona cómo estos temas se entrecruzan con la práctica de la investigación.</jats:p>",

By revisiting from today’s vantage point a set of data gathered years ago, and suggesting the Möbius strip as a helpful model, I offer an examination of recursivity in transplantation that is itself born out of a recursive approach to research and analysis. Throughout, I draw upon and analyze data that were gathered through participant observation and qualitative ethnographic interviews with transplant patients and loved ones residing in rural areas, where interlocutors’ insights regarding their temporal and spatial movement in relation to transplantation index some of its frictions of futurity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>War has defined Azerbaijan for more than three decades. The unresolved conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh has not only structured the sociopolitical climate of the nation but also everyday relations and the very manner in which both the private home and the homeland is imagined. Increasingly, the line has blurred between housing policy and military strategy, with desires for greater securitization and armament seeping into proprietary arrangements, construction plans, and mainstream narratives surrounding the domestic. I examine three sites where inhabitation has seemingly become inextricable from the military apparatus — a state-sponsored apartment block for the families of martyrs (şəhid ailəsi) and those disabled by war (müharibə əlillərinə), a newly built housing complex for servicemen (yüksək rütbəli hərbçilər), and, finally, a makeshift settlement for internally displaced people (məcburi köçkünlər). In these spaces, both temporal and material qualities of war seep into the quotidian, informing the ways in which individuals negotiate the intimate aftermaths of violence, injury, and severed relation. Whilst the article begins by examining state-sponsored settlement forged along lines of allegiance, masculinized duty, and capacity, it concludes by attending to moments that upend oppressive forms of homemaking.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Reflecting upon the notion of 'marked bodies' (Barad, 2007) as a metaphor for violence, the author draws upon their experience on a long-term, arts-based research/creation project with women who have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and critically considers the ways in which 'emotion' can be conceptualized as both a territory and an agential force. Lived experience with borderline personality disorder often involves long and repeated periods of suicidal ideation and self- harm, yet these experiences are often misunderstood and framed in  ways that invalidate emotional distress.  The author outlines the ways in which vulnerability as method and radical acceptance of emotional contagion (Brennan, 2004) can foster 'differential responsiveness' (Barad, 2007; 2014) to marks on bodies and allow for the emergence of 'borderline narratives' to emerge and intervene within expert knowledge systems.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The First Latina Hackathon",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>An event advertised as the first all-women’s hackathon in Latin America was held in México in 2015. Highly ephemeral but also highly visible, the hackathon functions as a critical site to examine how communities crystallize and evaporate, and how participants actively negotiate their hacker identities and practices across boundaries of nation, gender, race, and ethnicity. Popular discourse poses inclusivity within maker/hacker groups by proposing ways to get different or “diverse” participants to join events aimed at empowering their communities. I explore how members of marked groups are called upon to construct and manage these differences themselves within hacker spaces and “maker” formations. I first highlight how participants at the women’s hackathon aligned themselves with structures of expertise as they negotiated normative constructions of gender and femininity. Hackers continue these negotiations when they get caught up in Mexican nationalist pushes for productivity. In the final section, I unpack a surprise visit by abuelitas (grandmothers), who taught everyone a lesson on the invisibilized labor that supports communities of hackers. In a space usually reserved for young makers who understand “new” technologies, they claimed their space within “progress” and reasserted undervalued domestic work as foundational for other type of work. By weaving these three threads together ethnographically, I suggest the ways in which differences become important as Latina hackers differentially position themselves, but also align themselves, with the contradictions of treating code work as coded labor. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Collaborative research between scholars of science and technology studies (STS)and scholars of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) is a growing trend. The papers assembled in thisSpecial Section offer both embodied and empirical knowledge on how ethnographers negotiate our roles in integrative research when constrained by what our technoscientific collaborators value, what funders demand, what our home institutions expect, what we want to learn from the worlds we study, and the social transformations we envision in science and society. We grapple with how we as ethnographers can best balance caring for the communities we study, the ones we serve, and the ones we identify with. We take care that knowledge making is political. Race, gender, class, and ability status of scholars intersect with the organizational, institutional, and cultural contexts in which we practice science to shape and be shaped by entrenched power relations.Through a feminist politics of care, this collection transforms tensions in interdisciplinary collaborations into resources that enlarge our understandings of what these collaborations are like for STS ethnographers, make visible certain labors within them and, crucially, enrich our vision for what we want these collaborations to be.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the course of the last five years, a worldwide financial crisis combined with plummeting trust in institutions has led to significant changes in the organization and funding of research and education.  These changes have troubled the very foundations of universities, but they also have created new opportunities to re-imagine and re-form practices of knowledge production, a key concern of Science and Technology Studies (S&amp;TS) and feminist science studies (FSS).  Here we reflect on how these changing institutional landscapes as well as increased demands for substantive ethics training create openings for novel institutional practices that embody core insights of S&amp;TS and FSS.  Specifically, we describe the creation of the Science &amp; Justice Graduate Training Program at University of California, Santa Cruz. Taking its inspiration from recent feminist science studies re-workings of responsibility as response-ability, the SJTP created novel pedagogical and research practices that enabled collaboration across all divisions of the University.  A focus on justice proved critical to our efforts.  In its call to attend to the first principles that shape collective life, justice allowed us to open up the space of research ethics in novel ways, and helped us to create the basis for working across disciplines on shared problems and objects.  As S&amp;TS and FSS increasingly move toward generating new modes of gathering and practices of care, we suggest that justice might open up models of collectivity that fit better with the current zeitgeist and produce the kind of responsive knowledge and institutions long imagined. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Focusing on US military burn pits in Iraq, this paper traces entanglements between the materials of US war-making, the logistics of global capitalism, and the racialized displacement of toxicity and chemical kinship. In interviews about their experiences of burn pits at Joint Base Balad, a city-sized US military base located in Yathrib, Iraq, US veterans living along the US Gulf Coast linked their exposures to the toxicity of burn pits in Iraq with petrochemical exposures in their everyday lives at home. These links forged a chemical kinship with domestic others, while largely overlooking such kinship with Iraqis who share veterans' body burden. Yet I suggest that in these veterans' attention to logistics and infrastructure lies the possibility of a more expansive account of chemical kinship, one that cuts across the racialized distinctions of foreign and domestic, and gendered imaginaries of the domestic as a comfortable space for the reproduction of homophilic kin. I describe this dual imperative of the domestic as an ideology of domestic security. The toxicity of burn pits helps us to undermine this ideology of domestic security, opening new spaces to reckon with the relation between US and Iraqi experiences of US military toxicity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I provide a Spivakian analysis of computational algorithms. Building upon Gayatri Spivak’s claim that the value coding of late capitalism extends beyond the economic realm to the cultural and affective, I show that it seeps into the algorithmic as well. The recent proliferation of algorithmic applications has been met by an increased scholarly interest in their underlying mechanisms. Several critics of predictive algorithms, for instance, proceed as though the racial and gender discrimination that a given algorithm enacts upon execution can be positively attributed to -- and mitigated through a re-coding of – either its training data or its “source code.” There is little denying that the logic of computation undergirds much of our sociality. But, as I argue in this article, to concentrate the source of an algorithm’s action in its semiotic representations is to hide and legitimize the value codings that lend these representations their efficacy. My aim in this article is two-fold. First, to show how seemingly benign investments in algorithms can reproduce, in a larger network, the exploitative value systems that manage the worth of knowledge, epistemologies, labor, and bodies. Second, to raise a question of methodology: What antitechnocratic, nonhegemonic engagements with algorithms might feminists produce that do not privilege the algorithmic as a site of intervention</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This Special Section presents diverse scholarly voices examining the silenced, underexposed, intersectional forces that fortify science and technology platforms in their work to automate public abidance. The articles probe, from diverse global locations and perspectives, the contemporary work of various “platforms,” understood broadly as technology and software, health, social media, and policy platforms. The articles probe these systems and platforms with attention to the assumptions and practices embedded in their algorithms, protocols, design specifications, and communications, and, in turn, the political, cultural, governance, and mediated practices they make possible. The research studies and practice-based work herein expose the complex and shifting sociopolitical codes and contexts that condition technology, artificial intelligence (AI), surveillance, health, social media, and state platforms that support systems of care, news, communication, and governance. These exposures show how platform craftiness works differently in different spaces to privilege and damage, often with ghostly obscurity.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Thinking with a Canadian physical activity pedagogical resource, this article proposes that post-developmental early childhood education pedagogies can engage with physiological sciences beyond the instructive or instrumental relationships currently facilitated by contemporary physical activity pedagogies. To begin, I bring feminist science studies together with post-developmental pedagogies to detail how pedagogy and physiology become intertwined. I trace the tensions of weaving physiological knowledges with pedagogies, acknowledging the power-laden complexities of thinking with Euro-Western sciences in Canadian education. Finally, I work through two propositions aimed at making physiological knowledges differently entangled with the complexities of post-developmental pedagogies: (1) crafting physiological knowledges as a problem with pedagogies, while (2) deploying these physiological knowledges as pedagogical provocations that call us to engage differently with physiological knowledges.</jats:p>",

By establishing and normalizing a system of quantification through blood glucose testing and temporally mapping body-readings into data collections, these Datafied Body Doubles fundamentally alter the conceptual and material experience of living with Diabetes. As medically-compelled users, people with Type 1 Diabetes participate in their own datafication through their continued use of those devices—a choice which is not much of a choice at all—but their bodies are re-created and used to drive their participation in those very techno-medicalized treatments nevertheless.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article investigates an emerging class of contemporary machines: the robot companion. It is introduced as a robot that will accompany ‘us’ in ‘our’ human everyday lives. This article analyzes one example of how robot companionship is realized while querying how this realization might imply a change in how ‘we’ conceive of human/machine relations. Drawing on central insights into the making of the humanoid Armar, the author develops an approach to emerging human/machine relations through affects, more precisely through the affective strategies and affective labors taking place in the robotics laboratory. She furthermore suggests taking a posthumanist perspective on the analysis, which entails becoming attentive to the intra-active co-production between human and machine. Importantly, this also allows her to tweak the powerful differentiation between success and failure at work in this specific setting, the robotics laboratory. How can ‘we’ rethink human/machine relations of humanlike interaction through queering success and failure at the robot/human interface? Finally, the author suggests establishing an understanding of laboratory work on the project of the humanlike companion that takes into account the queering potential of failure – centrally by emphasizing the interweaving of knowing and affects, rather than neglecting their connection. At stake seems to be the possibility to develop visions of how to turn the capitalist endeavor of increasing rationalizations of ‘human everyday lives’ into a more responsible and accountable practice of technologization that takes into account the largely neglected dimensions of human/machine relations beyond the success/failure binary.   </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article critically analyzes the afterlives of the sloughed uterine lining, the menses or period blood around which an entire ‘feminine products’ industry and waste management discourse has erupted. I engage ecological and green consumerism in the early 21st century as it both replicates and departs from discourses that frame the sloughed uterine lining and the products used to ‘manage’ it as disgusting and hazardous to human health, and as various actors seek to influence product sales or design as an attempt for menses to suit the goals of zero-waste. In centering my attention particularly on SWaCH’s Red Dot Campaign in Pune, India, I suggest that waste picker collectives especially are positioning themselves as important stakeholders, co-designers and necessary professional consultants on the product design of menstrual disposal technology. I ask what new insights might be gleaned by shifting attention away from consumption and waste management technology to center transnational grappling with what I elsewhere refer to as waste futurity, specifically menstrual waste’s futurity? Drawing upon a growing electronic archive produced by waste picker collectives in India, I center the expertise of those in the global disposal sector as they have represented their heterogeneous positions on their websites, mission statements, product sales, in public service media, interviews, and especially as one particular collective negotiates the validity of their gendered labor conditions and professional expertise in municipal zero-waste strategies. I expressly examine how workers harness revaluation in zero-waste strategies and in the futurity embedded in what is considered one of the most culturally abject of ‘wastes’—menstrual blood—to emphasize this notion of future vitality in the presumed dead, over, and impossibly useless.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is an autophenomenographic-poetic, eco-critical meditation on diatoms. It combines a reflection on the role of this algae species in the author’s posthuman modes of mourning her passed away lesbian life partner, with a discussion of philosopher Isabelle Stengers’s notion of wonder in materialist science, defined as open-ended approaches to unexpected diversity. Diatoms are single-celled aquatic algae, a kind of phytoplankton, which, due to their ability to photosynthesize, have been categorized as plantlike. However, in 2011, it was discovered that diatoms have an animal-like urea cycle, assumed to provide robustness in times of nutrient scarcity, but also making diatoms resist categorizations as either plant- or animal-like. Taking the author’s entangled commitments to human–diatom relations and this unexpected discovery as entrance point to reflect on wonder in technoscience, the article discusses ways of shifting from instrumentalizing to wonder-based algae research, asking if speculative art and poetry can open new horizons, interpellating pathways to ethically care for diatoms. The article introduces two poems, articulating the author’s relations to the diatoms of Limfjorden, the Danish fjord, where her partner’s ashes are spread.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In conversation with Eva Hayward’s writing on transgender embodiment, this paper explores how beaver modify landscapes differently than human engineers, and how human engineering might be transformed through riverine collaborations with beavers. Considering the body variously as a body of water — a river, which draws together all of the above and underground water in a watershed — as like our own trans bodies, and as a slippery double for the psyche of an Anthropocene engineer, July Cole and I argued that thinking with beaver as stochastic transgressors against Manifest Destiny engineering projects could transfigure engineers approaches to their work and river restoration more broadly. What if, rather than trapping beavers into service as “ecosystem engineers,” we assert that humans should engineer as beavers do, in ways that create porous boundaries between land and water and up- and downstream, by way of stick-and-mud, leaky, temporary dams? Here, I theorize a transfigured watershed body through human-beaver-salmon encounters at three salmon recovery sites in the Pacific west: a Karuk-led project on the Klamath river, agency-led beaver relocation projects in the Methow and Yakima watershed, and a citizen science-agency collaborative project in the beaverless Salmon Creek and Russian River watersheds. All three stories concern river and salmon recovery in the Pacific West, where either humans or beavers have initiated collaborative projects to raise water tables, keep rivers from going dry, and improve salmon habitat. These scientists and local knowledge holders’ encounters with beavers and their ponds thick with salmon are inspiring them to change how they undertake habitat restoration projects and also spurring some to reconsider the proper task of human ecologists and engineers, into a mode inspired by beavers themselves.   </jats:p>",

Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in New York City jails, this article sets out to (1) argue for an abolitionist STS that intervenes in the racialized logics of “criminal man”; (2) offer the carceral body as arising from this abolitionist intervention into mass incarceration; and (3) illustrate how ontological multiplicities and critical phenomenology might be deployed as abolitionist STS tools. The premise is that ending mass incarceration requires philosophical interventions that resist the current racist, capitalist framework of the carceral-industrial-complex by disrupting the very foundations of reality. Abolitionist STS arises out of feminist and critical race STS as an intervention not only into criminology, but also into social theory’s ontological turn by attending to the interplay of carceral epistemologies and ontologies. When multiplicities, experientialities, complexities, contradictions, and power dynamics are drawn out, abolition is no longer an undoing but a proliferation that disinvests and contravenes carceral logics.</jats:p>",

I call on the writings of artists, theorists, and social scientists to redefine this word; to explore the ways the language of new media and the virtual spaces they occupy might describe an emergent, politically charged poetics. As a primary text, I examine Stanisław Lem’s Solaris (and Andreĭ Tarkovskiĭ’s adaptation), whose black ocean resists actively the scientists’ attempts to apprehend or describe it. Both novel and film, as with the Solarian surface itself, perform, I argue, an opaque, Virtual Poetics—a generically unstable aesthetic model at once of, but not bound exclusively to, Black aesthetics. More critically, I point to a racially charged figure in Lem’s text, who doubly mediates the colonial pasts endemic to the genre, in order to establish the political stakes for artists who commit to opacity as an aesthetic principle. I set the scholarship of Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora, Simone Browne, Lisa Nakamura, Saidiya Hartman, and Julia Kristeva in conversation with art-objects by poet Dolores Dorantes and visual artist Jeron Braxton to provide a grammar with which we might approach this poetics.</jats:p>",

My line of inquiry instead explores the tension between music creation and fragmented subjectivity, and folds in a critique of SoundCloud, the music sharing and networking site. I start with an analysis of what it means for the subject to compose and produce electronic music, and then with an analysis of my own music on SoundCloud. I investigate affective attachment in relation to our entanglement with music and social media, and I extend this to a survey of subjectivity, physicality and networked capitalism. In the article, affect and listening are related through their materiality and space, and by their capacity to mediate sound and meaning. I examine listening for its potential to expand critical activity in accord with embodied processes that are relevant to situated disability. Listening and affect guide my argument as concepts, and I conclude that distinct facets of listening can be connected to an ethics of living in the information society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been a recent increase in literature that critically engages how anorexic people experience their symptoms and challenges the current approaches to recovery in treatment centers. Yet, this work does not grapple with transnational scientific histories of the medicalized construction of eating disorders that affect who is able to be legible as eating disordered. Doing so (re)naturalizes anorexia as a disease that predominantly affects white girls and women, reinforcing erasures of those not easily interpellated into anorexic subjective positions. I address this gap through a disability studies and queer science studies grounding. I analyze early French writings on anorexia’s emergent forms, US dietetics in the burgeoning domestic science movement, and the differential pathologization of body size in the context of evolutionary thinking on capacity, debility, and nervousness. In doing so, I argue that anorexia nervosa emerges through racist sciences that spread and transformed across US-Euro imperial medical geographies, effectively functioning as a curative approach to the contradictions between white supremacist securitization of whiteness and its reproductive futurities. This paper highlights implications for present eating disorder diagnostic norms, re-situating them in a broader geohistorical context during which hierarchies of ability and personhood were organized through race, gender, and capacity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While recent literature on Asiatic racial form has drawn attention to the ways that techno-orientalism represents Asian life as mechanically non-human, the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments under the Anthropocene draw renewed attention to the construction of Asian peoples as a source of biological and contagious threat to the West. In this article I argue that a unique discourse of bio-orientalism contributes to the depiction of Asians as a \"Yellow Life\" that is an existential threat to Western forms of life. Western life posits that this Yellow Life must be resisted and ultimately eliminate for the flourishing of all non-Asian life. Through an attention to biological depictions of Asian life in yellow peril literature, I chart how bio-orientalism imagines Yellow Life as ontologically different from Western life forms and as innately animate through both its macroscopic growth and microscopic threat of contagion. Rather than embracing an Asian Americanist response that would also seek to disavow Yellow Life, in a reading of Bryan Thao Worra's poetry I speculate upon embracing Yellow Life as another mode in which Asian American studies imagines otherwise forms of life that challenge and move beyond contemporary Western-centric and humanist responses to anti-Asian racism.</jats:p>",

Through a critical Black studies engagement with the work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar, the paper sets out to explain and expand the concept of ‘primitive accreditation’ as it relates to the foundational narratives and performances of violence constitutive of the modern scientific conceptual economy. Through paradigmatic analysis, the essay aims to antagonize the ease in which anti-Blackness coheres bio-centric notions of gender, sexuality, and humanity as well as suggest that science studies as a field has not yet wrestled with the gender/genre question of Blackness as a problem for the axioms of thought and being.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on ethnographic research in the computing communities of Ugandan universities, we advance a feminist and decolonial critique of the dominant chronopolitics of globalizing technologies. Our analysis starts with participants recounting their childhood memories of growing up in rural poverty under the shadow of rebellion wars. We show how the future promises of computing make sense in reference to this past. The same chronopolitics of pitching the past against the future is used by the global computing and donor development industry, and Uganda’s governing regime, which disguises the symbolic and physical violence of the evacuated present. In coping with the precarities of the present, we show how female computing researchers build enduring “near futures” through work that corresponds to the historical and symbolic role of Ugandan women in the domestic realm. And yet the chronopolitics of global computing syncopates with that of “near futures.” Women’s communal roles are written into computing and computing is made possible and doable in Uganda through the gendered logics of care practised in the present. The paper thus contributes to an expanding literature on computing in Africa, by providing a temporal analysis that recognizes women’s roles in more substantive ways.</jats:p>",

In this context, we explore two specific initiatives: the Crafted Empathy Chair developed by members of campesino social movements in Cauca and Nariño, and Interweaving Material Encounters, a series of collaborative spaces involving women from textile collectives from Chocó, Antioquia, and Bolivar. In the process of exploring these initiatives, we reflect on the role of nonhumans as technologies that allow our interlocutors to share their affect. In addition to discussing strategies for engaging in affective relations when dealing with the aftermath of war violence, we describe how these arrangements affect us as a part of the audience. Thus, we propose the term affecting infrastructure to conceptualize how crafting and weaving can foster everyday spaces and shared grounds for the emergence of emotional engagements as alternative modes of repair.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses the burgeoning use of digital technologies for symptom monitoring in the field of first episode psychosis. Drawing on Foucauldian theory as well as intersectional feminist materialist and critical disabilities scholarship in science and technology studies (STS), we trace a novel landscape of technologies of the self. We explore the discursive strategies that position first episode psychosis and digital technology as progressive, curative paradigms and utilize our own ethnographic work within the field of first episode psychosis to consider how lived experience is transformed within and through digital technologies. We trouble the unfettered enthusiasm for digital technologies in first episode psychosis in light of how these transformations can be understood within a larger neoliberal political rationality and demarcate the importance of having intersectional feminist STS scholarship attend to this burgeoning field.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding and redressing the climate crisis in the Arctic demands acknowledging and translating perspectives from frontline communities, environmental scientists, Indigenous knowledge bearers, and social scientists. As a first approximation to the question of how Arctic scientists conceptualize and enact “knowledge co-production,” we analyze how they write about it in their academic publications through a systematic literature review. Based on the results, we identify the lack of clear definition and practical engagement with “co-production” understood as a practice of integrating knowledges and methodological approaches from various disciplines and cultures. We raise concerns regarding researchers’ claims of co-production without understanding what it means, which is particularly harmful for Arctic communities whose knowledge practices scientists have long marginalized and exploited. In response, we argue that feminist STS scholarship provides crucial guidance on how to create and sustain meaningful relationships for knowledge co-production. These relationships can potentially subvert power inequities that have prevented many Arctic science teams from breaking out of traditional disciplinary silos to create new forms of knowledge exchange, particularly those based on notions of care for collaborators, communities, and equity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To think of Bosnia is to think of war, but militarization precedes and exceeds war, as socialist Yugoslavia located much of its military industry here. The toxic gift of socialist militarization enables people in a small industrial town to survive and stay home at the same time as unfiltered toxic waste makes this home less habitable, poisoning their beloved river. The residents, this article shows, are equally people of the military factory and people of the river, and have to reconcile this dual inheritance. Historicizing the gendered inheritance of socialist militarization and contextualizing neoliberal dispossession and deregulation, this article examines how residents articulate a furtive critique of industrial toxicity in the extended domestic sphere, by which I mean the intimate gatherings in people’s yards and on neighborhood walks and riverside benches that comprise the interstices between public and private where much of Bosnian life is lived. Ethnographically, the article attends to the felt embodiments of dual riverine and militarized inheritance, illuminating furtive complaints of toxicity and poignant fragments of memory told in passing in the extended domestic sphere. Here, residents reclaim their inheritance of the river, planting seeds of dissent and survivance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While many patients who are ill form significant networks of support online I argue that to describe experiences in language over social media is not always desirable for someone with epilepsy. My line of inquiry instead explores the tension between music creation and fragmented subjectivity, and folds in a critique of SoundCloud, the music sharing and networking site. I start with an analysis of what it means for the subject to compose and produce electronic music, and then with an analysis of my own music on SoundCloud. I investigate affective attachment in relation to our entanglement with music and social media, and I extend this to a survey of subjectivity, physicality and networked capitalism. In the article, affect and listening are related through their materiality and space, and by their capacity to mediate sound and meaning. I examine listening for its potential to expand critical activity in accord with embodied processes that are relevant to situated disability. Listening and affect guide my argument as concepts, and I conclude that distinct facets of listening can be connected to an ethics of living in the information society.</jats:p>",

We situate this metaphor in critical posthuman theory by drawing comparisons to Braidotti’s (2013) understanding of the idealised human as an axiom of social production under advanced capitalist societies. We make comparisons of this idealized person with the idealized nurses that are captured in nursing codes of conduct and practice.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines how the intended and implied uses and users of emerging commercial sex technologies negotiate understandings of sexual consent as a social fiction articulated as contractual-yet-contingent autonomy and transactional access that is framed as a prerequisite obstacle to sexual gratification. To do so, I analyze the design and marketing of consent-recording applications and sex robots programmed to refuse consent. I draw on science and technology studies, media studies, and feminist and queer theory to investigate both how sexual consent is imaginatively scripted into digital technologies and how imagined digital technologies suggest that we approach and value sexual consent. My analysis foregrounds critical readings of the design imaginaries of promissory digital technologies—speculatively suggested through design and marketing materials—to situate them within cultural politics of consent and digital technology as they express desires for specific worldbuilding fantasies about gender and sex.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> &#x0D;\nWith the introduction of advanced computing technologies, medical imaging increasingly entails normalization – through procedures that create, shape, and adjust comparable variables deduced from processes in the living body. The computational rationalities of imaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computed tomography (CT) not only determine how human bodies are envisioned and visualized, but also how they need to be aligned with apparatuses to answer experimental and diagnostic inquiries. By drawing on the theoretical concepts of computational rationality and intra-action and on ethnographic observations, we aim to disentangle processes of normalization and intra-actions of bodies and technologies in medical imaging on three levels. First, we show how, in the history of theoretical mathematics, dynamic processes were conceptualized as discrete and hence calculable. In particular, the ideas of Joseph Fourier informed the development of fMRI imaging algorithms, which are currently applied in experimental contexts. Second, we analyze how the application of these algorithms enables and determines practices in fMRI-based research. Third, we explore how bodies and technologies are aligned with tomography scanners on a very material level and thereby demonstrate the convergence of digitalization and materialization on both conceptual and physical levels, which opens up possibilities for visualizing and understanding human bodies. On a theoretical and analytical level, we argue that a critical analysis of digital imaging processes calls for scrutiny of the epistemic and operational preconditions that are actualized but concealed in the application of imaging technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID pandemic presented a bioeconomic opportunity to re-entrench extant differences (racial, sexual, ethnic, religious, or otherwise) and to escalate the ongoing engineering of imagined communities. This paper examines how this general paradigm unfolded in India’s lockdown of March 2020, and the consequent “long walk home” for migrant laborers. Narendra Modi’s decision exemplifies an autoimmune drive that splits the national body-politic into a visible citizenry, groomed as electorate, and the teeming masses, marked as threat and slated for expulsion from a unified body politic. Such a drive draws on moral and science-based sanctions for rationalizing what Christina Sharpe has named premature and preventable deaths. The moral sanction draws psychic force from dominant cultural symbols that mystify, sometimes sacralize, the body politic (Modi’s “Lakshman Rekha metaphor), while science-based biosecurity measures sort and segregate populations for the management of health. Plotting Malthusian historical resonances between war, famine, and disease, I characterize the Modi regime’s readiness to countenance migrant deaths as a “population culling” that is, unfortunately, an iterative feature in the archives of global pandemics.</jats:p>",

While the “blackness” that enslavers attributed to enslaved mothers and their progeny objectified and dehumanized both and rationalized their treatment as fungible and alienable commodities, in contempory biocapitalism the racial formation that subtends reproductive extraction and dispossession has been complexly recalibrated to do related ideological and material work. The article concludes with a discussion of the sublation of “blackness” in contemporary market exchanges in which reproductive labor and its products are bought and sold.</jats:p>",

These artists are activating, interrogating, refusing, and repurposing medicalized aesthetics and technologies, finding within them inspiration and resources for their art practice. Rather than evaluating technologies on the basis of their ability to move bodies and minds into heightened productivity, efficiency, normalcy, and speed, they are creating objects and fostering relations that interrogate those very values. Building on scholars who recognize “kin” as encompassing more than the biological, reproductive, legal, and human, I discuss the possibilities of “crip kin,” recognizing the queer possibilities of intimacy with other presences and entities.</jats:p>",

Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in the Ecuadorian Amazon, this article invokes accounts of daily life in order to argue that vernacular experience is necessary for understanding what it means to live in a place of environmental hazard, and for building a more inclusive politics of knowledge production in models and assessments of toxicity. Descriptions such as “naked in the face of contamination,” “swimming in oil,” “smoke thick like marmalade,” or exclamations of pain re-lived “tsaac!” refuse hegemonic assumptions about how chemicals alter and enable life. To take these descriptions of life seriously is to recognize the ways that chemical concentrations often far exceed the ‘normal’ forms and quantities modeled in risk assessments of standard oil operations. The chemically saturated present demands a reconfiguration of toxicity – as a socio-material process, epistemic concept, and embodied experience – in order to work towards political and environmental, as well as epistemological, justice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Historical forms of domination and power, encompassed but not limited to social categories and hierarchies of difference, get built into seemingly non-human objects and the infrastructures that link them, thus sanitizing digital media technologies as human-free.  Rather than questioning the epistemological and ontological underpinnings of the human, fantasies about the revolutionary nature of new media and technology developments as posthuman carry forward and re-universalize the historical specificity of the category “human” whose bounds they claim to surpass.  To begin to theorize some of the ways in which the notion of a revolutionary network of humans and things is both racial and racializing, the first part of this article develops a reading of Sylvia Wynter’s theorization of modern “man” as fundamentally constructed through racial-scientific notions of the biological and economic.  We then think Wynter’s notion of homo-oeconomicus alongside Rifkin’s postulation that in fact the infrastructure revolution marks a paradigm shift away from capitalism. Through an analysis of several contemporary platforms (including Alfred and Amazon Mechanical Turk), we address the global-racial erasures and disappearances undergirding techno-utopic fantasies of a post-labor society.  At the same time, as we argue, it is insufficient to merely point out the way in which human racialized and gendered labor underwrites techno-utopic fantasies. Instead, we move to a consideration of the epistemological and material shifts as well as legacies tied to prior post-Enlightenment revolutionary thought, such as that of Franz Fanon, to reconceptualize who or what can count as human.  In conversation with feminist science studies scholarship on the posthuman, we grapple with what it means to think the subject of labor, and the human as subject, outside of the biological-economic imperatives of prior imaginaries.</jats:p>",

In this article, I read feminist scholarship on chemical ecologies as fables of response-ability, stories that teach us to attend and respond within our more-than-human world.  Amplifying their didactic registers, I pay attention to moments in the texts that are speculative, poetic, and personal, moments that work on the bodies, imaginations, and sensoria of their readers.  By reading these texts together, I hope to both acknowledge the didactic work that feminist science studies scholars are already doing and encourage others to experiment with telling their own fables of response-ability.</jats:p>",

The most recent new materialist publications draw upon the techno-scientific developments of the Anthropocene, a geological epoch defined by the cumulative effects of species-level human activity, to demonstrate the supposed inadequacy of poststructuralist “identity politics” for meeting the intellectual challenges of our time. But as a close reading of Octavia Butler’s Parable duology reveals, any model of ethics that dismisses considerations of race as such, and attention to the history of racial slavery in particular, will fail to address the most fundamental questions, ethical and otherwise, of the modern world. </jats:p>",
