The paper describes how these strategies were developed and why and models those responses. This paper confirms other studies which argue that certain key elements must be in place to ensure the successful implementation of information technology (IT) or electronic commerce. However, this research has highlighted the fact that there are important influential issues operating at another level within the organization studied. Politics and the power of vested interest groups within an organization and managerial misunderstanding about what electronic commerce is created unrealistic expectations of the innovation by management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The term formal method is used widely but with differing meanings. In this paper the term is used to refer to methods with a sound basis in mathematics. The term structured method is used to refer to methods which are well defined but which do not have a sound basis in mathematics. Technically the most significant difference between the two classes of technique is that formal methods permit functionality to be specified precisely whereas structured methods allow only system structure to be specified precisely. The term informal method is used to describe those methods which have no formal basis, e.g. those using natural lang-uage system descriptions. Structured methods are used fairly widely in industry. Formal methods are used much less widely, but their use is on the increase.",

    "title": "Transforming Organizations through Information Management",
    "abstract": "This conference was run by Lincoln Wood and Partners at the London Business School. At least three intriguing issues are raised by its title. First, Information Technology (IT) has been commonly presented as having transformative capacities within organizations. However, accumulated evidence now shows that required changes have often been less than desired or anticipated. Second, and in recognition of this point, the title now stresses information and management rather than just IT as the means to transformation. Third, it implies that re-engineering organizations can meet business needs while taking into account, as only one factor, how the potential of IT might be aligned with or even enhance the reengineering process. How far could these three different approaches be discussed? What evidence would be produced of transformation through information management?, and would helpful guidelines emerge on how information, IT and organizations could be better managed in the 1990s? The conference was organized in each morning and afternoon as four presentations followed by an open hour-long panel session. An innovative, highly interesting and useful feature of each panel session was the computerized gathering and display, behind the main speakers, of questions, issues and responses as they were discussed. Creativity Software then made a detailed report available to each conference member. The conference gained much from this software application, which to some extent acted as a live endorsement of the conference theme.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies have shown that maintenance is up to 80% of the life-cycle effort of developing and maintaining a business information technology (IT) system. There are several factors which significantly affect maintenance work. This paper concentrates on one of these factors which is the knowledge staff require for effective and efficient systems maintenance. The knowledge required is split into two categories. Firstly, there is the knowledge of the business environment within which an IT system operates. Secondly, there is the knowledge of the technical IT system, particularly the details of the software structure. It is argued that both categories of knowledge are equally important and difficult to acquire. Examples of techniques for improving this knowledge are discussed. The article is partly based on case-study research into the actual practice of systems development and maintenance in 31 UK IT departments. </jats:p>",

The approach is called Information Economics (IE). A key use is to prioritize investments in information systems. It brings together business and technology managers, by providing, at one level, a tool they can use for scoring systems. At another level, it offers a decision-making process that provides a number of key benefits, such as improved communications. Two case studies, from the public and private sectors, show two different, practical uses of the Information Economics approach, and how it can be adapted to different organizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Galliers divides the contents into four sections 'On the nature of information' ; 'Information analysis: some considerations and inherent problems' ; 'Approaches to information analysis' ; 'Evaluating potential information systems' . The first is concerned with information and its management. The papers touch on such topics as the value of information for decision-making and the roles of formal and informal communication. This leads to a second part which looks at some of the problems of determining information requirements. The particular emphasis is on information systems and on meeting the needs of their users. The third part of the book is, in some ways, its core, for it deals with various possible approaches to carrying out an analysis. These range from the identification of critical success factors and the analysis of organizational objectives to the use of systems ideas. The final part of the book looks more closely at the relevance of social and other factors to information analysis and the perpetual difficulty of balancing competing demands.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on the results from a survey of the provision of information technology (IT) course units in general MBA programmes in Australia. The results establish a baseline for future studies. They show widespread penetration of IT courses in general MBAs, but the amount and type of content they provide is only sufficient to give students a partial preparation for the general management task with respect to IT. There is an internal expectation gap between what IT academics view as core and the time and space available in the Master of Business Administration (MBA) curriculum. There is an external expectation gap between the issues currently of concern to business and the topics taught. At present the gap is widest in respect of business managers’ concerns about information infrastructure and organizational learning. The evidence suggests that neither expectation gap will decline over the next 5 years and may increase. We conclude that there is a need for increased provision in the curriculum. Recommendations are made for two core courses, with more attention to be given to topics of current concern to business managers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Hybrid managers are important. Lots of people say so. We carried out a survey of British Computer Society membership. We received well over 700 replies and 90% of these people rated hybrids as either important or very important. Similarly, in a recent questionnaire sent to members of the NCC's Impact Programme, seven out of eight of the companies asked, said that developing hybrid managers was very important. Virtually all those companies were either already undertaking hybrid manager development schemes or were planning to do so. So if hybrid managers are so important, what are they and why are we discussing them? The term was coined by Michael Earl, Director of OXIIM at Templeton College, Oxford. It arose as a result of a number of pieces of research that he and his colleagues had been undertaking. They noticed that in all the significant cases of successful implementation of information technology for competitive advantage or for achieving major change in organizations, there seemed to be a person at the heart of the development who displayed certain experience and characteristics. These were: an understanding of the business and what was required within the business, combined with a technical competence that enabled them to understand what was required in technical terms, including the scope of what was being planned. In addition to this, they displayed two types of organizational skills. They knew how to get about the business, and this implied that they knew the business and the people around it well, and they knew how to get things done, possessing a set of excellent social skills to listen, understand, negotiate and persuade. It was also clear from these cases that hybrids were not operating in isolation. There were other important",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In design science research, two important challenges exist to achieve greater influence in research and practice: (1) foster frequent reuse of artifacts and design theories and (2) increase knowledge accumulation in the field. In this article, we argue that replication studies could support the accumulation and development of design theories to reach a state that encourages reuse of artifacts and design theories. However, it is unclear precisely how replication relates to design science research—that is, what outcomes replication produces and how researchers should apply it within design science research. This study proposes three overarching research questions ( Does the artifact provide utility? Is the design theory complete? What design theory components fit a larger context?) and eight categories for replication studies in design science research (Test, Redesign, Justification, Adaptation, Explanation, Update, Recreation, and Meta-Replication). We offer guidance to researchers, editors, and reviewers on how to conduct replication studies in design science research and why such studies are so critical. Our goal is to provide “food for thought” on the significance of design science research replication studies and, in turn, help facilitate their widespread implementation and publication. We conclude our study by highlighting areas for further discussion and investigation, such as defining replication procedures and conceptualizing genuine replication goals within design science research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Autonomous driving systems (ADS) operate in an environment that is inherently complex. As these systems may execute a task without the permission of a human agent, they raise major safety and responsibility issues. To identify the relevant issues for information systems, we conducted a critical and scoping review of the literature from many disciplines. The innovative methodology we used combines bibliometrics techniques, grounded theory and a critical conceptual framework to analyse the structure and research themes of the field. Our findings show that there are certain ironies in the way in which responsibility for apparently safe autonomous systems is apportioned. These ironies are interconnected and reveal that there remains significant uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. The ironies draw attention to the challenges of safety and responsibility with ADS and possibly other cyber-physical systems in our increasingly digital world. We make seven recommendations related to (1) value sensitive design and system theory approaches; (2) stakeholders’ interests and interactions; (3) task allocation; (4) deskilling; (5) controllability; (6) responsibility (moral and legal); (7) trust. We suggest five areas for future IS research on ADS. These areas are related to socio-technical systems, critical research, safety, responsibility and trust. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital transformation fundamentally changes the way individuals conduct work in organisations. In accordance with this statement, prevalent literature understands digital workplace transformation as a second-order effect of implementing new information technology to increase organisational effectiveness or reach other strategic goals. This paper, in contrast, provides empirical evidence from two remote-first organisations that undergo a proactive rather than reactive digital workplace transformation. The analysis of these cases suggests that new ways of working can be the consequence of an identity change that is a precondition for introducing new information technology rather than its outcome. The resulting process model contributes a competing argument to the existing debate in digital transformation literature. Instead of issuing digital workplace transformation as a deliverable of technological progress and strategic goals, this paper supports a notion of digital workplace transformation that serves a desired identity based on work preferences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The adoption and management of electronic channels provide critical challenges for managers and researchers in the field of information systems. With the recent advent of electronic commerce, new business models have emerged to capture the value of on-line electronic channels. In electronic channels, channel functions in particular can be combined creatively to reduce costs and improve responsiveness and can be dispersed among several different players. We argue that buying processes and channel functions in electronic channels are of a key strategic nature. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges and requirements of electronic channels and illustrates these with the KLM Cargo Cyberpets case. Cyberpets refers to Pets Travel Service, KLM Cargo's recent addition to its electronic commerce portfolio which organizes and facilitates air transportation plus ancillary services for cats and dogs. The existence of ‘Channel silos’ and channel coordination problems were found to be one of the main inhibitors for channel effectiveness and success. The paper concludes with suggestions for managers as well as for researchers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper draws on work undertaken for the Butler Cox Productivity Enhancement Programme (PEP) to describe a process model which will provide a basis for overcoming the problems of cost and complexity associated with software maintenance. PEP is a continuous program that is open to organizations wishing to measure and improve systems development and productivity. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper argues that for maintenance work to be effective, it is vital to control the input to the process — the procedure by which change requests are notified and managed in the first place. The procedure of change management is followed by impact analysis, system release planning, change design, implementation, testing and system release/integration. These steps, which occur sequentially, are supported by a further activity that continues concurrently - progress monitoring. </jats:p><jats:p> The conclusion of the paper is that a coordinated program, effective across the whole maintenance process and designed to control changes to the system, will become more and more critical as the complexity of the system increases. Formal procedures are essential to ensure that software is not degraded and to provide an audit facility. At the same time there are several automated change and control packages now available that could help to reduce administrative overheads and increase control over system changes. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Reforming work patterns or negotiating workloads? Exploring alternative pathways for digital productivity assistants through a problematization lens",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital trace data can be used to capture organizational practices in granular detail and enable the automation of a wide range of managerial tasks. One example is Digital Productivity Assistants (DPA) that harness digital trace data about knowledge workers’ performance and make targeted suggestions for how to improve and optimize their work patterns. Previous research shows that despite benevolent intentions to increase workers’ wellbeing, DPA tend to introduce novel forms of exploitation and control. Inspired by Michel Foucault’s philosophical strategy of ‘problematization,’ which emphasizes how practices are constructed in the form of problems that subsequently shape certain solutions, this paper takes a critical yet constructive view of DPA. Specifically, we conduct a genealogical reading of the DPA tool, Microsoft MyAnalytics, to investigate the problematics that have structured its emergence, as well as how its uses imply certain discursive commitments to philosophical and ethical questions. In the prevailing discourse, DPA cast digital trace data as a learning opportunity and thereby commit to individualizing the responsibility for handling the paradoxical nature of increasingly fluid work arrangements. Conversely, in our account of the history of MyAnalytics, we uncover a ‘lost discourse’ committed to trace data as a resource that can help knowledge workers negotiate excessive workloads. We propose the problematization lens as a way critically to articulate alternatives and speculate about instantiations of digital technology that today seem ‘unthinkable’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> For almost two decades, the debate on net neutrality influences the governance of the Internet infrastructure operated by Internet service providers (ISPs) and has spurred an enormous body of academic literature. However, new business models such as zero-rating, rapid technological progress, changing consumer behavior and political transformations constantly challenge our understanding of net neutrality. Despite the breadth and depth of knowledge on this topic, a conceptualization and synthesis of almost two decades of interdisciplinary literature is missing. This paper provides a comprehensive state of knowledge review based on a framework of net neutrality that captures the chronology of the debate as well as individual, organizational, and societal level concepts, which allows us to disentangle the nature, effects, and implications of different business practices of ISPs in order to extract new insights. Finally, we develop a research agenda on net neutrality in telecommunications and on neutrality in the wider Internet ecosystem addressing the challenges with respect to digital platforms and data gatekeepers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "All software has some subject matter, often called the problem domain or the real world, which lies outside the software itself. This real world may be quite abstract and formal for example, the real world of a program that computes prime numbers is the mathematical world of natural numbers. It may be less abstract but still formal; for example, the real world of a scheduler in an operating system is the computer world of user processes and computing resources. But for a wide class of software the real world will be essentially informal, as it is for typical data processing systems that deal with payrolls, sales orders, production management in factories, accounts receivable, and similar applications. The real world is also informal for control systems such as those found in aircraft, which must deal with the physical properties of the earth and its atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the impact of knowledge based information systems (KBIS) on commercial organisations. A questionnaire and interview format was used to gather information from eleven commercial organisations developing KBIS. Three prime areas were considered, namely knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, and KBIS development methodologies. For each of these areas, the normative position as expressed in the literature is presented and then compared to the survey findings. Problems involved in the development of KBIS are mentioned as well as developers’ perceptions of the future directions for KBIS within their organisations. Additional information on each organisation is presented in an Appendix in order to provide a richer picture and background to the study. The main preliminary findings are that KBIS have made an impact on organisations in Australia who are willing to make a considerable investment of resources in this new venture. While most organisations are treating this technology as research and development, they believe that the technology will be absorbed into their mainstream information systems in the future. These systems are seen as providing a competitive edge to those organisations willing to make the investment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Crowdsourced disinformation represents a two-sided-market model wherein a platform organizer orchestrates the interaction between disinformation requesters and crowdworkers for a fee. Academic research and industry reports demonstrate that the disinformation business is thriving and that its consequences can be severe; however, research on this topic has focused mainly on developing technical methods to detect disinformation, while leaving the social aspects of the phenomenon unaddressed. In particular, very little is known about the discursive tactics that platforms apply to justify disinformation-service offerings such that these appear acceptable to potential customers. Taking a critical approach to the topic, the paper examines how platform organizers justify their disinformation services and to what extent the justifications given are valid. These questions are addressed via a unique dataset from 10 crowdsourcing platforms specializing in social-media–based reputation management. Drawing on the lens of accounts, the analysis suggests that these platforms employ six means of justification for persuasion purposes: the “claim of entitlement,” “defense of the necessity,” the “claim of ubiquity,” “language sanitization,” “appeal to professionalism,” and “appeal to codified rules.” Critical discourse analysis scrutinizing these accounts against the validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, sincerity, and legitimacy indicates that they cannot be considered valid. The paper discusses the implications of the findings and offers several recommendations designed for improving the status quo. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: The Industrialization of Intelligence: Mind and Machine in the Modern Age",
    "abstract": "The cover of this intriguingly titled book credits Noah Kennedy with the development of 'an original and provocative model of the interplay between computer systems and social systems'. The early chapters provide no clue as to the nature, or the content of this model, and focus instead on the classical economists who first established conceptual links between production technologies, human capital and economics growth. It later becomes apparent that the book is premised on two main arguments, the first of which is that computing cannot be viewed in isolation from the social organization of production as a whole. The second argument is that our understanding of the role of computers in society requires an understanding of the socio-economic processes through which technical change is discovered and disseminated. The key contribution of Smith and Ricardo was that the creation of wealth was seen as dependent not only on technical advance, but also on a progressively more specialized division of labour. This capacity for specialism is clearly reflected in the hugely complex, (but nevertheless minutely sequçnced) operations carried out by modern computers. Kennedy traces the technical development of computers from Babbage and Boole to Turing and Von Neumann but puts this development in proper socio-historical perspective by showing that the use of 'thinking machines' was advanced in a context of secularization, standardization, and ever greater leaps in productive efficiency. The second part of the book provides a highly original view of the social and economic processes which drive the discovery and dissemination of technological :flange. Here the intellectual point of departure is the work of Thomas Kuhn, and the idea that scientific revolutions can be equated with the emergence of new 'regimes of explanation'. Kennedy questions the view that technological development 'mirrors . . . the processes that Kuhn described in connection with scientific revolutions', and proceeds to unfold his own highly cogent analysis of the technical change process:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The ‘conversation’ offers an important contribution to the archaeology of information systems, both in practice as an academic domain or discipline, and a focus on the genealogy of the field, including some of the accidents and deviations that marked later developments. It is derived from a series of conversations and later exchanges that I arranged with Frank Land. The substantive aspects date from the late 2017 and were then developed in a series of exchanges in 2018; although in effect he and I have been developing this conversation over many years, during which he has been continually challenging, expansive and forthcoming. Comments forthcoming from readers of earlier drafts indicated some perplexity regarding the genre and the objectives of our contribution, so it is important to note that the term ‘conversation’ is something of a conceit. It is not an interview per se, nor is it a biographical account. The core of what follows developed from our verbatim exchanges both face-to-face, and later via email. Some sections, however, have been reworked and enhanced to clarify and augment the issues raised. In addition, we have sought to provide a good deal of background and narrative to guide readers through the text, offering pointers to further resources. The overall contribution is intended to provide an informed and, we hope, informative contribution to people’s understanding of key social and technical issues of our time. </jats:p>",

The second used the operating expense ratio (profitability measure) and the IT expense ratio to measure the level of IT capital intensity. The results of the present study showed a positive correlation between the CI and the financial ratios and the most profitable firms are more likely to spend a higher proportion of their non-interest operating expenses on IT. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information and communications technology can be used to improve the social and economic situation in developing countries. However, a broad range of challenges has been identified, and one of these relates to the power asymmetries in developing countries. These power asymmetries are often deeply entrenched. We conducted an in-depth critical case study of an information and communication technology for development project in India. We looked at the historical and cultural context, the roles of the actors, and the use of symbolic practices. Using Bourdieu’s theory of practice and, in particular, his concept of habitus, our findings reveal how symbolic practices can work against ICT projects in developing countries. These symbolic practices, rooted in a particular culture, are tied to and constitutive of power asymmetries. We offer a framework for studying habitus in information systems research on information and communication technology for development that may be useful for others who wish to explore similar questions in their case study research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we offer an original framework to study Artificial Intelligence (AI). The perspective we propose is based on the idea that AI is a system technology, and that a useful description of AI cannot abstain from mapping the components of the system, their interdependence, and how the synergies they create shape at the roots the directions of AI development. We adopt the concept of Large technical systems (LTS) to give substance and structure to our idea. Using LTS, we are able to scaffold AI and the forces at work steering its production, deployment, and evolution. We find that AI as a system shares essential features with infrastructural technologies such as the Internet. The LTS framework proves very useful to capture important nuances of the technology, and it allows us to trace the connections and cross–influences among its constituting domains—algorithms (software), compute (hardware), and data. We compare our proposed framework with other concepts usually associated with radical innovations, and suggest in which respects AI differs from these ideal–types. We consider ours a timely exercise, as we witness the formation of an AI industry. While in the making, this industry is rapidly ossifying, together with its specific problems, power imbalances, and development scenarios; the focus on the system–ness of AI allows uncovering the deeper structure of this technological breakthrough. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The economic dominance of large Internet tech companies, specifically the ‘Big Five’ (Google, Apple, Meta née Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft), is fundamentally complicating the organisation of society. Their positions raise profound questions, old and new, at the intersection of information systems and political philosophy, where companies have traditionally appeared in liberal democracies as economic operators rather than powerful political actors that threaten to limit citizens’ fundamental rights significantly through their operations. Importantly, the traditional understanding of corporate social responsibility is rooted in the liberal-democratic conception of moral labour’s division between public and private powers in a market economy. Focussing on this division, the paper analyses the various types of political power these companies wield and the complexities of regulating that power. Thus, it contributes to the IS discipline’s theoretical discussion by introducing political theory concepts that hold untapped potential for reconciling Big Tech and modern liberal-democratic conceptions of society. Taking these concepts as underpinnings for discussing six types of power, in turn (business vs. politics, democratic government, institutions of a market economy, companies, civil society and citizens), the paper offers the discipline example research questions to tackle and points to potential directions for scholarship. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review",
    "abstract": "This volume forms a part of a series of books sponsored by the International union of Crystallography (IUCr) and published by Oxford University Press. It has been conceived as an initiative of the Commission on Powder Diffraction of the IUCr dated as late as in 1991. Then, Commission on Powder Diffraction, chaired by Prof. R.A.Young, has made a specific proposal for a meeting in Czechoslovakia with the title „X-ray Diffraction Studies of Real Polycrystalline Materials“ (grain size, strain and texture). The conference was carefuly prepared and realized in Military Academy Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia in August 1995 with 120 attendants from 23 countries (SIZE-STRAIN’95). There were 25 invited lecturers there who agreed to work out texts that would be organised into an authoritative book on defect and microstructure analysis by diffraction to serve as a comprehensive, in-depth reference work on this topic for crystallographers and materials scientists. And, after another four years of great endeavour, the book finally appeared. The book has 785 + XVII pages and consists of 31 chapters (written by 39 authors) which are grouped into seven parts: fundamentals of defect analysis by diffraction, experimental techniques, macrostress, texture, whole pattern fitting, restoring physical patterns from the observed variables, and applications. Some sixty per cent of the volume is devoted to the line-broadening effects observed in X-ray powder diffraction patterns since the early days of X-ray diffraction analysis when it was recognized that the diffraction line shape contains information about imperfections in crystalline phases. The second most important subject dealt with in the book is texture of polycrystalline materials as defined by the orientation distribution of its crystallities. The featuring chapter on texture, written by Prof. H.J.Bunge, the world’s top specialist in texture analysis, represents, in fact, the best treatise on this subject matter ever published. The third issue, discussed in the volume and complementing the description of the materials real structure (microstructure), is macrostress, the measurement of which represents one of the most widespread and technologicaly important applications of X-ray difraction. In fact, microstructural or „real-structure“ features, i.e. structural imperfections as well as the size, shape, spatial arrangement and orientational alignment of crystallities or domains, residual stress and strains are of utmost practical importance since the properties of many materials in daily life largely depend on these features. On the other hand, the diffraction pattern is relatively intensive to the microstructural features and that is why they are usualy studied in the real space by various microscopical methods. But X-ray diffraction provides much microstructural information in the reciprocal space which is unaccessible by microscopy, being at the same time very demanding from the technical point of view. In fact, defect and microstructure analysis is the most difficult branch of X-ray crystallography and the only work that attempted to cover comprehensively this field was the book of H.S.Peiser, H.P.Rooksby and A.J.C.Wilson „Diffraction by Polycrystalline Materials“ that was published by Chapman and Hall in London, 1960. The present volume, edited by Snyder, Fiala and Bunge, fills up the wide gap between 1960 and 1999 and brings an extensive and detailed review of what has been done. So, much is explained on various sources of diffraction line broadening like crystallite or domain size and size distribution, strain including anisotropic strain, structural mistakes, stacking faults and other planar defects, dislocations, dislocation manifolds and dislocation configurations, strain fields and paracrystallinity. The state-of-the art evaluation techniques for restoring (deconvolution of) physical patterns from the measured diffraction profiles, background subtraction, smoothing, sampling and interpolation, Fourier techniques, iterative solutions of integral equations, inverse filtering, regularisation and maximum entropy methods, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, are discussed in detail, too. The extensive theoretical passages are complemented with a number of chapters reporting numerous examples of practical applications related to inorganic chemistry, metallurgy, ceramics and organic polymers. The volume points out the weak points of the conventional X-ray diffraction techniques for real structure analysis: the verification of structural models, indistinguishability of different structural models from the point of view of powder diffraction; the number of different real structure models that have been investigated in detail is very small and these models are rather simplified and far from reality. A new, very promissing technique for the study of microstructure is introduced in the chapter on X-ray diffraction imaging (XRDI). Unlike traditional powder diffractometry, where divergent and focusing X-ray optics are essential to collect information from an ensemble of all grains within the illuminated volume of the sample which is then analysed making use of a mathematical model of the assumed microstructure, a nearly parallel beam is employed in XRDI to observe and measure diffraction images from individual grains and component particles (grain-by-grain mapping, topography) providing thus ability to measure shape, size, orientation and strain without model-based analyses. The book „Defect and Microstructure Analysis by Diffraction“ is a very useful, quite a unique work, invaluable both to practitioners of X-ray analysis and to all those involved in materials characterization.",

Its major technical features are the use of a modularized knowledge base instead of CAI's textual scripts, and the ability to interpret the student's statements and questions expressed in natural English. These features make ICAI systems extremely flexible and allow the student much greater learner control of the interaction than is traditionally possible in CAI. Other major elements of an ICAI system are an extensive model of the student and an explicit model of the tutoring process.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concepts field and habitus are used widely and variably in institutional theory. The intellectual antecedents are found in the work of the French Sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu. This study presents a field-level analysis of pan-European policy on cross-border health information technology. Using field theory and institutional theory, we situate field as a multi-level concept which extends institutional and organizational levels of analysis. Empirical data is gathered from European policymakers, health professionals and patient advocacy groups on the diffusion of supra-national health information technology across European Member States. Findings reveal four scenarios depicting field tensions, as ideological and practical imperatives of supra-national health information technology policy mis-align with Member State health systems. This study has implications for policy-makers and other stakeholders, who seek to narrow the digital divide across health fields and sub-fields. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This note addresses the problem of choosing an appropriate method when evaluating an IT investment as set out in a previous work. The problem arises immediately because there are many methods on offer for performing the evaluation and a great number of different situations in which those methods could be applied. There is thus a problem of matching the method to the situation across many dimensions. In the previous paper the authors spelled out some of these dimensions on the basis of empirical work and proposed a matching method derived by trial and error which had, at the time, no theoretical foundations. Further research has suggested a possible rationale and it is that which is presented here, together with a further dimension on which the matching may be carried through. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Enterprise architecture is a description of an enterprise from an integrated business and IT perspective intended to bridge the communication gap between business and IT stakeholders and improve business and IT alignment. Enterprise architecture consists of multiple different artifacts providing certain views of an organization and the available enterprise architecture literature offers a number of comprehensive lists of artifacts that can be used as part of an enterprise architecture practice. However, these lists of enterprise architecture artifacts were never validated empirically and the practical usage of different artifacts still remains largely unexplored. Based on a comprehensive empirical analysis of enterprise architecture artifacts used in 27 diverse organizations, this study identifies the list of 24 common artifacts that proved useful in practice and describes in detail their usage and purpose. Although this study does not attempt to theorize on the findings, it makes a significant empirical contribution to the enterprise architecture discipline. In particular, this study (1) provides the first consistent list of enterprise architecture artifacts that actually proved useful in organizations, (2) offers the first available systematic description of their usage, (3) questions the common view of enterprise architecture as a set of business, information, applications and technology architectures and (4) questions the widely accepted conceptualization of enterprise architecture as a set of the current state, future state and transition roadmap. This study provides compelling empirical evidence in favor of reconceptualizing enterprise architecture and calls for further research in this direction. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The theoretical basis of enterprise architecture: A critical review and taxonomy of relevant theories",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Enterprise architecture is a collection of artifacts describing various aspects of an organization from an integrated business and IT perspective. Practicing enterprise architecture in organizations implies using these artifacts to facilitate information systems planning and improve business and IT alignment. Despite its long history, the enterprise architecture discipline still remains largely atheoretical and lacks a solid theoretical basis. Based on our previous empirical studies of the practical usage of enterprise architecture artifacts in multiple organizations and broad literature analysis, this conceptual article identifies and discusses in detail 10 theories that can be considered key for understanding how an enterprise architecture practice works: actor-network theory, boundary objects theory, cognitive fit theory, communities of practice theory, decision-making theories, information processing theory, knowledge management theory, management fashion theory, media richness theory, and uncertainty principle. Taken together, these theories offer a comprehensive theoretical view of an enterprise architecture practice explaining the role of enterprise architecture artifacts, their usability, and participation of stakeholders and, therefore, may constitute a theoretical basis of the entire enterprise architecture discipline. Although this article does not elaborate on any of these theories, it brings these theories to light, establishes their critical importance for comprehending an enterprise architecture practice, and positions them as central to the enterprise architecture discourse. Each of these theories can be leveraged by enterprise architecture scholars in their future studies for analyzing enterprise architecture practices through respective theoretical lenses. This article intends to provide fresh theoretical insights on enterprise architecture, spark new waves of theoretical enterprise architecture research, and contribute to the development of a sound theoretical foundation for the enterprise architecture discipline. </jats:p>",

Basically, the book is about systems analysis and the author starts by addressing both the student and the teacher. To the student he says clearly that systems analysis is a list of activities which allow the systems analyst to exert a significant influence over the organization in which he works; while to the instructor he issues the warning that systems analysis is one of the most difficult activities to teach. To this end he places emphasis on case studies and proven procedures.",

Embracing a regulatory view, this study attempts to advance a taxonomy of prevailing corporate data protection practices and their causal mechanisms by analyzing cases where organizations were fined for violating data protection legislation. Selecting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted by the European Union (EU) as our benchmark, this study employs an iterative taxonomy development technique as guidance and conducts a thematic analysis on 875 cases of GDPR enforcement. In so doing, we derive a conceptual model comprising 6 focal categories and 28 subcategories of prevailing corporate data protection malpractices existing within organizations as well as 4 main categories and 22 subcategories of causal mechanisms underlying these identified malpractices. Empirical findings from this study not only reinforce corporate data protection malpractices established in prior research but also yield novel malpractices that have been neglected in previous work. From a pragmatic standpoint, this study yields invaluable insights into the prevention and resolution of corporate data protection malpractices for practitioners. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information Systems (IS) functions and whole IS departments are being outsourced in industries where the IS functions have been considered ‘core’ to the success of that business. Why and how senior management came to make these decisions is the focus of this article. It explains the motivations behind Information Technology (IT) outsourcing when popular alliance theories, such as transaction cost theories, game theory and joint-venture alliance theory suggested firms would not outsource an entity if core competency would be lost. Seven case studies were used to investigate the IT outsourcing phenomenon in the observed ‘alliance-like’ relationships emerging in the banking industry in the early 1990s. Inductive theory generating research was undertaken in this work following Yin's (1984, 1989) guidelines of multiple case replications to ensure rigorous and systematic data collection procedures. Before the case studies were conducted, 40 preliminary interviews were undertaken with managers of companies that were and were not involved in IT outsourcing contracts to explore the theorized factors of interest drawn from the literature, to develop the propositions, and to refine a structured interview guide. These preparatory steps led into the initial case study, and the literal replications of the proposed factors to confirm the patterns found. A theoretical replication based on conflict resolution was then undertaken to expose greater variation in conflict with the outsourcing relationships to contrast the initial patterns found. The results suggest that financial motivations underlie many IT outsourcing decisions, and unresponsive IS departments are accelerating the pace of the outsourcing process. Within this research, IT outsourcing was found to have profound effects on the expenses for the banks. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, IT outsourcing is taking place within firms and industries which utilize IS activities that are considered core competencies. Several strategic motivations were presented that may explain this management decision. Firms were undertaking IT outsourcing to change the organizational boundaries, to restructure, to mitigate technological risk and uncertainty, to access emerging technology, to manage the IS department better, and to link business and IT strategy. </jats:p>",

From the start it has been a marriage between computer scientists with interest in the technical issues of producing sound software and managers faced with the practical problems of software projects, some of which could already be measured in man-millenia. The need for software specification, software quality and software engineering education were evident in the 1968 conference, central to the successor conference (Buxton and Randell, 1969), and embraced by the profession. In contrast, many of the programming languages and methods used at the time have since been forgotten. There was a software crisis then, and a gulfbetween theory and practice for engineers to bridge. As we look for a software engineering discipline to exploit the fifth generation architectures ofthe 1990s we must also expect to overturn yet again some of the traditional technologies of software and perhaps rediscover the principles of an evolving profession.",

    "abstract": "Many thanks to the commentators for their constructive, critical and insightful extensions of my recent Journal of Information Technology (JIT) article ‘Robo-Apocalypse Cancelled? Reframing the Automation and Future of Work Debate’. In this response I will first address the commentaries. Normally that would be sufficient. However, the year 2020 saw major pandemic, and economic crises unfold across the globe. It is important to address how these events impact upon and need a further reframing of the debate, a case of the disruption (from automation) being disrupted (by the pandemic). As such, I am including an outlook on the impact of COVID-19 on the future of automation and work.",

    "title": "Book Review: The Market and Beyond: Cooperation and Competition in Information Technology in the Japanese System",
    "abstract": "There are many things which commend this book to those interested in the role of markets in stimulating technological change. I t is extremely well researched, and it illuminates several features of the Japanese technology-creating system which have been the subject of controversy and misunderstanding. Its greatest strength is that it tries to explain as well as to describe, and in doing so offers a historically wellgrounded account of technical and economic development in modern Japan. Fransrnan argues that new forms of organization have been a significant influence on the development of the 'Japanese system', and that this system developed a highly innovative response to the challenges and uncertainties which emerged as the post-war period unfolded. Japanese technological development is divided into three periods. First, the 'early catchingup' period lasting from 1945 to 1965; second, a 'late catching-up' period lasting from 1966 to 1979, and finally a 'frontier leading' period from 1980 to the present. This historical framework is used in conjunction with Williamson's theory oftransaction costs, allowing the author to examine the ways in which different combinations of private and public enterprise can be used to tackle the uncertainties associated with technological research and development. Two main types of uncertainty are identified. 'Type I' uncertainty refers to the technical uncertainties inherent in pre-competitive R +D. 'Type II' uncertainties derive from the ability of competitor firms to emulate newly commercialized innovations as these appear in the marketplace. The existence of these uncertainties deterred even the largest Japanese corporations from entering the computer market in the first part of the early catching up period. It was government research institutes and universities, rather than the corporations, which took the lead in the Japanese system, acquiring, further developing and diffusing the new technologies. The Ministry ofIntemational Trade and Industry (MITI) also played an important role in protecting the nascent computer industries from international competition. This had the effect of reducing commercial 'Type II' uncertainty. In the early 1960s MITI took steps to reduce technical uncertainties by means of licensing agreements with major American companies. By 1966 the locus of research activity in the area of computing and electronic devices had shifted to five of the best-known Japanese corporations. Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Electric were all committed to the new information technologies. However, the government-sponsored ElectroTechnical Laboratory (ELT) made a significant contribution by serving as the 'technical antennae' for MITI, making independent assessments of company strengths and weaknesses. It was the ELT who first identified the memory area as the critical bottleneck in the immediate development ofcomputer technology. Having identified the main features of the Japanese system, Fransman goes on to shed light on the ways in which various elements ofthe system were realigned to match the qualitatively different uncertainties of the 1980s:",

    "title": "Computing Technologies New Directions and New Applications",
    "abstract": "This is a high quality book that represents some of the US's leading edge thinking in both information technology and its use. The title is slightly misleading as only a few of the twelve chapters are about technology as such. Three of the papers were given by winners of the BCS Awards on hypertext, disabled use of computing, and the use of low cost Apples to revolutionize an architectural practice. However, the overall standard of the other papers is high. Professor Jim Alty's research into better interfaces in process control (the GRADIENT dialogue system) deserves a wide audience for its implications for control systems generally, and the paper on robotics provides an interesting insight into the subject for the nonspecialist reader. This book can be thoroughly recommended for the general reader who wants an overview of current issues in British computer science and several of the chapters are of direct relevance to those teaching and learning business information systems.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Successful information technology transfer requires effective communication and clear, concise information exchange. This paper, using the Louisiana econometric model as a case study, proposes a pictorial approach to present and manage complex factors essential to information technology transfer. The approach utilizes multi-layer entity-relationship diagrams to provide a meaningful framework for the entire forecasting process, provide clarity to ensure better model maintenance when changes in social/economic structures require reformulations, and provide a procedural and data dictionary for clear documentation. The pictorial approach is both intuitive and readable, capable of serving as a task management tool, a model implementation aid, and a system maintenance resource. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Kennedy makes the point that 'citizens in the West cast their votes in defence of these programmes more out of an anxiety of being overrun by other more aggressive nations than out of any positive prospect that technology offers to society. In abstract terms the problem with national programs for stimulating technological development is not they they are ineffectual, because they clearly need not be, but that they serve frame-works of self interest that are too narrowly drawn'. From this point of view 'the best prospect for society is that technological and scientific rationalization in the future will respond to the rational and freely expressed self interest of a broadly defined community of humanity and that its appraisal of self interest will be informed in the best tradition of scientific discovery'. This, according to Kennedy 'is another way of saying that humanity's future, as it has always been is hostage to its own desires and beliefs, and ultimately to its own values'. This book makes a valuable contribution to a number of important debates whose main features have long been defined by more or less artificial conceptual boundaries, and the author succeeds in the exacting task of grounding his analysis of computer technology in the mainstream of Western socioeconomic thought. The book should be seen as prescribed reading particularly for those afflicted by the historical myopia and bogus scientism which has pervaded the debate thus far.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This case is intended to serve as the basis for one or two sessions of an introductory Information Technology course at an MBA program or for one session at a senior executive program. The aim is to address what needs to be known by general managers in terms of technology and at the same time serve as an introduction for those who want to deepen their knowledge in business-to-business (B2B) technologies. Thus, it is intended to cover basic technology principles and concepts essential for any CEO/MBA. It also covers key business concepts that are impacted by information technology such as industry convergence and B2B. The approach we suggest be taken with this case is an integrative one where both technology and business concepts are intermingled throughout the class discussion. An essential ingredient of this approach is to provide a business rational for why technology matters - using this case in the first session before drilling-down into the more specific technology details of XML and metadata in a possible second session. We have worked on other cases to extend this approach to a full-scale introductory MBA/senior executive class. There are two unique features of this approach. First, it is neither technology centric nor business centric. Instead, it links executive decisions with solid information technology fundamentals. Second, our approach would be concise not requiring more than 200 pages of core case material for a full 25-session course. We believe this is an important feature because MBA-style audience base does not go into a CIO career path most of the times and will therefore not be able to afford the amount of time a longer approach would require. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The scientific method is based on the rigorous testing of falsifiable conjectures. Data mining, in contrast, puts data before theory by searching for statistical patterns without being constrained by prespecified hypotheses. Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, for example, often rely on data-mining algorithms to construct models with little or no human guidance. However, a plethora of patterns are inevitable in large data sets, and computer algorithms have no effective way of assessing whether the patterns they unearth are truly useful or meaningless coincidences. While data mining sometimes discovers useful relationships, the data deluge has caused the number of possible patterns that can be discovered relative to the number that are genuinely useful to grow exponentially—which makes it increasingly likely that what data mining unearths is likely to be fool’s gold. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Leveraging paradigms to foster theoretical contributions in information systems research",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite all our theorizing efforts and the importance that we and our major information systems (IS) journals ascribe to theory development, making theoretical contributions to our field remains challenging. Recognizing that we cannot develop better theories without improving how we theorize, our field is now engaged in an in-depth discussion of the theorizing process. This manuscript contributes to this discussion by exposing why and how leveraging paradigms when theorizing can foster theoretical contributions within our field. Its premise is that we need to stop working within the confines of a limited set of well-entrenched paradigms and move beyond what is known as true and correct to come up with improvements that significantly alter the way we come to rationalize, explain, and master our world. Anchored on this premise, this manuscript begins by discussing the origin, role, and features of paradigms as well as explaining that they are of three different but interrelated forms (i.e., metaphysical, sociological, and artefactual). The manuscript then adds to this understanding of paradigms by detailing the unique relationships that tie paradigms of each form to theory and explaining why taking advantage of these unique bonds when theorizing may help us make theoretical contributions. Lastly, to foster theoretical contributions within our field, this manuscript proposes a set of guidelines to help us leverage paradigms of the different forms when theorizing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A survey of the information systems (IS) sophistication of small to medium sized UK manufacturing firms is reported. The survey revealed that manufacturing firms exhibited an intermediate degree of IS sophistication. Typically they were situated in the ‘contagion’ and ‘control’ stages of Nolan's stages of growth model, although a minority of firms were significantly more advanced. Organizational size was found to influence the degree of IS sophistication with larger firms manifesting a more highly developed information processing capacity. The influence of a number of factors on project success was investigated. Companies using their own formal methodologies for software development achieved higher than average rates of success. The degree of awareness of the strategic potential of IT was also positively correlated with success. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Software is acknowledged to be crucial in enabling the widespread diffusion of information technology (IT), but is inadequately dealt with in analyses of technological change and often misrepresented in accounts of IT phenomena. The tools that are used to analyse conventional innovation processes are found to be inappropriatte for software. The characteristics of software which present conceptual difficulty, and the features which drive change in the software development process are identified. Three lines of technological development in software are discussed: product diffusion, innovation in the organization and management of the development process, and innovation in technical practice. These reflect currently dominant and emergent trends, in particular the shift away from wholly custom-built towards packaged software; concern with process issues, including quality accreditation; and technical developments including CASE (computer aided software engineering) and object orientation. A framework is proposed which supports analysis of the distinctions and interactions between technical practice and organizational aspects of the development process, and also explains the interdependence between product diffusion and process innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Remote work has become a routine experience for many managers, forcing them to adapt to new ways of ensuring that employees follow company procedure and achieve job targets. Key among these changes have been to the move to computer-mediated surveillance (CMS), where managers monitor employees through electronic representations of work and computer-mediated interaction (CMI), where managers interact with employees through online communication. The outcome of this move is ambiguous and contradictory. CMS can strengthen control because of how effective it is at reporting on work. However, CMI can weaken control because of how effective it is at withholding work practice. We review the literature on remote work to explain how these apparently contradictory effects interact. We show that the joint effect of CMI and CMS goes beyond changing the amount of control over employees. Instead, this joint effect requires managers to ensure the accessibility necessary for control of remote work: that employees make their work visible and that they make themselves reachable for interaction with managers and peers. We use this new domain of control to outline a two-dimensional model of control. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the social construction of one group of technologies, systems for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). It compares the design of systems for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) in Scandinavia and Japan with particular attention to the influence of culture on the resulting products. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the argument that culture is an important factor in technology design, despite commonly held assumptions about the neutrality and objectivity of science and technology. The paper further proposes an explanation for why, despite similar technical backgrounds and research interests, CSCW design is conducted differently and produces different results in Denmark and Japan. It argues that, by looking at CSCW systems as texts which reflect the context of their production and the society from which they come, we may be better able to understand the transformations that operate when these texts are ‘read’ in the contexts of their implementation. </jats:p>",

In particular, this paper examines the consequences of the development of an information superhighway for the UK within the context of each scenario and draws comparisons with developments in other countries. Contrary to popular belief, we show that there is no full solution for the shortcomings experienced in the development of the UK's information superhighway; rather, each scenario offers solutions for a subset of the shortcomings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A simple system has been developed using expert systems technology to assist lecturers in teaching specific groups of professional and management students. To enable comparisons to be made, two versions of the system were built; one in prolog and one in an inexpensive expert system shell. The systems were designed to relieve lecturers by providing answers and explanations for examination questions in the area of standard costing. The experiments show that such simple systems can be developed by lecturers for their own use, although there are limitations, especially in the knowledge which can be captured. Testing of the system in practice has shown benefits in terms of reduced lecturer load and positive responses from students. The experiments show that integrating simple expert systems into the education process can be beneficial when the technology is adapted to match the educational requirements. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Computer Systems Development",
    "abstract": "This is an ambitious attempt to provide a historical and non-prescriptive perspective on how computer systems have developed. The authors divide the history into three phases: first hardware, then software then user needs dominate. A final section considers future developments. The approach is set early on in Part One on background and theory. This gives a careful, indeed painstakingly detailed evaluation of previous attempts at history, categorized as hardware generations, organization stages and labour process approaches. Part Two shows how various hardware and software bottlenecks were dealt with, while Part Three probably overstates the degree to which user needs have predominated in the minds ofsuppliers and systems developers in the more recent history of computerization. Part Four provides an interesting and detailed consideration of what Phase Four might entail. At times unnecessarily repetitive, always closely argued, this book is a mine ofinformation on its chosen subject, and Friedman provides fresh insight from his concern to relate technological development with social organization. The extensive bibliography will be useful to students, the publication as whole will be interesting mainly to an academic audience.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Twenty-three government organizations, which had or were developing Information Systems (IS) or Information Technology (IT) strategies; were interviewed in most cases the scope was the whole organization. Many internal reasons led to the development of these strategies but external factors were also often present. Management structures were similar and tended to follow CCTA guidelines. The need to ‘'sell’ strategies was widely understood and regular reviews were planned. Strategies most frequently covered an implementation period of 5 years. In most cases, business objectives drove the definition of information requirements; and business issues included the need to improve efficiency, the impact of legislative change and problems caused by the creation of executive agencies. There was a widespread move towards Open Systems and security was tending to become a departmental issue. Expenditure on IT was frequently about 5–7 % of programme expenditure. Departments were reluctant to discuss the value of intangible benefits. Steady progress was being made with the implementation of strategies being subject to various problems and constraints. Lessons learnt included the needs for clear business goals, senior management involvement, managing users’ expectations and selling strategies. Departments are moving slowly in the right direction and may be expected to match the best practice in the private sector within a few years. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Much interest has been generated recently by the concept of intranets: the use of internet technology to build the communication and data storage infrastructure of the firm. While the advantages of such a concept have been widely publicized, the risks of moving to an intranet based infrastructure are less clear. ‘Fear of the unknown’ may deter some firms from taking advantage of intranets. This empirical study is based in Singapore, a country chosen for its high internet penetration and usage levels. It investigates the factors underlying successful intranet developments. Intranet success as measured by user satisfaction is related to IS management risk factors. It is found that successful intranet implementation can be largely explained by standard determinants of IS success. Some implications for management of intranet developments are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This play attempts to reconstruct the social reality of key players at Metalica during the first couple of years of SAP implementation. Rather than adopting one perspective about the SAP project, we provide the views of different participants using their own words, arguments and ideas as much as possible. The play is constructed from summaries of systematic interviews which were changed only to suit scholarly objectives and a dramatic presentation. At the request of the company involved, the names and locations in this case have been disguised. Act 1 describes the company's vision concerning the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, a crisis which emerged during the initial phase of implementation and the actions taken to remedy the shortfalls. Act 2 describes the project management, the dynamics between the implementation team members and the organizational implications of an ERP system implementation. The actual performance of the play and a subsequent discussion among the participants enable students to re-create and experience the thrills, frustrations, dilemmas and concerns originally expressed by the people who inspired this account of SAP implementation. Using theatre in an academic environment opens new avenues for critical observation, integrative sense making and experiential learning. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on the findings of an empirically based case study of the use of function points analysis (FPA) by the information systems division of a large financial services company. The software engineering productivity figures measured by FPA in this company varied widely across the departments of the division and projects. Investigation of the reasons for the variations showed that, in addition to factors such as the technology platform and application characteristics, organizational and human factors affect the accuracy and reliability of productivity figures. Elucidating the lessons from this case, this paper suggests that three factors – knowledge of the FPA, calibration of the function point productivity indicator and rigour of the measurement process – are critical to the successful implementation of an FPA programme. These findings and the issues identified in the paper will be of interest to academics in the area of software productivity measurement and companies considering FPA as a productivity metric. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a hybrid organizational structure chosen by a corporation as a means to combine the benefits of centralization and decentralization. The hybrid structure is the result of a restructuring effort by a coal company in Kentucky under the directive of its parent corporation to ensure maximum resource utilization within a more streamlined organizational structure. Through an observation of the restructuring process, we are able to demonstrate how and why it is important for top-level managers to understand and make the best use of the intricate synergism between information technology and organizational structure. The strategic implications of a hybrid structure and the roles of information technology in organizational changes are explored. We argue that a hybrid structure is a viable and strategically valuable structural alternative, especially for highly diversified conglomerates that grow through mergers and acquisitions of other companies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional methods of systems design have tended to concentrate on capturing functional requirements and from them develop a system that will provide users with a technical solution to a problem they may have. However, there is a growing understanding, with historical origins in sociotechnical systems theory, that technical solutions alone, regardless of how well designed, may not succeed fully unless there is a concomitant understanding of the organization into which the technical solution is to be introduced. Organizational requirements, therefore, should become considerations of equal importance to systems designers. The ESPRIT Project ORDIT (organizational requirements definition for information technology) has developed a methodology which identifies and operationalizes organizational requirements for IT systems. This paper presents a case study in which the ORDIT concepts are applied to the process of introducing an IT system into a courtroom. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Managing a global network of suppliers presents considerable challenges for large multinational corporations. Chief among these is how to effectively transfer knowledge among members of strategic alliances while maintaining tight control over intellectual property. This paper highlights the efforts of a Fortune 100 manufacturing firm (hereafter US Manufacturing) and its management of global IT suppliers. Using a social capital framework developed by Inkpen and Tsang (2005), we explore the supplier network at three levels (structural, cognitive, and relational) and present eight proven practices for creating, managing, and exploiting social capital within strategic alliances. The Inkpen and Tsang framework examines the linkages between knowledge transfer and social capital for three network types: intracorporate networks, strategic alliances, and industrial districts. We use the strategic alliance of US Manufacturing and its suppliers to illustrate salient social capital dimensions and the conditions and practices that facilitated knowledge transfer. These practices enabled US Manufacturing to improve knowledge transfer, decrease development costs, shorten cycle time, increase the quality of developed deliverables, quickly respond to changes in the regulatory environment, and, most importantly, build strong, strategic relationships with its suppliers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many would claim that the development of electronic commerce is reshaping almost all industries, even to the extent that we are undergoing a paradigm shift. This enthusiasm represents a speculative bubble, what economists would describe as ‘mania’, as we witness increasing numbers of firms embracing the need for an on-line presence, despite the absence of both profits and sales. The recent turn of events, which is referred to as the ‘ dot.com implosion’, indicates that the rapid profit growth that was initially projected is unlikely to be achieved by many. As the technology markets have crashed along with a number of high-profile dot.com collapses, numerous investors have almost turned off from funding this sector. This should come as little surprise. What is of interest is why myriad investors were drawn into financially supporting these start-ups in the first instance. This paper aims to focus on the concept of business-to-consumer commerce and uses mythology for providing some explanation as to why so many investors were lured into participating in the dot.com share bubble. </jats:p>",

To advance current conceptualizations of networked governance, we draw on data from 42 public safety networks and use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We do so because fsQCA allows us to account for the realities of inter-dependence among the concepts and variables we consider and to illuminate the multiple viable governance patterns that are possible. The results show the importance of network-level governance competencies to manage stakeholders and information infrastructure to achieve high effectiveness of PSN. Analysis makes clear that there exist five configurations of PSN governance practices that enable high levels of network governance effectiveness. Common to all these configurations are the network-level competence in managing both stakeholders and the digital infrastructure, suggesting these are necessary (but not sufficient) network-level governance competencies. Building from the analysis, we advance the role of specific network-level governance competencies, and the current conceptualization of network governance more broadly. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 3DayCar programme reveals the principle source of delay during the order fulfilment process in the automotive industry as information processing not manufacturing. This suggests that information and communication technologies (ICT) are crucial in re-shaping industry structure towards customer responsiveness and building to order. This paper reports on the findings of a longitudinal study during a critical period for the industry where firms adopting web-enabled ICT seek to increase inter-organizational collaboration and gain competitive advantage over other supply chains. In all, 75 interviews across 28 firms examine the adoption of business-to-business (B2B) e-procurement and supply systems by vehicle manufacturers (VMs) and suppliers. Forms of organization are represented as a map of industry structure showing supply relationships and firm affiliation to B2B applications. VMs have tended to adopt a short-term price-driven approach using e-hubs and webEDI (electronic data interchange) in their attempts to control cost. Suppliers are concerned over an apparent disregard for firm autonomy, particularly those who have launched ICT projects of their own. Recommendations for the future are considered in light of what such large-scale efforts imply for design, deployment, and uses of ICT in industry settings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past two decades, openness (e.g. ‘open’ innovation, ‘open’ education and ‘open’ strategy) has been of increasing interest for researchers and of increasing relevance to practitioners. Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of “openness”, we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of “openness” characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of “openness”. </jats:p>",

The TAM was originally developed for explaining technology acceptance and has since been successfully applied to a number of technologies. Its suitability for modelling intranet use is considered here. The model is tested in two UK companies from the banking and engineering sectors. Study 1 finds that the TAM may be valuable as a tool for helping with analysing and understanding intranet usage. The second study indicates that its applicability may be variable between intranets and demonstrates that self-report and actual measures of usage are not interchangeable when applying such a model. The findings have implications for previous and current research employing the TAM and for intranet research in general. </jats:p>",

A critical project of this nature is applicable in the information systems (IS) arena, which has a growing tradition of qualitative inquiry. Despite its relativist ontology, actor-network theory places a strong emphasis on empirical inquiry and this paper argues that actor-network theory, with its careful tracing and recording of heterogeneous networks, is well suited to the generation of detailed and contextual empirical knowledge about IS. The intention in this paper is to explore the relevance of IS research informed by actor-network theory in the pursuit of a broader critical research project as defined in earlier work. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do we critically evaluate the social impact of the information and communications technology (ICT) that, in the developed world at least, is central to both economy and society. Market-oriented, functionalist and instrumental views tend to dominate discourse on ICT and the purpose of this paper is to challenge such views by suggesting a critical neo-humanist alternative. Harvey's critical analysis of recent industrial society, Aristotle's concept of phronesis and Heidegger's tool analysis set the scene for the main argument of the paper based on Habermas’ theory of communicative action. Using an illustrative case vignette from the Irish community sector, the paper argues that this theory provides potentially valid philosophical and social theoretical guidelines for a critical interpretive evaluation of the social impact of ICT that focuses attention on normative (‘lifeworld’) as distinct from instrumental (‘system’) forms of rationality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses work practices and organizational culture as situated actions and the implications for information systems innovation uptake. It reports research being conducted in Tanzania that brings an ethnographic research approach to understanding relations between local health care practices and health information systems development, by asking how health workers’ practices and everyday actions are influenced by the context of their specific situation. The research is being conducted in the context of a globally distributed open source software project to introduce and enhance health information systems in developing countries. Drawing on cultural historical activity theory, the study highlights the need for understanding each information system user's and each organization's specific and detailed work processes, and how situational and organizational factors may come together with the health information systems innovation processes in meeting the challenges discussed. In order to establish fully the potential of activity theory to innovation processes, situatedness of work practices focusing on the organization context is emphasized. </jats:p>",

In this paper, I challenge the conventional notion that warrants the primacy of human activities in the study of routines and bring artefacts in general and IT artefacts in particular to the very centre of my theorising. Through an in-depth case study of crown prosecutors’ work, I endeavour to explain the way legislative and IT artefacts are implicated in the transformation of police-prosecutor routines. I show that legislative artefacts play a constitutive role that generates a new role position and a new system of social practices while IT artefacts serve a regulative function that enforces a newly programmed sequence of steps onto pre-existing practices. I argue for the benefits of foregrounding legislative and IT artefacts to develop a nuanced account of organisational routines that responds to recent calls for research that contextualises the IT artefact outside single settings. I draw on the Transformational Model of Social Activity to unpack the causal linkages between legislative and IT artefacts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. </jats:p>",

Established in 1997 in The Netherlands and headquartered in Amersfoort, STATER had 27 business clients and serviced over 80 different mortgage portfolios of more than 450,000 mainly residential loans in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Their mortgage service operations and information systems were considered state-of-the-art in 2002, but they were moving business on-line while simultaneously increasing the types of services provided and expanding operations into Spain, France, and Italy — within the next five years. In a land known for taming the forces of the sea, Tom faced what seemed like a sea of ‘e-uncertainty.’ What exact roles should STATER play in an on-line loan market? How should they position themselves to lead in those roles? The E-Servicing Steering Committee looked to Tom to direct them, and he knew he needed a clear vision for the next Steering Committee meeting in 2 months, in May 2002. </jats:p>",

We examine enterprise social network (ESN) usage data obtained from a community of store managers in a leading Australian retail organization, over a period of 15 months after introduction of the platform. Our interest in examining this data is in spatial communication preferences by the network users, that is, to ascertain who is communicating with whom and where. Our analysis of 12,000 messages exchanged between 530 managers shows that interactions can generally be characterized by individual preferences for local communication but also that two different user communities exist - ‘locals’ and ‘globals’. We develop empirical profiles for these two types of social network user communities, and we compare the empirical results against contrasting theoretical perspectives for spatial preference patterns in communication behaviour. We outline implications for theories on spatial influences on communication behaviours on ESNs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using IT in ways that can trigger major organizational changes creates high-risk, potentially high-reward, situations that I call technochange (for technology-driven organizational change). Technochange differs from typical IT projects and from typical organizational change programs and therefore requires a different approach. One major risk in technochange—that people will not use information technology and related work practices—is not thoroughly addressed by the discipline of IT project management, which focuses on project cost, project schedule, and solution functionality. Organizational change management approaches are also generally not effective on their own, because they take as a given the IT “solutions” developed by a technical team. Consequently, the potential for the IT “solution” to be misaligned with important organizational characteristics, such as culture or incentives, is great. </jats:p><jats:p> Merely combining IT project management and organizational change management approaches does not produce the best results, for two reasons. First, the additive approach does not effectively address the many failure-threatening problems that can arise over the lengthy sequential process of the typical technochange lifecycle. Second, the additive approach is not structured to produce the characteristics of a good technochange solution: a complete intervention consisting of IT and complementary organizational changes, an implementable solution with minimal misfits with the existing organization, and an organization primed to appropriate the potential benefits of the technochange solution. With hard work and care, the combined IT project management plus organizational change approach can be made to work. However, an iterative, incremental approach to implementing technochange can be a better strategy in many situations. The essential characteristic of the technochange prototyping approach is that each phase involves both new IT functionality and related organizational changes, such as redesigned business processes, new performance metrics, and training. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a companion to the paper on generalization in IS research by Williams and Tsang published in this edition of the Journal of Information Technology. Its purpose is to discuss the implications of the robust exchange of views about the meaning of the term ‘generalization’ in four papers, two by Lee and Baskerville, and two by Tsang and Williams. The objectives of this paper are, first, to help the reader understand the issues by summarizing the arguments in the four papers, and second, to assess the implications of the debate for future IS research. Our conclusion is that when the papers are interpreted from the perspectives of the respective pairs of authors, most of what they say is sound. However, because their perspectives are so different, their differences of opinion are also very real. As a way of showing that neither pair of authors’ conception of generalization is the ‘last word’ on this topic, the paper also compares key concepts from both pairs of authors with those from Seddon and Scheepers. It is argued that although the Seddon and Scheepers’ framework is also not the ‘last word’, it may prove more useful than either of the two preceding frameworks. </jats:p>",

As a remedy, the extant literature encourages firms to enhance familiarity between the parties and/or consider using advisory services. In this paper, we seek to examine the effect of knowledge familiarity (client-supplier and supplier-client) and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. Further, we also examine whether the presence of advisors improves innovation outcomes. Our results suggest that a higher degree of relational familiarity and client-supplier knowledge familiarity are associated with better innovation outcomes. We also reveal that client-supplier knowledge familiarity mediates the effect of supplier-client knowledge familiarity on innovation outcomes. We did not find support for the direct effect of advisors on innovation outcomes. Instead, the presence of advisors moderates the effect of supplier-client and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. We consider the implications for the IS outsourcing literature and practice. </jats:p>",

Further, it severely and unreasonably limits the extent to which IS research and researchers can contribute to both pressing organisational problems and the scholarly literature.

    "title": "Management Commitments that Maximize Business Impact from IT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As digitization becomes pervasive, many organizations struggle to drive value from the growing number of IT-related opportunities. We show how the drivers of IT value creation can be framed as firm-wide commitments to a set of IT capabilities. On the basis of 20 published case studies, we identify a small set of IT decisions that organizations must make to use IT to successfully enhance their impact. We group these decisions into a framework of four commitments. Making these commitments helps organizations reinforce what really matters over time, which in turn helps focus the attention of their employees. We demonstrate, via a survey of 210 publicly traded firms, that firms which are more effective in making these four commitments have higher business impact from IT, which in turn correlates with higher financial performance. We suggest the construct of commitment is a step toward unifying the IT value literature and creating an overarching concept that brings together many of the important management practices identified in previous work. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ICT-enabled virtual organisations (VOs) are regarded as the appropriate organisational response to turbulent markets. Although much has been written about the structural characteristics and propositions of VOs, their inherent limitations and structural shortcomings remain largely unaddressed. Based on the structural properties of VOs, most frequently discussed in the literature, we introduce the V-form organisation as an ideal type of VOs. A conceptual analysis, however, reveals a mismatch between espoused benefits of the ideal type and preconditions in terms of collaborative practices needed to succeed in a turbulent environment. Dealing with complex tasks in a collaborative environment requires shared understanding, shared values and a level of social cohesion, which do not simply emerge in a virtual setting. Social capital theory addresses the social and cultural preconditions of collaboration. Our analysis shows preconditions for successful value creation in VOs and suggests management measures to foster and facilitate environments for the development of social capital. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Pervasive Information Systems (IS) exemplify a paradigm where Information Technology is embedded in the physical environment, capable of accommodating user needs and wants when desired. Pervasive IS differ from IS that are based on the desktop paradigm In that they encompass a complex, dynamic environment composed of multiple artifacts, capable of perceiving contextual information and supporting user mobility. Building on the novel properties of pervasive IS, we propose a taxonomical framework assessing the level of ‘pervasiveness’ in a given information system. The framework consists of three interweaving dimensions, namely ubiquity (encompassing mobility and heterogeneity), diffusion (encompassing invisibility and interactivity) and contextual awareness. The framework may be employed either to prospectively inform the design of pervasive IS (by pointing towards pertinent design considerations) or to retrospectively assess the pervasiveness of a system and identify improvement opportunities. We demonstrate both uses, firstly by discussing design priorities for ex ante IS evaluation and secondly by showcasing ex post assessments of a domestic and a corporate pervasive IS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While the uptake of online communities toward development purposes continues to grow, many are characterized by an unresolved tension. On the one hand, they benefit from participation of heterogeneous stakeholders in their efforts to strengthen their expertise. On the other hand, these stakeholders represent highly diverging interests, which makes collective strategic action very challenging. To understand how online communities cope with this tension, we conducted a longitudinal, mixed method case study of an online community focused on development transportation. We argue that online communities are uniquely equipped, through their fluidity and open-endedness, to enable knowledge creation and agenda-setting. In so doing, online communities afford an ‘intermediary space’ that simultaneously accommodates both convergence and divergence of interests. Our study strengthens the bridge between information systems research and development studies, by highlighting the potential of ICT uptake toward ‘remaking participation’ in development debate, while including the perspectives of heterogeneous interest groups. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Editorial: Critical Research in Information Systems: Issue 1",
    "abstract": "This is the  rst of two special issues that are dedicated to critical approaches in information systems (IS) research. Two questions present themselves. What is critical IS? And why is it of such importance that two issues should be dedicated to it? The papers themselves attempt to address these questions, as well as a number of other related issues, but the major aim is to open up critical IS debate rather than to attempt some sort of paradigmatic closure. The authors presented here represent a range of approaches, but they all have in common a focus on advancing both the theoretical and methodological debates within critical IS. Amongst the issues raised are the key topics of emancipation, power relations and a broadened understanding of ‘critical’ research itself. There is no intention here to either draw conceptual battle lines or obscure philosophical differences. Rather, it is in the spirit of looking for connections across the IS research landscape that their work is brought together under the banner of critical IS. It has been suggested that there are three major tasks for critical research: to investigate the nature of phenomena at local levels (a call for in-depth qualitative work), to critique taken-for-granted assumptions underpinning organizational and managerial practices and to develop relevant knowledge and practical understanding that enables change and indicates new ways of working (Alvesson and Deetz, 2000). A number of writers have alluded to epistemological and methodological weaknesses in critical approaches generally. These weaknesses are closely linked, but two of the most commonly cited ones are lack of social theory (speci cally on the nature of emancipation) and an inadequate conceptualization of power. The next two sections highlight how the papers in this issue have attempted to contribute to this debate.",

    "title": "Adoption of Broadband Internet in Korea: The Role of Experience in Building Attitudes",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although many countries are attempting to build an information infrastructure and accelerate the adoption of broadband Internet access technology, the results are not always satisfactory. The focus of earlier research on the diffusion and adoption of broadband Internet access has been primarily on the construction of a national-level infrastructure or on macro-level factors such as government policies, market competition and the density of population. This research highlights the individual-level factors affecting the adoption of broadband access, integrating various views on the adoption and diffusion of technology, including the technology acceptance model, theory of planned behaviour and diffusion of innovation model. An extended technology acceptance model incorporating the notion of perceived resources is proved to be relevant in the adoption of broadband technologies. It was found that innovation attributes, such as compatibility, visibility and result demonstrability, have an impact on constructs in the extended technology acceptance model such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived resources. These results also support the idea that congruent experiences and opportunities in adopting a new technology affect user attitudes through the three extended technology acceptance model constructs above. This research suggests that efforts should be made to expand the compatible experience base of broadband Internet in order to facilitate its adoption and use. This paper also provides an extensive review of the adoption behaviour of individuals by incorporating different views and theories. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Institutional isomorphism has been a major intellectual contribution within institutional theory for three decades. The effects and processes of institutionalization have traditionally focused on stability and persistence of institutions, and more recently on institutional change. This study contributes to the IS field using the lens of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism and change within a highly institutionalized organizational field of health care. The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology. Institutional isomorphic conditions become conflicted with attempts to impose field and organizational change. As clinicians attempt to retain their professional dominance in a climate of almost continuous restructuring of health services, political initiatives to implement EHRs are met with resistance from key stakeholders, resulting in policy changes and further delayed implementation times. </jats:p>",

Ivan Illich's theory of ‘Conviviality of Tools’ enables an analysis of the conviviality of the Internet. Subsequently, this conceptual lens is used to examine empirical data from two Internet-based campaigns. The paper contributes theoretical and practical Implications regarding conviviality of Internet social networks and the accomplishment of conviviality in society. Our findings show that Internet conviviality cannot be treated as an independent variable with deterministic outcomes on society, but as a technology that is shaped by ongoing economic and political forces. The Iranian Internet social networks are not universally accessible, frequently induce fragmented, nonsensical, and enraged discussion and its potential as a tool of liberation is tempered by the Iranian government adaption of systems of surveillance and censorship. We argue that the findings of this study have some general implications of value to researchers studying computerisation movements and Internet social networks in other countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores user and provider experiences with broadband networks. Drawing on data from an early broadband trial and from recent studies of consumer broadband usage, the validity of the commonly held view that widespread adoption of broadband is dependent upon the development of a killer application is challenged. It is argued that access to broadband can be valuable for users without the provision of a killer application and that the dynamics of broadband development are shifting. As more users become content creators and distributors and as it becomes easier for consumers to establish broadband networks without help from traditional providers, the existing relationships within the broadband industry will change. Broadband researchers and stakeholders in the development of broadband networks are encouraged to explore and understand the implications of these changes, recognizing that there is much to be learned about deploying broadband in ways that will create the broad societal benefits promised by its promoters. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate the concept of Smart Business Networks by using Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) to analyse how such a network mitigates the affect of emergent, and therefore unforecastable, demands upon the networked businesses. We examine the requirements for network smartness, highlight some significant properties of one Smart Network and use our case analysis and concepts from systems theory to suggest some general properties such as natural stability and distributed capability. We have found that smartness is distributed and shared behavioural process standards can act to stabilise complex systems. This is important because it mitigates emergent behaviour within increasingly complex business networks. The contributions of our article apply both to academics and business practitioners and are in its illustration and investigation of one Smart Business Network including how the smart capability functions at a strategic, business process and technical level; and the use of Beer's VSM to analyse an electricity market. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study used an earlier critique of the cultural sciences for exploring the ideological basis for the evaluation of outsourcing. Questionnaire and interview responses are presented. These incorporate a range of evaluative criteria, which together represent an indicative list of the benefits and risks of outsourcing. The paper initially suggests that different stakeholders might be impacted on in different ways by benefits and risks. It is suggested that information technology outsourcing evaluation might thus be partial and not neutral in its impact on stakeholders. However, the differences and similarities between stakeholders suggest a subtle interplay of ideological concerns that does not totally deny the interests of all but the dominant stakeholders. Although the evaluation may be partial this does not deny the potential for those who might be presumed to be disadvantaged for making personal gains. However, in making personal gains, an ideology based on economic interests is furthered, thus occluding the opportunity for autonomous and responsible engagement with the process of evaluation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The global digital divide is usually measured in terms of differences between rich and poor countries in the extent to which they use ICTs in general and the Internet in particular. Such a view of the problem, however, ignores the fact that there are all kinds of ways in which poor, illiterate persons in developing countries benefit from the Internet without any use of computers and Internet connectivity. Most of these benefits occur as a result of intermediaries who, in one way or another, transfer relevant parts of the knowledge available from the technology to recipients in a form that is relevant to their specific needs. Using India as an illustration of this argument, we find that usage understates actual beneficiaries by at least 30 percent. On the basis of this finding, we suggest that a reconstrued notion of the digital divide be based on usage as well as other more indirect forms of benefit from the Internet in developing countries. To this end, much more needs to be known about these other forms of benefit in a large sample of countries in addition to India. </jats:p>",

This combined with the increasingly standardization of business processes and the application of modularity at the process level leads to embedded coordination. This case study describes how three unconnected business networks were integrated using modularity at the business process, or activity component, level and the role standardization played to implement embedded coordination. The case study was conducted at ABZ, a trusted Business Service Provisioner in the Dutch insurance industry. This study suggests that embedded coordination leads to improved performance of the business network under the condition that standardization is enforced. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2003, Rob Carter, CIO of international express courier FedEx, launched the ‘Six by Six’ (6 × 6) IT transformation program: a major rationalization and centralization effort to improve FedEx's IT service delivery to its business partners. This teaching case deals with the 6 × 6 efforts made by the IT department for Europe, Middle East, Indian sub-continent and Africa (EMEA). The case focuses on two objectives of the 6 × 6 program: (a) creating a consistent IT environment and (b) increasing delivery bandwidth to the business. Historically, FedEx Express in EMEA had granted high levels of empowerment to local business and IT people. Moreover, FedEx had always supported a ‘can-do’ mentality In both business and IT people. Consequently, the IT department was expected to keep the enterprise systems architecture resilient and supportive of longer-term enterprise growth, while keeping the IT development pipeline aligned with the often unpredictable stream of requests from empowered business constituents. The story begins in 2007, when a new Vice President for IT was appointed for the region. Part A deals with the IT department's efforts to set up a central systems architecture and IT resource estimation review process. Part B deals with demand-side prioritization issues. The suggested teaching plan assumes that Part A is discussed before the students receive Part B. Instructors can use this case to introduce their students to a realistic view on the complex puzzle of establishing enterprise-wide business-IT engagement patterns through IT governance in an empowered and operations-focused business environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The European Conference in Information Systems (ECIS) is now, in 1999, in its seventh year. The conference this year will be in Copenhagen from June 23± 25th. ECIS has been a very successful conference, regularly attracting 300 plus participants, and now widely recognized as the main annual European meeting place for academics in the information systems ® eld. It also increasingly attracts a large number of participants annually from Australasia, South Africa and the USA. ECIS is a heavily refereed conference. The main activities at ECIS centre on refereed papers, there being in 1998, for example, the refereed Research Paper, Case Research and Research-in-Progress tracks. We were the chair tracks for these. Each year there are also Panels and a range of other options which the particular Conference Committee and Standing Committee for that year will choose to develop. In the fourth year ± at Cork ± ECIS also worked together with the Association for Information Systems to initiate a PHD Consortium that runs in the three days before each conference, and that regularly attracts 30 plus candidates drawn from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Two further attractive features of ECIS have been its timing and venues ± European summer and so far the conference has been held in Henley, England; The Netherlands; Athens, Greece; Lisbon, Portugal; Cork, Eire; and Aixen-Provence, France. In 1998 the ECIS standing committee agreed a proposal made by the Journal of Information Technology to publish in a major academic journal a select number of papers developed further out of those referees considered to be the best papers each year. JIT agreed to be the ® rst Journal to undertake this responsibility, and the present issue represents the ® rst results of the process. Each paper in this issue was reviewed by three referees before acceptance ± with revisions ± at the 1998 ECIS conference. Subsequently, each paper was reviewed by the JIT editors and one further reviewer, and in each case further revisions and developments were suggested. As Editors of this Special Issue we are pleased with the results, and particularly with the fact that the papers have come through this academically rigorous process represents such a variety of topics and are from such a wide set of countries and academic backgrounds. This really does give a ̄ avour of the sort of event ECIS has become over the last seven years and this is a major reason why we believe publishing these papers has become such an attractive idea, apart from the fact that each paper in its own right makes a significant contribution to the ® eld.",

    "abstract": "This book could almost be subtitled 'Confessions of a Spod' to adopt the slang by which users of bulletin boards and virtual discussions refer to themselves. Howard Rheingold bases it around his own experience over several years as a user, particularly of a system called WELL. But Rheingold is no preoccupied hacker with limited social skills. He joined an electronic community in the mid-1980s, attracted by the chance to watch a society growing, developing its own conventions and learning how best to use its own peculiar method of communication. His (real life) family became used to seeing him in earnest discussion with the computer, and his description of this society and its members as he meets them is varied, absorbing and at times touching. Without leaving his home, he has met students, medics, librarians and lawyers, many with a story to tell about themselves. He has watched history unfold as it happens, participated in fund-raising for sick members of the community, watched romances made and broken and in extreme cases met people in real life once he had got to know them over the net. Even when he addresses the allegations that such systems are for the lonely, it is refreshing to see that he refuses to be pejorative about users who are lonely: 'one honest answer... is that most people don't have a terribly glamorous life'. Within the virtual world there are numerous communities general fora for asking specialized questions, cult discussions, live chats (the most addictive and potentially damaging to productivity) where users can watch words appear on a screen as their counterpart types them, pornographic bulletin boards with their attendant ethical problems and multiuser dungeons (the connotations of the word dungeon vary amongst different people). There are people hiding behind multiple identities, crafting their own personalities, sometimes creating complete fictitious characters and joining the network in character, sometimes disguising their gender (Rheingold is rather over-charitable on this; in practice most networks have more male than female users, so presenting as a woman is a way of attracting attention). The book is an engaging account of what it feels like to join such a borderless community. While clearly enthused by the network's possibilities, Rheingold ends by looking at some of the drawbacks, not so much of virtual community but of a society where there are no restrictions on spreading information (unfortunately there is no mention of the British Data Protection Act) and the infrastructure to distribute it is very cheap. His (powerful) analogy for people feeling imprisoned by technology is the Panopticon, a prison proposed in the 19th century by Jeremy Bentham where every inmate would be under constant surveillance but unable to see anybody else. Nevertheless, Rheingold raises more questions for the researcher than he answers. When do bulletin boards become addictive? What are the implications of users revealing or concealing their identity? What sort of ethical code is needed to control interactive behaviour on the network? How close to universal access will such networks get in the future? Rheingold has given us a readable and evocative account, but it remains a valuable starting point, with much work still to be done. MARTIN RICH City University Business School",

    "title": "How Chief Executive Officers in Large Organizations View the Management of their Information Systems",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As part of a research programme on key information systems (IS) management issues, a survey of Australasia's largest organizations was conducted to identify which issues were perceived by their chief executive officers (CEOs) as being important, problematic and critical over the next 3–5 years. The results reported are based on a moderate response rate (though perhaps reasonable for the target group) but formal testing showed an absence of non-response bias. The most critical issues were revealed to be a mix of technology management issues (managing and measuring the effectiveness of the information technology (IT) infrastructure, and disaster recovery), strategic management issues (business process redesign, competitive advantage, and information architecture), people and support management issues (organizational learning, and executive and decision support) and systems development and data management issues (effective use of the data resource and effectiveness of software development). This reflects their interest in a wide range of issues, but all with an organization-wide focus. The non-critical issues were mostly related to the individual technologies and the place and role of IS in the organization. While the CEOs showed some agreement with their chief information officers (CIOs) on issues such as the IT infrastructure, competitive advantage and organizational learning, some distinct differences exist, particularly in relation to the quality and effectiveness of systems and processes and also how CEOs and CIOs perceive the IT knowledge of the CEOs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This is an ambitious attempt to provide a historical and non-prescriptive perspective on how computer systems have developed. The authors divide the history into three phases: first hardware, then software then user needs dominate. A final section considers future developments. The approach is set early on in Part One on background and theory. This gives a careful, indeed painstakingly detailed evaluation of previous attempts at history, categorized as hardware generations, organization stages and labour process approaches. Part Two shows how various hardware and software bottlenecks were dealt with, while Part Three probably overstates the degree to which user needs have predominated in the minds ofsuppliers and systems developers in the more recent history of computerization. Part Four provides an interesting and detailed consideration of what Phase Four might entail. At times unnecessarily repetitive, always closely argued, this book is a mine ofinformation on its chosen subject, and Friedman provides fresh insight from his concern to relate technological development with social organization. The extensive bibliography will be useful to students, the publication as whole will be interesting mainly to an academic audience.",

    "title": "Deriving Semantic Data Models from Structured Process Descriptions of Reality",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper begins by describing a generally accepted view of the contemporary information systems development process. This process assumes the direct derivation of a prototype from data models which have themselves been derived from a functionally decomposed representation of reality. The data models are constructed using entity-relationship modelling (ERM) and data flow diagram (DFD) techniques. The paper also considers the use of Petri net representations as structured process models of reality. These representations are a means of structuring the functional analysis of observed situations for which an information system design is required. The paper then suggests a refinement to the model just described. It examines the relationship between the ERM and DFD techniques and proposes the use of logical access mapping (LAM) as a method of synthesizing the product of these two data modelling activities. An example is used to illustrate the derivation of ERM and DFD from Petri nets. Also an example of the refined process model is given. ‘Weak links’ in this model are identified and further work towards establishing a method for formally proving data models is proposed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is a young research field, no more than ten years old, concerned with the development and use of computer systems to support cooperative working. Although researchers and practitioners in this area have many interests in common, there is a great deal of diversity in definitions of and approaches to CSCW. This diversity has arisen despite the clarity of intention of the early seminal papers that attempted to set the agenda for CSCW research. Ten years into the development of this research area, a number of tensions appear to be diluting this initial clarity. These tensions reveal themselves in apparent disjunctions between theoretical papers and statements of intent on the one hand and CSCW practice (research and design) on the other. In this paper a review of the state-of-the-art of CSCW is offered. Some existing systems, and related design and evaluation research, are described. Then three sources of the aforementioned tension are explored: the role of technology in driving or being derived from the science; conceptions of working and cooperative working in particular; and the relationship between CSCW and organization. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Learning from Adopters’ Experiences with ERP: Problems Encountered and Success Achieved",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Enterprise resource planning (ERP) packages touch many aspects of a company's internal and external operations. Consequently, successful deployment and use of ERP systems are critical to organizational performance and survival. This paper presents the results of a study of the problems and outcomes in ERP projects which was conducted under the sponsorship of an ERP systems vendor. Two basic research questions were addressed. First, how successful are companies at different points in time in their ERP experiences and how are different measures of success related? (That is, can early success be followed by failure and vice versa?) Second, what problems do ERP adopters encounter as they implement and deploy ERP and how are these problems related to outcomes? The findings showed that the success of ERP systems depends on when it is measured and that success at one point in time may only be loosely related to success at another point in time. Companies experience problems at all phases of the ERP system life cycle and many of the problems experienced in later phases originated earlier but remained unnoticed or uncorrected. These findings suggest that researchers and companies will do well to adopt broad definitions and multiple measures of success and pay particular attention to the early identification and correction of problems. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Theory building from the points of view of a native, an anthropologist, and a philosopher: Commentary on Suzanne Rivard’s “Theory building is neither an art nor a science. It is a craft”",
    "abstract": "In her debates-and-perspectives paper, “Theory building is neither an art nor a science. It is a craft,” Rivard (2020) offers a firsthand, eyewitness account of theory building. She distills years of her own experience with, and observations of, theory building into a fascinating account crowded with details of the activity of theory building—an activity that the title of her paper emphasizes to be a craft. We readers of her paper are fortunate to be able to share, and profit from, the wisdom that Rivard imparts. Rivard’s account is just a seed that she is planting. From this seed, much can grow. First, from the perspective of a “native” of the world of information systems researchers, what else could be said? Second, not from the perspective of a native, but from the perspective of an “anthropologist” studying the natives, what might be added? Third, from the perspective of philosophy, what helpful commentary on Rivard’s argument can be made? But before we tackle these questions, we first address what is meant by “art,” “science,” and “craft.”",

    "title": "Book Review: Business Process Re-engineering: The Use of Process Redesign and IT to Transform Corporate Performance",
    "abstract": "The subtitle of the book explains the considerable interest which Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) is arousing amongst both business and IT managers. Transforming corporate performance has been an elusive goal, and never was it more needed than now. BPR, also known as Business Process Redesign, Business Process Management, Process Innovation etc., aims to 'get back to basics' by centring attention on the core processes of an organization and challenging assumptions about why (and how) they are carried out. Because innovative use of IT can sometimes break the mould and act as a catalyst for change, BPR also encourages a convergence of business and IT strategy, and this in itself would be more than welcome to executives wondering if they are getting value for money from IT. The central principle behind BPR is that 'business as usual' and incremental improvements are not enough: businesses today need radical approaches and step changes in productivity, service and quality to compete effectively. The quote at the head of chapter 6 (Konosuki Matsushita) expresses the problem: 'Your firms are built on the Taylor model. Even worse, so are your heads '\" The survival of firms ... depends on the day-to-day mobilization of every ounce of intelligence' . Frederick Taylor, the 'Father of Scientific Management', focused attention around the turn of the century on efficiency, which was optimized by breaking down work into tasks which could be analysed and routinized (a practice enthusiastically taken up in the 1960s and 1970s by countless 0 & M departments in most large companies). The first two chapters examine some of the implications of Taylorism: the rise of the functional organization, characterized by separate departments, intricate job specifications and an inward-looking culture. Bureaucracy has also contributed to a management style of fire-fighting, an incremental approach to IT projects and huge problems in knitting the organization together through common work practices and systems. In contrast, businesses today need to look beyond individual functions to whole processes, break down organizational boundaries, broaden jobs to embrace 201",

Certainly for academics and researchers the book will be of considerable value; however, its value to the practising manager, especially the senior manager, may be harder to evaluate. He or she may not be in a position to consider and adopt many of the proposals included, through either pressure of work or simply a lack of understanding about the importance of considering the human implications of AMT.

    "abstract": "of conferences at Bled Slovenia from 25th–28th June. The  rst two days see an Electronic Commerce conference that has been run successfully at Bled annually for a number of years. It is always well attended. In parallel at Bled is the AIS PHD Colloquium, which began life at Cork, Eire and has been run each year since and has always attracted strong participation from students and academic staff alike. This year’s programme chair is Kalle Lyttinen. The European Conference For Information Systems (ECIS) then runs from 27th–29th June 2001 with the dinner and award ceremony on the  nal night. ECIS has attracted this year a strong group of papers, and has organized some very interesting panels and presentations. Of course Bled itself is worth a visit at any time, but the academic content and networking opportunities provided by having these two conferences running consecutively in the same place means that the events are likely to be over-subscribed, so you are advised to book early this year. The June issue of JIT will be a special edition, with Guest Editors, Jacky Swan and Harry Scarborough, putting together a strong selection of papers on the theme of Knowledge Management: Concepts and Controversies. Their contributions include a number of good papers linking IT, organization and knowledge management (some more theoretical, others combining theory and practice). A feature is their inclusion of critical re ections (not in the negative sense) on the role/potential role of IT in knowledge management. The papers will include a specially commissioned piece by Claudio Ciborra.",

    "title": "Effects of Transparency: Analyzing Social Biases on Trader Performance in Social Trading",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social Trading platforms combine the trading functionalities of classical online broker services with the communication and interaction features of social networks. Next to following other users’ profiles, a main characteristic of social trading platforms is the possibility to follow other users by automatically copying their trades. By being a technologically based financial intermediary that enables individual profit maximization, social trading platforms constitute a contemporary example of financialization. Our empirical analysis of the behavior of traders on a social trading platform provides new insights on financialization related questions regarding the influence of transparency and interaction in delegated investment environments. The disposition effect is a well-studied behavioral bias of investors and traders. Human investors tend to realize returns of their winning positions too early and let unfavorable positions accumulate losses for too long. We find that on social trading platforms the traders’ sensitivity to the disposition effect is influenced by the amount of attention they receive from their followers who invested capital into the traders’ strategy. These novel insights propose a link between principal-agent theory and the disposition effect induced by transparency mechanisms. We extend the literature on trader-investor interaction channels in social trading networks. The results obtained in a social network environment are of high relevance for regulators who have a strong focus on customer protection and financial services regulation. They also provide guidelines for platform designers, traders, investors and social trading platform operators. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Craig Knight, Asia Pacific Digital Business and Customer Services Manager of Eastman Chemical Company, was given a mandate to sell Eastman's philosophy for an integrated electronic supply chain, otherwise known as the Integrated System Solution (ISS), to its business partners in the region, and to encourage adoption. Having invested in a state-of-the-art technical architecture that would support interconnectivity with all parties along the supply chain, Eastman was keen to realise the full benefits to be gained from an integrated e-supply chain on a global scale. Following numerous rounds of discussion with key business partners in the Asia Pacific region, some progress had been made. Nagase &amp; Co., Ltd. of Japan had agreed to adopt ISS connections with Eastman, but had some reservations regarding the extent of integration. Although the benefits of integration were proven, suppliers, customers, distributors and other interested parties were faced with numerous limitations and considerations that would have significant implications on their established business processes and even the shaping of their corporate strategy. Adoption was not a simple choice. Craig understood these shortcomings and was making every effort to ease the adoption process by identifying the longer-term benefits to Nagase and other business partners of applying XML technology to their businesses. </jats:p>",

The path from performance expectancy and user satisfaction to IT utilization was positive and significant. While the path from implicit social influence to IT utilization was found to be significant, explicit social influence had no significant influence on users’ IT utilization.

This paper investigates the current practice of information technology project configuration from a management viewpoint. It is based on a series of semi-structured interviews across a range of medium to large organizations in the UK, including both users and providers of IT services. It finds that project requirements, strategic IT policies, risk management, pragmatic considerations, the managed exploitation of experience and the managed adoption of new technologies drive individual project configuration. The paper proposes a new integrated model that explicitly identifies the drivers of project configuration management. It illustrates the model using a published case study and generates directions for further research and implications for practitioners. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a plethora of theories to explore the disciplines of business, management and sociology, with institutional theory being widely used to explore a range of research challenges. In the area of Information Systems (IS), the use of institutional theory remains in its infancy, with much potential for adoption. Much of the rationale underpinning the proposed research is that a systematic review and synthesis of the normative literature may support the direction of further research and the use of institutional theory in exploring pertinent research challenges facing the IS community. This study also serves to signpost cross-disciplinary research, and thus opens up a whole new research paradigm. Therefore, this article seeks to provide a bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to institutional theory to ascertain the current ‘state of play’ of the theory. Information on a series of variables was extracted after conducting a review of 511 articles across various disciplines that have utilised institutional theory, published in 210 peer-reviewed journals between 1978 and 2008. The findings suggest that the positivist paradigm, empirical and quantitative research, the survey method and organisation/firm as a unit of analysis was used predominantly in combination with institutional theory. The results of this study may have implications for researchers, journal editors, reviewers and universities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An organization depends on quality information for effective operations and decisionmaking. However, there is still no agreement as to how quality should be defined in terms of specific quality categories and criteria. Proposed information quality frameworks have limitations with respect to either consistency, resulting from a non-theoretical approach to framework development, or scope, considering only objective but not subjective information quality perspectives. In this paper, we describe a unique research approach to framework development that addresses these problems and compare it to those used previously for other frameworks. Semiotic theory, the philosophical theory of signs, is used to ensure rigor and scope. It provides a theoretical basis for framework structure - quality categories and their criteria - and for integrating objective and subjective quality views. Empirical refinement based on academic, practitioner, and end-user focus groups is then used to ensure relevance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This papers shows that the management of contractual relationships in IS/IT outsourcing is not only receiving greater attention in academic research, but that it has also moved into focus of companies with high outsourcing degrees. This shift of management attention is accompanied by observable changes in IT organizations’ design, revealing an underrepresented but promising research topic. While prior research has predominantly explored single aspects, for example, supplier selection or relationship building, this article takes a more holistic approach on IT supplier relationship management (SRM) with a focus on organizational design. A conceptual framework, covering three core elements of organizational design, strategy, structure and process, guided the multiple case study on IT SRM in five client IT organizations. One key finding from sourcing strategy is that IT organizations have in parts significantly and abruptly reduced their number of suppliers in the last years, a phenomenon typically well known in the automobile industry. With regard to structure, different organizational models are presented, varying upon their degree of centralization and mode of sourcing. The concept of a hybrid (centralized-decentralized) structure, where a central unit fulfills SRM activities, was shown to be the predominant model within our case organizations. Design and potential benefits of this barely examined model are discussed in detail and empirical examples are provided respectively. As a third organizational design component, formal processes and lateral connections are presented as a means to bridge barriers between organizational entities central to IT SRM. Finally, various opportunities for future research are illustrated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This Wiley Series is already notable for a number of very interesting texts. This is another well produced, detailed volume, though one can question why in a 1991 publication, in an area as fast moving and voluminously written about as information systems, except in the section on telework, it is difficult to find a reference after 1987. The book is organized into four sections. The first covers fundamental issues, including the organizational scan and scope of DIS, the nature of office technology, and the integration of business systems, the strategic use of DIS and the likely impacts of DIS. Much of this is well-trodden ground but is clearly discussed, with interesting case examples. Part Two covers operational issues in OIS, namely planning and needs analysis for OIS, an.d implementing and evaluating OIS. The needs analysis section provides the more original material here, but the section on evaluation comes in at just over two pages and is far too brief to be helpful. Part Three lo.oks at using computers to monitor performance, flexible work and OIS, and end-user computing. A managerial perspective is assumed throughout, and key management questions are usefully highlighted. Part Four looks at OIS and the future, with the authors suggesting that IS needs to be much more focussed on organizational processes and required organizational goals. OIS applied without a clear understanding of the business 'is a recipe for disaster'. The authors provide an informative introduction to the practitioners and students they address, and on a few subjects they provide something more than that.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The efficacy of information and communication technology (ICT) projects and initiatives in developing countries, and how they may assist poverty reduction or otherwise improve the quality of life for communities in those countries, is still a topic of debate. Knowledge empowers people, while information technology integrates such knowledge for purposeful action and reaction. This paper describes a framework, based on social capital and knowledge management theories, which aims to further that debate in the field of information systems. The framework is primarily a sensitising device, designed to assist thinking about how social capital and knowledge theories facilitate ICT interventions for poverty reduction. The framework has four stages, the process of ICT development, the ICT intervention, the evaluation of the impact of the ICT intervention and the process of poverty reduction, which is the final and most contested stage of an ICT intervention. Each stage of the framework is discussed, using illustrations from various development projects. Finally, the paper draws some conclusions about the contribution of social capital and knowledge management theories to the issue of ICT intervention and evaluation in developing countries. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A qualitative systematic review of trust in technology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although many information systems (IS) scholars have researched the antecedents and consequences of trust in technology, the sheer amount of work published, authors’ use of inconsistent construct terms, and variations in conceptualization and measurement make it difficult to compare and aggregate findings across studies. To provide scholars with an overview of the literature, we performed a systematic qualitative review of the IS literature. The goal of our review was to identify the antecedents and consequences of trust in technology that have received frequent empirical support, as well as those for which the evidence is not yet conclusive. To that end, we curated a glossary of unique construct terms and summarized the results of 241 relationships tested in 62 empirical research articles (both quantitative and qualitative) from the AIS “Basket of Eight” journals. From these, we identified 62 unique relationships: 22 are well-supported, 6 are supported by suggestive evidence, and 34 have received little support. These relationships summarize what is well-known and less well-known within the literature. By taking stock, we prepare a path for future research on the phenomenon of trust in the context of emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and blockchain). We conclude the paper with opportunities and directions for future research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study reports on the experience of the First Atlantic Bank of Nigeria as it embarked on the implementation and introduction of Internet and mobile banking services. Based on the concept of a logic of opposition the study conceptualizes the case company's effort with a specific emphasis on the mode and impact of learning that occurred intra- and inter-organizationally. The case considers how being a first mover in a given market can be crucial, not necessarily because of the immediate commercial benefit, but more because of the opportunity for developing customers’ trust in order to ensure the success of future innovations. In addition, the case illustrates the problematic nature of evaluating the success or failure of an innovation. Further, it shows how failure can be an intermediate step to future success, while making the point, counter-intuitively perhaps, that blindly listening to customers may prove to be a barrier to successful innovations. Thus, firms might capitalize from what might initially be perceived as failure, in particular through transforming an opposing force into a promoting one. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Accounting Executives and it Outsourcing Recommendations: An Experimental Study of the Effect of CIO Skills and Institutional Isomorphism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although substantial effort has been devoted to understanding how cost issues drive Information Technology outsourcing (ITO), several researchers have proposed that this narrow focus ignores the role of more subtle factors. This paper addresses this concern by investigating internal and external influences on accounting executives’ recommendations to outsource the IT infrastructure. Using resource-based and institutional theories, we hypothesize that when the chief information officer's (CIO's) skills are strong, accounting executives will more likely advise against outsourcing. But when the skills are weak, accountants are more likely to mimic the outsourcing actions of industry peers. Our findings support this expectation. These results should interest IS, accounting, and general management scholars. Strategic IT choices are a collegial decision which include contributions from multiple members of the top management team. Senior accounting executives are routinely involved in such evaluations, providing initial projections and monitoring the consequent progress. In addition, recent US regulations have made accounting executives personally responsible for the effectiveness of internal controls, including those over the IT infrastructure. The accounting executives’ recommendations on ITO in this context often becomes decisive, and factors behind this recommendation should be fully explored. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Historical perspectives are only timidly entering the world of IS research compared to historical research in management or organisation studies. If major IS outlets have already published history-oriented papers, the number of historical papers - although increasing - remains low. We carried out a thematic analysis of all papers on History and IS published between 1972 and 2009 indexed on ABI and papers indexed in Google Scholar<jats:sup>™</jats:sup> for the same period. We used a typology developed by theorists Üsdiken and Kieser, who classify historical organisation research into supplementarist, integrationist and reorientationist approaches. We outline their links with the epistemological stances well known in IS research, positivism, interpretivism and critical research; we then focus on their differences and historiographical characteristics. We found that most IS History papers are supplementarist descriptive case studies with limited uses of History. This paper then suggests that IS research could benefit from adopting integrationist and reorientationist historical perspectives and we offer some examples to illustrate how that would contribute to enriching, extending and challenging existing theories. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The process of information systems (IS) design has been dominated by the demands inherent in providing a technical solution to a perceived problem or need. Engineering IS design methods applied in order to satisfy the problem situation tend to have a preoccupation with verifying specifications as being mathematically correct. Difficulties arise when the ideas underpinning verification are extended in an attempt to ‘prove’ the validity of a proposed design for an IS. A pure engineering approach does not facilitate a response to the subjective elements within social situations, which experience has shown to be essential in demonstrating the pertinence of new designs to those concerned. We suggest that, by applying interpretivist systems ideas, it is possible to support concerned individuals in reflecting upon crucial aspects of the inquiry, enabling those individuals to judge the relevance or ‘authenticity’ of the learning, according to their own values and beliefs. The elements of participants, engagement, authority, relationships and learning are suggested as being crucial. These make up the mnemonic PEArL, which is offered as an aide-mémoire for those concerned with IS design. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The notion of the agile workforce has been discussed as central to creating the agile organization, which achieves superior environmental responsiveness in contexts of turbulence and change. Previous agility research has focused overly on the organization, paying scant attention to the workforce. This paper addresses a significant gap in agility research by reporting on the first empirical study to examine how the pressures of organizational agility impact upon the workforce. Survey evidence from 515 UK organizations is used for eliciting an initial indicator of workforce agility. The data suggest that agile workforces acquire the five capabilities of intelligence, competencies, collaboration, culture and information systems (IS). From an information technology (IT) perspective the determinants of workforce agility are flexible infrastructure platforms that support the rapid introduction of new IS and the enhancement of IT competencies across the entire workforce. The survey also revealed that information and communications technology applications increase workforce agility most when used for collaborative working. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards a Theory of Organizational Information Services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of information technology (IT) in organizations has undergone dramatic changes during the past 30 years. As a result, it has become increasingly common to adopt services rather than traditional systems perspective to more accurately capture contemporary practices. There is, however, a lack of theories that can help us understand, assess, and design information services in organizational contexts. On this backdrop, we combine general notions of information processing options and requirements to outline a contingency theory of organizational use of information services. The theory suggests that information services are configurations of heterogeneous information processing capabilities; these services are evoked by organizational actors to help execute tasks, and evoking different configurations may lead to equally satisfactory outcomes. The theory distinguishes between four types of services computational, adaptive, networking, and collaborative services, and it suggests that organizational actors need portfolios of information services that are suited to the equivocality and uncertainty profile of the information processing they face. The paper defines four types of services and how they relate to information processing requirements; it applies the theory to a study of information services in response to vehicle policing; and it outlines how the theory relates to standardization and unintended consequences of information services. We conclude by discussing the theory and its implications for research and practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> More than 10 years ago, Orlikowski and Iacono (2001) examined the conceptualization of Information Technology (IT) in Information Systems Research (ISR) articles published in the 1990s. Their main conclusion was that the majority of these articles did not properly conceptualize the IT artifact. They recommended that IS researchers start to theorize about the IT artifact and employ rich conceptualizations of IT. The Orlikowski and Iacono paper provides a strong anchor point from which to analyze the evolution of the IS discipline. In order to obtain an up-to-date image of contemporary IS research, and to assess how the IS field has evolved since the 1990s, we carried out a similar analysis on a more recent and broader set of articles, that is, the full set (N = 644) of papers published between 2006 and 2009 by six top North American (ISR, MISQ, JAIS) and European (JIT, ISJ, EJIS) journals. The statistics in our results reveal no drastic advance in terms of deeper engagement with the IT artifact; more than 39% of the articles in our set are virtually mute about the artifact, and less than 16% employ an ensemble view of IT. Moreover, we note differences among the North American and European journals. Implications of the findings for two perspectives central to the IS research legitimacy debate are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the offshoring of knowledge work has accelerated, theoretical models to explain the phenomenon have not kept up. Most theoretical models assume a static transactional relationship from various factors to a binary offshoring decision. Such models do not take into account the mix of sourcing choices at the level of a firm, nor do they consider dynamic changes over time. To help fill these gaps, we use five case studies on offshore migration of software work by major US companies. Data were collected from senior executives. We use these data to develop a dynamic conceptual model that incorporates three factor groupings which collectively help explain offshore sourcing outcomes: (1) economic factors; (2) the nature of the development activity; and (3) managerial capabilities and practices. Importantly, the model includes five feedback loops among sourcing decisions, sourcing mix, and these three factors. Thus, the relationships in the model are not unidirectional, nor static; rather, they are Iterative and dynamic, involving feedback loops, learning, and cumulative effects over time. In this dynamic model, the sourcing ‘mix,’ a continuously changing offshore portfolio, is a key firm-level dependent variable, closer to the economic concept of a ‘stock’ measure that represents the cumulative effect of sourcing decisions over time. This variable may be measured in different ways, for instance as the amount of work done offshore, or the number of workers employed offshore. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Attempts to summarise Claudio Ciborra's work through a single theme cannot succeed due to its breadth and the ease in which he moved between subjects. This paper is a tentative attempt to discover a common theme in his work, with the notion of knowledge identified as an appropriate starting point. Encompassing learning and rationality, the theme of knowledge has been persistent and evolving in Ciborra's work, with three knowledge combinations reflecting its development: knowledge-rationality, knowledge-learning and everyday-knowledge. The first combination depicts rationality as a catalyst in the pursuit of specific objectives that determine knowledge. Ciborra continued his exploration of knowledge by theorising that background knowledge structure objectives were the basis of sense-making and organisational action, while short-term knowledge structure was required to address developing situations. This introduced and provided the foundation for the knowledge-learning combination. Ciborra's final knowledge combination was predicated on the interpretation of reality as created by the experiences of the individual, including participation in organisational life where feelings, moods and the totality of existence is expressed, delineating the everyday-knowledge combination in the process. Ciborra utilised these and other approaches like the learning ladder in his investigation of complex multilayered subjects like information systems, undertaken from among others, a phenomenological vantage point that shaped many of his key contributions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ICT innovation is known to significantly elevate a country's growth and to enhance productivity. It is now well-acknowledged that emerging economies are beginning to innovate at a rapid rate despite some of the challenges they face. Given that these countries with such economies now comprise a third of the world's largest 25 economies, and that they are likely to be critical for the success of a global economy, it is important to understand how these economies innovate, what factors affect innovation in such nations, and what are the impacts. However, to the best of our knowledge, little research till date has been conducted on this topic, and the few existing studies have failed to catch the attention of the mainstream IS research community. We believe that the absence of studies is primarily due to a lack of understanding of what has been found with respect to ICT innovation in emerging economies, what needs to be studied, and how they should be studied. We attempt to contribute in this area by: (1) providing a comprehensive framework of existing research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, (2) highlighting the gaps that have been left behind, and (3) providing specific guidelines to future researchers, including a research model summarizing the salient issues that need examination. We believe that our study makes an important contribution to research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, and can be a useful resource for future researchers interested in this topic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The recently developed knowledge-based view of the firm argues that knowledge is the firm's most valuable resource. Within this field of study, informal social networks are rapidly gaining attention as mechanisms that facilitate knowledge flows. Electronic networks of practice (NoPs) are a special case of informal network where the sharing of practice-related knowledge occurs primarily through computer-based communication technologies. However, we know relatively little about the dynamics of knowledge exchange that occur in these electronic networks. This conceptual paper posits that there is a relationship between the structural properties of electronic NoPs and successful knowledge exchange. The theoretical positions of social network theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm are used to support this claim. A review of the extant literature reveals that a clear conceptual framework for NoPs is lacking. The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of such a framework by addressing a largely neglected area within the growing network of practice literature – namely, the relationship between electronic network communication structure and knowledge flows. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Big-data business models: A critical literature review and multiperspective research framework",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of “big data” offers organizations unprecedented opportunities to gain and maintain competitive advantage. Trying to exploit the strategic business potential embedded in big data, many organizations have started to renovate their business models or develop new ones, giving rise to the phenomenon of big-data business models. Although big-data business model research is still in its infancy, a significant number of studies on the topic have been published since 2014. We thus suggest it is time to perform a critical review and assessment of the literature at the intersection of business models and big data (analytics), thereby responding to recent calls for further research on and sustained analysis of big-data business models. In particular, our review uses three major criteria (big-data business model types, dimensions, and deployment) to assess the state of the big-data business model literature and identify shortcomings in this literature. On this basis, we derive and discuss five central research perspectives (supply chain, stakeholder, ethics, national, and process), providing guidance for future research and theory development in the area. These perspectives also have practical implications on how to address the current big-data business model deployment gap. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the European economy. A critical challenge faced by SME leaders, as a consequence of the continuing digital technology revolution, is how to optimally align business strategy with digital technology to fully leverage the potential offered by these technologies in pursuit of longevity and growth. There is a paucity of empirical research examining how e-leadership in SMEs drives successful alignment between business strategy and digital technology fostering longevity and growth. To address this gap, in this paper we develop an empirically derived e-leadership model. Initially we develop a theoretical model of e-leadership drawing on strategic alignment theory. This provides a theoretical foundation on how SMEs can harness digital technology in support of their business strategy enabling sustainable growth. An in-depth empirical study was undertaken interviewing 42 successful European SME leaders to validate, advance and substantiate our theoretically driven model. The outcome of the two stage process – inductive development of a theoretically driven e-leadership model and deductive advancement to develop a complete model through in-depth interviews with successful European SME leaders – is an e-leadership model with specific constructs fostering effective strategic alignment. The resulting diagnostic model enables SME decision makers to exercise effective e-leadership by creating productive alignment between business strategy and digital technology improving longevity and growth prospects. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Virtual communities and social networks assume and consume more aspects of people's lives. In these evolving social spaces, the boundaries between actual and virtual reality, between living individuals and their virtual bodies, and between private and public domains are becoming ever more blurred. As a result, users and their presentations of self, as expressed through virtual bodies, are increasingly entangled. Consequently, more and more Internet users are cyborgs. For this reason, the ethical guidelines necessary for Internet research need to be revisited. We contend that the IS community has paid insufficient attention to the ethics of Internet research. To this end, we develop an understanding of issues related to online human subjects research by distinguishing between a disembodied and an entangled view of the Internet. We outline a framework to guide investigators and research ethics committees in answering a key question in the age of cyborgism: When does a proposed Internet study deal with human subjects as opposed to digital material? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> For many organizations, maintaining and upgrading enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (large packaged application software) is often far more costly than the initial implementation. Systematic planning and knowledge of the fundamental maintenance processes and maintenance-related management data are required in order to effectively and efficiently administer maintenance activities. This paper reports a revelatory case study of Government Services Provider (GSP), a high-performing ERP service provider to government agencies in Australia. GSP ERP maintenance-process and maintenance-data standards are compared with the IEEE/EIA 12207 software engineering standard for custom software, also drawing upon published research, to identify how practices in the ERP context diverge from the IEEE standard. While the results show that many best practices reflected in the IEEE standard have broad relevance to software generally, divergent practices in the ERP context necessitate a shift in management focus, additional responsibilities, and different maintenance decision criteria. Study findings may provide useful guidance to practitioners, as well as input to the IEEE and other related standards. </jats:p>",

We speculate that these changes are currently indeterminate due to ongoing confusion among the impacts of first and second-level effects, the roles of ICT in redefining access to data, and the importance of localized, social structures of real estate markets. To develop these findings, we take an institutional perspective and draw on multiple data collection methods. This provides us a means to highlight the value of an institutional perspective for studying industrial-level change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Big data and the mechanisms by which it is produced and disseminated introduce important changes in the ways information is generated and made relevant for organizations. Big data often represents miscellaneous records of the whereabouts of large and shifting online crowds. It is frequently agnostic, in the sense of being produced for generic purposes or purposes different from those sought by big data crunching. It is based on varying formats and modes of communication (e.g., texts, image and sound), raising severe problems of semiotic translation and meaning compatibility. Crucially, the usefulness of big data rests on their steady updatability, a condition that reduces the time span within which this data is useful or relevant. Jointly, these attributes challenge established rules of strategy making as these are manifested in the canons of procuring structured information of lasting value that addresses specific and long-term organizational objectives. The developments underlying big data thus seem to carry important implications for strategy making, and the data and information practices with which strategy has been associated. We conclude by placing the understanding of these changes within the wider social and institutional context of longstanding data practices and the significance they carry for management and organizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Considerable research has focused on the positive effects of information technology use. However, emerging research and practice commentary highlight the importance of considering the negative side of information technology use. The current study investigates how enterprise social media use (i.e. work- and social-related use) influences employees’ perceived overload (i.e. information and social overload), which in turn affects enterprise social media-related strain. In addition, we posit that communication visibility moderates the nonlinear relationship between enterprise social media use and overload. Using a survey of 282 enterprise social media users in the workplace as a basis, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between work-related enterprise social media use and information overload and between work-related enterprise social media use and social overload. Moreover, a U-shaped relationship is found between social-related enterprise social media use and information overload and between social-related enterprise social media use and social overload. Communication visibility positively moderates the inverted U-shaped relationships between work-related enterprise social media use and information overload and between work-related enterprise social media use and social overload, but negatively moderates the U-shaped relationship between social-related enterprise social media use and information overload. The theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. </jats:p>",

Following this critique, the principles of Grounded Design are presented. Grounded Design is applied in case studies where we reconstruct the social practices observed before and during the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts. We call these context-specific research endeavors ‘design case studies.’ In conducting these case studies, Grounded Design builds upon well-established research methods such as ethnographical field studies, participatory design and action research. To support the transferability of its situated findings, Grounded Design suggests documenting increasing numbers of design case studies to create an extended, comparative knowledge base. Comparing cases allows for the emergence of bottom-up concepts dealing with the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts in social practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of the user has persisted in information systems research and practice since the field’s inception in the 1950s. However, the roles that people play and the activities they perform have changed considerably over time. People now engage with digital technologies for all kinds of activities and in all kinds of ways, including for both personal and professional purposes. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to reconceptualize the term “user.” We discuss the various activities that people engage in with digital technologies, the myriad roles they play, and an essential shift in what the term “user” means. Users might be active in shaping how a particular information system is used, they might be partners with an information system, they might be used by an information system, and they may spend sizable parts of their lives living essentially within information systems. We conclude by discussing the implications for the IS discipline of reconceptualizing the term “user.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital transformation (DT) offers organizations the opportunity for operational and strategic innovation, leading to increased efficiencies and transformative changes. However, successfully implementing DT initiatives requires collaboration among diverse stakeholders with varying perspectives, motivations, and capabilities. This study explores how stakeholders frame the DT process to achieve alignment and implement DT initiatives. Drawing upon the concepts of frames and frame alignment mechanisms, the study examines how stakeholders strategically influence each other’s interpretations through frame alignment mechanisms. A case study of a council-wide DT initiative in an Australian city council was conducted to analyze stakeholders' strategic alignment efforts. The findings reveal differing interpretations of the DT process among stakeholders and the strategic efforts to align the various interpretations through a frame transformation of planning, implementation, and communication frames. Based on the findings, a process model for achieving alignment in DT initiatives is proposed, capturing the dynamic nature of frames and their interactions. This study contributes to the understanding of stakeholder dynamics and strategic framing in the context of DT initiatives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies for over 30 years have consistently indicated that enterprise-level Business-Information Technology (IT) alignment is a pervasive problem. While significant progress has been made to understand alignment, research on IT alignment is still plagued by several problems. First, most alignment models approach alignment as a static relationship in contrast to analyzing the scope and variance of activities through which the alignment is (or can be) attained. Second, most alignment models are not founded on strong theoretical foundations. Third, because of their static view, these models do not guide how organizations can improve alignment. This study addresses these weaknesses using a capability-based lens. It formulates and operationalizes a formative construct rooted in the theory of dynamic capabilities and defines the scope and nature of activities that contribute to alignment. The construct identifies six dimensions promoting alignment: (1) IT-Business Communications; (2) Use of Value Analytics; (3) Approaches to Collaborative Governance; (4) Nature of the affiliation/partnership; (5) Scope of IT initiatives; and (6) Development of IT Skills. The construct measures are validated in terms of their dimensionality, item pool sampling, and the nomological and predictive validity. The research uses Partial Least Squares (PLS) to statistically validate the construct using a dataset covering over 3000 global participants including nearly 400 Fortune 1000 companies. All construct dimensions contribute significantly to the level of alignment and the construct shows strong nomological and predictive validity by demonstrating a statistically significant impact on firm performance. Scholars can leverage this research to explore additional activity-based constructs of IT-business alignment. </jats:p>",

We find that CDOs intentionally draw on the term “digital” to distance themselves from existing executive roles in order to gain legitimacy. CDOs as institutional entrepreneurs take a focal role in both: (1) articulating and developing the emerging “digital” logic of action and (2) enacting this digital logic through strategies such as grafting, bridging, and decoupling to navigate tensions between the existing and emerging approaches to innovation with digital technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Theories of decision-making have long been important foundations for information systems research and much of the information system is concerned with information processing for decision-making. The discipline of behavioral economics provides the dominant contemporary approach for understanding human decision-making. Therefore, it is logical that information systems research that involves decision-making should consider behavioral economics as a foundation or reference theory. Surprisingly, and despite calls for greater use of behavioral economics in information systems research, it seems that information systems has been slow to adopt contemporary behavioral economics as reference theory. This article reports a critical analysis of behavioral economics in all fields of information systems based on an intensive investigation of quality information systems research using bibliometric content analysis. The analysis shows that information systems researchers have a general understanding of behavioral economics, but their use of the theories has an ad hoc feel where only a narrow range of behavioral economic concepts and theories tend to form the foundation of information systems research. The factors constraining the adoption of behavioral economic theories in information systems are discussed and strategies for the use of this influential foundation theory are proposed. Guidance is provided on how behavioral economics could be used in various aspects of information systems. The article concludes with the view that behavioral economic reference theory has the potential to transform significant areas of information systems research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) has initiated a paradigm shift in data protection toward greater choice and sovereignty for individuals and more accountability for organizations. Its strict rules have inspired data protection regulations in other parts of the world. However, many organizations are facing difficulty complying with the EU-GDPR: these new types of data protection regulations cannot be addressed by an adaptation of contractual frameworks, but require a fundamental reconceptualization of how companies store and process personal data on an enterprise-wide level. In this paper, we introduce the resource-based view as a theoretical lens to explain the lengthy trajectories towards compliance and argue that these regulations require companies to build dedicated, enterprise-wide data management capabilities. Following a design science research approach, we propose a theoretically and empirically grounded capability model for the EU-GDPR that integrates the interpretation of legal texts, findings from EU-GDPR-related publications, and practical insights from focus groups with experts from 22 companies and four EU-GDPR projects. Our study advances interdisciplinary research at the intersection between IS and law: First, the proposed capability model adds to the regulatory compliance management literature by connecting abstract compliance requirements to three groups of capabilities and the resources required for their implementation, and second, it provides an enterprise-wide perspective that integrates and extends the fragmented body of research on EU-GDPR. Practitioners may use the capability model to assess their current status and set up systematic approaches toward compliance with an increasing number of data protection regulations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the increasing demand for digitalization, organizations look to emerging technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to increase their business performance. This makes it essential to identify and select the most suitable processes to maximize the benefits for organizations. However, despite the increasing interest of academics and professionals in RPA, the literature lacks a study on the main criteria organizations should consider to decide which processes to automate. Therefore, this research lists the main criteria for process automation based on scientific and professional know-how. A systematic literature review was performed, followed by a Delphi study with RPA professionals, to tune the former insights collected from the scientific literature. Our findings point to 32 criteria that organizations and decision-makers should consider before choosing which processes to automate. Feasibility, process description, and input and output data are the most voted. The criteria are evaluated with 18 processes in six organizations with positive results. While professionals may find valuable information in this document to help them decide which processes must be automated first, academics are now aware of which areas deserve further investigation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile information technology (IT) holds great promise to support managerial processes; however, clear guidelines of how to design effective mobile Information systems (IS) for use by managers are still lacking. Building on earlier research studies of task-technology fit (TTF) and other areas of IS, this article presents a three-step conceptual model to establish fit between managerial tasks, mobile IT, and the mobile use context, assuming that a good fit positively impacts task performance. We find that use situations characterized by high distraction and poor quality of network connection are particularly challenging for the design of mobile IS, and that the user Interface requires particular attention. Our model contributes to IS research by joining disparate streams of research in an effort to help advance our understanding about the development and utilization of mobile IS. From a practical perspective, we contribute to the success of mobile IS and to the effectiveness of mobile work as It becomes increasingly prevalent in our modern world. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Infosys Technologies: Improving Organizational Knowledge Flows",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Knowledge is being discussed as one of the most important organizational resources. But these resources exist in specialized pockets dispersed across the organization, and dedicated knowledge management (KM) programs are required to improve their flow. However, high failure rates of such programs raise serious doubts about their ability to improve knowledge flows. This case traces the KM program of Infosys Technologies, Ltd – a Global Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise. The case describes how, in 1999, Infosys’ top management detected a severe lack of organizational knowledge flows while implementing a program aimed at continuously improving their core business processes. A more detailed examination exposed that the lack of knowledge flows stifled the effectiveness of their organizational structure and their business model. Alarmed by these critical findings, Infosys initiated their KM program. A five-stage knowledge maturity model (KMM) was conceptualized to aid KM implementation. With people, processes, and technology as the three pillars of Infosys’ KM program, KMM identified specific capabilities Infosys needed to develop in each of the five levels. Things worked fine till 2004 when Infosys began moving towards KMM Level 4, which required developing clear metrics to measure KM effectiveness, that is, improvements in knowledge flow. In the absence of such metrics, Infosys’ Board of Directors started questioning company's financial investment in the KM program. The CEO, who championed the KM program, knew that he faced two key challenges – to convince the Board of future revenue prospects of the KM program, and to identify metrics for assessing improvements in organizational knowledge flows. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we explore some of Claudio Ciborra's ideas about the technological object. We do this in contrast to recent analysis by Law and Singleton (L&amp;S) that advocates a methodological radicalism that moves beyond epistemological uncertainties about the technological object to ontological concerns. L&amp;S present a series of stages in this analysis that include fluid objects that change relatively gently and fire objects that have more radical discontinuities. This approach is applied to empirical work studying the engagement practices of a large, sophisticated information infrastructure research project, the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). At the start of the DBE engagement process, the DBE was an invisible technology that did not exist and this made the process of engagement with it particularly challenging. Drawing on the analysis presented by, however, the DBE appears to have the ontological characteristics of both the fluid and the fire object. In order to address this dilemma, we draw upon Ciborra's thinking, particularly around the information infrastructure and Gestell as a means that allows us to consider technologies like the DBE as being both fluid and fire objects. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of this work on Claudio Ciborra's legacy for the study of information and communications technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Professor Mumford has contributed significantly to the information system (IS) field. Among her achievements and pioneering thinking is the development of an integrated methodology for systems implementation named Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems (ETHICS) that incorporates job design as part of the systems planning and implementation effort. This study questions why ETHICS initially rose in popularity and then declined over the years. To answer this question, we apply Latour's (1999) five-loop framework to describe the formation of science. The findings reveal that Mumford held and aligned many heterogeneous actors and resources that together contributed to the shaping of ETHICS. As the content of ETHICS was shaped by the intertwining of many elements, when some of these elements later changed and undermined their previous alignment, the content of ETHICS was not reshaped, and hence it lost its status and declined. The paper ends by drawing more general lessons for IS research. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Improving Strategic Flexibility with Information Technologies: Insights for Firm Performance in an Emerging Economy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the business environment becomes more turbulent, firms ponder how to become more flexible in reallocating or reconfiguring resources, processes, and strategies to respond more efficiently and effectively. In this context, the question of whether and how information technology (IT) can support strategic flexibility remains unresolved. This paper theorizes that firms that use IT to support core competencies will experience improved strategic flexibility, which may enhance their performance. It further theorizes that these effects are contingent on the form and nature of the firm's IT infrastructure, as well as its type of ownership - state-owned or private. Using data from a matched survey of IT and business executives in 148 Chinese manufacturing firms, we reveal positive, significant links between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility, and between strategic flexibility and firm performance. The findings further show that the effect of IT support for core competencies on performance is partially mediated by strategic flexibility, and that IT infrastructure positively moderates the link between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility. We also demonstrate that state-owned firms are less likely to apply IT applications to collect and analyse market information and thus surrender opportunities for achieving strategic flexibility and stronger firm performance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public concern about ‘fake news’ skyrocketed following the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit referendum, and has only intensified since then. A burgeoning body of research on the topic is emerging, and conceptual clarity is vital for this research to converge into a cumulative body of knowledge; the purpose of this article is to underline and address some of the conceptual clutter and ambiguities around the concept of fake news and situate it within its social context. To do so, we first discuss the problems with current terminology and conceptualisation, and then draw on recent developments on the ontology of digital objects and their attributes to shift the focus from fake news to false messages, a type of syntactic digital objects comprised of content and structure and characterised by attributes of editability, openness, interactivity, and distributedness. Then we expand this concept further by placing it within a network of actors and digital objects. Our analysis uncovers several areas of research that have been overlooked in the study of fake news. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Between Indians and “Cowboys”: The Role of ICT in the Management of Contradictory Self-images and the Production of Carbon Credits in the Brazilian Amazon",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we draw upon Goffman's symbolic interactionism to analyze the ways in which new users in developing countries have adopted ICT to present and manage contradictory self-images to different groups of the public. In particular, we show that the Acapú, an indigenous group in the Amazon, present themselves through online videos and websites as ideal Indians: innate forest stewards aiming to mitigate climate change and ensure the planet's environmental sustainability. At the same time, the Acapú are also represented through a complex computer simulation model as destructive “cowboys”: farmers and ranchers who are willing to develop by clearing their forests in the absence of financial compensation. This research shows that these two opposing self-images, while contradictory, are necessary for the implementation of REDD projects (a payment mechanism for reducing greenhouse emissions from deforestation). In order to obtain carbon credits from avoided deforestation, the project relies on the difference between deforestation measurements and high levels of predicted deforestation, which in turn, depend on the presentation of destructive self-images through the use of a complex computer simulation. But to sell these credits on a voluntary carbon market, it is necessary for the Acapú to openly market a self-image through the Internet which is attractive to corporate buyers willing to boost their eco-friendly profile. Based on this analysis, the paper challenges the narrative whereby Southern ICT users are passive receivers of technological black boxes. In contrast, it shows that in some cases these new users may participate in the creation of ICT artifacts to manage the impressions of distant audiences. Furthermore, the paper calls attention to the role of computer simulations and other ICT applications in concealing the paradoxes of neoliberal environmental management practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We believe that the information system (IS) discipline has a major and urgent problem to contend with: the general public appears to believe that there are ‘no jobs in IS’ because of offshoring. They see the offshoring of IS jobs as an inevitable consequence of economic and competitive pressures to drive down labor costs, which leads them to conclude that there is no future in IS. In particular, the discipline is suffering from the erosion of its student base and in this article we explore some of the reasons as to why this is occurring; focussing specifically on the role offshoring may be playing on the perception that there are no jobs in IS. Despite fairly robust figures showing that there are virtually as many IS jobs now as ever before, the public's perception appears to be at odds with this. We thus examine where these beliefs may have come from and in our stakeholder action plan we suggest some radical solutions to align perception with reality. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Information Technology, Transaction Costs and Governance Structures: Integrating an Institutional Approach",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Transaction cost concepts have been deployed in information systems to analyze the impact of information technology on the organization of economic activity in markets and hierarchies. It has been widely observed that there is a general trend toward markets. It has also been observed that the transaction cost approach cannot explain empirical observations where the choice of governance has more to do with power and behavioral attributes of transacting actors than with minimizing transaction costs. Information systems researchers have overcome the shortcomings of the transaction cost approach to a limited extent by complementing it with political economy, resource-dependency and network theories. However, these complementary perspectives cannot easily analyze the interactions between power and efficiency and cannot handle the impact of the institutional environment on the choice of governance structure. This research exposes the shortcomings of these complementary perspectives in the light of a range of institutionalist studies drawn from economics, sociology and anthropology. The research points out that an institutional approach is essential for understanding and overcoming the complications that may arise as IT-enabled moves toward markets are launched in organizations that are situated in institutional environments that are at present not compatible with market-oriented exchange arrangements. We demonstrate this by the application of three ‘tools’ to an exemplary case where information systems in the British National Health Service were intended as a tool to move one aspect of the hierarchical structure toward a market structure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Among many leading organizations, in all sectors of industry, commerce and government, there is considerable evidence of e-business being deployed to achieve strategic goals. Where this deployment has been most successful, there is a strong case that the organization has taken an integrated approach that both builds on the organization's strengths and pays careful attention to the process of change within the organization. However, in the literature most empirical work has either studied e-business strategy and performance from the perspective of strategy content – which highlights positioning and/or unique bundles of resources – or from the perspective of strategy process – which captures human influence and e-business implementation. In this study, we integrate these two perspectives to develop a more holistic understanding of the underlying drivers of e-business performance. Further, latent class modeling techniques are used to show that the variables in our study are heavily influenced by the unobservable heterogeneity across firms. Four distinct types of firms populate our data, and the relationship between performance and its underlying determinants varies greatly between them. The implication is that a single model cannot explain the relationship between environment, structure, feasibility, managerial beliefs and performance. This is critical to our understanding of e-business as it implies that there is far less homogeneity at the individual firm level than is normally assumed in the literature. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the issue of strategic alignment and enterprise systems (ES) implementation from the point of view of one organization involved in deploying an enterprise resource planning system globally. Two questions motivated this research. First, given that strategic information systems (IS) alignment is viewed as essential to organizational success in deriving value from information technology (IT) investments, what is the experience of organizations in practice in aligning their IT strategies with their business strategies? Second, what is the impact of global ES deployments on strategic IS alignment? Based on an in-depth case study of one organization's experience, the research shows that achieving alignment is still important yet difficult to attain. The pressure for alignment may be even more intense with the deployment of global enterprise-wide systems. The study provides additional empirical support for the strategic IS alignment construct and goes further to suggest that deploying an ES does not by itself create integrated and seamless operating environments. In addition, such an outcome requires significant organizational change at all levels. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Exploring An Alternative Method of Evaluating the Effects of Erp: A Multiple Case Study",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous research has already established that compared to other types of investments, information technology (IT) investments are insufficiently or not at all evaluated. This can be partly explained by the lack of adequate IT evaluation methods and tools. In the case of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems whose effects on organizational processes and performance are intrinsically profound and wide-ranging compared to those of traditional IT limited to some spheres of organization, evaluation activities may be an issue of great concern. This study thus aims to propose and test an alternative evaluation method adaptable to the organizational context, making it possible to measure the contribution of an ERP system to organizational performance in all its aspects. Combining a process-based model and a scorecard model, the proposed method was first designed from a review of information systems evaluation literature. It has then been validated and refined through a multi-case study of manufacturing firms: an in-depth pilot case study was conducted, and thereafter the study was replicated on two other cases. Results show that the method proposed here enables organizations to determine the extent to which the firm's operational and overall performance has been impacted by the adoption and use of ERP systems, through the automational, informational, and transformational effects of ERP on their business processes. From a practical point of view, three contributions must be mentioned: the proposed method allows for a strong contextualization of its application, it is action-oriented, and it allows comparison across organizations even though organizational contexts may totally differ. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Computer Scientist's Reactions to NPfIT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains a set of personal views relating to NHS Connecting for Health's National Programme for IT (NPfIT), and in particular its Care Records Service, written from the point of view of a computer scientist, not a medical informatics expert. The principal points made are as follows: Centralisation: Pulling lots of data together (for individual patients and then for large patient populations) harms safety and privacy – it is one byproduct of excessive use of identification when in fact all that is usually needed is authentication. Large centralized data storage facilities can be useful for reliability, but risk exchanging lots of small failures for a lesser number of much larger failures. A much more decentralised approach to electronic patient record (EPR) data and its storage should be investigated. Evolutionary acquisition: Specifying, implementing, deploying and evaluating a sequence of ever more complete IT systems is the best way of ending up with well-accepted and well-trusted systems – especially when this process is controlled by the stakeholders who are most directly involved, rather than by some distant central bureaucracy. Thus authority as well as responsibility should be left with hospital and general practitioner trusts to acquire IT systems that suit their environments and priorities – subject to adherence to minimal interoperability constraints – and to use centralized services (e.g., for system support and back-up) as if and when they choose. Socio-technical issues: Ill-chosen imposed medical IT systems impede patient care, are resisted, result in lots of accidental faults, and lose user support and trust. All these points are attested to by rigorous studies involving expertise from the social sciences (psychology, ethnography, etc.) as well as by technical (medical and computer) experts – much more attention needs to be paid to such studies, and more such studies encouraged. Constructive reviews: A constructive expert review, working closely with Connecting for Health, could be very helpful, but should be evidently independent and open and thus essentially different in nature to past and current inquiries. A review of this nature could not just recommend appropriate changes of plan, and speed progress. It could also contribute to the vital task of helping to restore the trust and confidence of the public and the media in the programme and in the government officials involved. </jats:p>",

This division between software development and new technologies for software development establishes specialized competencies, supports standardization across software projects and departments and provides dedicated resources for innovation. However, such software technology units are faced with complex diffusion projects that are difficult and challenging to manage and that in many cases lead to unsatisfactory results. This paper reports from attempts to improve diffusion practices within a technology unit in a large software organization. Two complementary roles for software technology units, i.e. technology supplier and service provider, are presented and used for interpreting the experiences. The research suggests that technology units in large software organizations can improve their diffusion practices by complementing the traditional role as a technology supplier with that of a service provider. The paper offers lessons on how software organizations can take steps in that direction. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Justifying Enterprise Resource Planning Adoption",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a critical approach to the way organizations justify adopting enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. An earlier critical theory provides a framework for exploring the themes of communication, rationality and domination. Technology, process and organization are forms of domination that may appear in the context of ERP adoption. The literature on the formal and informal (qualitative) justification of information technology investment is reviewed and assessed. The significance of ERP systems is examined and also motives for their adoption. The data used for the study are electronically mediated justifications of ERP adoption that were presented by universities. A content analysis is applied to these data. The paper concludes that, despite reservations about the sensitivity of domination and emancipation to identification and measurement, there is some evidence to suggest people are considered to occupy a subservient role to technology, process and organization. </jats:p>",

The development of feminist philosophy and epistemology is briefly introduced. Habermas’ ‘ideal speech situation’ is problematized in relation to feminist writing on male and female communication juxtaposed with recent research in computer-mediated communications. The paper continues by exploring the concept of emancipation through feminist epistemology and it closes with a preliminary consideration of how these concerns may be applied to critical IS. </jats:p>",

Despite its relationship to adoption, relatively little is known about user resistance. User resistance is investigated in the Enterprise System (ES) environment because the complexity and richness of ES leads users to manifest a large range of resistant behaviors and beliefs. Using Concourse Theory and Q-methodology, ES users are interviewed followed by the development of a Q-sort questionnaire, which was distributed to ES users. The results reveal eight user groups and address the management strategies preferred by each group. The results have implications for both research in the field of user resistance and adoption, and practitioners involved in system implementation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While substantial research has examined the control of Information systems (IS) projects, most studies In this area have only examined how one controller manages a single group of controllees. However, many IS projects, especially enterprise systems projects (often initiated by an organization's corporate headquarters, and involving business unit users and consultants), have multiple stakeholders. The corporate headquarters (the project's principal controller) must simultaneously ensure that the various stakeholders are aligned with the project's goals despite their diverse motivations, and that the stakeholders collaborate with each other to achieve project success. Behavior control theory argues that the controller enacts a control portfolio of formal and Informal controls. However, the presence of multiple controllee groups increases the complexity of vertical controller- controllee relationships, the salience of controllee-controllee relationships, and the interaction between these vertical and horizontal relationships. We therefore examined the creation and evolution of the control portfolio In a multi-stakeholder project over a period of 14 months. We found that (1) the principal controller did enact separate controls for the user and consultant groups; (2) there was more than one controller - the principal controller co-existed with subordinate controllers; and (3) controls enacted by the subordinate controllers and other controllees that cut across stakeholder groups required the support of the principal controller. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the resultant pressures exerted on policymakers to prevent future crises have precipitated coordinated regulatory responses globally. A key focus of the new wave of regulation is to ensure the removal of practices now deemed problematic with new controls for conducting transactions and maintaining holdings. There is increasing pressure on organizations to retire manual processes and adopt core systems, such as Investment Management Systems (IMS). These systems facilitate trading and ensure transactions are compliant by transcribing regulatory requirements into automated rules and applying them to trades. The motivation of this study is to explore the extent to which such systems may enable the alteration of previously embedded practices. We researched implementations of an IMS at eight global financial organizations and found that overall the IMS encourages responsible trading through surveillance, monitoring and the automation of regulatory rules and that such systems are likely to become further embedded within financial organizations. We found evidence that some older practices persisted. Our study suggests that the institutionalization of technology-induced compliant behaviour is still uncertain. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The move towards technological ubiquity is allowing a more idiosyncratic and dynamic working environment to emerge that may result in the restructuring of information communication technologies, and changes in their use through different user groups’ actions. Taking a ‘practice’ lens to human agency, we explore the evolving roles of, and relationships between these user groups and their appropriation of emergent technologies by drawing upon Lamb and Kling's social actor framework. To illustrate our argument, we draw upon a study of a UK Fire Brigade that has introduced a variety of technologies in an attempt to move towards embracing mobile and ubiquitous computing. Our analysis of the enactment of such technologies reveals that Bystanders, a group yet to be taken as the central unit of analysis in information systems research, or considered in practice, are emerging as important actors. The research implications of our work relate to the need to further consider Bystanders in deployments other than those that are mobile and ubiquitous. For practice, we suggest that Bystanders require consideration in the systems development life cycle, particularly in terms of design and education in processes of use. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Practising Peer Review in Organizations: A Qualifier for Knowledge Dissemination and Legitimization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> A key issue in many organizations is how to disseminate information in an effective way and, more importantly, how to make use of this information in order to create new knowledge. One way of addressing this problem is to focus on how information is socially transformed into knowledge. This includes how knowledge is handled in practice and how the knowledge produced is qualified as being something worth knowing and acting upon. Two well-established practices for doing this are the refereeing system and the peer review process. These are used in scientific communities as a means of validating and legitimating knowledge, for example by reviewing journal papers before publishing or project proposals before granting funds, etc. This paper argues that peer review is a useful concept when looking at knowledge creation and legitimization in organizations. The social meaning of peer review is to legitimize new knowledge by organizationally sanctioning it and thereby creating a platform for collective sense making. This paper uses an example from a field study in a pharmaceutical company in order to illustrate this argument. The study took place in a quality support department where the quality of health care products and processes was assessed. The organization had a need for fast and reliable updating of information that could influence how the production process of pharmaceuticals should be carried out. In order to cope with these problems the department established an ‘evaluation loop’, which shared several characteristics with the peer review process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This commentary responds to Avison and Malaurent's (A&amp;M) interesting perspective on the role of theory in qualitative articles published in information systems journals. A&amp;M raise valid concerns with journal norms in respect to acceptance of novelty, tolerance for triviality, possibly unethical behaviour, and, implicitly, accepted epistemological practices for theorizing and theory development. Although I share many of their concerns about journal practice, I have serious concerns that readers will view their paper as attacking theory-in-itself despite the authors’ protestations they are not doing so. The guidelines they advance could promote the idea that theory-free articles are acceptable, which I see as a dangerous path for our field. I believe we should be focusing more on the theorizing process and underlying epistemological issues. In this way, we can view and justify new and surprising ideas and interesting empirical findings in single articles against a backdrop of ongoing theory development in the field as a whole. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media in general and wikis in particular offer unique opportunities for knowledge management. Despite widely publicised successes in public settings, wikis in businesses evince mixed results; enterprises struggle to apply wikis to institutionalise knowledge-management practices. We investigate the inherent tensions underlying knowledge-sharing in competitive and hierarchical organisations. Our application of the multi-level organisational learning framework demonstrates that, although wikis facilitate some important learning stages, other critical challenges remain. A unique blend of project leadership can facilitate the institutionalisation of wiki-based knowledge-management processes. To observe the leadership archetype, we use a longitudinal case study of wiki use within a division of NBC Universal. On the basis of our observations, we propose a new archetype of project leadership called Knowledge Entrepreneurship that integrates managerial skills, technology affordances, and critical factors in knowledge-management processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The co-evolution of information systems (IS) and the processes that underpin the construction and development of IT systems are explained from a complex systems perspective. Evolution operates at the microscopic level; in organizations, this is the individual or agent. Each agent has an idiosyncratic view of the organization, using to some extent personal constructs in dealing with the reality of organizational life. These objects or constructs can be described and measured by most agents; they are well defined. Many of these objects are represented in electronic, IT systems. Each agent also has their own view as to how they know what they know, that is, their epistemology, which we argue is their IS, and is wider than the IT systems they use. The IS of each agent co-evolves, by interaction with other agents, based on the agent's view of reality. The interaction of all agents constitutes the organization. Even more importantly, different values and interests motivate each agent. This is their axiology and it is what motivates them to learn and to develop their IS. An agent-based axiological framework is essential to understanding the evolution of organizations. It is the interaction of agents that builds consensus as to the shared reality of the organization, and this affects each agent's ability and motivation to evolve IS further. In addition, we propose that it is time that IT systems included modelling capabilities, based on multi-agent representations of the organization and its context, to explore and support strategic thinking and decision making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Practical solutions concerning the strategic use of knowledge and its management depend upon the relevant organizational context. By applying the ‘learning ladder’ model (i.e. a compact way of describing the unfolding of multiple organizational knowledge creation, transformation and transfer processes), three different contexts are explored. First, the single firm is considered and the governance of its internal knowledge processes performed according to the tenets of the resource-based view of strategy. Second, the boundaries of the single firm are crossed and the characteristics of the processes of knowledge transfer and production between allied firms are considered. Finally, emerging features of how knowledge is managed among a large number of interdependent organizations and individuals are explored with reference to the case of open source software. The latter context highlights behaviours that seem, in a sense, at odds with the traditional principles of knowledge management. This is puzzling: conventional strategic and knowledge management frameworks break down precisely when dealing with the case of highly distributed, knowledge intensive businesses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the question how networks of practice (NoPs) can create value (operationalized as their contribution to individual members’ performance) for organizations through knowledge integration and management. The discussion focuses on two sets of variables influencing member performance: the embeddedness of the network and the use of different media. Three dimensions of embeddedness are distinguished: (1) embeddedness in practice: the extent to which the knowledge shared in the network is integrated in members’ (local) practices; (2) structural embeddedness: the extent to which network members are connected to each other and know who knows what; and (3) relational embeddedness: the extent to which the network is characterized by strong social ties. In terms of communication media, information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled and face-to-face interaction are distinguished. A survey study among 206 members of different NoPs reveals that all three forms of embeddedness are important antecedents of NoP member performance (explaining 43% of the variance in performance) and that these forms are interrelated. Furthermore, ICT use positively influences embeddedness in practice, whereas face-to-face communication contributes to the structural and relational embeddedness of an NoP. This contributes to knowledge management and ICT literature in general and NoP theory in particular. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Intranet technology has been rapidly adopted by many organizations. From being a largely unknown technology prior to the mid-1990s, numerous organizations today have implemented or are currently implementing intranets. The intranet implementation processes of three large organizations in two countries were studied over a period of 5 years. In particular, the paper investigates the role players who spearheaded the intranet implementations in these organizations. Five interrelated roles during the intranet implementation process are identified: the technology champion, organizational sponsor, intranet coordinator, intranet developer and content provider. In the light of the nature of intranet technology, each respective role is analysed in terms of its significance, key challenges and interrelationships during the implementation process. The paper further examines the dynamics of these roles in the aftermath of implementation as the technology becomes embedded in routine organizational activity. </jats:p>",

    "title": "History and IS – Broadening Our View and Understanding: Actor–Network Theory as a Methodology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The call for historical research In IS, mirrored In other fields of business studies, Is an explicit recognition of the predominance of presentism in business research; the use of the past only to justify and validate current beliefs or inserting modern beliefs onto the past, rather than using the past to understand and reveal current assumptions and biases. There is freedom in severing time and centering ourselves and our artifacts (computer technology), looking to improve the future unburdened by the past. Yet, if that assumption is wrong, and the present is instead fluid and unstable because the past embedded in the present is tension filled and unresolved, this raises fundamental challenges to the work that we do, the value of that work to others, and is cause for reflection on our impact as educators. This paper demonstrates the merits of using Actor-Network Theory as a methodology for historical IS research, through its use in a Canadian case study. The study was prompted by the apparent resolution of a privacy controversy, involving personal motor vehicle registration information in the province of Alberta, through an appeal to something called ‘historical purposes and practices.’ Strangely, the purposes and practices were never identified. This begged the question, ‘what was the substance of this argument and how come it was successful?’ Tracing actual ‘purposes and practices,’ from the early 1900s to the present, reveals how historical, contextual understanding offers not only insights into, but can alter our very understanding of, the present. </jats:p>",

Charged with managing the Mahajan family wealth, he has formed a private equity group that helps build mid-market companies. He has also launched a few technology-enabled ventures of his own, including a company that failed in its attempts to sell a service that used encrypted and masked barcodes for document authentication and a successful company that provided administrative and data management support for pharmaceutical clinical trials. Now, apparently with sufficient resources to contemplate another entrepreneurial venture, AM wonders whether to revive the document authentication business, with a turnkey solution or one or more services that would use encrypted RFID tags instead of the older barcode technology. This teaching case was developed based on interviews with Mr. ‘Mahajan’ and two other employees. The case provides an opportunity for students to Investigate technical, strategic and operational uncertainties and challenges associated with building a business around a new technology. For business schools that are attempting to ‘globalize’ their curriculum, the case offers the benefit of presenting the point of view of a well-connected Indian entrepreneur. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws on the evidence gathered from a corporate social responsibility (CSR) research project in the area of global information technology (IT) outsourcing to examine the impact of liminality. IT outsourcing offers a novel context to study this phenomena, as it operates across the boundaries of both firm and country. The case study focuses on the specific project of a school in India, as the liminal space found ‘betwixt and between’ the client and provider of IT outsourcing services. Three stages of liminality are identified: separation (divestiture), transition (liminality) and incorporation (investiture); through the interpretive analysis of the empirical material. The construct of communitas is proposed for analysing the impact of liminality on the relationship between an outsourcing client and the provider. The understanding of liminality and communitas has both theoretical and practical implications, and contributes to the understanding of relationships and the wider role of CSR in global IT outsourcing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reflects on the managerialistic orthodoxy of knowledge management in order to show that a critical communications theory is required for addressing real political and ethical shortcomings. This produces an alternative methodological perspective through an intentional synthesis of established methodological views. The paper's allies in this critical quest include Jürgen Habermas, Werner Ulrich, Stanley Deetz, Geoffrey Vickers, Peter Checkland and their mentors. Information systems and knowledge systems architects and engineers and their manager clients conveniently ignore fundamental issues, including politics, power, knowledge and communication. Yet, today the more substantive issues are not technical but ethical. In raising questions about the rhetoric of knowledge management reflections on the instrumentality of much of what is said and done about management and information systems are outlined. The departure point is critical scepticism. This is motivated by concerns for the ethical status of the commercially valuable outcome of (at least) two conjoined simplistic and fundamentally dominatory conventional wisdoms. These stem from two fields that are managerialistically biased and which share a common basis in a false rationality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on longitudinal research into the implementation and use of the first mobile vehicle mounted data system (VMDS) at a UK fire service. Using insights from Claudio Ciborra's work, the paper develops a phenomenological ontology for conceptualising the co-constitutive relation between organisational practices and information technology mediated practices. The paper sets out how the brigade's mobile data system can be understood in terms hospitality, improvisation and Gestell. It is argued that despite the seemingly innocent and potentially mundane replacement of paper-based practices by electronically mediated mobile information and communication, the VMDS is associated with significant and far-reaching outcomes, both empirical and ontological, within the brigade and for the modernisation of fire service provision across the UK. We suggest that the dynamic of hospitality between guest and host provides a way to think through and beyond the deployment information infrastructures as enframed by a technological mood. The paper concludes with some general implications for a phenomenology of information technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A fundamental result of the information technology (IT) and business performance literature is that IT is not a driver of performance per se. However, it can be associated with higher performance if accompanied by organizational change. The identification of the variables describing organizational change is still on-going work. This paper focuses on organizational absorptive capacity and analyses its effects on the relationship between IT and business performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Organizational absorptive capacity measures the ability of an organization to complete a learning process. A significant learning effort is typically associated with IT, as it represents a complex technology. To cope with IT's complexity, implementation is typically incremental and is accompanied by a continuous integration effort of data and applications. The degree of integration of a company's information system (IS), called IS integration, is a proxy of IT maturity and quality. In this study, we explore the effect of IS integration on business performance through absorptive capacity, that is, we hypothesize that absorptive capacity has a mediation role between IS integration and business performance. The proposed research model is tested with data surveyed from 466 SMEs sited in Italy, for which exports constitute more than half of their revenues. Results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity has a mediation effect. Alternative models attributing to absorptive capacity a role different from mediation are found to be non-significant. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The need to simultaneously achieve operational efficiency, while accommodating a continuous morphing of alliances and network arrangements, is a key challenge in the modern enterprise and market. Inter-firm interdependence and unpredictable market shifts heighten the need to establish an architecture and governance arrangement that permits rapid adaptation. Fully integrated firms have increasingly morphed into networks of collaborators. The demand for efficient and effective inter-firm coordination is no longer a desired condition, but essential for competitive position. Historically, the cost of this efficiency has been loss of flexibility, yet volatile markets reward efficiency and flexibility. Market trends demand an ability to improvise in the marketplace - converge execution with planning - while being simultaneously efficient. In this paper, we explore this improvisation-efficiency paradox. The architecture and governance issues are considered that seek the strengths of both effects. Efficiency need not come at a high cost in attaining the ability to be adaptive and spontaneous. We explore the key considerations of both network architecture and governance structures that characterize improvisational networks. Trade communities and trading partners establish a discipline of processes and decision rights that serve the community of collaborators. </jats:p>",

The study found that the use of e-commerce for responding to competitors, providing enhanced customer services and improving relations with suppliers was driving the uptake by smaller businesses to a greater extent than by their larger counterparts. Only in the area of improved operational efficiency did larger businesses express greater interest in adopting e-commerce.

It certifies assistants’ skills, matches them with potential clients, supervises the quality of the work done and provides software tools for on-line collaboration. The founder, Gayle Barr, believed that this type of assistance would soon be the predominant model due to a convergence of several trends. First, advances in the Internet technology GroupWare and their acceptance by managers and professionals coupled with growth in the amount of coordination across time zones due to globalization and expansion of the number of telecommuting workers indicated that clients would be willing and able to work in a virtual relationship with their assistants. Second, extensive corporate downsizing and a large number of home-based new business start-ups had created a large pool of clients who did not have adequate permanent assistance available. In addition, many companies were now using large numbers of part-time and contract workers on an ongoing basis for clerical and professional positions. Thus, Barr reasoned, the technology was accessible, the need for part-time and temporary administrative assistance was apparent and clients were now sufficiently comfortable with such arrangements that the officeTech<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> concept should be feasible. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Many Rivers to Cross: From Ict to Knowledge Management Systems",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Several applications of information and communication technology (ICT) have gained considerable popularity as instruments for knowledge management. Some authors even seem to equate knowledge management with the introduction of specific ICT applications (intranets, groupware, etc.). However, the relationship between ICT and knowledge is no less problematic. Organizational knowledge and ICT refer to distinct sets of conceptions and establishing their relationship is far from trivial. The question then is how to assess the relationship between ICT and knowledge management. Several variables to be considered when answering this question have been identified in the literature: the enabling role of ICT for knowledge processes, the state of the ICT infrastructure, the level of knowledge required for using ICT, other user considerations, etc. However, a more encompassing perspective connecting these individual variables seems to be lacking. The aim of the present paper is to correct this. It argues that five dimensions determine the potential value of ICT applications for knowledge management. These dimensions are summarized in the following question. How and when will ICT, in interplay with other knowledge management measures (dimension 5), help knowledge (dimension 2) as a dynamic (dimension 4), institutional and action-related resource (dimension 3) realize its strategic potential (dimension 1)? The main argument in this paper is that, unless all five dimensions are addressed together, no satisfactory assessment of the status of an ICT application as a potential tool for knowledge management is feasible. Each of these dimensions is of a complex, multidimensional nature. The identification of the five dimensions is therefore only a first step. It needs a follow-up in the form of an elaboration of each dimension. This paper provides the groundwork for such an elaboration. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Politics of Next Generation Research Democratizing Research-Centred Computational Networks",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on information technology has been focused primarily on the worlds of IT and management systems for business and government to the relative neglect of research on the digital and institutional infrastructures that underpin the research enterprise itself. When digital research is studied, the emphasis has been on the diffusion of technological innovations, rather than the social and political dynamics shaping the design and role of technologies in research. However, what researchers know, and with whom they collaborate, could be transformed through the strategic use of advances designed to support research, defined here as ‘research-centred computational networks’. This article presents a framework for conceptualizing the social and technological choices shaping the next generation of research in ways that could open – democratize – key aspects of the research process that move well beyond academic publication. The framework highlights the limited scope of innovation to date, and identifies a variety of factors that maintain and enhance institutional control over the research process, at the risk of losing the creative and productive bottom-up participation by networked researchers and citizen researchers among the public at large. Conceptualizing, prioritizing and advancing study of next generation research is one of the most significant but difficult challenges facing scholars of information technology. </jats:p>",

We refer to the notion of digital application marketplace, colloquially called ‘appstores,’ as a platform component that offers a venue for exchanging applications between developers and end users belonging to a single or multiple ecosystems. Such marketplaces exhibit diversity in features and assumptions, and we propose that examining this diversity, and its ideal types, will help us to further understand the relationship between application marketplaces, platforms, and platform ecosystems. To this end, we generate a typology that distinguishes four kinds of digital application marketplaces: closed, censored, focused, and open marketplaces. The paper also offers implications for actors wishing to make informed decisions about their relationship to a particular digital application marketplace. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology (IT) applications to support group decision processes have been of considerable interest over the years. With the emergence of virtual team arrangements and the advent of emerging information and networking technologies, an increasing amount of attention is now being aimed at understanding collaboration among group members, as they make decisions to accomplish tasks. Effective and efficient collaboration is critical from a decision quality and decision timeliness standpoint. Commonly known as collaborative information technologies (CITs), many technology solutions have the capability to enhance collaboration and facilitate group decisions in task accomplishment by enabling better communication, sharing of information, ideas, expertise, and evaluating alternatives, irrespective of time and distance barriers. Many studies have investigated such individual CIT solutions in different regional settings. However, despite the fact that no single medium can support collaboration in different types of tasks, there is a scarcity of research investigating the adoption and use of multiple CIT options across regions. This paper builds upon innovation diffusion theory and tests a research model to validate five antecedents of collective adoption and use of seven CITs in the US, Australia, and Hong Kong. Sub-sample analyses of data collected from 344 organizations in these three regions suggest that not only do adoption and use patterns of some CIT solutions vary across regions but so do the antecedents that explain their proliferation. Implications of our findings are discussed for practitioners and researchers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> June 2005 was to bring online gambling out of the shadows and into the spotlight. PartyGaming, a start-up formed in 1997, launched a flotation (Initial Public Offering) on the London Stock Exchange that valued the firm at £4.64 billion giving it a larger market capitalisation than British Airways. PartyGaming had become the dominant player in the booming online poker market with its PartyPoker brand having over 50% market share. However, this float – as with Internet gambling in general – was not without controversy. While PartyGaming had an online gambling license from the tax haven of Gibraltar, nearly 90% of its revenue came from the United States, where the authorities viewed Internet gambling as illegal and threatened legal action. The complex operations of this truly global firm with bases in London, India, Gibraltar and Canada, the background of its founder Ruth Parasol in Internet pornography and the handling of its flotation also raised concerns from an ethical perspective, with some commentators questioning whether the float should have been allowed at all. These concerns were then confirmed as US legislation to curb online gambling was passed in September 2006, leading to PartyGaming's exit from the US market and an immediate fall of 58% in the share price. This case study analyses the entrepreneurs behind PartyGaming, its growth, the challenges it has faced, the ethical issues it poses and its future prospects. The case draws on theory from e-commerce, strategy and ethics. </jats:p>",

Different professional communities, among them information systems/information technology (IS/IT) and more business management-oriented actors, have created strong conceptual ties with the idea of managing knowledge. This paper studies the structure and development of the knowledge management discourse over an 18-year period with an emphasis on the role of the IS/IT community in shaping this discourse. In order to do so, a content analysis of 434 article abstracts from the ABI/Inform database referring to ‘knowledge management’ was performed. The argument here is based on a theoretical framework derived from recent theorizing about popular management knowledge as fashion and it is assumed that different professional or ‘speech communities’ gathering around a concept such as knowledge management enter into competition for limited organizational resources. The paper's findings show the co-existence of two distinct speech communities involved in the knowledge management debate, focusing on either IS/IT or general management issues and they support the idea that both communities engage in a joint effort at sustaining knowledge management as a fashion field. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The longitudinal study of the most sophisticated decision support system (DSS) for the management of debit accounts provides new answers to the question of conformity in French banking. In 2003, the analysis of 45 observations and qualitative interviews showed that the advisor maintains his free appreciation of risk. However, even if conformity does not exist, the results on the modification range show that the DSS does exert an influence on user behaviour. In addition, the interpretation and acceptance of DSS recommendation are different according to the type of portfolio managed and how the work is organised. The less the financial advisor knows the client, the greater the influence of the DSS. Recent decisions regarding the division of labour for the management of lower segments heighten the risk that DSS used without knowing the client leads to more conformity, or at least to what we conceptualise as strategic conformity, and a taylorisation of services. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Personality traits were examined in relation to job satisfaction and career satisfaction for 1059 information technology (IT) professionals. As hypothesized, eight traits were significantly related to both job and career satisfaction: Assertiveness, Emotional Resilience, Extraversion, Openness, Teamwork Disposition, Customer Service Orientation, Optimism, and Work Drive. Regression analyses indicated that sets of three and four traits accounted for 17 and 25%, respectively, of job and career satisfaction variance. As expected, career satisfaction correlations were of generally higher magnitude than corresponding job satisfaction correlations. Results were interpreted in terms of IT research and theorizing. The findings that Extraversion and Teamwork Disposition were related to job and career satisfaction contravenes job descriptions and career planning advice, suggesting that independent introverts are better suited for IT work. Given that adult personality is antecedent to work experiences, it was suggested that future research proposing to show the effects of work-related factors such as pay and challenge on job or career satisfaction should first control for personality traits. Other practical and theoretical implications were noted. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology adoption research has long struggled to incorporate normative beliefs from sources in the social environment of adopters into adoption models. We study the role of social influence from different workplace referent groups, like superiors and colleagues from the same or the IT department, on the intention to adopt. An empirical analysis, using data from 152 firms, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and related approaches reveals that social influence on adoption significantly differs with regard to both source (peer groups) and sink (adopters and non-adopters) of the influence. The results imply that a single cumulative subjective norm measure might be too naive and that future research might considerably improve our understanding of IT adoption and non-adoption by revealing the differential impact of various peer groups on adoption intention, and also on its antecedents. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Socio–instrumental Usability: IT is all about Social Action<sup>1</sup>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Usability is an important concept that seems to receive less attention than it deserves outside of the core Human–Computer Interaction community. The reason for this apparent lack of interest may stem from an overly instrumental orientation towards usability that does not appeal to more socially oriented researchers. Three central criteria for usability, as reflected in the contemporary literature, are the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which users can achieve specified goals. These criteria are often expressed in terms of achieving goals, which, at least tacitly, seem to be restricted to goals related to an instrumental view on the use of IT. To broaden this view, the paper elaborates on how the concept of usability can be understood and used within a social action context. How social goals are related to the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction criteria is addressed specifically. It is argued that in order truly to understand usability, we must consider both instrumental and social goals since their combination constitute a fundamental part of the social action context in which systems are used. Both instrumental and social goals affect the way systems and use-situations are designed and conceived. Interpreting usability from this broad social action perspective may be a way to make the concept more accepted throughout the wide variety of areas dealing with the design of IT systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Innovations in products and processes enabled by ICT such as mobile phones and the Internet constitute a rapidly emerging means of market development at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP), which consists of people who earn less than US$2 a day. However, these ICT-enabled market development efforts have not always yielded positive developmental outcomes, in part because market development is hindered by remote location and geographic dispersion of BOP communities, their low and uncertain incomes, and informal local markets having exploitative intermediaries. These conditions imply that BOP consumers and producers are ‘separated’ from marketers and customers, respectively, through physical distance, lack of financial ability, and information asymmetry. The paper examines the question: How do ICT innovations in products and processes impact development at the BOP? Drawing perspectives from the information systems (IS) and marketing literatures, we analyze how and why ICT-enabled innovations in products and processes deployed for market development at the BOP, enable developmental outcomes through reduction of market separations. Analyzing qualitative data gathered from interviews with 33 respondents in India, including BOP individuals, social entrepreneurs, and managers from private organizations, we find that ICT-enabled product and process innovations do have the potential to reduce four types of separations that ‘disconnect’ BOP consumers (producers) from marketers (customers). However, situated social conditions influence the impact of ICT innovations on reduction of separations. The reduction of separations leads to developmental outcomes at the BOP. Implications of our findings for theory, practice, and policy are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information systems are a strong and ever-growing discipline of enormous relevance to today's informated world, and yet, as recent reviews have shown, there is still not an agreed and explicit conceptualization or definition of information. After an evaluative review of a range of theories of information, this paper develops and defends a particular theory, one that sees information as both objective and veridical. By objective, we mean that the information carried by signs and messages exists independently of its receivers or observers. The information carried by a sign exists even if the sign is not actually observed. By veridical, we mean that information must be true or correct in order to be information – information is truth-constituted. False information is not information, but misinformation or disinformation. The paper develops this theory and then discusses four contentious issues – information as objective rather than subjective; information as true or correct; information and knowledge; and information and the ambiguity of meaning. It concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of the theory. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, organizations have increasingly sourced cloud-based enterprise software (ES). Although comprehensively capturing organizations’ requirements considerably affects the success of an ES sourcing project, little is known about how requirements evolve beyond the implementation. We conduct a longitudinal, exploratory single-case study of the life cycle of cloud-based ES in a medium-sized organization. Over 5 years, we trace the evolution of requirements throughout the ES life cycle, beginning with the initial adoption decision and ending with considerations to retire the ES. We develop a process theory that explains how requirements evolve beyond ES implementation and throughout its life cycle. We isolate nine mechanisms that explain how contextual factors and experiences are intertwined and shape the evolution of requirements. We then develop seven propositions that explain how sourcing cloud-based ES alters the mechanisms that shape the evolution of requirements. Our findings emphasize that the evolution of requirements for cloud-based ES follows similar mechanisms to that of the requirements for on-premises ES but changes how particular mechanisms manifest. Sourcing cloud-based ES changes the influence of business divisions in acquisition and configuration activities, the role of upgrade and customization procedures, and the influence of the ES’ ecosystem. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Emergence of Openness in Open-Source Projects: The Case of OpenEhR",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The meaning of openness in open source is both intrinsically unstable and dynamic, and tends to fluctuate with time and context. We draw on a very particular open-source project primarily concerned with building rigorous clinical concepts to be used in electronic health records called openEHR. openEHR explains how openness is a concept that is purposely engaged with, and how, in this process of engagement, the very meaning of open matures and evolves within the project. Drawing on rich longitudinal data related to openEHR we theorise the evolving nature of openness and how this idea emerges through two intertwined processes of maturation and metamorphosis. While metamorphosis allows us to trace and interrogate the mutational evolution in openness, maturation analyses the small, careful changes crafted to build a very particular understanding of openness. Metamorphosis is less managed and controlled, whereas maturation is representative of highly precise work carried out in controlled form. Both processes work together in open-source projects and reinforce each other. Our study reveals that openness emerges and evolves in open-source projects where it can be understood to mean rigour; ability to participate; open implementation; and an open process. Our work contributes to a deepening in the theorisation of what it means to be an open-source project. The multiple and co-existing meanings of ‘open’ imply that open-source projects evolve in nonlinear ways where each critical meaning of openness causes a reflective questioning by the community of its continued status and existence. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper employs the network perspective to study patterns and structures of intra- organizational learning networks. The theoretical background draws from cognitive theories, theories of homophily and proximity, theories of social exchange, the theory of generalized exchange, small-worlds theory, and social process theory. The levels of analysis applied are actor, dyadic, triadic, and global. Confirmatory social network analysis (exponential random graph modeling) was employed for data analysis. Findings suggest: (1) central actors in the learning network are experienced and hold senior positions in the organizational hierarchy; (2) evidence of homophlly (In terms of gender, tenure, and hierarchical level relations) and proximity (In terms of geographical and departmental distances) in learning relationships; (3) learning relationships are non-reciprocal; and (4) transitivity and high local clustering with sparse inter-cluster ties are significant for intra-organizational learning networks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The close relationship between the concepts of information systems and information technology creates issues for researchers. Usefully distinguishing between the concepts is problematic. We investigate the use of the systems concept in practice, finding a pragmatic distinction between an information system (IS) and an information technology system (IT system). In a practice view, an IS incorporates an emphasis on both a technical and a social subsystem, while an IT system predominantly emphasizes the technical elements. This distinction becomes useful in practice because contemporary IS practitioners are often involved in acquiring and integrating IT systems into an organizational IS. This involvement leads to a viewpoint on the organizational IS (including the social subsystem) as a nexus of multiple IT systems. This nexus creates issues in practice for not only integrating IT systems into the organizational IS, but also integrating multiple IT systems with each other in the context of the organizational IS. These issues lead to research opportunities such as the need for new methodologies for IT system acquisitions and new theories that accommodate the social integration of IT systems and IS. </jats:p>",

Digital trace data enable researchers to generate highly context-specific insights into the features and dynamics of socio-technical phenomena. We suggest how IS researchers can use digital trace data to develop situated explanations, that is, explanations that capture the idiosyncratic features of real-world problems in order to generate impactful solutions to these problems. We outline five key principles to build situated explanations based on digital trace data. We make several suggestions on how the information system field can adjust its research and publication practices to embrace the development and dissemination of situated explanations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The pursuit of novel and indigenous digital theories is a thought-provoking call by Grover and Lyytinen. Such a piece is direly needed, and we hope it will spark a reinvigoration of the field. However, despite its many merits and our alignment with its message, we have two comments or caveats for readers of their piece. These are—a) a need to re-emphasize the value of attending to the cumulative tradition in our pursuit of digital theorizing, and relatedly b) an unreflective reading of the paper may risk mobilizing IS scholarship towards clickbait research. We further highlight three anchors that future scholarship can consider in attending to these issues a) problematization anchor, b) implications anchor, and c) boundary-spanning anchor. With these points, we add more volume to amplify the message of G&amp;L and offer suggestions for pursuing innovative digital theories that go beyond ephemeral theorizing. </jats:p>",

In particular, it is affected by the implicit ‘contract’ between the team and the organization. This contract is controlled through the adherence to formal methodologies and the use of organizational control system. This paper looks at risk management from the point of view of team behaviour, focusing on behavioural response to risks in terms of effort and risk aversion. Three case studies of project team behaviour are used to illustrate the types of risk management behaviour which may arise under different contracts between project team and organization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The December 1998 issue of the Journal was particularly well received. This was a special issue on interpretive research in information systems, edited by Geoff Walsham of Cambridge University and Michael Myers of University of Auckland. In this issue we are publishing three more papers by authors explicitly working in this tradition, and have already begun to receive further interpretive research submissions for consideration. The next issue, in June 1999, also sees eight papers developed from the best submissions to the very successful European Conference in Information Systems held in Aix-en-Provence last June. The issue will be edited by Giorgios Doukidis, Hubert Oesterle and Leslie Willcocks, who oversaw three of the research tracks at the Aix conference. This year the conference is to be held at Copenhagen in June, with selected best papers being published this time in the Information Systems Journal. September 1999 sees the publication of eight full teaching case studies developed from synopsis submissions to the new Teaching Case Track at the International Conference in Information Systems in Helsinki in December 1998. The editors will be Chris Sauer of AGSM, Sydney, and Leslie Willcocks of Oxford University, who were co-Chairs of the track at ICIS. The teaching cases have been heavily reviewed and have been selected from 28 original submissions. Teaching notes will also be made available by the authors. The JIT believes this to be an important development, and ICIS has also decided to continue with teaching case submissions for the Charlotte ICIS conference in December 1999. A further upcoming special issue is on Electronic Commerce and this will be edited by Troy Strader and Leslie Willcocks. The date for submissions has now passed, and a range of interesting papers are now under review.",

Special attention is directed towards describing the CEO's perspective on the CIO's qualifications, addressing the problem of overblown CEO expectations for the CIO position, and discussing ‘old-line’ CEOs’ attitudes towards IT and the CIO position. Also addressed is the exploration of the common CEO perception of the CIO as an ‘empire builder’ and an analysis of the CEO's perspective on the future need for a CIO position. </jats:p><jats:p> Finally the paper focuses on developing this ‘strategic partnership’ between the CIO and the CEO.

    "title": "Natural sciences, philosophy of science and the orientation of the social sciences",
    "abstract": "The Debate paper (by Siponen/Klaavuniemi) is part of the wider discourse whether or not, and with what consequences, Information Systems (IS) and other social sciences could be or should be ‘science’ (most recently McBride, 2018; Nelson, 2016). The Debate thesis rests on the position that IS research could be, or should be, based on a model of ‘science’ as understood and practised in the natural sciences. The central Debate thesis, depicted in Figure 1, is the claim that IS researchers have mis-characterised the natural sciences. The Debate paper then itemises nine supposed mis-characterisations of the natural sciences by IS researchers, contrasting them to either philosophy of science writings or examples of research in the applied natural sciences. The Debate paper concludes that correctly depicted natural sciences provide an appropriate and applicable model for IS research, including qualitative IS research, and suggests concrete measures, such as extending the scope of IS PhD education. I will comment on the Debate thesis from the perspective of a qualitative IS researcher (i.e. the target audience) and from the history of the IS field and that of the philosophy of science. In particular, I am seeking to provide a balanced presentation of what my IS research colleagues actually meant and of what most scholars in the philosophy of science and scientists in the natural sciences typically do or argue in their works.1 First, I agree with the implication of the Debate thesis that the natural sciences and the philosophy of science discipline (my colleague provides an excellent introduction: Godfrey-Smith, 2003) over past decades have changed and that they offer important and relevant insights for IS researchers. I appreciate the thrust of the Debate thesis encouraging my colleagues and me, as IS researchers, to continue to engage with and read in other disciplines. Second, I agree with the actionable conclusions of the Debate thesis, and support the suggestions, even if I may approach them from a different analysis. In particular, the broadening and extension of IS PhD training is a concrete measure that I fully support, not the least based on my own experience. Third, I am, however, less than convinced by the ‘mischaracterisations’ or ‘misunderstandings’ attributed to IS researchers. I find the Debate thesis argument and analysis wanting in that IS research quotes have been cherry-picked from their textual and historical contexts and crucial distinctions having been conflated. As a result, the Debate thesis paper contributes less than what I was hoping to clarification of the precise nature of the supposed mis-characterisations. To be clear, in some respects, I agree with some of the ‘mischaracterisations’, but not with the way in which they are framed and analytically supported.2 To contribute, I will seek to add distinctions, history and context to the Debate. In a sense, the Debate’s analysis is weak precisely on the classical matters of much greater concern to the humanities than to the sciences: the consideration of history, context and Verstehen of meaning and intentions.3 The meanings of statements are neither isolated nor timeless; they need to be placed in their textual and historical contexts.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Knowledge management is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage for organizations. Knowledge embedded in an organization's business processes and an employee's skills provide a firm with unique capabilities for delivering a product or service to customers. Law firms represent an industry which seems very well suited for knowledge management investigation. Law firms are knowledge intensive and the use of advanced technology may transform these organizations in the future. To examine knowledge management in Norwegian law firms, a study which involved two phases of data collection and analysis was designed. The first phase was a field study of the largest law firm in Norway. The semi-structured interviews conducted in the initial field study documented a strong belief in the potential benefits from knowledge management. The second phase was a survey of Norwegian law firms. Firm culture, firm knowledge and use of information technology were identified as potential predictors of information technology support for knowledge management in law firms in Norway. The extent to which law firms in Norway use information technology to support knowledge management is significantly influenced by the extent firms generally use information technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The field of data science emerged in recent years, building on advances in computational statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data. Modern organizations are immersed in data and are turning toward data science to address a variety of business problems. While numerous complex problems in science have become solvable through data science, not all scientific solutions are equally applicable to business. Many data-intensive business problems are situated in complex socio-political and behavioral contexts that still elude commonly used scientific methods. To what extent can such problems be addressed through data science? Does data science have any inherent blind spots in this regard? What types of business problems are likely to be addressed by data science in the near future, which will not, and why? We develop a conceptual framework to inform the application of data science in business. The framework draws on an extensive review of data science literature across four domains: data, method, interfaces, and cognition. We draw on Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety as theoretical principle. We conclude that data-scientific advances across the four domains, in aggregate, could constitute requisite variety for particular types of business problems. This explains why such problems can be fully or only partially addressed, solved, or automated through data science. We distinguish between situations that can be improved due to cross-domain compensatory effects, and problems where data science, at best, only contributes merely to better understanding of complex phenomena. </jats:p>",

In this Debates and Perspectives article, based on analysis of over 1800 articles, we first describe trends from 2000 to 2015 in co-authorship, research areas, unit of analysis, and research direction-setting initiatives. Our results indicate a rising trend among information systems researchers toward co-authorship. We also find that information systems research converges on a few broad research areas, and there is increasing diversity of topics within these broad themes. Concerning level of analysis, our results indicate a decreasing trend toward macro (organizational) studies. Finally, we note a lack of positive significant trends in the publication of special issue articles, review articles, and meta-analytic studies. We then offer our perspective regarding these trends along with a discussion of the importance of managing vicious and virtuous cycles that may result from community adaptations to environmental changes. </jats:p>",

During the collection of data from the firms participating in the case study research the author collected in excess of 200 pages of text. It was necessary to analyse and summarize the data in order to see what general principles relating to the formulation and implementation of a strategic information system could be derived. The main process adopted for this analysis and synthesis was content analysis. Correspondence analysis was then applied in order to help corroborate the findings of the content analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "There is not much to say about the first: it is essential to ensure understanding (which depends on addressing problem (ii) and recognize the point when we consciously move from understanding to selecting aspects which may go in a system. The confusion is that both steps require a process of selecting concepts and abstracting them into a form of notation, but the second also involves deselecting things we are 'not interested in' and if done too soon or unconsciously, can have serious consequences. The second problem is the key to all. The book offers the dictionary definition of 'methods of organization' and 'categories of behaviour' , which is somewhat similar to the idea that cognition involves recognizing 'frames' (mental pictures) and 'scripts' (the means of animating the frames). However, somewhere along the way, the book homes in on services executed on an object, and we have lost the richer context of interaction in the real world. A discussion of language might have helped. For instance, the symbols used in the primitive language of roadsigns include 'Thing' signs (the ones in red triangles) and 'Do' signs (the ones in red circles). A man shovelling in a triangle means 'there are roadworks ahead' and a car in a red circle with a cross means 'don't drive through here'. Does this mean there is more to communication than objects and services? A further exploration of language shows that we take a lot of factors into account when giving or receiving communication. For instance, we consider whether it is appropriate to say what we intend: we have a purpose, but this may be mitigated by the risk of giving offence or subdued by the conventions of the social situation. What are these factors which influence human 199",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The notion of employee empowerment in today's organizations is becoming increasingly important with the growing degree of responsibility individual employees hold. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal study which examined the relationship between computer-based information systems (IS) and empowerment in detail drawing heavily on empirical work carried out in the British manufacturing industry. The paper elaborates and discusses the conceptual issues which are relevant to the idea of empowerment and its relationship with IS, before determining empowerment to be in essence the decentralization of decision-making authority to lower levels of the organization. The lack of any research on this topic led us to carry out a combination of empirical research. A large-scale postal survey of 450 UK manufacturing companies followed by a series of 20 in-depth interviews in 18 top UK manufacturing organizations formed the basis for this paper. The findings confirmed that empowerment is indeed pursued by many UK manufacturing organizations within their various efforts at improving their organization of work. The research participants viewed IS as an important enabling tool for empowerment offering many opportunities, but clearly noted that the role of IS in this is supportive rather than initiating; IS do not lead to employees becoming empowered. However, the interviews revealed that manufacturing organizations are facing a wide range of problems and difficulties with their existing IS raising a number of constraints. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions for using IS as a supportive means for empowering employees. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: The Outsourcing Manual",
    "abstract": "The authors provide a very informative handbook for practitioners considering large-scale outsourcing of information systems. At the same time there are many insights into the outsourcing process, obviously hard-won from experience, that those studying the outsourcing phenomenon will ® nd stimulating and useful. The bulk of the book is in fact about preparing for outsourcing; skimping on this, the authors rightly argue, is the main cause of subsequent problems. The book is structured into four parts. I will assess these ® rst, then move on to make some more general comments about the book and its views on outsourcing. The ® rst part of the book provides a sensible framework for thinking through whether outsourcing is actually what an organization requires. Can the objectives be achieved another way? Can objectives be con ̄ icting ± for example, organizations that have sought a cost minimization objective have often found themselves stuck in in ̄ exible contracts that act as a real constraint on business and technical development. Can the improvements required be achieved internally? There is much evidence now that this can often be the case, though the political barriers for achievement may still persuade organizations into outsourcing. As the authors argue, the trick here is to deduct some of these potential internal improvements from the vendor bid price and not permit the vendor to take all the `low lying fruit’ in excessive pro® t. A strength of this section of the book is its detail on how to assess the potential for improving performance ± notoriously a dif® cult area, because, if outsourcing is also being considered, it also requires a knowledge of vendor pro® t margins and their (often differing) ability to remove constraints and add value. Part 1 provides three other insights, often played down in outsourcing practice. One is the need to involve business users. As one example, the authors were involved in one contract where large cost reductions for resources were possible, but only if business users were able to give a 14 month notice of requirement. Signi® cant cost savings depended on whether the business users were alert to this requirement. A second is the need to manage the constituency, in other words to gain and sustain the support of salient stakeholders in the outsourcing programme. A third and, in the reviewer’s experience, highly neglected area is identifying and managing the risks. The authors, indeed, suggest that this is so important that they provide details of how a risk register with risk scores and trends can be developed as a basis for developing a risk mitigation strategy for outsourcing. The second part represents, in fact, approximately half the book. It focuses on preparation ± speci® cally, identifying the procurement process, project and resource plans, how to arrive at a statement of service requirement and how to package an agreement. It communicates the often excruciating detail and comprehensiveness required at the preparation stage in order to make outsourcing arrangements work. As well as providing many practical structures and ideas, it offers insights that could only be from inside experience. As just three examples it is not uncommon for original resource estimates to be 100% wrong, greatest control can be exercised by a core project team no larger than six people and charging mechanisms must as a minimum deliver `pricing certainty within service ̄ exibility’ . Part 2 is particularly detailed and good on human resource and asset issues, charging formulae and how to evaluate proposals. It is tantalizing on how to evaluate relationships ± again, in my experience, a central but frequently neglected area ± but does provide in the Appendix a specimen detailed questionnaire on this that could be used to gain references from vendors’ clients. Overall the cleverness of part 2 is to show how an organization can create a funnel of requirements and prices against which each part of a vendor’s bid can be evaluated on a like-for-like basis. The failure to do this can result, of course, in some unpleasant surprises once a contract is signed. Part 3 covers making a market, negotiating an agreement and implementing and managing the contract. Again, the section provides useful structures and many insights. It is interesting to note that the authors and their clients have found it necessary in large scale outsourcing to be very active in attracting suppliers, reducing their bid costs and demonstrating they are prepared to work in the suppliers’ interests ± including ensuring a reasonable pro® t. If this is the experience and tantamount to `good practice’ , then quite frequently organizations have assumed quite the reverse in their dealings with vendors. Some quotable pieces of advice emerge, for example `never let the other side do your calculations’ and `mature (suppliers) need enticement while Journal of Information Technology (1997) 12, 239± 241",

Competing ideologies and social norms about the efficacy of regulatory regimes, the influence of innovation philosophies, and the need to foster ethical principles and practices underpin debates on crypto-assets. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in the USA and UK with regulators, tech firms, institutional and retail investors, and crypto social media influencers. Stakeholder groups were classified as interventionists, innovators, influencers, and investors. The research builds a data structure from extant literature and empirical research. Aggregate dimensions of inchoate technology, regulatory intervention, and innovation social norms reflect complex and competing stakeholder positions on crypto assets. Findings show crypto-assets are not homogenous, but highly differentiated with potential effects and outcomes determined by algorithmic code. However, competing stakeholder agendas obfuscate policy development for decentralized finance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the pressure on organizations to ensure health and safety in the workplace. An increasing number of organizations are considering wearables and physiolytics devices as part of their safe return to work programs so as to comply with governments’ accountability rules. As with other technologies with ambivalent use (i.e., simultaneously beneficial and harmful), the introduction of these devices in work settings is met with skepticism. In this context, nudging strategies as a way of using design, information, and other ways to manipulate behaviors (system 1 nudge) and choices (system 2 nudge) has gained traction and is often applied alongside the introduction of ambivalent technologies with the aim to “nudge” their use. While the feasibility of different nudge strategies is often studied from only a managerial perspective, where employees’ volitional autonomy and dignity is often treated as secondary, we explore which nudges are acceptable from the perspectives of ordinary workers. Using Q-methodology as a more evolutionary and participatory way to design nudges, we describe five basic strategies that are (to varying degrees) acceptable to them: (a) positive reinforcement and fun, (b) controlling the organizational environment, (c) self-responsibility, (d) collective responsibility, and (e) adapting the individual environment. Our findings show that there is a wide range of viewpoints on what is being considered an acceptable nudge and stress the importance of a transparent, equal dialogue between those who design nudges and potential nudgees. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the theoretical and practical problems that arise from attempts to develop formal characterizations and explanations of many work activities, in particular, collaborative activities. We argue that even seemingly discrete individual activities occur in, and frequently draw upon a complex network of factors: individual, social and organizational. Similarly, organizational and social constraints and practices impact upon individual cognitive processes and the realization of these in specific tasks. Any adequate characterization of work activities therefore requires the analysis and synthesis of information from these traditionally separate sources. We argue that existing frameworks, emanating separately from the respective disciplines (cognitive, social and organizational) do not present an adequate means of studying the dynamics of collaborative activity in situ. An alternative framework, advocated in this paper, is distributed cognition. Its theoretical basis is outlined together with examples of applied studies of computer-mediated work activities in different organizational settings. </jats:p>",

These characteristics influence the nature of approach to be used in the development of any decision aids to support the process. This paper presents an approach adopted in the development of a DSS to support complex decision making in a Public Sector body. The approach incorporates the use of Soft System Methodology (SSM). The role of SSM in Information Systems in general and in the development of DSS in particular is not well understood. This paper attempts to enhance this understanding by presenting the role of SSM in the development life cycle. SSM was found to be useful especially at the initial stage of DSS development, namely in understanding the problem area, as well as in identifying models and information to be used as inputs to the DSS design. </jats:p>",

As a practical mid-point among the above views which are from academia (Thomas and Aleksander) lies the sensible pillar of Mike Dale's view as an industrialist.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Tensions are a major source of communication problems, coordination issues, and conflict in globally distributed work. In this article, we argue that extant literature falls short of addressing tensions in globally distributed work at two levels. First, it fails to fully account for the intrinsic and entrenched nature of tensions in globally distributed work, suggesting instead that they can be resolved or made to disappear. Second, it does not examine the key interactions among different kinds of tensions. Drawing on qualitative data from a distributed finance organization and applying concepts from paradox theory, we show how globally distributed units negotiate knowledge, power, and identity tensions in collaborative work. The findings illuminate how a sequential enactment of both formal and informal solutions can better address tensions and generate collaborative opportunities in globally distributed work. Building on the findings, we develop a phasal model of tension evolution and management in globally distributed work which explains how tensions evolve from a phase of suppression through to a phase of attenuation. We demonstrate the interactions of knowledge–power–identity tensions against a background of defensive, interactive, and collaborative behaviors, and suggest several practical implications for globally distributed work practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This is a high quality book that represents some of the US's leading edge thinking in both information technology and its use. The title is slightly misleading as only a few of the twelve chapters are about technology as such. Three of the papers were given by winners of the BCS Awards on hypertext, disabled use of computing, and the use of low cost Apples to revolutionize an architectural practice. However, the overall standard of the other papers is high. Professor Jim Alty's research into better interfaces in process control (the GRADIENT dialogue system) deserves a wide audience for its implications for control systems generally, and the paper on robotics provides an interesting insight into the subject for the nonspecialist reader. This book can be thoroughly recommended for the general reader who wants an overview of current issues in British computer science and several of the chapters are of direct relevance to those teaching and learning business information systems.",

Our review systematizes the objectives and cost accounting methods underlying past developments in this area. We describe the features of successful chargeout systems, recognizing the current neglect of organizational-level objectives and follow this with a discussion of the advantages of chargeout systems, and the problems involved in their use. An investigation into the context of new ITs reveals a new surge of chargeout software products that require more organizationally oriented chargeout research.

This paper discusses various types of requirement errors and illustrates each error with an example. It also examines several techniques used for requirements verification and the capability of each technique to identify various requirement errors. In addition, it reviews the use of each technique in various requirements analysis approaches and indicates the drawbacks of these techniques. This paper can help systems analysts to be aware of possible errors in requirement specifications and the limitations in requirements verification while using a requirements analysis approach. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Levels of analysis are common frameworks for describing organizational dynamics, both in the general organizational and the information technology (IT)-organizational literature. Levels of analysis – individual, group, intergroup and organizational – are typically presented as constructs under which particular organizational dynamics can be grouped and analysed. Rarely is there any emphasis placed on how events on one level can affect the dynamics of other levels. This article introduces Rashford and Coghlan's framework of organizational levels which describes levels as systemically interrelated and interdependent and, through examples, argues that the IT–organizational literature needs to adopt a more dynamic construct of levels of analysis to account for how IT affects individuals, teams, interteam coordination and organizations concurrently. </jats:p>",

However, previous research has found that current application development methodologies provide little or no support for client/server computing possibly due to the relative newness of the technology in commercial environments. This research is the first step in demonstrating the applicability of the client/server methodology enhancements proposed in a commercial Management Information System (MIS) environment. It examines the application of traditional development methodologies to the client/server environment, the problems associated in using these methodologies and the respondent's rating of the importance of the various client/server application development issues included in the proposed methodology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The origins of the Internet are only partially understood. It is often believed that the Internet grew as a tree from a tiny acorn, the ARPANET network set up in 1969. In this study, we argue that this interpretation is incomplete at best and seriously flawed at worst. Our article makes three contributions. First, on the basis of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources we reconstruct the history of computer networks between the late 1950s and the early 1990s. We show that the ARPANET network was one among a myriad of (commercial and non-commercial) networks that developed over that period of time – the integration of these networks into an internet was likely to happen, whether ARPANET existed or not. Second, we make a systematic effort to quantify the significance of these various networks. This allows us to visualize more clearly the extent to which the ARPANET network was one among many, and not a particularly large one at that. Third, we provide a nuanced interpretation of the rise of various technologies, including the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and the World Wide Web, as ‘dominant designs.’ Their rise should be interpreted within the economic framework of industries with network effects, in which historical accidents bring about tipping points that lead to universal acceptance. We thus show that history matters for understanding why information systems function in the way they do. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Partners of Humans: A Realistic Assessment of the Role of Robots in the Foreseeable Future",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As robots are generally thought to perform human-like tasks, they depend on the successes of information technology in the area of artificial intelligence to succeed in such pursuits. But robots, through their anthropomorphic character and their weighty presence in science fiction, attract the attention of the press and the media in a way that, at times, blurs the distinction between the actual state of the art and exaggerated claims. This makes it hard to assess the true functional positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society. The aim of this paper is to review the actual level of competence that is being achieved in robotics research laboratories and a plausible impact that this is likely to have on human control over life and jobs. The key thesis here is that cognition in machines and even an artificial form of consciousness lead to operations in a set of tasks (the ‘algorithmic’ category) which is different from that available to truly cognitive and conscious human beings (the ‘life-need’ category): that is, in the paper it is argued that a major category error (Ryle in The concept of mind, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1949) looms in predictions of serious threats to humanity. As far as a threat to jobs goes, it is argued that early attention to education and re-skilling of humans in the workplace can lead to an effective symbiosis between people and robots. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many firms have adopted outsourcing in recent years as a means of governing their information technology (IT) operations. While outsourcing is associated with significant benefits, it can also be a risky endeavour. This paper proposes a scenario-based conceptualization of the IT outsourcing risk, wherein risk is defined as a quadruplet comprising a scenario, the likelihood of that scenario, its consequences and the risk mitigation mechanisms that can attenuate or help avoid the occurrence of a scenario. This definition draws on and extends a risk assessment framework that is widely used in engineering. The proposed conceptualization of risk is then applied to the specific context of IT outsourcing using previous research on IT outsourcing as well as transaction cost and agency theory as a point of departure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper critiques the perspective that information technology can play a central role in knowledge-sharing processes. Fundamentally, it suggests that the nature of knowledge itself makes it extremely difficult and that quite specific conditions are required for information technology-based knowledge sharing to occur successfully. The paper proceeds by criticizing the objectivist philosophy of knowledge, which typically underpins the literature advocating information technology-based knowledge management. The centre point of this critique involves questioning one of the foundational assumptions of the objectivist perspective, namely the dichotomy made between tacit and explicit knowledge. Instead, a ‘practice‘-based philosophy of knowledge is proposed that suggests that all knowledge has both tacit and explicit components, is to some extent embodied in human brains and bodies and is embedded in organizational routines, practices and contexts. These characteristics therefore suggest that the role of information technology systems in the sharing of knowledge is likely to be somewhat limited. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We present a review and analysis of the rich body of research on the adoption and diffusion of IT-based innovations by individuals and organizations. Our review analyzes 48 empirical studies on individual and 51 studies on organizational IT adoption published between 1992 and 2003. In total, the sample contains 135 independent variables, eight dependent variables, and 505 relationships between independent and dependent variables. Furthermore, our sample includes both quantitative and qualitative studies. We were able to include qualitative studies because of a unique coding scheme, which can easily be replicated in other reviews. We use this sample to assess predictors, linkages, and biases in individual and organizational IT adoption research. The best predictors of individual IT adoption include Perceived Usefulness, Top Management Support, Computer Experience, Behavioral Intention, and User Support. The best predictors of IT adoption by organizations were Top Management Support, External Pressure, Professionalism of the IS Unit, and External Information Sources. At the level of independent variables, Top Management Support stands as the main linkage between individual and organizational IT adoption. But at an aggregate level, two collections of independent variables were good predictors of both individual and organizational IT adoption. These were innovation characteristics and organizational characteristics. Thus, we can consistently say that generic characteristics of the innovation and characteristics of the organization are strong predictors of IT adoption by both individuals and organizations. Based on an assessment of the predictors, linkages, and known biases, we prescribe 10 areas for further exploration. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper suggests that there is too much emphasis on the requirement for theory use and theory building in qualitative research published in our leading journals. We discuss six concerns that we have that relate to this high status of theory in such papers. We argue for what we refer to as ‘theory light’ papers where theory plays no significant part in the paper and the contribution lies elsewhere, for example, new arguments, facts, patterns or relationships. Some examples of theory light papers (and research) are provided from other disciplines and one exemplar information systems paper is studied in depth. We see these papers as equally worthy as those which demonstrate the applicability and predictive qualities of theory use as well as the potential of theory building. We propose a list of 10 questions that authors and reviewers might ask themselves when writing or reviewing such theory light papers. The more demanding role of the reader is also discussed along with the requirement for editorial teams to adapt. We suggest that the requirement for a contribution to theory would be replaced with the requirement that any journal paper has a high potential for stimulating research that will impact on information systems theory and/or practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper critically analyses the nature and state of decision support systems (DSS) research. To provide context for the analysis, a history of DSS is presented which focuses on the evolution of a number of sub-groupings of research and practice: personal DSS, group support systems, negotiation support systems, intelligent DSS, knowledge management-based DSS, executive information systems/business intelligence, and data warehousing. To understand the state of DSS research an empirical investigation of published DSS research is presented. This investigation is based on the detailed analysis of 1,020 DSS articles published in 14 major journals from 1990 to 2003. The analysis found that DSS publication has been falling steadily since its peak in 1994 and the current publication rate is at early 1990s levels. Other findings include that personal DSS and group support systems dominate research activity and data warehousing is the least published type of DSS. The journal DSS is the major publishing outlet; US ‘Other’ journals dominate DSS publishing and there is very low exposure of DSS in European journals. Around two-thirds of DSS research is empirical, a much higher proportion than general IS research. DSS empirical research is overwhelming positivist, and is more dominated by positivism than IS research in general. Design science is a major DSS research category. The decision support focus of the sample shows a well-balanced mix of development, technology, process, and outcome studies. Almost half of DSS papers did not use judgement and decision-making reference research in the design and analysis of their projects and most cited reference works are relatively old. A major omission in DSS scholarship is the poor identification of the clients and users of the various DSS applications that are the focus of investigation. The analysis of the professional or practical contribution of DSS research shows a field that is facing a crisis of relevance. Using the history and empirical study as a foundation, a number of strategies for improving DSS research are suggested. </jats:p>",

    "title": "What Drives the Adoption of Mobile Data Services? An Approach from a Value Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile data services (MDS) are wireless value-added pay-per-use services that have attracted increased attention in recent years. In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to investigate key drivers of user behavior in wireless pay-per-use services based on a value perspective. This study examines the role of three evaluation criteria -utilitarian, hedonic, and social values - in adoption decisions. Potential adopters have no direct experience with MDS; thus, they likely conceive value based primarily on indirect experience with it, such as through communication with peers or advertisements. In this study, the influence of members in the social networks and external sources are regarded as the major sources of information in order to capture the role of these factors on the perceptions of value. Additionally, according to the age and gender of potential adopters, changes in the degree to which the antecedents lead to MDS acceptance are examined. The proposed model is empirically tested using survey data collected from 287 potential adopters. The analysis results show that the proposed model, based on the aforementioned view of value, provides a significant explanation of the variance in the level of adoption intention toward MDS. The results of this study indicate that utilitarian and social values dominate adoption decisions, whereas the impact of hedonic value in MDS acceptance is weaker than other values. Information from relevant others and from mass media play a critical role in forming the perceptions of value obtained from the use of MDS. The results also shed light on the moderating effects of age and gender on MDS acceptance. Theoretical and practical implications of this work are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is based on data collected as part of an 11-year authors’ survey research on IT trends in different geographic regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and Latin America. This study focuses on global similarities and differences in technology trends (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) among geographies to gain insight into the challenges that IT and non-IT executives face today as well as provide an understanding of the impact these technologies have on the organization's long-term plans and investments. The results for the 11-year period show that the top five management concerns are: (i) IT-business alignment; (ii) business agility; (iii) business cost reduction/controls; (iv) business productivity; and (v) security/privacy. The five most influential technologies are: (i) analytics/business intelligence; (ii) cloud computing; (iii) ERP systems; (iv) CRM systems; and (v) security technologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the alignment of IT and the business and leveraging IT to reduce business expenses and generate revenue are and will remain essential. The results also suggest that the role of the CIO is evolving and offshore outsourcing is on the rise. Budgets, hiring, and salaries are also increasing, albeit cautiously. This research provides important implications for IT managers to benchmark considerations such as organizational, sourcing, spending, issues/concerns, and technologies across geographies, and sheds light on a perspective on leveraging important IT trends to make thoughtful decisions about them over the coming years, and address current business challenges. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "not a text book and so requires some effort on the part of the readers first to find and then to understand the information they require. The book does not present a formal definition of DAI or a definitive set of its properties. There is still not even agreement on all the problems, let alone answers to them. This is all due to the fact that DAI is still a young subject. However, the papers as a whole do seem to cover most of the current research areas and offer some solutions to their problems. It is a book for people with a good knowledge of AI, since a lot of background AI is assumed, but it could be used as a source of references to AI literature for novices. Taking these factors into account, the book is more suitable for a graduate level readership. In a DAI course, it would probably be better to use the book as part of a wider reading course, which included more introductory material.",

    "title": "Making IT Strategy Succeed: Creating a Strategic Alliance between IT and the Business",
    "abstract": "Is it possible to argue that we are at last entering a strategy era when it comes to exploiting IT for business or organizational advantage? Recent evidence from studies in the UK and USA suggest that such optimism is a little premature. Thus Ernst and Young (1990) found only two out of 86 organizations with IT, business and organization strategies aligned. In the UK public sector there is growing concern to develop IT strategies, but still much to be done in their implementation to achieve organizational objectives (Bacon, 1991; Willcocks, 1991). Meanwhile in the US context the Landmark Study contains much case evidence of misaligned strategies and indifferent IT implementation practice (Scott Morton, 1991; Walton, 1989). In this respect the theme of the conference must be viewed as timely. The chairman, Professor Colin Eden of Strathclyde Business School, emphasized this point by suggesting that the good practice presented during the day would be very much that from a biased, untypical sample of organizations. By way of introduction to the conference Colin Eden then spelt out some of the main elements of 'strategic effectiveness' emerging from his own research. These included the importance of getting the involvement of internal stakeholders and external collaborators (e.g. suppliers); of assigning responsibilities for IT benefits to line managers; in seeing applications as a portfolio related to customer needs; in planning for the skilled human resources needed for implementation; making IT requirements coherent with strategic business unit plans. Mock-participation may be counter-productive; history and emergent strategies play important roles their influence cannot be ignored; too many IT strategies cover too much and fail to prioritize and exclude; there is the need for emotional as well as cognitive commitment to strategy development. In his experience organizations rarely feel that business strategy has become imbedded in the culture. This indicates how much more difficult it is, to get interest and support for developing IT strategies.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information systems (IS) are centrally important to the modern form of organization, but their impacts are not yet well understood. IS development is, in general, grounded in a quasi-scientific ‘formal-rationalism’, oriented chiefly towards technical aspects; yet the accompanying difficulties in implementation are due for the most part to ‘people problems’. In defining an IS as a computer system embedded in an organization, this paper argues that information systems are not purely technical systems, but also social systems. Consequently, work in this area necessitates an interactionist approach, taking the effects of information technology to be a product of neither the technical nor social aspects alone, but of their interaction. Evaluation is shaped, similarly, by the interaction of technique with social process: it is a multi-stage activity running through IS development. The history of IS development in the Processing Company illustrates these views and highlights the dysfunctionality of the formal-rational perspective. </jats:p>",

The impact of outsourcing drivers including efficiency, IS alignment and the human resource dimension are explored and balanced against the perceived outsourcing risks. It is also postulated that although managers claim rational economic benefits, when making outsourcing decisions, they may, in fact, be bounded in their rationality by their perception of the quality experienced as users of IS/IT. Hence, it is suggested that the real justification for outsourcing may be that it provides a definitive, albeit drastic, vehicle for change. </jats:p>",

In terms of performance, reliability, storage capacity, size and cost, the computers of today out-perform those of 40 years ago by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, the rate of advance has not slowed down. As against that, what has software engineering achieved? Few software products will ever exceed the original EDSAC (an early British computer built at Cambridge University) initial orders in functionality, ingenuity, elegance, economy and performance.",

    "title": "Case Study: Implementing New Systems at Penguin Books",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the costs of computer systems continue to rise, and the commercial advantages become harder to maintain, the implementation of IT projects is coming under close scrutiny. An analysis of the methods used at Penguin Books suggests that a coherent, carefully planned programme, giving priority to the needs of the end-users, can greatly improve the levels of efficiency and reduce support costs once the system goes live. This article outlines the steps taken in drawing up an integrated package of research, documentation and training, and explains how the users were encouraged to contribute to the design of the overall implementation programme. The methods described are put forward as a means of reducing the massive costs currently incurred by implementing new systems, and improving the return on this investment. By prioritizing the role of the user, this article offers a coherent solution to some of the current IT investment problems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A prerequisite for conducting sound academic research in information systems is to understand the research process – how to identify a suitable research problem, how to create a theoretical conjecture and hypotheses, how to collect data and how to test and analyse them. An appreciation of these issues is essential before any professional research may be conducted either for general academic publication or for a higher degree. This paper discusses, in general terms, the nature of academic research and how the scientific method is used in practice. It identifies three major categories of research and explains the steps which the research needs to follow if a claim is to be made that a significant addition has been made to the collection of knowledge.

    "title": "Robo-apocalypse cancelled? Commentary",
    "abstract": "Leslie Wilcocks has tackled an important and challenging issue as organisations and researchers try to predict the impact that new technologies like AI and robotics will have on the work of the future. This is an important debate for both the demand and supply side of this equation as educators try to predict what skills will be required, while organisations grapple with the plethora of continually emerging technologies and the impact these are likely to have on their business models and their people. This article does a good job of highlighting how difficult the demand side is to predict by casting the AI argument in terms of ‘hype or fear’ and showing the array of predictive studies. With these vastly differing predicted outcomes, it is no wonder that senior leaders are struggling to get any clarity around new horizons, let alone on how to prioritise the investments to get there. One thing seems very clear from the research of Wilcocks (and colleagues) is that the technology development will happen much faster than the human capabilities that are required to generate value from them. It is largely the labour dynamics that present the key challenges to the impact robotic processes and cognitive automation will have on work, workplace, and the ways of working. Wilcocks presents eight qualifiers to curate the range of perspectives that frame our understanding of the impact of new technologies on work. This is helpful and a worthwhile contribution to a more critical approach at a macro-level. It also serves to help us to understand why, despite the hype around cognitive computing, companies are slower to adopt these technologies beyond contained experiments and even slower to work out how to capture value. Examining the challenges of using AI and Robotics at the organisational level casts even more light on why the macro-predictions vary to such a degree and how the ‘fear, hype’ discourses pervade. Tarafdar et al. (2019) found that despite the hype around AI (which they refer to as Enterprise Cognitive Computing (ECC)), the actual rate of adoption was very low and measurable results of firm value from their efforts even lower. In their survey of 106 large organisations, they found that (in line with similar studies) less only 50% had ECC applications in place, and of these, only half had produced measurable business benefits. Wilcocks and colleagues concur with these findings, finding that these technologies are much more difficult, and therefore slower, to implement than companies first anticipate. Some of these challenges appear to be around the unrealistic expectations about the powers of AI technologies themselves, but many were about underestimating the organisational requirements to realise business value. Tarafadar et al., in a further study of 33 companies and 51 use cases, identified five capabilities that are crucial to realising value from AI investments: data science competence, business domain proficiency, enterprise architecture expertise, an operational IT backbone and digital inquisitiveness. Each of these capabilities are challenging for large, traditional companies to develop. They require significant investments in technology, shifting decision rights, high levels of dedicated senior executive focus, and integration across silos and functions. In addition, large organisations typically find it hard to attract and retain the skilled talent required to deliver on these capabilities, and therefore, struggle to deliver complex AI solutions that are meaningful for the business. Adding to this organisational challenges, the majority of large firms look to the contingent workforce (e.g. freelancers, contractors, outsourcers) to fill skill gaps and extend the number of design and development teams to meet company deadlines. This multi-dimensional workforce adds, yet another, layer of complexity to realising the value from AI and Robotic efforts. In our study of 279 companies, we found that 63% of organisations source over 50% of their digital talent from the contingent labour market.1 While this strategy may fill some of the short-term digital and data skill requirements, it is much more challenging when it Robo-apocalypse cancelled?

While claims which exaggerate the impact of technological changes should not be taken seriously, within the context of current developments in world capitalism CSCW assumes particular importance raising cultural and organizational problems at least as much as economic and technological ones. The flexibility, variety and disorder associated with ‘post-modern’ organizations (i.e. organizations characteristic of the epoch after modernism) necessitate the adoption of ‘postmodern’ approaches to understanding (i.e. approaches to the theory of knowledge developed in linguistics and philosophy) which emphasise the significance of communication, interpretation, improvization, negotiation and learning processes. The suggestion is that, for the impact of CSCW to be understood, conventional theories of organization should be replaced by theories of collective activity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Whaling is one of the most financially damaging, well-known, effective cyberattacks employed by sophisticated cybercriminals. Although whaling largely consists of sending a simplistic email message to a whale (i.e. a high-value target in an organization), it can result in large payoffs for cybercriminals, in terms of money or data stolen from organizations. While a legitimate cybersecurity threat, little information security research has directed attention toward whaling. In this study, we begin to provide an initial understanding of what makes whaling such a pernicious problem for organizations, executives, or celebrities (e.g. whales), and those charged with protecting them. We do this by defining whaling, delineating it from general phishing and spear phishing, presenting real-world cases of whaling, and provide guidance on future information security research on whaling. We find that whaling is far more complex than general phishing and spear phishing, spans multiple domains (e.g. work and personal), and potentially results in spillover effects that ripple across the organization. We conclude with a discussion of promising future directions for whaling and information security research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Blockchain systems afford new privacy capabilities. This threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, once risks have become clear. Such regulation may not be possible as protocols and rulesets currently being coded into the system may be impossible to amend in the future (unless they can obtain either developer or network consensus). The third is that regulators assume methods for overseeing extraordinary transaction are necessary to avoid widespread, near-effortless money laundering. Yet, each of the other social worlds is operating under the assumption that this trade-off has already been accepted. These findings demonstrate subtle power transitions and changes in privacy attitudes that have implications for research on blockchain, management, and boundary objects in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In a few words, Information Payoff by Paul Strassmann is likely to have an impact in the world of information technolog-y equal to that which Schumacher's Small is Beautiful had on the world at large. Ex-Vice President of the Information Products Group at the Xerox Corporation, Paul Strassmann is one of the most influential figures in the management of information technology today. The word 'guru' comes to mind, but this would be totally unfair and inappropriate. Strassmann believes that the proper management of information technology comes from a thorough and rigorous basis in the measurement of the effectiveness of management. The spiritual qualities of a guru might only be applicable in the appealing and persuasive style in which The Information Payoff has been written.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study advances the field of Computationally Intensive Theory Development (CTD) by examining the capabilities of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), in particular SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for theory development, while providing guidelines for this process. We evaluate SHAP’s methodological abilities and develop a structured approach for using SHAP to harness insights from black-box predictive models. For this purpose, we leverage a dual-methodological approach. First, to assess SHAP’s capabilities in uncovering patterns that shape a phenomenon, we conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation study. Second, to illustrate and guide the theory development process with SHAP for CTD, we apply SHAP in a use-case using real-world data. Based on these analyses, we propose a stepwise uniform and replicable approach giving guidance that can benefit rigorous theory development and increase the traceability of the theorizing process. With our structured approach, we contribute to the use of XAI approaches in research and, by uncovering patterns in black-box prediction models, add to the ongoing search for next-generation theorizing methods in the field of Information Systems (IS). </jats:p>",

They also often hold a romantic view of theory building, which they envision either as emerging from trancelike writing or as the product of a straightforward deductive process. The perspective I offer is more realistic and pragmatic. I espouse the view that the outcomes of a researcher’s theorizing efforts are often incomplete explanations of a phenomenon, which, given a chance, may develop into rich theories. I propose a highly iterative spiral model that portrays theory building as a craft, which calls for care and ingenuity, and requires patience and perseverance.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With this article, we contribute to the recent debate regarding the role of transaction cost economics in IT outsourcing and software development outsourcing research. Our focus is on the contract-type choice for short-term software development outsourcing. For this purpose, we critically examine transaction cost economics and the extant IT outsourcing/software development outsourcing literature and propose a framework which classifies software development outsourcing transactions according to transaction frequency and transaction investment characteristics. The framework identifies short-term software development outsourcing as an occasional, idiosyncratic transaction. Based on this groundwork, we clarify the concept of short-term contract and put forward that such a transaction is governed by a short-term contract. Following transaction cost economics and control theory, our resulting theoretical considerations infer that for short-term software development outsourcing, the vendor’s high human asset specificity and the resulting behaviour-based outcome control, the monitoring of the developer staff, are the triggers for contract-type decisions. Accordingly, staff monitoring by the client should result in Time &amp; Material contracts, whereas staff monitoring by the vendor should result in Fixed Price contracts. We develop corresponding hypotheses which we test with 468 specific contract records for short-term software development outsourcing. The results confirm the transaction cost economics–based recommendations for contract-type choice. We therefore conclude that the advice of the transaction cost economics to use certain governance structures according to transaction attributes is also applicable to IT outsourcing/software development outsourcing transactions. We suggest further exploration of specific contract records to substantiate our results. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In their pursuit of public health goals, policymakers increasingly turn to innovative apps to complement existing health measures. However, findings from previous research in non-IT health contexts indicate that individuals may compensate for new interventions (e.g., start exercising) by reducing existing preventive health behaviors (e.g., eating fewer healthy foods). However, the findings are inconclusive, and it is unknown when people tend to engage in behavioral compensation. Building on this observation, we draw on rational choice theory to substantiate the subjective rationality of compensation behavior and develop a utility maximization model that suggests circumstances under which adoption of technological innovation may lead to users reducing existing preventive health behaviors. This research provides evidence from a multi-wave study on COVID-19 contact-tracing apps that confirms the existence of what we term the technology-behavioral compensation effect: Individuals who perceive the app to be highly useful or actively use it reduce other preventive health behaviors (e.g., social distancing) after app adoption. Ironically, this technology-behavioral compensation effect indicates a hitherto-overlooked tension between two established IS design goals (i.e., perceived usefulness and active use) and the successful exploitation of technology to support users’ health. We expand research on dark side effects of IS use by revealing a previously neglected type of unintended consequence and elaborate on its implications for research well beyond the health context. Our findings also will help policymakers make decisions on the design of societal technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The rapidly increasing use of outsourcing for IT services, both in the public and private sectors, has attracted much interest from researchers and practitioners alike. While early studies of IT outsourcing were largely qualitative in nature, more recent studies have attempted to analyse the outcomes achieved in quantitative terms. This paper is consistent with the latter, but goes further by modelling the price, performance and contract characteristics that are relevant to IT outsourcing. A two-equation recursive regression model was used to analyse 48 contracts for IT support and maintenance. The results did not reveal any quantitatively significant price-performance trade-off, but did suggest that first-term contracts (i.e. the first ever contract awarded by a client for the provision of a particular IT service) were more expensive than repeat contracts. Although competitive tendering did not result in lower prices than directly negotiated contracts, it was associated with comparatively better performance. Well-defined expectations of an organization's IT requirements were also likely to lead to improved performance when the service was outsourced. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Understanding Slow Internet Adoption: ‘Infomediation’ in Ship-Broking Markets",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Debate on the impact of the Internet on socioeconomic and business environments has been dominated by technological determinist perspectives, narrowing the range of discourse around the implications of these new technologies. One important and neglected dimension is the impact on market relationships. Technological determinism suggests that the transactional efficiencies associated with the new medium should have a major impact on market structures. If that argument is correct, the case should be stronger in broking markets where information exchange, information mediation and communication flows are paramount. However, an examination of various broking markets reveals significant differences in the implications of this technological innovation. Drawing upon participant observation research conducted in 1998–99 in the shipbroking market, the paper explores the limitations of the technological determinist perspective and puts forward a model to explore the changing nature and dynamics of market relationships generated by information flows via the Internet. Application of the model helps to locate the reasons for slow adoption of the Internet in ship-broking markets. </jats:p>",

    "title": "An Empirical Evaluation of the Impact of Case on Developer Productivity and Software Quality",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paperpresents the findings of research into the impact of computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools. It is based on a questionnaire survey of software developers in UK organizations. CASE had a positive effect on developer productivity and the quality of applications software. It particularly improved the reliability and accuracy of applications software, though this was sometimes offset by a deterioration in software efficiency. There was little evidence of productivity being ‘traded’ for quality, since developers citing productivity gains also tended to report quality improvements. The extent to which organizations were able to realize the benefits of CASE depended on the experience, competence and training of individual developers. This has significant implications for the selection and training of personnel and the use of consultants. Methodologically, the findings also serve to underline the importance of explicitly taking account of prior development environments, when using retrospective methods to evaluate different software technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizing vision (OV) theory, developed more than 25 years ago, posits a broad, diverse, and collective envisioning process at the heart of information technology innovation and diffusion. We revisit the theory and review more than 150 publications that have referenced the original paper, seeking to ascertain how the theory has been found useful in addressing innovation with information technology. We group and analyze these contributions according to how the promotion, reception, and enactment of organizing visions engage participants in bringing about change. In our review, we find that a varied group of some 46 technologies and their OVs have been studied. We consider how these contributions have also drawn from and spoken to related theories, topics, and literatures, finding that the influence of OV theory has largely been confined to the information systems field. Looking to the future, we address: (i) whether newer technologies in the changing digitized world are problematic for OV theory; (ii) how the overall engagement mechanism comprising promotion, reception, and enactment can be more deeply understood; and (iii) how OV theory can speak more effectively beyond traditional IS disciplinary bounds. Building especially on the more recent contributions, we propose a reimagining of the theory with which to guide its continued development and application. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "described as using information technology, such as the Internet and World Wide Web (Web), to enable commercial transactions, and it is revolutionizing the way companies conduct their business. Companies use business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce applications to manage their global supply chains and market and sell their products to corporate customers. In addition, business-to-consumer (B2C) applications enable interaction with individual consumers anywhere in the world. It is truly a global phenomenon. Some of the organizational bene® ts of e-commerce include cost reduction, enhanced customer service, access to new global markets, and enhanced potential for partnering. But these come with costs and challenges including the need for hiring or retraining of information technology personnel, pro® t uncertainty in the new global markets, perceived problems with Internet security not seen with traditional retail sales, and dif® culty in gaining competitive advantage on the Internet. The rapid growth of e-commerce is outpacing our ability to understand and predict its future. This provides many research opportunities. In the earliest days of e-commerce there were far more Internet users in the US than the rest of the world. Approximately seven years after the introduction of Web-based applications we ® nd that 1999 is the ® rst year where the number of US and non-US Internet users is approximately equal (an estimated 54 million people in each group). And it is predicted that by 2002 there will be 88 million non-US Internet users, compared with 68 million US users. These numbers illustrate potential for growth in global B2C e-commerce revenues, projected to be US$35.3 billion in 2002, but B2B e-commerce is even larger, projected to be US$268 billion in 2002. These numbers illustrate the dramatic growth in e-commerce when compared with 1997 worldwide e-commerce revenues, from both B2C and B2B, of only US$7.4 billion. While the US market is becoming increasingly saturated ± generally those that want to, and can get online, are already there ± the world at large has a bigger base to grow from and therefore represents the greatest long-term growth opportunity. True globalization will begin to occur over the next few years, due to the following factors:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media technology not only affords opportunities for digital activism and global liberation, but it also poses threats to the freewheeling of democracy. The emergence and prevalence of conspiracy theories on social media stem from communal processes of online political debate or social movements that degenerate into conspiracy beliefs. This study views the online formation of conspiracy theories as a socially emergent process. Subscribing to a social constructionist lens and synthesizing extant literature on social movements and social media affordances, we conducted discourse analysis on discursive data collected from Twitter for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election Fraud Conspiracy Theory. Through the analysis, we delineate the formation of conspiracy theory into four stages and characterize each stage according to its mobilizing structure, participants, mode of interaction, content created, and discernible collective action. We also identify social media affordances facilitating the formation of conspiracy theories within and across stages. Findings of this study advance contemporary knowledge on conspiracy theories by not only extending our understanding of the role of social media in conspiracy theory formation, but they also aid practitioners in comprehending the formation process of conspiracy theory formation, the latter of which constitutes the foundation for devising appropriate prevention and mitigation strategies. </jats:p>",

It has its origins in research undertaken by geographers at University College, Swansea, for Cadw. It is much to the credit of Cadw that it commissioned the original work. John Carr, Director of Cadw, came to that post in 1985 and immediately recognized that his was much more than a caretaker role. Existing knowledge in Cadw about visitors and non-visitors to Welsh monuments was slight and Carr early sought to remedy the situation with this research. He was obviously sufficiently satisfied with the results to contribute his own chapter, on research and the heritage operator, to the book. He recognizes, however, the clear distinction between research and management:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the situation and suggests a way ahead. It is in three parts. The first part reviews the situation at the start of the 1990s. It identifies the growing concern of managers about justifying IT investment, and the methods which they currently use in their organizations to do so. The second part discusses the challenge facing managers, at the general level and in the field of Information Management. A major challenge is for IT/IS to be viewed within the context of strategic business thinking, the principles of which are described in this section. The third part of the paper outlines the response of managers and IT professionals in this area in the 1990s. A benefit-level matrix is described which can be used as a tool for both analysis and synthesis within the business context. Finally, there is some practical guidance about managing benefits alongside other aspects of IT projects. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Applying Methodologies for Information Systems Development",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many organizations develop their information systems without the use of any information systems development methodology. However, even when organizations identify the need for the use of such methodologies, it is not always obvious which to use, or whether a blended combination might be appropriate. Further, in using either stand-alone or blended information systems development methodologies in practice, a number of difficulties are encountered. This paper discusses the use of an information systems development methodology which consisted of a blend of other methodologies in a real-world situation (a large telecommunications company) where no formal methodology had been used previously. A number of difficulties arose in practice, some of which were not anticipated. Examples are given of the types of difficulty encountered, and these fell into three broad categories: those related to the deficiencies in the design techniques and tools themselves; those related to implementing the system from the design; and those related to the particular environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Business process reengineering and information architecture share a common strategic and business process focus. Both can be mutually supportive of each other's objectives. Information architecture design can produce a stable IA capable of supporting existing as well as improved business processes. Reciprocally, business process redesign (BPR) provides a high profile business justification for the IA endeavour. Given proper collaboration between corporate and IT strategic planners, both BPR and IA efforts should produce a number of valuable common outputs. These include the identification of business processes within an organization, the prioritization of these processes based on their strategic relevance, the establishment of process performance measures, and the modelling of these processes and their supporting information resources. A synergistic model of IA and BPR is presented and selected IA techniques and modelling methods are recommended. Future research is suggested concerning the need to test the relationship between BPR and IA. </jats:p>",

To do this, we identify the different assumptions regarding the implementation context implicit in the two theories and, based on these differences, develop a contingent model within which to integrate the two theories. A partial test of the model within one particular context is reported using data collected from the end-users of an IS innovation introduced in a State health system in Australia. As hypothesized, we find that, within the context, characterized by high individual level impact and low group level impact, the contribution of innovation characteristics to implementation success is higher than that of implementation process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Information systems (IS) scholarship and practice aim to predict phenomena and outcomes of IS use. These phenomena of IS use are typically set in multi-leveled, dynamic, and complex contexts that lend explanation to the non-positivist tradition in IS research. However, limited methodological options exist to make predictions. In this research, we propose stratified agent-based modeling, a step-by-step approach that enables prediction in non-positivist paradigms. Drawing upon the critical realist philosophy of science, which suggests ontological stratification and assumes open systems, we adopt a retroduction-based explanation formation and agent-based modeling to simulate different potential states of a complex system. The critical step in combining critical realism with agent-based modeling involves identifying and codifying the underlying generative mechanisms (i.e., causal powers) into various components of the agent-based model. We propose four steps toward prediction under the critical realist paradigm: (1) capturing the phenomenon, (2) identifying the generative mechanism, (3) building the agent-based model, and (4) simulating states of the system. We present an exemplar of our proposed approach that investigates the effectiveness of strategies to combat malicious content propagation in social networks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 2010 Journal of Information Technology (JIT) article, ‘A Review of the IT Outsourcing Empirical Literature and Future Research Directions,’ analyzed 741 findings on the determinants of Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) decisions and outcomes from 164 empirical articles published between 1992 and 2010. Using the same coding method, the 2011 JIT article, ‘Business Process Outsourcing Studies: A Critical Review and Research Directions,’ analyzed 615 findings on the determinants of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) decisions and outcomes from 67 empirical articles published between 1996 and 2011. Taken together, these two reviews found that the preponderance of evidence from both ITO and BPO research streams produced largely consistent results pertaining to the categories of independent variables that affected outsourcing decisions and outcomes. To investigate the most current research findings on business services, which comprise ITO and BPO, and to compare the results with the prior JIT reviews, we replicated the method used in the prior JIT reviews. In this update, we examined 174 newly published articles across 78 academic journals published between 2010 and 2014. We found that researchers have significantly expanded the variables of interest in the last 4 years. In all, researchers investigated 69 new variables. Compared with earlier research, this review of recent articles found a deeper exploration of the direct effects of transaction attributes, sourcing motivations, client and provider capabilities, and governance on sourcing decisions and outcomes. Researchers have also studied a broader variety of sourcing decisions, including shared services, captive centers, rural sourcing and backsourcing. This update also found a more nuanced understanding of relational governance and its interaction with contractual governance. We assessed the research progress that has been made on ten previously identified gaps in knowledge. We proposed a future research agenda that includes continued, incremental progress on ‘normal science’ research questions, as well as more ambitious research goals. We challenged researchers to investigate how sourcing clients, providers, and advisors can protect jobs, protect the environment, and ensure security in an increasingly automated world. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Grover &amp; Lyytinen (2015) urged to reassess the Information System (IS) field’s exclusive dependence on reference theories and to engage more in blue-ocean theorizing. From its inception, such need has been latent in the field, because it deals with novel, fast changing, complex, and systemic phenomena that is hard to account with received theory. We note in this essay that the need for innovative theorizing is heightened given the unprecedented, pervasive digitalization of contemporary society, accelerated by ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this essay, we scrutinize further the idea of blue-ocean theorizing and review the characteristics, impediments, and merits of developing innovative theory. We define endeavors toward such theory as collectively endorsed cognitive processes which increase variance and novelty of theoretical accounts of IS phenomena. These push to deviate from the field’s established theoretical (canonical) core by relaxing six assumptions that guide dominant, legitimate forms of the field’s theorizing. We identify and review institutional barriers that curb the development of innovative theory. In conclusion, we offer guidelines for how the field and its stakeholders can productively engage in developing and evaluating innovative theory. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The dynamics of institutional pressures and stakeholder behavior in national electronic health record implementations: A tale of two countries",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through electronic health record implementation, national healthcare systems are aiming for care integration and enhancement. However, the path to large-scale electronic health record implementation is seldom smooth, involving multiple stakeholders with diverse interests and influences. This study proposes a framework that draws on both stakeholder and institutional theories to understand the complex dynamics of stakeholder interactions and institutional pressures over time during electronic health record systems implementation. This framework is utilized to analyze the national electronic health record programs of Singapore and England, which provide contrasting perspectives on how two top-down system implementations took place with different outcomes. Our results suggest that in the Singapore case, the presence of boundary spanners, supporting implementation agency that included IT staff from healthcare organizations, and greater engagement with medical professionals were associated with more positive dynamics of stakeholder interactions (e.g. limited pushback from professionals or the press) during electronic health record implementation than in England. Differences in the healthcare structures and systems, electronic health record project organization, and the combined influences of institutional pressures shed light on the varying implementation paths and outcomes in the two cases. This study adds to the health information technology literature through a comparative examination of the organizational and social processes during complex national healthcare integration projects. It also contributes to the institutional and stakeholder literatures in several ways, in particular by depicting the processes and outcomes of the dynamics of isomorphic pressures played out under different institutional conditions. Finally, our proposed framework provides a useful conceptual tool for analyzing such complex IT implementations across multiple stakeholders. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Factors Affecting the Successful Realisation of Benefits from Systems Development Projects: Findings from Three Case Studies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The return that organisations derive from investments in information systems and technology continues to disappoint. While there is a very significant body of literature on the factors that should facilitate a successful outcome from systems development, there is growing concern that these prescriptions are not having their desired effect. In this paper, we argue that the success of a systems development project should be measured in terms of its ability to deliver meaningful benefits, rather than the timely delivery of a technical artefact, and therefore organisations should adopt an explicit and proactive benefits realisation approach when investing in IT. Consequently, we sought to explore those actionable factors that might facilitate the effective realisation of benefits from systems development initiatives. Three organisations were identified that claimed to adopt a proactive approach to benefits realisation, and detailed studies of their systems development practices were conducted. Our analysis found that whilst one organisation had been successful in its adoption of a benefits realisation perspective, the other two had not, and this allowed us to identify those factors that helped to explain this difference in outcomes. In short, this paper makes an important contribution by identifying how a subset of traditional systems success factors might be enhanced, to give them a more explicit benefits realisation orientation. Moreover, it presents a coherent set of principles that can be used for deriving other factors and practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One way of generating revenue from broadband media content rests upon the assumption that multi-media content may trigger a greater intent to buy products and services impulsively. An experiment was performed in order to explore the effects of media formats on the emotions and impulse buying intentions for music compact discs (CDs). Three distinct media formats of World Wide Web pages were set up: (1) the text of the lyrics, (2) still images from the song's music video and (3) the music video itself. Each had a varying degree of visual/ verbal intensity while simultaneously playing the soundtrack in all three conditions. The results of this study indicate that displaying the text of the lyrics had a greater effect on the impulse buying intent than showing still images of the music video. In addition, different media formats caused emotional responses that can explain the participant's impulse buying intent to buy the CD. Unexpectedly, the still images and video did not necessarily generate more buying intention than combinations of the text and music. Therefore, it is recommended that electronic commerce and marketing managers explore innovative ways of integrating visual and verbal media formats for eliciting an effective consumer response. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of social networking websites presents further opportunities for criminals to obtain information for use in identity theft, cyber-stalking, and worse activities. This paper presents research investigating why users of social networking websites willingly disclose personal information and what sorts of information they provide (or not). The study employed an ethnographic approach of participation in the online community and interviews of community members, combined with a quantitative survey. The findings show that users are often simply not aware of the issues or feel that the risk to them personally is very low. The paper develops a preliminary theoretical model to explain the information disclosure phenomenon. It further recommends that government agencies or social networking websites themselves conduct campaigns to inform the public of these issues and that social networking websites consider removing some facilities. The study was conducted in an Australian context and focussed on the popular Facebook website. </jats:p>",

    "title": "On being ‘Systematic’ in Literature Reviews in IS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> General guidelines for conducting literature reviews often do not address the question of literature searches and dealing with a potentially large number of identified sources. These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature. Moreover, SLRs are claimed to be a ‘standardized method’ for literature reviews that is replicable, transparent, objective, unbiased and rigorous, and thus superior to other approaches for conducting literature reviews. These are significant and consequential claims that – despite increasing adoption of SLRs – remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR's claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed SLR process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLRs are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLRs provide superior quality are not justified. More importantly, we argue that SLR as a general approach to conducting literature reviews is highly questionable, concealing significant perils. The paper cautions that SLR could undermine critical engagement with literature and what it means to be scholarly in academic work. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Toward Smarter Health and Well-Being: An Implicit Role for Networking and Information Technology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The number of people afflicted with chronic illnesses such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes has soared in recent years, generating new kinds of disparate medical challenges. In turn, these challenges have resulted in skyrocketing costs, preventable deaths, and medical malpractice claims. For example, studies have found nearly half of all US patients receive inadequate care each year, over 2 million are harmed by hospital-acquired infections, and over 1 million suffer disabling complications during surgery – even though half of these are thought to be avoidable. These challenges have catalyzed the beginning of a transformation in care delivery, from a health-care system that focuses on disease to one that must look after patients – including individuals and communities. To provide proper treatment to those who are chronically ill, the health-care system has to support improved individuals’ health-related practices prior to the manifestation of disease; ensure that a range of practitioners can deliver quality clinical care during the onset of an illness; and facilitate patient-provider-family partnerships during post-disease wellness care. As we describe in this review, key advances in networking and information technologies – spanning patient monitoring, data visualization and decision making, robotics and computer vision for diagnosis and surgery, social networking for fostering community-based support systems, and so on – stand to drive forward these changes. Together with social scientists, systems engineers, medical practitioners, and computer scientists, information systems scholars can help alter the nature of care delivery well into the twenty-first century, ultimately contributing to a system that is much more safe, effective, reliable, and timely than it is today. </jats:p>",

The research analyses the role of micro-level processes of interplay in embedding an intranet in the formal functioning of an organisation and in the habits and routines of its employees. The findings identify two types of processes of interplay underpinning this process of institutionalisation. The first operates at the level of constitutive expectations and refers to mutual changes to the governance, policy and control mechanisms which foster the perception that the intranet is part of the expected formal functioning of the organisation. The second operates at the level of background expectations and refers to mutual changes that make the intranet look more familiar, functional, easier to use, fostering its embedding in routines and habits of the employees. The study aims to motivate more research on institutionalisation as a bottom-up micro process of gradual development of institutionalised behaviour. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Companies across industries are shifting toward a platform ecosystem strategy. By leveraging cloud computing technologies, companies aim to benefit from collaboration with a wide range of third-party developers within emergent platform ecosystems. To succeed, these companies need to develop new organizational capabilities to co-create and capture value in platform ecosystems. To understand what capabilities are crucial to establish platform ecosystems and how they contribute to value co-creation and value capture, we conducted a multi-year, in-depth case study of SAP’s cloud platform project. We identified (1) technology-related capabilities (cloud-based platformization, open IT landscape management) and (2) relationship-driven capabilities (ecosystem orchestration, platform evangelism, platform co-selling) and illustrate how these capabilities help the platform owner to enable and balance value co-creation and value capture in an emergent platform ecosystem. With our findings, we contribute to the discussion on how companies can overcome the challenging emergent phase of platform ecosystems. We thereby bridge literature on value creation in platform ecosystems and on organizational capabilities. Though we conducted our study in the context of the enterprise software industry, we discuss how our findings apply to prospective platform owners from different contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There have been few management concepts, even including Total Quality’, ‘World Class Manufacturing’ and ‘Excellence’ to have generated such enormous media interest so quickly as the phenomenon of Business Process Redesign (BPR). The IT community in particular has latched on to the concept, although since its inception it has broadened its appeal. This paper discusses the significant issues relating to BPR and makes a distinction between business re-engineering and business process redesign. Based on a study of a number of organizations who claim to be active, the essential ingredients of BPR are presented. The paper then identifies how organizations are managing their redesign initiatives and presents emerging themes. The paper concludes with some of the lessons learned from the research to date and addresses the vital issues of whether BPR is hype, hope or hypocrisy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "At first sight there seems to be no connection between physical uncertainty and practical affairs. However, in the sense of intrinsic unpredictability in detail, uncertainty is fundamental in our present understanding of the physical world, in which living organisms exist and consequently should be included in any theoretical analysis. It should therefore be possible to trace a connection between the familiar intrinsic unpredictability in the behaviour of living organisms, including our fellows and ourselves, and the intrinsic unpredictability in the behaviour of small objects that has been recognized by physicists since Boltzmann and Heisenberg. This paper is an attempt to establish such a connection by consideration of the essential mechanisms of life and the relevance of physical uncertainty to their operation.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on Fligstein's (1990) work on ‘conceptions of control’ (broad managerial paradigms), this paper provides an analysis of the ways in which information technology (IT) artefacts shape and are shaped by institutional contexts. Specifically, we report on primary and secondary empirical data that spans a 44-year period pertaining to the uses made of the Amazon rainforest monitoring system (a set of satellite-based geographic information systems). This paper argues that: (1) the process of institutional change is conflictual, emergent and contested; (2) the design and use of IT artefacts tend to reflect the currently dominant conceptions of control; (3) that IT artefacts that emerge within a specific conception of control can be later reconfigured to serve the interests of other conceptions of control; (4) and finally, IT artefacts might unintentionally reinforce alternate conceptions of control and lead to institutional change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The impact of a discipline's research is constrained by its ability to articulate compelling problems. Well-crafted problems are the foundation for mobilizing the effort, resources, and attention essential to scientific progress and broader impact. We argue that Information Systems (IS) scholars, individually and collectively, must develop the practice of articulating and engaging large-scale, broad scope problems – or grand challenges. To support this position, we examine the role and value of grand challenge efforts in science and engineering based on a theory of grand challenges as socially constructed boundary objects. Conceptualizing grand challenges in these terms implies strategies and approaches for magnifying the impact of IS research by engaging these types of problems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article empirically investigates the process by which a digital infrastructure evolved and took the architectural form of a digital platform as a core–periphery structure over a 20-year period. Our study pays special attention to the developmental dependencies of the components of the infrastructure’s installed base and how the interdependencies between the platform core and periphery evolve over time. We use the notion of ‘generative entrenchment’ to provide an account of the formation and unfolding of a core–periphery structure from an evolving digital infrastructure that highlights three aspects of the process. First, the process of architectural evolution that our study depicts comprises three phases showing a gradual reversal of the entrenchment relationship of the platform core and periphery: (1) entrenchment of the periphery, (2) mutual entrenchment of the core and periphery, and (3) entrenchment of the core. Second, we show how the generatively entrenched infrastructure’s installed base shaped the decisions and choices regarding the initial platform core. Third, we identify three architectural practices (creating redundancy in the core, augmenting the core with novelty, and reducing the heterogeneity of an entrenched peripheral component and later integrating it into the core) that weakened the entrenchment of the peripheral components, amplified the role of the core, and consolidated the core–periphery structure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Being connected to the Internet through various mobile devices is pervasive in our daily professional and private lives. Yet, the way people connect, including when, with whom and through which communication channels differs, manifesting individuals’ idiosyncratic connectivity patterns. In team collaboration, where individuals are dependent on each other’s availability and responsiveness, differences in team members’ connectivity patterns can lead to clashing expectations concerning connectivity. This, in turn, can compromise individuals’ well-being and productivity and threaten team collaboration outcomes. In this paper, we address the question of how to manage connectivity in interdependent teams and align connectivity patterns to facilitate successful collaboration while at the same time safeguarding individuals’ connectivity boundaries. To address this question, we conducted a qualitative case study that involved 39 semi-structured interviews with employees and members of the management board of an international consultancy headquartered in Germany. Building on concepts established in boundary theory, we coined the term “connectivity boundaries” and identified the six boundary work tactics, externalizing, accommodating, adapting, pushing, sacrificing, and enforcing that allow team members to create, maintain, temporarily change, and reclaim their connectivity boundaries and achieve team collaboration success. We developed propositions that highlight which contextual factors and goals are associated with which boundary work tactic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an exploratory study that provides a brief history of information systems (IS) in corporations that are not part of the Information Technology sector, such as retailers, banks, government agencies and so on. It looks at the development of the IS function and the changing roles of IS practitioners in such organisations over the past 60 years, and assesses how they perceived themselves and were perceived by their peers, by business colleagues and by others. It uses the testimony of successful IS practitioners to provide a grounded perspective on the history of the IS worker over this time. The research identifies a trajectory of a gradual diminishment in the role and status of the IS worker in the corporation over the lifetime of the discipline. It observes that the IS worker has experienced changed fortunes: from a position of influence at the outset, leading to a peak of status and reward in the years up to the millennium; and to the present day where the occupation has a much lower profile. It ascribes this to the increasing commoditisation of IS, manifested by phenomena such as end-user computing, outsourcing and cloud computing. The paper is of relevance to academics who are interested in IS in the corporate organisation; to business professionals, who are sometimes bewildered by their IS colleagues; and to those who work in IS. The research is presented as an interpretative study and is intended to help future researchers frame questions and design research projects. It also aims to inform and witness, and provide a perspective on a currently neglected part of the business world. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From Recreational Applications to Workplace Technologies: An Empirical Study of Cross-Context IS Continuance in the Case of Virtual Worlds",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although three-dimensional, immersive virtual worlds, such as Active Worlds, Second Life, and Teleplace have been in existence for several years, their organizational use is rather limited. This paper posits, perhaps counter intuitively, that the diffusion of virtual worlds within organizations could be enhanced by their recreational usage. This argument is motivated by the notion developed in this paper that the use of technologies need not remain within a single context, but instead can cross-contexts, for example from recreational to vocational. We term such shift cross-context IS continuance. This paper proposes that workers using virtual worlds for recreational (i.e., hedonic and social) use are suitably positioned to discover those technologies’ workplace applicability, thereby assisting in their diffusion within the organization. Building on the supporting results of an empirical study, this paper recommends that managers consider allowing for ‘playtime’ with virtual worlds as a mechanism for enhancing their adoption and subsequent diffusion in the workplace. From an information systems (IS)-research perspective, this paper makes several important contributions. First, it contributes to the IS continuance literature by arguing for, and providing evidence in support of, the existence of cross-context continuance. To date, this literature stream has examined only one aspect of continuance - for example, within-context. Second, this paper identifies recreational and work as distinct dimensions of technology usage, and hedonic and social usage as sub-dimensions of the former, thereby contributing to the contextualization of this core IS construct. Third, it is one of the early field studies dedicated to the empirical examination of virtual worlds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Regulating how digital platforms use algorithms to determine and control content displayed to their users is both a controversial topic and an important societal challenge. Existing research acknowledges institutional tussles around regulating how digital platforms use algorithms to determine and control content. However, we lack research showing how the development of regulation unfolds. We build on data from a longitudinal discourse analysis of 410 media articles and 483 policy and industry documents to study two cases of algorithmic control regulation in Australia. The first involves algorithmic control for content display, the second for content moderation. We develop a process model of institutional work towards regulation of algorithmic control. It captures the institutional tussles between governments, digital platforms and third parties as each expresses their perspective on legitimate forms of algorithmic control and shapes the process and outcome of regulation. Building on our model, we discuss the dynamics of regulation development in light of the constellation of actors and their power position in the process. We further consider the regulatory outcome and highlight future research questions that build on our findings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Robotic process automation (RPA) is often used in organisational digitalisation efforts to automate work processes. RPA, and the software robots at its heart, is an equivocal and contentious technology. Adopting the products of theorising approach, this study views metaphors as central sensemaking and sensegiving devices that shape the interpretation of RPA among stakeholders towards a preferred reality of ways of seeing and experiencing software robots. The empirical materials are drawn from research in three Australasian organisations that have implemented RPA. Grounding our analysis in the domains-interaction model, we identified three root metaphors: person, robot and tool, their constitutive conceptual metaphors, and intended use as heuristics devices. Our findings show that metaphor is a powerful device that employees rely on to make sense of their experiences with a new digital technology that can potentially shape their roles, work practices and job design. In addition, managers and automation team members intentionally leverage metaphors to shape others’ perceptions of a software robot’s capabilities and limitations, its implication for human work and its expanding benefits for organisations over time, among others. Metaphor as a precursor to more formal theory provides scholars with a vocabulary to understand disparate experiences with an emergent automation technology that can be further developed to generate a theory of seeing automation and working with automated agents. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Process Innovation",
    "abstract": "There are as yet not many authorities in the field of process-oriented business analysis. The current interest in business process redesign/re-engineering (BPR) dates back to Davenport's article in June 1990 (Sloan Management Review) and one from Hammer in the July/August issue of the Harvard Business Review in the same year. Some authors have responded with books drawn from their experience of 0 &M (for instance Harrington's 'Business Process Improvement', referred to by Davenport) and there has been a spate of articles in the business and computing press purporting to explain the need for and derivation of the new approach. These are mainly anecdotal accounts of case studies which involve any of the 'ingredients' of BPR (such as change to process, structure, culture or systems), but give little justification for regarding BPR as a new 'method' . Davenport's book is therefore a 'first' and goes a long way towards establishing a sound basis for recognizing BPR as a legitimate and useful area of study and practice. Whether it is exactly 'new' is another matter: it owesmuch to a synthesis of techniques from Porter's strategic analysis (such as his value chain ideas), the quality movement, logistics and information engineering. However, it is perhaps the first 'packaged' approach to addressing the problem which has bedevilled organizations in the past: how to create a genuine synergy between IT and the business and focus effort on real competitive issues in the market-place. Davenport gives an informative explanation of the origins of process thinking and sets out the issues: the difficulty of defining processes in a functionally-oriented organization, the need for vision, the niceties of balancing enablers and constraints in the search for innovation and the challenge of implementing radical change. He refers to three enablers of innovation: information technology (IT), information and organizational/human resource factors. Given the central theme that we need to ask fundamental questions about the way organizations work, I was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on process/product knowledge and the need to empower the considerable base of 'know-how' which exists in most organizations. For instance, the vision that is undoubtedly central to any major change programme can be stimulated/informed by 'digging out' measurements of current process performance and by analysing activity costs. This is likely to yield insights (possibly shocks) which are a major determinant in changing mind sets and creating buy-in. Similarly, the information needs of managers (particularly of the 'soft' variety) can be illustrated more graphically by tracing decision processes and analysing their time/quality dimensions. The illustrations of how IT can be used to create capabilities were interesting, but given that organizational/human factors was accorded equal weight as an enabler of innovation, I felt more needed to be said. This goes back to the problem of business/IS synergy and why IT spend does not seem to necessarily confer competitive advantage. It may be true, as Davenport notes, that setting 'stretch targets' challenges staff to be innovative, but I am also reminded of Deming's warning that threats and exhortations made by managers who do not understand the capabilities of 'the system' (in its wider sense) will merely frustrate and demotivate people. Davenport draws a distinction between process innovation (top-down, radical change) and process improvement (the incremental approach). He suggests the Japanese are comfortable with the latter (which may yield 5-12% improvement per year), but that Western companies are better suited to short, sharp initiatives aiming for 50-100% improvement, underpinned by ongoing process improvement to prevent backsliding. Again, I am not convinced: given that most of the process innovations which Davenport describes towards the end of the book have been introduced from the Japanese, it may be that innovation actually has to be a longer-term incubation process and even copying (rather than inventing) new ways of working may need careful preparation. This is a stimulating and useful book, written by a practitioner with real experience of an approach which has certainly only been consciously attempted in very recent times. It would have been useful to have had more practitioner advice (for instance on modelling methods and techniques challenging management thinking). The overriding message is that successful organizations express strategy in process terms. Managers must consider key processes across the entire value chain, and encourage both future thinking and attention to current performance and measurement. I am reminded that President Truman is said to have remarked: 'I may be President of the United States but I have no idea what happens to an order after it leaves this office'. The Japanese have shown that that is not good enough for business in the 1990s.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital transformation (DT) research is moving to new frontiers of investigation, exploring the nexus between multi-scale and multi-level stimuli and effects. This article contributes to the literature examining how DT phenomena affect multiple and connected ecosystems among industries, governments, economies, and societies. Identifying DT outcomes in a given context includes considering the organisations’ unequal development and digital presence. Non-profit organisations (NPOs) are flagships of a unique organisational nature based on non-distributional constraints and the primacy of nonfinancial outcomes. Assuming DT as a process that could improve, transform, or change an entity’s property, this research examines which specific aspects link to DT outcomes in the context of NPOs, investigating preconditions, value-creation structures, and strategic development. The study performs a meta-synthesis by developing a taxonomy of 124 journal articles strictly discussing DT in NPOs to identify objects and characteristics describing the debate. Subsequently, it questions the validity of adopting insights resulting from other organisational forms to study and develop DT strategies for NPOs by comparing two frameworks. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge by suggesting a lens of analysis helpful in assessing the (DT) value-creation structures of NPOs, a research agenda outlining future directions, and recommendations intended to support NPOs’ policymakers and managers in undertaking DT projects. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile health applications and devices (“mobile health apps”) play increasingly important roles in the lives of individuals interested in self-regulating their personal health behaviors. While some appear to be simply consumer products and services, many are embedded in regulatory programs aimed at compliance with expert guidelines. In this paper, we draw on de Vaujany et al.’s framework for organizational IT-based regulation systems to consider how systems operate in open and distributed contexts in which actors have strong agency and regulation is indirect and voluntary. To do so, we consider how IT artifacts become embedded in practices, how data are implicated in regulatory feedback loops, and how individual, organizational and technological actors are mobilized and with what regulatory outcomes. We develop an instrumental case study as a vignette of five regulatory episodes (continuous glucose monitoring systems used by persons with diabetes) to examine how expert rules materialized in mobile health apps, data about bodily states, and IT features such as displays and alarms “nudge” individuals towards compliance with self-regulatory guidelines and practices. Through this analysis, we identify two related regulatory affordances of mobile health apps for predicting and surveilling personal health. We theorize how multilevel networks composed of trifecta of rules, IT artifacts, and practices develop as a regulatory lattice through which social regulation is realized. We conclude by considering the broader implications of this analytical approach to study voluntary, data-enriched regulatory systems. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Steps toward a digital ecology: ecological principles for the study of digital ecosystems",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The notion of digital ecosystems has become a fruitful metaphor for examining the effects of digitalization across boundaries of organization, industry, lifeworld, mind, and body. In business-economic terms, the metaphor has inspired IS research into new business models, while in engineering terms, it has led to important insights into the design and governance of digital platforms. Studying digital ecosystems in these terms, however, makes it difficult to trace and explain those effects of digitalization, which do not materialize predominantly in economic and engineering patterns. Important relationships and their effects may therefore go unnoticed. In response, I draw on the ecological epistemology of Gregory Bateson and others to contribute an ecological approach to digital ecosystems. Such an understanding, I argue, expands the possibilities for tracing and explaining the wide-reaching, boundary-crossing effects of digitalization and the runaway dynamics they may lead to. I suggest to do this based on three principles: (1) part-of-ness—phenomena are to be observed as always part of a larger ecosystem; (2) systemic wisdom—ecosystems have limits, which need to be respected; and (3) information ecology—ecosystems are not mechanical but informed, cognitive systems. As my contribution, I propose six avenues for future IS research into digital ecology. </jats:p>",

This paper proposes that a fruitful area of research, which will provide insights into the effectiveness of ISD methodologies, must centre on the observation of the practice of systems developers, users and managers, and the study of methodologies in use. Such a programme requires certain techniques, ideally longitudinal ethnographic case studies. Preliminary results from a couple of case studies indicate that ISD methodologies are not used as prescribed but this does not necessarily prevent the successful completion of development projects. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Principles required for secure electronic voting using the Internet are known and published. Although the Internet voting functionalities and technologies are well-defined, none of the existing state-sponsored Internet voting approaches in use incorporate a total Internet-based system approach that includes voter registration, the voting process, and vote counting. The distributed Internet voting architecture concept discussed in this article uses a novel thin client approach to Internet voting. The architecture uses existing technologies and knowledge to create a viable whole system approach to Internet voting. This article describes various aspects and processes necessary to support an integrated approach. The application programming interface software for many of the critical functions was developed in Python and functionality tested. A virtual network, including a cloud-based functionality, was created and used to evaluate the various conceptual aspects of the proposed architecture. This included the concepts associated with programming and accessing smart cards, capturing and saving fingerprint data, structuring virtual private networks using tunneling and Internet Protocol Security, encrypting ballots using asymmetric encryption, using symmetric encryption for secret cookies, thin client interaction, and creating hash functions to be used within a blockchain structure in a Merkle tree architecture. The systems’ primary user targets are individuals remotely located from their home voting precincts and senior citizens who have limited mobility and mostly reside in assisted living facilities. The research supports the contention that a cybersecure Internet voting system that significantly reduces the opportunity for mail-in voter fraud, helps to ensure privacy for the voter, including nonrepudiation, nonattribution, receipt freeness, and vote acknowledgment can be created using existing technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Exploitation of the World Wide Web (WWW) is a pipedream for many businesses, as they do not or cannot analyse their motives for having a web site. Many do not understand that there is more to a successful web site than having a corporate logo on a home page. They do not foresee the effort that goes into maintaining a web site, the increased competition from exposure to a ‘global market’ via the Internet and the impact a web site will have on the existing business. This case study allows analysis of the opportunities and risks of launching electronic commerce (EC) services in the case of the Co-op Bookshop, Australia's largest academic bookseller. The case describes Co-op's difficult progression to a profitable WWW presence and investigates potential developments due to growing competition from ‘global players’ and increasing amalgamation between bookselling over the WWW and electronic publishing. The case outlines the four possibilities by which a firm can profit from its Internet activities and transfers these general benefits to Internet service provision by bookstores. In particular, it directs attention to thinking of the core goals of the business, how a WWW presence helps to meet these goals and whether the introduction of a web site changes the direction of the business. This leads to a consideration of the nature of the web site. The case study allows exploration of the current customers and markets and why the firm focuses on these. Further, there are the issues of the resources required to set up and maintain a web site, how the site may be integrated into the existing business and its growth path. These issues are explored and modelled in the teaching notes and further background detail is given. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Electronic commerce is transforming interorganizational relationships in marketing channels. Reports frequently note that ‘power’ goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or ‘automated’ trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers’ incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss. This results in higher trust and cooperation in their trading relationships. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The theorizing trifecta",
    "abstract": "Looking back at my time as a doctoral student, my own academic upbringing happened to be relatively in line with a developmental trajectory that has been discussed for the information system (IS) field as a whole: from topics, to methods, to theories. While the field’s early years were characterized by a fascination and open exploration of the then new topic of corporate computing (Klemmer, 1973), the field needed to overcome difficulties in terms of methodological quality (Banville and Landry, 1989) before eventually being challenged to pay more attention to its theoretical development (Zmud, 1998). So by the end of my dissertation, albeit a decade later, I too was facing increasing scrutiny not only on what I did and how I did it, but on why I did it (i.e. what is my theoretical contribution). At the time, however, guidance on what theory was and how to use it was scarce in our field and only few notable exceptions provided—more or less explicit— direction (with Gregor, 2006; Grover et al., 2008; Markus and Robey, 1988; Truex et al., 2006; Weber, 2003 being the ones that had the biggest influence on me at the time). So I was quite happy to turn to the debates in our reference fields such as management or sociology. In particular, I worked through the various special issues and sections in the Academy of Management Review and the Academy of Management Journal with great joy, the papers of which continue to play a big role in our understanding of theory today as evidenced by the many references from this stream of work also present in Rivard’s essay. The only thing I was left to wonder was why similar reflections and debates on theory and theorizing were not as common in the IS community as they had been elsewhere. No surprise then that I was delighted when the IS community began to increase its attention to matters related to theory and theorizing through papers such as Hovorka et al. (2013), Lee (2014), or Weber (2012) (this, again, being the convenience sample of papers that struck a chord with me then). Since the dawn of the 2010s, we have seen a number of theory tracks (such as at ECIS, ICIS, and HICSS), special issues (most recently at MIS Quarterly), commentaries (such as Avison and Malaurent, 2014), editorials (e.g. Leidner, 2020; Rai, 2017, 2018), doctoral seminars (such as Suzanne’s and my own), studies (e.g. Burton-Jones et al., 2017; Larsen and Bong, 2016; Niederman and March, 2019), and panel discussions on everything that moves the theorist’s heart. This lively debate now offers a broad variety of perspectives and ideas to provide aspiring young contributors the foundations and impulses that were so sorely lacking a decade ago.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The literature on the sociology of financial markets and institutional theory promotes concepts of field, networks, performativity, agencement and financial entropy. This study builds a conceptual model of technological instantiation of regulatory practices in financial markets. We observe how asset management firms instantiate technology as a material and social artefact to regulate the actions and behaviour of human agents. The structural-agency divide reveals the coercive role of regulators who impose stringent compliance practices on financial organizations by embedding formal rules and regulations in the software. Socio-technical conditions show how human agents interpret and apply these rules to circumvent formal regulatory policies and practices. Context-specific analysis shows technological performativity and agencement co-exist in financial fields that are becoming more entangled and fragmented. Regulators respond with more complex mandates to reduce entropy in financial markets characterized by extreme volatility and instability. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Business process re-engineering (BPR) was presented as the key to successful organizational transformation in the early 1990s. In this paper we examine a BPR initiative at a medium-sized UK building society in order to explore whether BPR succeeded or failed and to place BPR within the wider context of an organization facing a merger. The study describes the development of a novel BPR methodology which combines both hard and soft modelling approaches and reveals a degree of success in terms of process modelling and gaining consensus on process content and faults. However, two more far-reaching initiatives served to drain away support from the BPR effort: a parallel organizational analysis undertaken by an external consultancy and the hidden (although rumoured) merger talks with a larger partner. Therefore it is inappropriate to view BPR as an isolated, strategic initiative when, in practice, it may be one of several competing change activities vying for support within a changing organizational context. The paper concludes by presenting a model of concurrent dynamics which helps to explain why BPR lost momentum. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Expert support systems (ESSs) are increasingly used in organizations to support individuals and groups in decision making. Although ESSs have been shown to enhance the decision-making capabilities of individuals, their benefits in supporting group decision making are less clear. To the best of our knowledge, no empirical research has evaluated the effectiveness of the technology in the group setting or compared its usefulness for supporting individual versus group decision making. The results of this research show that ESSs benefit decision making of both individuals and groups and novices are able to gain more from ESSs than experts. The findings also suggest that groups outperform individuals in both with and without ESS support settings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The information technology (IT) group at a large Canadian financial institution has recently implemented a new operating framework that significantly changed the role of IT within the organization. The traditional, technology-centric, independent entity has been retailored into an integrated, customer-focused business unit. Consistent with their new vision, the IT group has shifted its focus towards IT–business integration, increased IT employee satisfaction and decreased turnaround in system development. Amongst the successes of the implementation to date is one perspective that has attracted the attention of IT executives. Customers who observed the transition of the IT group have raised concern about Riverbank Financial's ability to maintain leadership in technological expertise. IT executives must now consider the possibility that the new operating framework has taken too much focus away from technology and identify possible changes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "My greatest quarrel with this book takes place in Chapter 7, which is labelled 'Productivity'. It has long been my belief that productivity figures can be fiddled any way you like when they are defined in terms of output against input. Indeed, this must have been in the author's mind when he defined management productivity as applying computer power directly to managerial work, which (inevitably?) leverages management. This type of 'hype' neglects the fact that whether or not management productivity is enhanced by the application of computer power depends a great deal on management attitudes and management effectiveness. In fact, this seems to be one of the problems with this book all round: it suggests that bringing information technology in touch with business makes things take off as if by magic. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is the sober realization that unless the management is right to start with, information technology can have a derogatory effect on the business. The last third of the book concentrates on architectural issues which seem sensible although not always credible.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Paper documents are often described as ‘information rich’, in contrast with electronic documents. This ethnographic study examines Lotus NOTES in a sub-section of the Irish civil service, with particular reference to the concurrent use of electronic and paper documents. The sub-section examines disagreements with regard to claims by Irish citizens for particular government benefits. The study describes how meta-information contained in paper case files is perceived as necessary for the work of the organization, thus restricting the use of electronic case files in NOTES as a shared information system. However, this reliance on paper files derives not only from the information rich properties of paper documents, but also from the desire of some workers to protect their occupational status by defining, as necessary for their job, information which is only available in paper documents and which only they can interpret. This dependence on paper documents also reduces the amount of information that can be shared within the organization. This paper suggests that, only if the perceived threat posed by the information system were reduced in some way would user innovations in work practices and greater sharing of information within the organization become possible. </jats:p>",

This paper charts the diffusion of digital desktop publishing (dtp) systems within the magazine publishing sector, and assesses the threats and opportunities of the new information technologies for print publishing. In particular, the paper focuses on the organizational changes accompanying the new techniques as publishers internalize page make-up, and in so doing bring into question the long term future of an independent pre-press sector. The paper highlights the obstacles in the path towards full digital publishing, and examines the factors behind the slow diffusion of dtp amongst magazine publishers. Finally, the strategic implications for decision makers are assessed, and some wider issues arising from our study for the information technology community are considered. </jats:p>",

There is one major difference however: in contrast with AI, which was largely an outlet for a minority of computer scientists, neural computing unites a very broad community: physicists, statisticians, parallel processing experts, optical technologists, neurophysiologists and experimental biologists. The focus of this new paradigm is rather simple. It rests on the recognition by this diverse community that the brain 'computes' in a very different way from the conventional computer.",

Catering for \"industrial and academic training\", as stated on the cover, has led the author to avoid presenting information retrieval in a strict academic sense and to include commercial developments; but at the same time, he still felt the need to develop the intellectual arguments in the traditional academic fashion and order of presentation. Those two aims and two types ofreadership are difficult to reconcile. It was ambitious to attempt to achieve in such a short book. More attention could have been paid to this double objective and consequently, more careful writing and editing was required to avoid divergent presentation styles. Taken on their own, the chapters on online retrieval, ranked output searching (very specialised), front-ends and hypermedia are good. The examples and figures are also very useful.

Although the current state of technology can deal with information in different forms, no one information system can handle all vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information at the same time. The convergence of the existing technologies may provide a new environment for electronic publishing and trigger a new range of applications in this area. The Brighton videotex/videodisc project has undertaken a pilot study into a combined videotex/videodisc system in which a videodisc player is controlled by a videotex terminal so that control information on videotex pages can select still frames, or sequences of frames, on the videodisc. The system has been developed in co-operation with the English Tourist Board. It is intended to mount a public trial of the system in the near future. This paper presents a description of the combined videotex/videodisc system. The user facilities are described in detail and there is a brief discussion of the technical issues involved in the implementation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Metahuman systems are new, emergent, sociotechnical systems where machines that learn join human learning and create original systemic capabilities. Metahuman systems will change many facets of the way we think about organizations and work. They will push information systems research in new directions that may involve a revision of the field’s research goals, methods and theorizing. Information systems researchers can look beyond the capabilities and constraints of human learning toward hybrid human/machine learning systems that exhibit major differences in scale, scope and speed. We review how these changes influence organization design and goals. We identify four organizational level generic functions critical to organize metahuman systems properly: delegating, monitoring, cultivating, and reflecting. We show how each function raises new research questions for the field. We conclude by noting that improved understanding of metahuman systems will primarily come from learning-by-doing as information systems scholars try out new forms of hybrid learning in multiple settings to generate novel, generalizable, impactful designs. Such trials will result in improved understanding of metahuman systems. This need for large-scale experimentation will push many scholars out from their comfort zone, because it calls for the revitalization of action research programs that informed the first wave of socio-technical research at the dawn of automating work systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Disruptive digital innovations do not come without pain – the disorder that they introduce can create negative externalities and unintended consequences for people, communities, industries and economies. In the worst case, there is disruption with little innovation. This can lead to job losses for individuals, loss of human dignity, negative health impacts, lost revenue for communities, obsolescence of industries and loss of the traditional values that underpin modern societies. Sarker et al. (2019) note that “humanistic concerns arising from the curtailing of human freedom and development, and from racism, sexism and commodification of the human body are overlooked for the apparent benefits that systems, including widely used search engines and medical databases, promise to deliver (Noble 2018; Wachter-Boettcher 2017). Indeed, there is a rising need for a thorough ethical interrogation of algorithms (O’Neil 2016) that underlie systems mediating many critical human activities, so as not to marginalize certain stakeholders, especially those ‘who are already in the margin’ (Noble 2018, p. 171).”",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Resilience is commonly portrayed as a positive capability that allows individuals, groups, and organizations to thrive in dynamic contexts. This paper questions this oversimplified view based on a dialectical analysis of a telehealth innovation within a network of collaborating hospitals. We analyze the major contradictions that characterize the adoption of the innovation. First, we analyze contradictions between individuals and groups within each adopting organization. Second, we analyze contradictions between the adopting organizations. This multi-level analysis leads to a deeper understanding of resilience as a dialectical process. The analysis of the case shows that, although the participating individuals, groups, and organizations demonstrated apparent resilience in adopting the telehealth innovation, the innovation remained in a fragile state, where it was unclear whether it would continue to diffuse, stabilize as-is, or slowly deteriorate. Hence, while resilience facilitated swift and successful adoption, it also created tensions that endangered further diffusion and the long-term sustainability of the telehealth innovation. We suggest that understanding the future success of the innovation would be facilitated to a large extent by a dialectical analysis of the involved contradictions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we examine the relation between social media use and the absorptive capacity of organisations. Over the past 10 years, many organisations have systematically adopted social media. Trade press and consulting companies often claim that the systematic use of social media increases the performance of organisations. However, such claims are typically neither empirically grounded nor theoretically examined. In this paper, based on key informant interviews at 20 organisations, we examine these claims empirically and theoretically. Firstly, we examine the ways in which social media are used by organisations. We identify five different social media use types that support different organisational purposes (broadcast, dialogue, collaboration, knowledge management and sociability). Secondly, we analyse how these five social media use types relate to organisations' absorptive capacity. We find that particular social media use types (e.g., dialogue) support organisations' absorptive capacity and, ultimately, their performance although others (e.g., sociability) do not. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Reconceptualizing synergy to explain the value of business analytics systems",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> How can we use synergy to explain the value created by business analytics systems? In this article, we conceptualize and operationalize two important aspects of synergy: namely, the synergistic relationship and the synergistic outcome. We explore the enablers and mechanisms that are involved in a synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems and define it as the ability of systems to work together, span their boundaries and complement each other. Synergistic outcomes are the new business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems that emerge from the synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems. Taking a whole system perspective, business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems comprise the components and the emergent properties that arise from their interaction (e.g. the ability to cross-sell and up-sell based on advanced computational methods), in which the emergent properties are new because they do not exist in the individual components. We develop a research model that uses Synergistic Relationship and Synergistic Outcomes to explain the business value created by business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems, and we test this model using a survey of 201 managers in Australia and the United States. We find that the synergistic relationship plays a significant role in the creation of business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems and subsequently business value. Business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems—comprising business analytics systems, customer relationship management systems and their emergent properties—contribute to transactional, informational and strategic value. This goes beyond the value created by the business analytics and customer relationship management systems individually, as measured through statistical interaction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Electronic commerce (e-commerce) can occur between a business and its customers, as well as between a business and its suppliers. To facilitate interorganizational e-commerce it is often necessary to share supply and demand information between supply chain partners. Based on our analysis of supply chains in several industries we identify the mechanisms (business processes) required for effective supply chain management. We also identify the information system components needed to support these mechanisms, show how the individual components can be integrated into an information infrastructure framework and identify some technologies currently available that can fit within our proposed infrastructure. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework by simulating convergent assembly (commonly associated with motor vehicle and aerospace production) supply chain performance under various information-sharing strategies supported by our proposed infrastructure. We find that inventory costs can be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfilment cycle times. This is true because information, which provides the basis for enhanced coordination and reduced uncertainty, can substitute for inventory. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Grounded in the dynamic capabilities perspective, our study addresses the question of how information technology outsourcing capabilities can interact with other IT strategic capabilities to enable organizational agility through the ongoing reconfiguration of IT solutions. To answer our question, we built on the notion of microfoundations that undergird the high-level dynamic capabilities of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring. Adopting a theory elaboration approach, we studied the case of a firm evolving in a turbulent environment, which had outsourced the quasi-totality of its IT services and had a mature IT architecture. From the case data, we specify two types of microfoundations: repeatability-related microfoundations (i.e. processes) and ability-related microfoundations (i.e. IT department structure, skills, simple rules, and communications) that undergird either information technology outsourcing dynamic capabilities or IT architecture dynamic capabilities. We propose a model that outlines how the interaction between repeatability-related microfoundations, supported by ability-related microfoundations, enables the reconfiguration of IT solutions. Our study also elucidates how a firm can follow a logic of opportunity enabled by their IT outsourcing and IT architecture dynamic capabilities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media platforms, such as Facebook, are today’s agoras, the spaces where public discourse takes place. Freedom of speech on social media has thus become a matter of concern, with calls for better regulation. Public debate revolves around content moderation, seen by some as necessary to remove harmful content, yet as censorship by others. In this article, we argue that the current debate is exclusively focused on the speaking side of speech but overlooks an important way in which platforms have come to interfere with free speech on the audience side. Rather than simply speaking to one’s follower network, algorithms now organise speech on social media with the aim to increase user engagement and marketability for targeted advertising. The result is that audiences for speech are now decided algorithmically, a phenomenon we term ‘algorithmic audiencing’. We put forward algorithmic audiencing as a discovery, a novel phenomenon that has been overlooked so far. We show that it interferes with free speech in unprecedented ways not possible in pre-digital times, by amplifying or suppressing speech for economic gain, which in turn distorts the free and fair exchange of ideas in public discourse. When black-boxed algorithms determine who we speak to the problematic for free speech changes from ‘what can be said’ to ‘what will be heard’ and ‘by whom’. We must urgently problematise the audience side of speech if we want to truly understand, and regulate, free speech on social media. For Information Systems research, algorithmic audiencing opens up entirely new research avenues. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Information systems research on artificial intelligence and work: A commentary on “Robo-Apocalypse cancelled? Reframing the automation and future of work debate”",
    "abstract": "In his article “Robo-Apocalypse Cancelled? Reframing the Automation and Future of Work Debate,” Willcocks provides a critical reflection on the common assumption that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have a massive impact on jobs. The article offers a much-needed and very helpful discussion entry that I certainly recommend to include in our teaching. While I fully agree that it is time to cancel the RoboApocalypse, I will argue that we first need to get rid of the more general and persistent naïve anxiety and admiration of the power that we assign to AI technologies, what Willcocks describes as the hype and fear narrative. It seems that we tend to ignore the most urgent question: what is it exactly about these technologies that legitimates all this fuss about AI changing our work? I will argue that it is time for information systems (IS) researchers trained in the sociotechnical tradition to step on board and fight the hype and fear narrative by offering empirically validated insights on why, when and how AI changes our work. Let me start with a disclaimer. Current research on AI technologies and work does not only address job losses. In fact, over the past 1 or 2 years, scholars from different disciplines have been studying changes in the quality of work instead of quantity of jobs. While strikingly silent during the Robo-Apocalypse debate—fearing among other things a second AI winter—computer scientists have recently joined the discussion on AI and work, stressing the need to keep the human in the loop (e.g. Dellermann et al., 2019). By developing hybrid AI, tools will become our new assistants, coaches and colleagues and thus will augment rather than automate work. While computer scientists’ aim is to build systems that increase the quality of work, a recently growing group of critical researchers aim instead to create societal awareness about the rise of low quality of work due to AI. They point, for example, to jobs under constant surveillance (Zuboff, 2019), jobs characterized as “ghost work” (Gray and Suri, 2019) and jobs imposed by inscrutable data-driven decisions (e.g. Faraj et al., 2018). In addition, organizational behavior scholars mainly use survey-based research to analyze, for example, the individual perceptions on the quality of work with AI (e.g. Brougham and Haar, 2017). Even those who started the hype–fear narrative, principally labor economic scholars, conduct research that departs from the focus on changes in number of jobs. For example, Felten et al.’s 2018 study how AI technologies are associated with changes in skills and wages and found that these new technologies might trigger a different type of polarization than one related to job losses and gains. While these latest academic contributions address the changes in quality of work instead of quantity of jobs, they share the implicit technological deterministic assumption that AI has the power in itself to change work. This is rather problematic; while technology has its own agency, it is also always socially constructed, which makes assumptions about its decisive impact unattainable and will only sustain the myths surrounding AI. Based mainly on the tradition of the field of Sociology of Technology Studies and Actor Network Theory, sociotechnical IS researchers know how to go beyond this technological determinism (Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2014).

Reframing the automation and future of work debate”",

    "title": "The Four P's Revisited: Business Value Assessment of the Infrastructure Impact of it Investments",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Assessing the business impacts of increased IT investment has become one of the major issues in contemporary management. Many senior managers realize that a well-structured appraisal process might make the vital difference between IT success and IT failure, both in the private and the public sectors. Senior management's prime concern has shifted from controlling IT costs to managing and delivering IT benefits. Today, increased emphasis is being put on the role of infrastructure investments in order to fully exploit the profit potential of IT. The infrastructure impact of IT investments more and more centres around the emerging notion of an information infrastructure. Assessing the role and impacts of infrastructure investments, however, has proved to be particularly difficult and it is not yet clear how the underlying strategic decision-making process should be managed. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that offers four control options – paraphrasing conventional business wisdom in marketing coined the ‘P4 model’ – to manage investment appraisal and to support organizational decision-making. As a prelude to this, the paper explores the role of an information infrastructure from an IT investment perspective and examines four styles of decision-making. It also presents case study material from the financial services sector, in order to illustrate the relevance and applicability of the P4 model. Much of this paper draws on a research study funded by Eindhoven University and two large financial services organizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, game theory has provided valuable insights into many different types of organizational arrangements. In this paper we investigate some of the ways in which game theory can help us to understand the structure and function of information systems outsourcing arrangements. We provide a brief review of two-person non-cooperative game theory. We discuss the basic concepts of dominance and Nash equilibria. In particular we stress the importance of the information structure of two-person games. We then provide a general game-theoretic interpretation of many key aspects of information systems outsourcing arrangements. In particular, we investigate the rationales behind many of the different ways of determining fees and the effects of the transfer of assets between the outsourcing company and the outsourcing vendor. Finally, we discuss how one particular type of non-cooperative two-person game might be useful as a model of information systems outsourcing arrangements. This model, the principal-agent model, has been extensively studied and in the hands of the authors has provided some initial insights into information systems outsourcing arrangements. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The aestheticization of business processes: Visualizing their Gestalt for collective thinking",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Business processes, simply defined by Davenport as ‘structures for action’, organize the creation of value in a company. In addition to being carried out visibly, processes also have an inner dimension which remains hidden in the existing mechanistic metaphor of process management models. Aesthetic business processes draw from systems theory and Gestalt theory in order to uncover this inner dimension. The aim of this phenomenological investigation presented here is to describe the super-summative nature of business processes, in other words, to understand them holistically as a Gestalt. Mechanical Engineering students at a university of applied sciences analyzed business processes at different companies to discover patterns which they then visualized with the process participants at those companies. They used Christopher Alexander’s pattern language as a paradigm to make implicit knowledge buried in those business processes explicit. Using this technique, aesthetic business processes were identified as patterns. The format of the patterns served as a tool for collective thinking and as a form of expression for the Gestalt of aesthetic business processes in their visualization. A pattern language as an overview of the many ways to combine business process patterns has yet to be reconstructed based on this investigation. The shared visualizations highlighted the nature of the business processes and made it possible to see, in a metaphorical way, their significant interactions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Computerization and Controversy: Value Conflicts and Social Choices",
    "abstract": "This is a weighty book, in several senses of the word. It contains over fifty papers by many authors on subjects ranging from 'The strange case of the electronic lover' to 'Procedures for the enforcement of the ACM code of professional conduct'. The papers are helpfully arranged in seven parts each of which is headed by an introduction by the editors, highlighting the major issues in the section and outlining the papers included. This makes it easier to read than might be expected from such a diverse book. It is refreshing that in their introductions the editors are willing to criticize as well as compliment the contributors. They also, usefully, take time to explain fully any philosophical or historical concepts used. The first part of the book, entitled 'the dreams of technological utopianism' is given a particularly thorough introduction by the editors, who provide a history of the idea of utopia as well as warnings against the wilder dreams of its proponents. The papers include an attempt by John Sculley, chairman of the board of the Apple Computer Corporation, to argue that print technology catalysed the Renaissance, and computer systems based on hypermedia, simulation and artificial intelligence applied to education are the right way to forge a new community of ideas. As Dunlop and Kling point out, 'such pieces excite hope by linking computerization to positive social ideals anchored in a vastly oversimplified history'; in this case there may have been a fmancial incentive. In sharp contrast, Wendell Berry provides a small treatise on why he is not going to buy a computer, the pithy common sense of which is slightly marred by the realization that this is partly because his wife types, edits and proofreads all his work. There is an elegantly written essay by Kling and Iacono criticizing the widespread and indiscriminate use of the term 'computer revolution'. There are areas where computerization plays a major role in the restructuring of relationships, but the 'myths' inherent in many discussions purify new computer technologies and their use by simplifying the complexities and sluggishness of institutional change. Revolutions are radical breaks with an existing order: as the authors point out there are far more instances of information technologies reinforcing relationships than there are of it changing them. 197",

To address this challenge, we propose EDGE, a novel ethical design method that focuses on two key activities in the systems development process—ethical grounding and evaluation of ethical impacts. We provide an empirical example of the EDGE method by applying it to the redesign of a sustainable application in the energy industry. This empirical example reveals the need for ethical clarity to ground and evaluate the app to achieve improved ethical performance and social impacts. We conclude with the implications of the new ethical design method and future research directions for its application and enhancement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Telstra – until recently Australia's only telecommunications carrier – is internationally recognized within the industry for providing a world-class telecommunications service to a highly dispersed and isolated population under challenging environmental conditions. In 1990, the Australian Government announced that it would end Telstra's monopoly and move towards a deregulated telecommunications industry. The first step was a competitive duopoly and, in 1991–1992, a private carrier – Optus Communications – became Telstra's first competitor in the Australian market-place. On 1 July 1997 the industry was fully deregulated. Over this period, Telstra has undergone enormous changes – none of which is more dramatic than the shift from an engineering-driven organization, to one with a marketing focus. The shift in emphasis from engineering to marketing is clearly reflected by the establishment of Telstra's National Telemarketing Centre (NTC). Though originally created in response to deregulation and the threat of its first competitor, the NTC has grown to become a major national marketing channel for Telstra, as well as providing national customer and product support services. This case examines the function of the NTC within Telstra, the role of technology at the NTC and the way call centres affect organizational flexibility and change the relationship between Telstra and its customers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Problems with the implementation of ERP systems are well documented. Although companies spend millions on ERP packages and the implementation process, there is extensive evidence that they experience considerable problems, particularly during the actual implementation project. This paper presents a project phase model (PPM) of ERP implementation projects that is a synthesis of existing ERP implementation process models and focuses on the implementation project. Two case studies of ERP implementation within the same organization, one unsuccessful and a later successful one, are reported and analysed in order to determine which critical success factors (CSFs) are necessary within each phase of the PPM. The CSFs are drawn from an earlier stage of this research and from recent literature. The PPM is used as a ‘lens’ for understanding ERP implementation projects, by highlighting the differences between the two cases. We then offer an explanation for these differences, focusing particularly on the successful case. Firstly, the organizational learning that occurred during the unsuccessful project and the associated early appointment of an experienced ‘champion’ with clearly defined responsibilities were critical to the successful project. Secondly, organizations implementing ERP systems should partition large projects into several smaller, simpler projects identified here as ‘vanilla’ implementations. The PPM, together with associated CSFs, provides guidance for practitioners when planning ERP implementation projects and also provides researchers with a foundation for further empirical research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with the computerization of the primary health care sector in the United Kingdom. This care is provided by family doctors, known as general practitioners (GPs). The sector has been transformed in the years since 1986 by a series of legislative changes. These changes have had profound implications for the information requirements of GPs. They have led to the widespread adoption of computerized patient record systems by GPs rising from less than 25% before 1988, to greater than 75% by 1993. The paper considers evidence from a variety of historical surveys and combines this with first-hand experience drawn from working to implement information technology (IT) in the National Health Service (NHS) and through a set of interviews carried out for this study. It seeks to evaluate the process up to the present and to identify critical factors relevant to both practitioners and IT professionals who are increasingly involved with the NHS in the UK. Finally, it makes recommendations for both health and IT professionals on the future IT needs of general practice. </jats:p>",

One reason for this is that we have recognized that consultancy is a totally different business from our systems business. It has different characteristics in terms of the scope and size of projects, project life cycle, project management and control procedures and, last but not least, the staff profile. Therefore we have established a separate company which is, in many ways, organized and operated differently from our systems companies. Another very important reason for establishing Logica Consultancy Ltd as a separate company is independence. We have a high degree of autonomy and independence from the other parts of Logica to the extent that we can, and on occasion do, recommend to our clients that the solution to their problem can be met by a particular product or system provided by non-Logica companies.",

Recent reviews of company performance for example Eason (1989) and KPMG Peat Marwick Mitchell (1990) demonstrate that this is not easy to achieve, with up to 30-40 per cent of organizations and IT projects investigated showing no benefits whatsoever. Two key explanators emerging from studies, and increasingly voiced by practitioners, are: the neglect of the human aspects of computer-ization, broadly conceived; related to that, the central role played by the degree of senior managerial commitment to IT, their capacity to understand the implications of IT and plan and implement systems solutions for organizational",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of electronic commerce is changing marketing practice. In particular the transformation of traditional intermediaries such as the retailer is occurring as a result of new computer-mediated relationships. This paper uses the setting of an interactive home-shopping supermarket to examine the changing role of the retailer in electronic commerce environments (ECEs). We build on our previous conceptual enquiry which proposed a conceptual model which posits that retailers in an ECE apply a trust-based approach to consumer marketing relationships. In this paper we provide additional literature and empirical evidence to support our proposition that the relationship between the retailer and their customers can be defined by the disconfirmation of two cognitive images of the on-line shopping experience, these being the expected virtual (service brand-created, cognitive image of experience) and actual real (service-process-created, cognitive image of experience) images. This paper develops existing conceptualizations through new, confirmatory, interorganizational case data and consumer-oriented, qualitative, empirical evidence from focus groups that supports our proposition. </jats:p>",

The technological improvements did not result in output at the expected levels and there was a high level of absenteeism and labour turnover. The new production system was technically well organized but it failed to meet the needs of those who were using it. The good relations in the small groups had been disrupted and the variety in work had disappeared. Trist and his co-workers redesigned the system in an attempt to meet both human and technical needs. They allowed the re-formation of largely autonomous, self-selected work groups with all three tasks being performed on each shift. This allowed the miners the benefit's of both good relationships and varied, responsible work. Using this method Trist apparently managed to cut absenteeism by 11.8 per cent and increase output by over 50 per cent.",

The focus of the analysis is on two types of tasks: decision-making tasks and routine office processes. The paper argues that a number of (conflicting) options exist when developing the coordination aspects of group systems; they are classified across the following axes: specification and implementation of coordination; use of synchronous and asynchronous working phases; information exchange and information sharing; support of sequential and concurrent processing; support of negotiation and conflict resolution; support of analytical modelling; and description of the organizational environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a study involving 88 companies., the nature of the linkages between business strategy and information technology (IT) responsiveness was explored. The results indicate that variations in IT–strategy responsiveness, measured by the extent to which IT is explicitly considered in business strategy formulation, are linked to the type of business strategy being pursued by the organization. For example, IT is more responsive to business strategy in organizations which place heavy emphasis on innovation in their product and market strategies than in those which operate in a relatively stable product/market area. This implies that organizations with an aggressive business strategy are more likely than those with a conservative business strategy to explicitly consider IT as a strategic resource in formulating business strategy. This paper suggests that the extent to which IT is used to shape business strategy differs among organizations, and that business strategy can help us understand these differences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards a sociomaterial approach to inter-organizational boundaries: How information systems elicit relevant knowledge in government outsourcing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article furthers a sociomaterial framework to examine inter-organizational boundaries in government IT projects. It engages in a dialogue with the practice theory-based approach to boundary spanning and utilizes analytical tools and epistemologies drawn from the social studies of technology. It aims to contribute to a situated, material understanding of inter-organizational boundaries. We argue that boundaries in outsourcing relationships can be de facto enacted through definitions of what counts as relevant knowledge. Information systems have a key role in eliciting such definitions, thus establishing knowledge asymmetries and regimes of inclusion and exclusion. The article responds to the call to value the role of artefacts in IT research. Furthermore, it eventually shows that understanding knowledge asymmetries triggered at the micro-level of information systems can help to examine macro-scale transformations between the public and the private sectors. To illustrate the framework, two ethnographic case studies of governmental IT projects are discussed. The first case concerns a permit and licence submission service in Italy. The second case analyses a 20-year-long database integration carried on at the Dutch land registry. In the first case, information systems made relevant a form of knowledge developed by contractors; in the second case, the integration process valued knowledge developed in-house. Three sets of implications are drawn for the theory and practice of inter-organizational IT projects. To conclude, the article focuses on inter-organizational boundaries involving the public and the private sectors and foresees a novel interdisciplinary research direction at the confluence of information systems and political studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a category of information systems called ‘Soft information systems’. Basically these lie between conventional information systems in which data are well defined, and management support, and decision support systems. A soft system is a system which operates on soft data. Such data cover categories of information such as conjectures, predictions, feelings and opinions and are typically found in systems where there is some element of anticipation of the future. Such systems include career counselling systems, where clients have rather ‘fuzzy’ views of what they might wish to do, through to economic based systems used to predict levels of employment, inflation levels and interest rates etc. In between are management-type systems in which it is normally assumed that hard (i.e. factual) data are used, for instance in budgeting systems. The paper describes some previous work and the experimental systems which tested and explored the ideas involved as well as attempting to refine some of the techniques that can be used to deal with soft data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Structures are important to the practice of information technology (IT) evaluation. Structures, as evidenced by 14 case studies and the words of six financial directors, are defined here as organizational responses, including user committees and responsibility accounting, quantitative assessments of IT projects, such as financial appraisals, and qualitative assessments. Structures in practice seem to allow for a changing world in which projects are accepted according to business needs and subsequent actions lead accepted projects to be adapted and managed as time passes. In order to manage IT technology in this way, structures alone are important but not sufficient. Active individuals have an important role to play and credibility becomes an important factor in evaluation and implementation. The credibility of IT management is created by its selling of the project in the first place and then by its ability to manage the project in a responsive way. Credible strategists are at least as important as a strategy to the evaluation of IT. </jats:p>",

    "title": "An Appraisal of the Competitive Benefits of IT",
    "abstract": "Since the 1950s when computers were first used by commercial organizations, the overall objective has been to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise. In the early days, in spite of the cost and risks involved, computers were seen as a means of improving the efficiency of those operations where the primary task was information processing. Many of the early applications merely used the computer as a rapid, reliable calculator, fast printer and data filing system, to standardize and expedite clerical operations. The benefits were essentially derived directly from, and limited by, the capabilities of the available information technology (IT). In time, previously impossibly complex tasks were undertaken using computers forecasting, optimization, planning enabling resources to be deployed more effectively, and co-ordination of operations to be improved. The organization benefited from improved information systems (IS), not just technology. In the 1970s the realization dawned that the computer had become a repository of a potentially valuable management resource information. Unfortunately the information had been stored to maximize efficiency of storage rather than ease of access. Nor were the tools and techniques of systems development suitable for ad hoc enquiry and analysis the requirements to support management processes effectively. Only recently with the new languages, generators and userappropriate packages has it been possible to overcome the problems generated by evolved rather than planned information management. Organizations can now gain advantage from using the information they have used the computer to store, control and co-ordinate.",

Significantly this research addressed the following questions: How well organizations matched their IT investment plans with their strategic planning; how well IT strategies were formulated; how well IT systems were implemented and what were the critical success factors and impediments; and whether organizations were truly getting value from their IT investment. The findings have shown the causes of misused IT in some organizations, such as IT strategy not closely aligned with business strategy, no change of historical IT structure, lack of understanding of the potential of IT, lack of CEO and senior management support and awareness of IT's potential, impediments to IT development and implementation. Although in many organizations the role of IT development has become proactive and strategic to gain competitive advantage through primary and support activities, it has still not unleashed ITs full potential. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "and that this diffusion of knowledge was brought about by the inclusion of the weaker firms in collaborative research. Accurate and insightful use of the historical framework, and well documented case study material (whose unit of analysis is the collaborative research project rather than the individual firm) allow Fransman to establish broadly based, but empirically well grounded, perspectives on the nature of technological change. As an exercise in comparative industrial organization, The Market and Beyond is something of a tour de force, and it is the first really substantial account of the Japanese system to be published in English. The book is less successful in its attempt to adapt the 'Markets and Hierarchies' perspective to a revised theorization of the innovation process. A viable attempt to go beyond Williamson would have required a much more subtle blend of sociology and economics than Fransman has been able to deploy. The need for cross-disciplinary work is hinted at by Christopher Freeman, whose introduction points out that Schumpeter and the Webbs were among the first social scientists to learn about Japanese society at first hand. The final chapter calls for further theoretical development, but relies too heavily on outmoded notions of bounded rationality, and does little to open up new cross-disciplinary perspectives. However, to judge the book in purely theoretical terms is to misunderstand its real value. The significance of Fransman's work lies in the timeliness of his contribution to the debate on technological change and the sources of competitive advantage. The most pressing task for UK policy makers is to find a balance of market and hierarchy appropriate to the current pace of technological change and the historically unique conditions now bearing on our development as an advanced industrial economy. The Market and Beyond provides more than enough evidence to convince us that Britain will be ill-served by the freemarket nostrums which dominated the policy agenda of the 1980s.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The design of systems which provide computer support for cooperative work (CSCW) has been dominated by models of collaborative teams in academic or design environments. Such settings are characterized by a relatively egalitarian power distribution and a division of labour established locally by the collaborating parties. This paper describes other types of collaborative work in which the r&amp;ocirc;les of participants are characterized by pre-established divisions of labour and unequal power distribution. A case study is presented of a collaborative group allocating and scheduling service calls in an electricity company. Using the Organizational Requirements Definition for Information Technology (ORDIT) methods for responsibility analysis a number of alternative organizational structures are described which may serve this task. The alternatives are based upon different job design structures which distribute responsibilities to work r&amp;ocirc;les by different rationales. An analysis is offered of the different CSCW systems that would be necessary to support these alternatives. The paper concludes by examining the implications of pre-established but variable organizational structures for the design of generic CSCW systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing availability of expansive social media trace data (SMTD) offers researchers promising opportunities to create rich depictions of societal and social phenomena. Despite this potential, research analysing such data often struggles to construct novel theoretical insight. This paper argues that holistically incorporating temporality enhances data collection and data analysis, subsequently facilitating process theory construction from SMTD. Recommendations to integrate temporality are outlined in the proposed Temporal Dynamics Framework and Methodology (TDFM). We apply the TDFM to investigate the temporal dynamics of mental health discourse on Twitter (now X) across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, theoretically framed in the context of innate psychological needs satisfaction. The findings reveal dynamic shifts in social media use, indicating that different phases of the pandemic triggered changes in the needs motivating, and being motivated by, social media use. This illustrative case reflectively evaluates the TDFM's usefulness in contextualising SMTD collection, analytical strategies, and process theory construction by incorporating a dynamic perspective on time. </jats:p>",

The social care sector is not yet a great user of information technology (IT) and the thinking about IS is generally less well-developed than, for instance, in the health care sector. Research in health informatics indicates that there are special problems in creating integrated solutions and achieving the uptake of systems. This project was therefore undertaken with the benefit of experience of previous projects in health and social services and in the expectation that attention to participative design and people factors would be the key determinants of success.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A major problem facing the development of technological support for groups is that many studies investigate group technology in isolation from an analysis of group activity, or focus only on discrete aspects of the process. This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the nature and extent of group decision making and the use of group supporting technology in Irish organizations. The paper presents a model of group decision making and examines group processes and activities as well as the use of technology at each stage. The findings indicate that group decision making is a widespread phenomenon, which was found to be far more complicated than individual decision making. However, groups were found to need a great deal of control and coordination to enable members to collaborate effectively. Nevertheless, group decision making was found to receive little technological support. The available technology provided only low level support which mainly focused on supporting the asynchronous work of groups. </jats:p>",

The case poses the question of how IT should be organized and managed to meet current business challenges. ‘Dow Corning Corporation part B: Re-engineering Global Processes’ is set in March 1997. The IT organization had been redesigned and reported to a member of the senior management team. The case focuses on Dow Corning's pilot implementation of SAP and its plans to re-engineer global processes. Special attention is given to the IT unit's role in the re-engineering and systems implementation processes. </jats:p>",

In order to effectively use the resources offered by these two development environments, organizations need to answer the question: given a systems requirement, which development environment should be used to ensure success. This paper hypothesizes that the answer to this question depends upon the characteristics of the task? Drawing upon previous systems analysis and design research, we examine the effect of a task's degree of structure, interdependency, scope and periodicity, on the appropriate development environment. Results from a preliminary empirical test indicate that these task characteristics are useful in suggesting the appropriate environment for successful development of an information system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In his editorial in the very first issue of Classical and Quantum Gravity, 11 January 1984, M~A~MacCallum wrote that `we confidently expect that Classical and Quantum Gravity will become a journal whose contents, by their quality and importance, will enhance the standing of work on gravitation and enrich the world of research and scholarship in physics'. At the time it seemed very courageous (at least to me) to start a journal with `quantum gravity' in the title, but time has meanwhile proved these expectations to be no exaggeration. Classical and Quantum Gravity has blossomed and, under the guidance of the previous Honorary Editors, Malcolm MacCallum, Kellogg Stelle and Gary Gibbons, become a leading international journal in gravitational physics. Perhaps more than other journals in this area, it provides a balanced coverage of the whole field, encompassing all aspects of classical and quantum general relativity. Its importance is reflected amongst other things by the recent increase in the number of submissions (33% over the past four years) as well as in general demand for its publications (28 203 accesses to the electronic journal in 1998). To maintain the standing of the journal we will strive to make further improvements. This concerns in particular the times between submission of a paper and a first decision (presently 81 days on average) and its publication in the journal (presently about 205 days). As a new service to authors and readers, the journal will publish the first multimedia paper in this issue on pair production during the collapse of a texture topological defect (this paper will be a Featured Article freely available from the journal home page on the Web). This option allows researchers with numerical and computational results to display their data in a new way that enhances understanding and use of electronic media. However, the ultimate criterion by which the journal will be judged is the quality of its scientific output, which will be my main priority as new Honorary Editor of Classical and Quantum Gravity. This requires openness towards new developments in the field. For this reason the previous Editorial Board had already decided to broaden the perspectives of the journal with a call for papers in relativistic astrophysics, a field where exciting theoretical and experimental developments are to be expected in the coming years. Later this year we will publish a special supplement on the state of the subject at the turn of the millennium, with papers from some of the most influential contributors to gravitational research over the past 20~years. Classical and Quantum Gravity will also publish the proceedings of both the International Symposium on Experimental Gravitation, to be held in Samarkand, and of this year's string conference, STRINGS '99, in Potsdam. I hope that these features will make the journal even more attractive to its readers and to prospective new authors whom I warmly welcome. Hermann Nicolai",

Because in the last year, something very interesting has happened on pages 18 and 19. These are adverts for telephone dating services. One of them according to a very small study has generated one and a half million telephone calls since it started. Their capital costs consist of putting the advert in Capital Gay. There is a difference between peak time charges of 38p a minute and off peak charges of 25p a minute. The only difference, I can imagine, is that the 13p in those differences has gone to British Telecom.

    "abstract": "No in-depth insight has ever been gained into how Britain's successful firms approach information technology (IT). 'I'he aim of the MSA Business Survey was to reveal the policies and attitudes towards IT of some of the best firms operating in Britain. Fundamental questions about the strategic role of IT in their businesses arc explored, along with major operational and staffing issues, including: What is the corporate view of IT? How do they find and keep staff? How good are their disaster recovery plans? Do they use IT consultancies? NVhat are their buying policies? What ncw developments matter to them? Is 1992 an issue? MSA commissioned one of Britain's foremost research firms, HR&H Consensus, to conduct a qualitative survey based on in-depth interviews with top IT management of ten companies from a range of industry sectors. In addition to the interviews, more information was gleaned from a written questionnaire about the facts and figures of IT, completed by the ten participating firms and a further five companies. From the research emerged common themes, enlightening comments and surprising reactions. In choosing to link this survey to excellence, a subject of inherent fascination to most of us in business who are working constantly to achieve it, MSA acknowledges the work by Tom Peters and Rob Waterman, whose In Search of Excellence book, and the management thinking that followed it, prompted the idea for the research. Finally, MSA would like to express its gratitude and thanks to all those individuals who gave time in a busy day to this survey and whose opinions, attributed and non-attributed, are the essence of this report.",

The purpose of the project was to design appropriate organizational structures and functions and an accompanying information system (IS), to increase the effectiveness of the existing service. A participative sociotechnical approach was adopted for the entire design process which was carried out by the practitioners themselves. The staff's views were elicited during informal participatory group sessions as well as in one-to-one informal discussions. While ETHICS was the overall guiding methodology for the design, QUICKethics was used as a complementary means of analysing the requirements of the new IS. This paper describes the methodology used and the design process; it reflects on the adaptation and its match with the ETHICS methodology, exploring the claimed association with the viable systems methodology and concludes with suggestions for further research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Vendor capabilities are an important research stream in the IT outsourcing literature. The extant studies have generated rich findings on how vendors develop capabilities, but these findings have mainly been based on the condition of vendors improving their existing business. How vendors develop capabilities to move up the value chain has received little prior research attention. A key challenge for vendors in moving up the value chain is the development of new capabilities while maintaining the existing ones. This challenge is consistent with achieving exploration and exploitation in organizational ambidexterity. Hence, we adopt organizational ambidexterity as our theoretical lens. By conducting a case study on four IT outsourcing vendors in China, we identify four classifications for achieving ambidexterity in capability development and the context for each classification. These classifications are based on combinations of different structural arrangements and processes for achieving ambidexterity. Our study contributes to the research on IT outsourcing vendor capabilities by improving our understanding of capability development in vendors moving up the value chain. It also contributes to the organizational ambidexterity literature by identifying the factors that influence the choices of different structural arrangements and processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper seeks to investigate the potential for interorganizational networks (IONs) to facilitate a challenge to the current hegemony of integrated production. From a transaction cost perspective the choice between market and hierarchical modes of production depends upon their relative coordination costs. The argument developed here is that uncertainty has precipitated market failure and the consequent rise of large, integrated concerns. IONs, however, by facilitating the cost-effective diffusion of information can reduce the coordination costs associated with the market place and permit the deintegration of production. The greatest benefits are held to be realized where the development of common knowledge between connected trading partners permits the ‘free flow’ of information. Supporting empirical work consists of a comprehensive survey of the uptake of IONs in the Scottish electronics industry and the development of case studies in a variety of companies highlighting the specific processes at work. Tentative conclusions indicate that while IONs do represent an opportunity for the emergence of new, more collaborative modes of production such an outcome is by no means assured. </jats:p><jats:p> ‘changes consist primarily in a relative decline in the importance of Fordist mass production and an enormous expansion of manufacturing activities based on less rigid and more highly adaptable (i.e., flexible) technological and institutional structures’ (Scott, 1988, p. 171). </jats:p>",

To try to improve this imbalance, the field of software engineering has been advanced as a possible solution, attempting to apply the formal methods of an engineering discipline to software design and implementation. One of the most promising areas to be developed in this field is that of integrated project support environments (IPSEs), which attempt to spread the focus of attention during software development from the coding stage to embrace the whole development cycle, from initial requirements specification through to operational maintenance. These environments hope to improve production efficiency and quality by providing a complete set of support tools to help with each stage of software development, and to supply the necessary tool integration to ensure a smooth transition of use between these tools. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper provides an introduction to IPSEs through analysing the motivation for providing integrated support for the production of software, and describing something of the evolution of environments for software development. This provides the context for describing current and future research trends in this area. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Lee and Baskerville (2003) attempted to clarify the concept of generalization and classify it into four types. In Tsang and Williams (2012) we objected to their account of generalization as well as their classification and offered repairs. Then we proposed a classification of induction, within which we distinguished five types of generalization. In their (2012) rejoinder, they argue that their classification is compatible with ours, claiming that theirs offers a ‘new language.’ Insofar as we resist this ‘new language’ and insofar as they think that our position commits us to positivism and the rejection of interpretivism, they conclude both that our classification is more restrictive than theirs and also that we embrace ‘paradigmatic domination.’ Lee and Baskerville's classification of generalization is based on a distinction between theoretical and empirical statements. Accordingly we will first clarify the terms ‘theoretical statement’ and ‘empirical statement.’ We note that they find no fault with our classification of induction, we restate our main objections to their classification that remain unanswered and we show that their classification of generalizing is in fact incompatible with ours. We argue that their account of generalization retains fatal flaws, which means it should not be relied upon. We demonstrate that our classification is not committed to any paradigm and so we do not embrace ‘paradigmatic domination.’ </jats:p>",

To assess the impact that cloud may have on enterprises, it is important to evaluate the claims made in the existing literature and critically review these claims against empirical evidence from the field.

This framework is structured around a series of technological and service ‘desires’, that is, characteristics of cloud that are important for cloud users. The existing literature on cloud computing is located within this framework and is supplemented with empirical evidence from interviews with cloud providers and cloud users that were undertaken between 2010 and 2012.

What emerges suggests that, not only can IT systems enable malfeasance on a large scale, but that very little specialist knowledge is required in order to turn the computer into an accomplice. The most disturbing feature of the Barings Bank debacle is the contrast between the mundane act of suppressing a control mechanism and the consequences that flowed from this act. It is argued that organizational security ultimately lies in knowing the limits of one's information. </jats:p>",

However, there is limited research on the effect of vendor-based sponsorship on the management of information technology (IT) projects. This paper contributes to that emerging body of evidence. Drawing on literature on psychological contract, management control and project sponsorship, the authors propose that vendor-based sponsors influence project performance in two main ways. One is to protect project quality by renegotiating contract with the client; and the other is to resource the project. Based on a survey of senior managers in IT services vendor organisations, it reports that project sponsorship improves the quality, but not the cost or timeliness, of vendor delivery of IT projects. The findings suggest that IT services vendors can improve their project delivery capability by appointing project sponsors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this article is to explain the dominance and advocacy of the design- oriented research approach in Wirtschaftsinformatik (Business Informatics or BI), one of the major Information Systems (IS) communities. To this end, we employed a research approach based on autobiographical material. Sixteen well-known BI scholars served as informants, and provided career autobiographies in which they document their perceptions and observations regarding the genesis and development of BI. The average age of this sample of contemporary witnesses is 70 years, signifying a rich body of experience. Based on an interpretive analysis of the data, we find that the design of IS is deeply rooted in BI's history, and our results also show that there have always been close relationships with practice. As a consequence, we conclude that the success of BI as an academic community is inseparably associated with systems design, implementation, and engineering. Against this background, we argue that it is unlikely that BI will weaken its design orientation in the future, although external forces signify a shift to a more behaviouristic research approach. In order to balance the internal strength of the community and the external forces, we suggest a ‘theory-driven design approach’ as a viable strategy for the future orientation of the community. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This teaching case discusses the challenges being faced by the technology managers at Indian Railways (IR) in the current scenario of a resurgent national economy coupled with increasing customer expectations. In the face of growing competition from road and low-cost airlines, to retain its customers, IR has responded by changing its business rules. The Railway Ministry expects a rapid response from Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) to incorporate all these changes in the passenger reservation system (PRS). The old PRS, which is time-tested and reliable, and has been serving the customers’ needs for nearly two decades, is now proving to be relatively inflexible to match the rapidly changing business requirements. Although the current scenario of a constant need to change the programming logic of PRS has been making maintenance tougher for CRIS officials, they have realized that PRS is a time-tested, proven, and reliable technology. Though they would be happy to replace the old PRS with a new state-of-art system that would provide them greater maintenance flexibility, the repercussions associated with possible failure of the new system are far too serious. The case exhibits the current dilemma being faced by the head of CRIS, the umbrella agency for information technology (IT) implementation in IR: whether IR should continue using the old PRS technology with its inherent shortcomings, or should it take the risk and go in for a wholesale replacement with a new state-of-art technology which would provide greater maintenance flexibility? </jats:p>",

This development has raised expectations that a firm’s chief information officer (CIO) will take a more strategic role, including innovation leadership and digital exploration. In this study, we argue from an upper echelons perspective that CIOs’ career variety and role tenure are critical in shaping the extent to which firms explore digital technologies in their patent portfolio, that is, digital exploration. We expect a U-shaped relationship between CIO career variety and digital exploration, and an inverted U-shaped relationship between CIO role tenure and digital exploration. We test our conceptual model using a cross-industry panel of U.S. firms. As predicted, the results show high digital exploration for low and high career variety, and low digital exploration for moderate career variety, that is, a U-shape. Conversely, they show low digital exploration for low and high role tenure, and high digital exploration for moderate role tenure, that is, an inverted U-shape. These insights indicate that CIOs do become strategic leaders in exploring and shaping digital innovation.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Moments of Governance in is Outsourcing: Conceptualizing Effects of Contracts on Value Capture and Creation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on the governance of IS outsourcing has recognized two moments of governance: the formal outsourcing contract (promissory contract) and post-contractual relationship management (psychological contract). While this research has been prescriptive of contract terms that lead to successful outsourcing, there is need for clarity on what specific governance options are available at each moment of governance and how governance choices at one moment affect those at another, and consequently affect outsourcing outcomes. This paper draws on theoretical and empirical work in the areas of governance and contracts to develop a model of IS outsourcing governance, delineating specific moments of governance (MoG). It describes how the IS outsourcing context circumscribes market, hierarchy, and network governance options that are available at the promissory contract and psychological contract moments. Processes and structures that constitute governance choices at each moment of governance are identified. This analysis of outcomes recognizes an inherent tension in interorganizational relationships: firms’ desire for value capture or efficiency vs their desire for value creation or innovation. We explore how choices in formulating the promissory contract affect the psychological contract, and how psychological contract choices impact value capture and creation. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of the MoG model for practitioners and suggesting areas in which further conceptualization and empirical work may be beneficial. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Control Devolution as Information Infrastructure Design Strategy: A Case Study of a Content Service Platform for Mobile Phones in Norway",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper depicts the results of an empirical case study on how two Norwegian telecommunications operators developed a business sector information infrastructure for the provision of mobile content services. Focusing on the context of this technology's development, and the strategic issues behind its design, implementation and operation, control devolution as a design strategy is explored. This analysis draws on insights presented by Claudio Ciborra's in his study of the change from alignment to loose coupling in the Swiss multinational Hoffmann-La Roche. This paper illustrates how control is played out on different levels, and balanced against autonomy. The theoretical implications of this paper highlight how the differences and transformations between information systems and information infrastructures are conceptualised, with the development of the latter better understood in light of a balance between control and autonomy. Consequently, it is suggested that control devolution as a design approach should be based on a deep understanding of the existing control/autonomy balance as well as the distribution of resources, risks and the ability and willingness to innovate. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Toward Predicting Software Development Success from the Perspective of Practitioners: An Exploratory Bayesian Model",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Software development project managers may need to focus on particular issues during the development process for a variety of reasons, including limited resources. This study utilized a survey to ask software practitioners, who are at the core of development, to provide insight into some of the important early non-technical issues of software development, including those related to sponsor/senior management, customer/users and requirements management. Proposed relationships among these early items, and their relationship to software practitioners’ perception of project success, were quantitatively represented through a proposed Bayesian Belief Network. The concept of ‘success’ was derived from a pilot study of practitioners and was ‘defined’ as (a) there is a project plan, (b) the project is well planned, (c) practitioners have a sense of achievement while working on a project, (d) practitioners have a sense of doing a good job (i.e. delivered quality) while working on a project, and (e) requirements are accepted by the development team as realistic/achievable. The proposed causal model provided quantitative evidence that reaching agreement with customers/users on requirements, a high level of customer/user participation, and users who make adequate time for requirements gathering have the largest direct impacts on project success among the investigated items. The proposed model identified the following as the critical chain of events for success: (1) Having a sponsor throughout the project, (2) users who make adequate time for requirements gathering, (3) a high level of customer/user participation in the development process, and (4) agreement on requirements between customer/users and the development team. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This case describes the experience of a wholly foreign-owned manufacturing company in Tianjin/China regarding the use of its ERP system in its main functional departments, purchasing, production planning, sales/distribution, and finance. The company is part of a group which is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of mechanical devices, called gearboxes, that are needed to drive a wide range of facilities such as escalators and baggage conveyor belts in airports. It has entered China in 1995 and the Tianjin manufacturing facility has soon become a hub for the Asian market. The main challenge confronting the management team is to support the breakneck growth rate of this young company. The company's ERP system plays a crucial role in this task. However, it seems that middle managers are frequently hitting an invisible wall when trying to expand the use of the ERP system in order to cope with ever-increasing workloads and coordination tasks. This case serves to illustrate cultural issues implicated in the use of an enterprise wide information system in a medium size company operating in an emerging market economy. In addition, issues of operations management, global management, and organizational behaviour are addressed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The gap between research and practice is strikingly evident in the area of information technology (IT) project risk management. In spite of extensive research for over 30 years into IT project risk factors resulting in normative guidance on IT project risk management, adoption of these risk management methods in practice is inconsistent. Managing risk in IT projects remains a key challenge for many organizations. We discuss barriers to the application of normative prescriptions, such as assessments of probability and impact of risk, and suggest a contingency approach, which addresses the uncertainties, complexities, and ambiguities of IT projects and enables early identification of high-risk projects. Specifically, in a case study, we examine how the project management office (PMO) at one organization has bridged the gap between research and practice, developing a contingency-based risk assessment process well founded on research knowledge of project dimensions related to project performance, while also being practical in its implementation. The PMO's risk assessment process, and the risk spider chart that is the primary tool in this assessment, has proven to be effective for surfacing inherent risk at the early stages of IT projects, thereby enabling the recommendation of appropriate management strategies. The PMO's project risk assessment process is a model for other organizations striving to engage in effective and collaborative practices in order to improve project outcomes. The case illustrates the importance of considering the practical constraints of the context of application in order to transform research findings into practices that promote attainment of desired outcomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on IT personnel has observed that the major predictors for turnover intention are job satisfaction and organizational commitment. However, less is known about how these predictors are determined and how they vary according to the different job types of IT personnel. Hence, we develop and evaluate a dispositional model of turnover intention across IT job types as the first approach in IT turnover research combining the personality traits of the five-factor model and the basic turnover model found among Western IS professionals into one research model. By the help of the model we analyze the role of personality in IT personnel turnover across four groups of IT roles: consultants, programmers, system engineers, and system administrators. The results of an empirical analysis of 813 IT personnel reveal significant differences across the four groups in terms of personality and job-related attitudes. In terms of personality traits, system engineers rank highest in openness and conscientiousness, IT consultants in extraversion, programmers in neuroticism, and system administrators in agreeableness. In 50% of all cases, personality traits are significant predictors for job-related attitudes. Additionally, they indirectly affect IT personnel turnover intention. Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are also important indirect predictors for turnover intention, whereas openness has only a weak effect and agreeableness no measurable effect. </jats:p>",

The article argues that by decreasing the governance costs for the less strategic IT transactions, IT outsourcing enables the IT function, and IT management particularly, to focus more on aligning the IT activities and plans with business strategies and priorities, and thereby improve IT alignment. This article also suggests that organizations may improve IT alignment by effectively transmitting knowledge and supporting collaboration between IT and business functions through boundary spanning activities and with boundary objects. The concept of organizational boundaries and boundary management has not been explicitly addressed by the existing research on IT alignment. This study also contributes to the IT outsourcing literature by linking outsourcing to improved IT alignment. </jats:p>",

It begins by addressing the question ‘what is critical research?’ showing how the definition has changed and broadened over time. Two key themes emerge from this discussion: our understanding of emancipation and the nature of unequal power relations in the workplace. The paper then goes on to identify a recent emerging tendency towards the use of Habermas in the specific area of critical IS inquiry. It considers some of the reasons for this apparent trend and warns against becoming locked into a particular discourse. The paper concludes with some thoughts on how we can continue to broaden our frameworks of thinking, illustrating this with reference to the work of Foucault. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the development of operational risk management (ORM) in a financial organization, focusing in particular on the role of IT in institutionalizing the new regime. Through an interpretive case study in a major US financial institution, the paper uses Giddens’ structuration theory to examine how it adjusts to the demands of protecting itself against new operational risks. The discussion and results of our study are expressed in three propositions: (1) the regulatory context and technological development affect the shape and the outcome of ORM; (2) implementing ORM is a process of reflexive monitoring and transforming organizational practices in a financial institution; (3) the role of IT in ORM is contingent on the extant organizational structure and on the choice of risk management approach. </jats:p>",

The paper looks at the various reasons that led to X.400's failure to gain the widely expected level of market acceptance. A brief literature review suggests that common explanations for success in a standards battle cannot explain the demise of X.400. The same holds for two popular explanations for the victory of Internet over OSI. Therefore, alternative reasons are proposed and discussed, including poor timing of the standardisation activity, inadequate first implementations, and an ill-advised paradigm shift that occurred in the cause of events. Finally, some lessons to be learned for the future are identified. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information system maintenance is an important aspect of information system development, especially in systems that provide dynamic content, such as Web-based systems and Knowledge Management Systems (KMS). Design for Maintenance (DFM) is an approach that argues that maintenance effort should be considered during the design of information systems in addition to the usual system design considerations. This research examines how the design of links among knowledge documents in a KMS affects both their maintenance and use. We argue that providing links among knowledge documents increases the cost of maintenance because when a document changes, the documents that link to and from that document are more likely to need changes. At the same, linking knowledge documents makes it easier to locate useful knowledge and thus increases use. We examine this tension between use and maintenance using 10 years of data from a well-established KMS. Our results indicate that as the number of links among documents increases, both maintenance effort and use for these documents increase. Our analyses suggest two DFM principles for dynamic content in practice. First, knowledge coupling (i.e., linking) to documents internal to the KMS rather than sources external to the KMS better balances maintenance effort and use. Second, designing small, knowledge cohesive documents (e.g., 250-350 words) leads to the best balance between maintenance effort and use. </jats:p>",

This can be seen as an attempt to transform the structures and performance of local authorities in the UK. A parallel set of initiatives, the electronic government agenda, were launched in 2000 and have attempted to extend the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) within local government. This paper describes the context for and themes within both agendas, the aim being to describe the existing and likely dynamics of the relationship between innovations in ICTs within local government and the modernization of local government. The paper presents an analysis of the electronic government strategies of 22 Welsh unitary authorities and uses this analysis for highlighting a number of issues relating to the progress of the electronic local government agenda within the UK.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although there is extensive literature on IT/IS-business alignment, we argue that the topic's current research trajectory is limited given the concept's predominantly static focus to date. While the process perspective on alignment is a promising avenue to study the phenomenon's dynamic nature, we still know little about what it is that organizational actors actually do, on a day-to-day basis, to align IS and related concerns with business imperatives. In order to address this lack of understanding regarding the practices of aligning, we argue for research that goes beyond abstract macro analysis of alignment processes to that which considers the actual micro practices of aligning. An analysis of the extant literature on the topic leads to the identification and classification of aligning activities that are being undertaken in practice. We argue that this review and critical appraisal of the IT/business alignment field has the potential for substantive and insightful contributions to our understanding of alignment as it is enacted – in practice. Arising from the review, we discuss important new research themes that are to be addressed if research on alignment is to be demonstrably relevant. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we investigate the effects of four determinants of vendor profitability in enterprise resource planning (ERP) outsourcing projects under two contractual regimes: fixed price (FP) contracts and time and material (TM) contracts. We hypothesize that effect sizes are larger under FP contracts than under TM contracts. From a transaction cost economics perspective, we hypothesize that project uncertainty and project size are negatively associated with vendor profitability. From a knowledge-based view of the firm perspective, we hypothesize that industry knowledge and client knowledge are positively associated with vendor profitability. We tested these hypotheses on a comprehensive archival data set comprising 33,908 projects from a major vendor in the ERP software market. Our results confirm and extend previous research. Our results support the existence of two contractual regimes: effect sizes on vendor profitability are indeed much larger in FP contracts than in TM contracts. Also in line with prior research, our results suggest negative effects of project uncertainty and project size in terms of project budget on vendor profitability and positive effects of industry knowledge on vendor profitability. Contrary to prior knowledge, we find that project size in terms of project duration is significantly positively associated with vendor profitability in FP contracts. Also contrary to what is known, we find a significant negative effect of client knowledge on vendor profitability in both contractual regimes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we analyze institutionalization as a process of transferring and stabilizing material artifacts and routines in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although past studies have analyzed institutionalization as structuring around scripts or discourse moves, we emphasize the material role of artifacts and routines as carriers of institutional logics. In addition, insitutionalization is not linear and incremental, but goes through sudden, nonlinear disruptions. To this end, we apply punctuated socio-technical information system change (PSIC) model that draws upon Gersick's model of change to identify and trace moves that are critical during the institutionalization. The model accounts for ERP institutionalization by chronicling complex interactions between socio-technical elements in the implementation system, the work system, and organizational and environmental context which together account for the institutionalization outcome. We use the model to analyze a longitudinal case covering 11 years (1993–2004) of ERP implementation processes in a large Saudi steel firm. Our analysis shows that the proposed material and punctuated lens toward institutionalization offers rich insights how and why ERP systems become institutions and why their institutionalization is difficult and unfolds in unpredictable ways. We conclude that the normally held assumptions of successful linear and incremental adaptation to new institutional patterns logics out by ERP systems do not hold. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, I contend that executive leaders can and should be prepared to spot timely opportunities and prevent major failures, even if it requires understanding IT technical details. An essential part of executive leadership is exception management - and exceptions occur everywhere, often surfacing first as details, nothing more. Here I present two cases that show technology is no exception. In this paper, I outline how Steelscreen.com 's and RoweCom's early years can illustrate why understanding IT technical details helps explain IT-related failures and successes. In particular, I outline the differences between the two stories and argue that the show stopper for Steelscreen was at its crux a technology detail - the other shortcomings could have been addressed elsewhere. I conclude with some recommendations for executive leaders and a brief outline of a teaching approach suggestion for an MBA or a Senior Executive IT class based on the ideas presented. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The adoption and diffusion of innovative technologies have remained critical concerns in information systems research. With the recent advent of electronic commerce, issues in system deployment and user acceptance have become even more crucial. An experimental system, Stocknet, which is a departure from normal practice in the local stock exchange which still uses conventional methods for share transactions, was developed and subjected to a pilot test through a stock trading competition using live stock data. A research framework was developed with the main emphasis on the adoption and deployment of a broad-based Internet stock-trading platform in Singapore. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict user acceptance of a new system from a measure of their perceptions, beliefs and attitudes and usage behaviour. The study reveals that users’ concerns, expectations, perceived ease of use and the real value added of a new system as well as their trading behaviour are critical determinants to the ultimate adoption of Internet stock trading. In fact, the probability of users accepting a new system is highly dependent on their perceptions of system evaluations and subsequently their usage behaviour. The primary focus of this paper is on users’ perspectives with a view towards a subsequent examination of policy as well as regulatory issues. Based on the results, some broad recommendations and implications are subsequently drawn with regard to the future adoption and deployment of real-time, Internet-based stock trading. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Understanding of consumer experienced value in mobile services continues to be a strategic issue in the information systems literature. This is no different with Mobile TV that has become feasible with the convergence of telecommunication infrastructures, computer technology, and media content services. Mobile TV offerings are defined as real-time broadcast transmissions of content to mobile devices. We review mobile services literatures on consumer value creation and identify a gap in our understanding of how supplier firm's consumer-focused strategies may aid in consumption processes and thereby increase payments from consumers. We apply the perspective of consumer benefits experienced (CBE) to provide insight into how supplier firms may be able to increase consumer value. Value increases with greater consumer service-specific knowledge, and leveraging and complementing this knowledge across different offerings. Increased service-specific knowledge can also reduce demands on the consumer that can create important switching costs while increasing consumer-experienced value. This paper contributes to innovation research on mobile services. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Public ICT Innovations: A Strategic Ambiguity Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public Information and Communications Technology (ICT) innovations are seen as having the potential to usher in a new era of technology-enabled models of governance in emerging economies. While it may be desirable for the implementation of such innovations to be underpinned by precise planning, structure and clarity, policy implementers in emerging economies are confronted instead by situations where ambiguous goals and means are standard. This paper considers high levels of ambiguity as a relatively enduring and intrinsic aspect of public ICT innovations in emerging economies. Drawing on an ethnographic study of Bangalore one, an innovative public ICT project implemented in Bangalore, India, the paper examines how strategic ambiguity is deployed by key public actors to chart the course of the implementation process and to steer it towards reasonable outcomes. Theoretically, the paper suggests that although strategic ambiguity is a precarious and unsettling condition in general, it can work effectively in contexts that are reasonably tolerant of ambiguous norms. The findings of the study also present arguments for why evaluation mechanisms need to be fundamentally reframed in order to assess the extent of implementation success of public ICT innovations in emerging economies. </jats:p>",

The e-Day initiative simply yet powerfully states that ‘one governmental authority has the right to demand that its communication with another authority must be in electronic format’ which is expected to create ripple effects both internally and externally. The e-Day initiative represents a drastic change in the former policy statements concerning IT adoption and diffusion in Danish government. The policy statements had previously been based on voluntary adoption focusing on visions and pedagogical intervention in governmental agencies, but the e-Day initiative marked a departure from that strategy and the carrot has been exchanged by the whip, and the voice is imperative. </jats:p>",

We then study the impact of different core-periphery movements on Open Source projects. We conclude that a steady core-periphery shift towards the core is beneficial to the project, whereas shifts away from the core are clearly not good. Furthermore, oscillatory shifts towards and away from the core can be considered as an Indication of the instability of the project. Such an analysis can provide developers with a good Insight into the health of an Open Source project.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The e-marketplace, or broker-managed online market, is one of today's most profitable e-business models. In these marketplaces, buyers routinely engage with businesses and individual sellers with whom they have had little or no prior interaction, making trust one of the most important issues in the e-marketplaces. Therefore, a clear understanding of the trust building process in the e-marketplace is important for the success in the market. In this study, we analyze the process by which e-marketplace customers develop trust in both a market-maker and sellers. Additionally, this analysis provides a theoretical framework to identify the antecedents of trust. In the framework, we suggest that the impact of trust on transaction intention is moderated by the customer's previous experiences in the e-marketplace. The theoretical model presented here was tested on survey and transaction data collected from 692 respondents. The results indicate that customers value the importance of trust in the market-maker and sellers differentially by the level of transaction experience. It is also shown that market-maker's characteristics (reputation, website's usability and security) and seller's characteristics (expertise) play an important role in the formation and development of trust toward a market-maker and sellers, respectively. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Effect of Social Network Structures at the Business/IT Interface on IT Application Change Effectiveness",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The challenge of managing the relationship between a firm's business and IT in order to derive business value from IT is an important topic on researchers’ and practitioners’ agendas. The focus of most related research and management actions has been on the top management or project management levels. However, conflicts frequently arise within the line organization when applications are extended, enhanced, maintained, or otherwise changed operationally outside software development projects. This study focuses on the impact of relationships at the application-change level and strives to identify and explain favorable social structures for effective business/IT dialog at the operational level. We collected data in seven comprehensive case studies, including 88 interviews and corresponding surveys, and applied social network analysis to show that three social structures at the implementation level influence the degree to which IT applications are maintained and enhanced in line with business requirements: (1) interface actors connecting business and IT, (2) the relationships between interface actors and the corresponding unit, and (3) the relationships between interface actors and other employees in their unit. In three cases, less favorable structures are revealed that correspond to low application change effectiveness and software applications that do not meet business requirements. The other cases benefit from favorable social structures and thus enhance fulfillment of business requirements and result in higher IT business value. This paper contributes to IS research by helping to explain why companies may not provide favorable IT services despite favorable relationships at the top management level and successful application development projects. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research is driven by the assumption made in several user resistance studies that employees are generally resistant to change. It investigates the extent to which employees' resistance to IT-induced change is caused by individuals' predisposition to resist change. We develop a model of user resistance that assumes the influence of dispositional resistance to change on perceptual resistance to change, perceived ease of use, and usefulness, which in turn influence user resistance behavior. Using an empirical study of 106 HR employees forced to use a new human resources information system, the analysis reveals that 17.0–22.1 percent of the variance in perceived ease of use, usefulness, and perceptual resistance to change can be explained by the dispositional inclination to change initiatives. The four dimensions of dispositional resistance to change – routine seeking, emotional reaction, short-term focus and cognitive rigidity – have an even stronger effect than other common individual variables, such as age, gender, or working experiences. We conclude that dispositional resistance to change is an example of an individual difference that is instrumental in explaining a large proportion of the variance in beliefs about and user resistance to mandatory IS in organizations, which has implications for theory, practice, and future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study empirically examined and identified specific types of management accounting information as well as conditions of learning facilitators for effective organizational learning under high levels of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). In this study, the interaction and communication among functions as well as job rotation and experience were considered as the facilitators of organizational learning. This research investigated the relationship between the level of AMT and the amount of management accounting information (i.e. planning and control information and nonfinancial performance information). The empirical results showed that there is a significant positive relationship between the AMT level and the amount of information produced by management accounting information systems (MAISs). Significant positive correlations among the amount of information, degree of organizational learning, and production performance were also observed. Using structural equation modeling, this study examined causal relationships among AMT level, amount of information, learning facilitators, organizational learning, and production performance. The results of the study showed that under a high level of AMT, to give rise to a high degree of learning and, consequently, an increase of performance through the provision of information, facilitators of learning must be well-coordinated (i.e. highly utilized), and MAISs must produce a large amount of management accounting information (i.e. planning and control information and nonfinancial performance information). </jats:p>",

    "title": "An Empirical Examination of Antecedents and Consequences of IT Governance in US Hospitals",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Intense pressure to control costs and improve patient care quality is driving hospitals to increasingly look to information technology (IT) for solutions. As IT investment and IT capability have grown in hospitals, the need to manage IT resources aggressively has also increased. The rise in complexity and sophistication of the IT capability in hospitals has also increased the importance of IT governance in these organizations. Yet, there is limited empirical data about the antecedents and consequences of IT governance. We draw upon extant literature related to power and politics and capability management to propose, operationalize, and empirically examine a nomological model that explains and predicts IT governance and its ensuing impact on risk management and IT contribution to hospital performance. We empirically tests our hypotheses based on survey data gathered from 164 CIOs of US hospitals. The results have implications for hospitals’ readiness and predisposition for IT governance, as their structural and relational mechanisms can affect IT governance and, indirectly, IT value creation. A contribution of this study is that it is one of the first to empirically examine antecedents to IT governance and its impact on IT performance in a high-velocity environment that is riddled with technological turbulence. </jats:p>",

Empirical evidence is provided by three case studies representing three classic types of client-consultant relationships. We draw on two complementary perspectives: possession view (i.e., power and knowledge are based on resources that can be owned or controlled by individuals) and practice view (i.e., power and knowledge are relational in nature and exercised in action). The paper develops a framework that shows that power and knowledge are closely intertwined and that the possession and practice views are complementary in understanding configurable technology projects. The paper also demonstrates the importance of the initial set-up of the project and how knowing/powering mechanisms can reinforce or change implementation trajectories, which, in turn, can affect project results. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Measuring it Core Capabilities for Electronic Commerce",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on the theoretical development and empirical validation of a measurement instrument for three information technology (IT) core capabilities in an electronic commerce context. The instrument is based on the work of Feeny and Willcocks (1998) and includes the capabilities ‘information systems (IS)/IT governance’, ‘business system thinking’ and ‘relationship building’. It was validated using a sample consisting of 179 respondents, all of whom were IT managers or chief information officers. The results demonstrate that the constructs are reliable (a coefficients &gt; 0.8) and valid. A confirmatory factor analysis on the data set yielded a moderately acceptable model fit. The model also demonstrated highly significant factor loadings (p &gt; 0.001). The paper shows that a respecification of a competing model in which IS/IT governance is split into ‘business IT strategic thinking’ and ‘IT management’ provides better measures of fit. The paper concludes that the core capabilities of IT departments are useful constructs for incorporating into future research. They are successfully able to predict behaviours that have relatively little overlap. Recommended further research includes the relationship between capabilities and governance structures as well as further investigation into how IT core capabilities are formed and strengthened in organizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing phenomenon of financialization influences an array of societal dimensions that go beyond the economic realm, to include public policy-making and information technology (IT). This study presents a cross-country analysis of the emergence of national electronic identification (e-ID) solutions as the result of interaction between the financial and the public sector in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Drawing on on-line sources, documents, and interviews with key actors in the three cases, we adopt a cross-disciplinary perspective by applying the lens of collective action theory to identify the role of interests, resources, and governance in the emergence of national e-ID solutions. Findings show that different governance solutions can emerge as the result of the convergence of interests and of interdependency of resources between the actors over time. We contribute to research on financialization and IT by proposing a dialectic process model and identifying five mechanisms that drive the process forward. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Diffusion of WOZ: Expanding the Topology of IS Innovations",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growth and diffusion of self-service technology (SST) over the last decade has resulted in an increasing number of business and government transactions being completed without human assistance. One innovation in this area, the speech-enabled business system, is characterised by complex implementations that bring together language-processing technologies, applications development, and end-user psychology. A resulting secondary innovation, the Wizard-of-OZ (WOZ) experiment is a valuable technique for simulating and building human–machine prototypes to ensure successful deployment of the completed service. The objective of the paper is to examine these innovations in relation to the changing business landscape; the technology and innovation literature, and the population of likely adopters. The review is carried out by placing the authors’ former experience as practitioners within current theoretical research frameworks. The result is a number of suggestions relating to both IT technology research and IT innovation research. Firstly, it proposes the simplification and diffusion of the WOZ methodology to support the growth in demand for automated e-business transactions that is mindful of human and ethical challenges. Secondly, the paper argues that because SST and business extends the traditional boundaries of the customer service function, it now needs to be incorporated into Swanson's tri-core innovation typology. The paper concludes by presenting the suggested reorientation of information systems research that incorporates an outward facing perceptive as a conceptual model. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an era where a strategic command of global resources is becoming a requisite for success, firms are struggling to successfully unify their onshore and offshore sites. The literature on global virtual teams generally frames the impediments to coordination and collaboration based on divergent nationally based cultural attributes, language barriers, and the limitations of information and communication technologies. Drawing on world-systems theory, this paper argues for a decrease in the importance afforded to national boundaries and individual sites, and a re-orientation to the social dynamics across sites regardless of nationality. By changing the unit of analysis to the organization as a world system and focusing on emergent practices, this paper provides new insights regarding globally distributed collaborative work and identifies how to manage global relations to overcome structural impediments, to develop positive social relations, and achieve collaboration. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Institutional ontology for Conceptual Modeling",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Conceptual models are intended to capture knowledge about the world. Hence, the design of conceptual models could be informed by theories about what entities exist in the world and how they are constituted. Further, a common assumption within the field of conceptual modeling is that conceptual models and information systems describe entities in the real world, outside the systems. An alternative view is provided by an ontological commitment that recognizes that the institutional world is constructed through language use and the creation of institutional facts. Such an ontological commitment implies that there is an institutional reality, which, to a great extent, is constructed using information infrastructures. Accordingly, conceptual models have not only a descriptive role but also a prescriptive one, meaning that modelers set up a framework of rules that restrict and enable people to construct institutional reality using information infrastructures. Understanding the prescriptive role of conceptual models may revive the area of conceptual modeling in the information systems research community. Reviving conceptual modeling through institutional modeling is motivated by the effect that implemented conceptual models have on information infrastructures and institutions. The purpose of this article is to propose an institutional ontology that can support the design of information infrastructures. The ontology is theoretically informed by institutional theory and a communicative perspective on information systems design, as well as being empirically based on several case studies. It is illustrated using a case study in the welfare sector. A number of guidelines for modeling institutional reality are also proposed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent team boundary spanning literature has recommended a shift toward assessing the role of virtual tools – such as social media. Simultaneously the proliferation of Enterprise Social Media (ESM) points to the need to theorize and investigate the supra-individual usage of these tools, such as their usefulness for organizational groups. This paper responds to both mandates through a theoretical integration of the team boundary spanning and existing ESM literature. Using data from two studies – one qualitative and one quantitative – this papers addresses two important research questions regarding the empirical relationship between team boundary spanning and ESM for understanding (i) the types of team boundary-spanning activities that group members enact through ESM and (ii) the effects of ESM on extra-team stakeholders' perceptions and reciprocating actions vis-à-vis the team boundary-spanning activities of these group members. The results of this study show that ESM, largely as a function of their visibility affordance, supports a narrow set of representational activities, but offers only limited support for information search and coordination. Furthermore, the findings reveal that ESM activity has a positive effect on extra-team stakeholders' recognition and financial support of the representational ESM posts emanating from the boundary-spanning group. Important implications for theory, strategy, and design are discussed. </jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to such adoption and diffusion issues in order to observe trends, ascertain the current ‘state of play’, and to highlight promising lines of inquiry including those lacking investigative activity or simply being in need of renewed interest. Previous research activity was analysed along a number dimensions including units of analysis, research paradigms, methodologies, and methods, theories and theoretical constructs, and technologies/contexts examined. Information on these and other variables was extracted during an examination of 345 papers on innovation adoption, acceptance and diffusion appearing in 19 peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 2007. Findings suggest that the positivist paradigm, empirical and quantitative research, the survey method and Technology Acceptance Model theory (and its associated constructs) were predominantly used in the body of work examined, revealing clear opportunities for researchers to make original contributions by making greater use of the theoretical and methodological variety available to them, and consequently reducing the risk of research in the area moving toward overall homogeneity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with managing e-learning communities. It reports on the process and methods adopted in an EU project called MEDFORIST. The challenges of managing this project were considerable because there was significant social diversity amongst the e-leaning community members. The paper outlines some key principles derived from teleology (or, the ‘study of purpose’) that were used to structure some key aspects of the management of the e-learning group processes. These principles were developed and used, in order to structure enquiring activities to inform the design, monitoring and evaluation activities in the provision of e-learning group processes. The paper outlines the use of such enquiry as a foundation for the continued development of the application of e-learning in contexts in which divergent human groups come together in unstructured, non-prescriptive human learning activities. As such, the paper outlines some key methodological requirements for managing e-learning group processes. </jats:p>",

This discussion paper attaches new literature to the subject. The new literature centres upon the epistemological status of certain forms of MIS. More specifically, it is argued that MIS, based upon metonymy (part for whole substitution), can seriously mislead managers because the representation gets mistaken for the reality. The demonstration is based on high level risk registers. Risk registers were selected for analysis because they are ubiquitous and important decision support systems. In theory, diligent use of risk registers should virtually eliminate unpleasant surprises. In practice, the result may be an illusion of control. Analysis draws upon sociology and psychology to explain why this may be so. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper highlights the over-arching themes salient in the rapidly converging mobile computing industry. Increasingly, the developers of mobile devices and services are looking toward exploratory, non-determinist or, user-driven development methodologies in an effort to cultivate products that consumers will consistently pay for. These include Design Thinking, Living Labs, and other forms of ethnography that embrace serendipity, playfulness, error, and other human responses that have previously rested outside the orthodoxy of technology design. Secondly, the mobile device is likely the world's foremost social computer. Mobile vendors seeking to foster the production, propagation, and consumption of content on mobile devices are increasingly viewing the challenge as a complex social phenomenon, not a merely a well-defined technology problem. Research illustrating these themes is presented. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we investigate an approach to eliciting practitioners’ problem-solving experience across an application domain. The approach is based on a well-known ‘pattern mining’ process which commonly results in a collection of sharable and reusable ‘design patterns’. While pattern mining has been recognised to work effectively in numerous domains, its main problem is the degree of technical proficiency that few domain practitioners are prepared to master. In our approach to pattern mining, patterns are induced indirectly from designers’ experience, as determined by analysing their past projects, the problems encountered and solutions applied in problem rectification. Through the cycles of hermeneutic revisions, the pattern mining process has been refined and ultimately its deficiencies addressed. The hermeneutic method used in the study has been clearly shown in the paper and illustrated with examples drawn from the multimedia domain. The resulting approach to experience elicitation provided opportunities for active participation of multimedia practitioners in capturing and sharing their design experience. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cultural Influences on it use Amongst Factory Managers: A UK-Japanese Comparison",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper seeks to analyse the influence of national cultural factors on the use of information technology (IT) by managers. An analysis of the existing literature on the interplay between technology, culture and organizational context indicates that the influence of national culture needs to be carefully specified if it is to be differentiated from institutional and organizational factors. Moreover, insofar as such influence operates at all, it is subsumed within, and not exterior to, a dynamic and emergent process of interaction between technology design and organizational practices. In this light, the study presented here seeks to avoid a simplistic approach in which national culture is viewed as an exogenous force directly conditioning action, but rather posits such influence as a critical element of the wider context which enframes action. These considerations were reflected in the research design of the empirical study presented here. This involved a survey of managers in over 1400 firms across five industrial sectors in the UK and Japan. These countries were chosen because previous studies had indicated that they exhibit distinctive cultural differences in their management practices. By conducting a large-scale survey across a range of sectors, the study aimed to abstract the diffuse effect of these cultural differences from the specific impact of sectorial and organizational contingencies. In particular, questions within the survey sought to explore the extent to which managerial preferences and practices in IT use could be interpreted in terms of two key dimensions of national cultural difference. The latter were operationalized in this study as a control orientation to IT use, and an individualistic orientation to IT use, respectively. The overall analysis of the survey data suggests that the effect of national culture is significant and seems to operate across industry boundaries. Managers in Japanese factories do in fact exhibit the hypothesized stronger orientation towards a control orientation in the use of IT, while managers in British factories show a relatively stronger orientation towards individualistic use of IT at the management level. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An organization operates within a network of relationships with economic partners. The translation services market provides rich examples of networks in practice that connect a diverse range of customers who require translation services to a global array of translators ranging from individual experts through to organized groups. This paper examines the marketing strategy of a global translation company, Thebigword. In the case of Thebigword, the network is constructed around shared information systems that encapsulate and define the nature of relationships with both business customers and thousands of individual translators worldwide. The marketing problem for Thebigword is that it must be able to sense and react to changes and requests from large business customers around the world, whether this is a change to their website, or a request for a new document translation. In the financial services market, the request for translation services may also be very time sensitive. The focus of the paper is on how Thebigword has used information systems to create a smart business network that defines marketing channels along the key dimensions of target market, business processes, IT architectures and systems, and network intelligence. A range of business examples is presented that illustrate how the marketing and information technology concepts fit together, including that of an international bank and an airline company. The case also provides technology examples of portal technology, web services and e-procurement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> When developing an information system, organisations are faced with a fundamental choice: to buy a pre-developed package (potentially customise it or redesign/reengineer the business processes of the company concerned to fit the package), or to build the system in-house. Past literature has indicated the importance of the buy vs build decision to the organisation even suggesting that correctly managing the choice could be the key to managing IT. This research aims to identify the factors that an organisation should consider when making an information systems buy vs build decision. Interviews were conducted with 10 organisations across a spread of industries, involving key strategic IT decision-making personnel at the senior IT executive level. By examining the operational approaches adopted in each of these organisations and the key drivers behind these approaches, we identify the core factors that affect real-world buy vs build decisions in large Australian organisations with a turnover in excess of $750 million. We found that a number of core factors - strategy, commodity and competitive advantage, maturity, cost and requirements fit - critically affect buy vs build, while peripheral factors - risk, time and timing, political factors, and ongoing support - are secondary considerations. </jats:p>",

The data reveal significant differences in the perceptions of business managers and those of IT professionals, especially with respect to issues of IT system efficacy and communication efficacy. Both cohorts demonstrate increasing awareness of the importance of IT as a driver of business activity, as well as comparable upward or downward trends in response on issues relating to IT's alignment with business strategy and communication efficacy, but only the first mentioned issue is identified as a statistically significant trend. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> IT outsourcing vendors depend on projects from their clients to reap gains and develop capabilities. Because of this dependence, vendors are vulnerable to shocks in client demand. However, the extant literature on how vendors mitigate the damage from demand shocks is very limited. This multiple case study examined five pairs of relationships between Chinese vendors and their Japanese clients, drawing on resource dependence theory, which considers two response strategies: bridging and buffering. Our findings suggest that both bridging and buffering should be specified further on the basis of their explorative and exploitative dimensions, and that the choice of a particular strategy depended on the power relation between the vendor and client. Results show that when the client was in a highpower advantage, the vendor chose bridging. More specifically, if the vendor also had high power, it adopted explorative bridging; otherwise, it adopted exploitative bridging. When the client was in a low-power position, the vendor would pursue explorative buffering. Exploitative buffering was a common response to demand shocks, independent of the dyadic power relation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2005 the Journal of Information Technology article ‘A critical analysis of decision support systems research’ analyzed 1020 decision support systems (DSS) articles from 1990 to 2003. Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis. The article sample to 2010 now includes 1466 articles from 16 journals. The analysis of the expectations yields mixed results for the DSS field. On the negative side, there has been an overall decline in DSS publishing, the relevance of DSS research published in journals to IT professionals has declined, and the rigor of DSS research designs has not improved. On the positive side, there has been improvement in relevance to managers, grant funding of DSS research has increased, there has been a positive shift in judgment and decision-making foundations, BI publishing has increased, and group support systems publishing has reduced to a more balanced level. An important result from the analysis of the last 7 years of DSS research is the significant increase in DSS design-science research (DSR) to almost half of published articles. It is clear from the analysis that DSS is undergoing a transition from a field based on statistical hypothesis testing and conceptual studies to one where DSR is the most popular method. </jats:p>",

First I identify three discourses on IS implementation and associated organizational and social change that coexist in information systems in developing countries (ISDC) research, namely as a process of technology and knowledge transfer and adaptation to local social conditions; as a process of socially embedded action; and as a process of transformative techno-organizational intervention associated with global politics and economics. I then point out the distinctive research agenda that has been formed in ISDC studies, both in the more familiar IS themes - failure, outsourcing, and strategic value of ICT - and also in studies of themes relevant specifically to the context of developing countries, such as the development of community ICT and information resources. Finally, I call the reader's attention to the potentially significant theoretical contributions of ISDC research for understanding IS innovation in relation to social context and in relation to socio-economic development theories and policies. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Social Machines: How Recent Technological Advances have Aided Financialisation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, financial markets have been fundamentally transformed by innovations in information technology, in particular with regard to the web, social networks, high-speed computer networks and mobile technologies. We borrow the concept of Social Machines from Web Science as a single concept that captures the essence of all these recent technological changes to argue that the emergence of these Social Machines has aided the transformation of financial markets and society. This study explores the formation of these Social Machines with three sample disruptive technologies – automated/high-frequency trading, social network analytics and smart mobile technology. Through critical reflective analysis of these three case studies, we assess the impact of information technology innovation on financialisation. We adopt three case studies – automated trading; market information extraction using social media technologies; and information diffusion and trader decision-making with mobile technology on financial and real sector changes – which demonstrate the increasing trend of transaction velocity, speculative trading, increased complex information network, accelerated inequality and leverage. Our findings demonstrate that technologically enabled financial Social Machines harness crowd wisdom, engage disparate individual traders to produce more accurate price estimations, and have enhanced decision-making capability. However, these same changes can also have a simultaneously detrimental effect on financial and real sectors, in some situations exacerbating underlying distortions, such as misinformation due to complex information networks, speculative trading behaviour, and higher volatility with transaction velocity. Overall, we conclude that these innovations have transformed the fundamental nature of key aspects of the finance industry and society as a whole. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Review of the it Outsourcing Empirical Literature and Future Research Directions",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> An enormous amount of information has been produced about the IT outsourcing phenomenon over the last 20 years, but one has to look to the academic literature for consistent, objective, and reliable research approaches and analyses. Our review finds that, In practice, the academic literature on IT outsourcing has very much honored both rigor and relevance In the ways In which research has been conducted. Our central purpose In the review was to answer two research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about information technology outsourcing (ITO) decisions and outcomes? What are the gaps In knowledge to consider In future ITO research? To answer these questions, we examined 164 empirical ITO articles published between 1992 and 2010 In 50 journals. Adapting a method used by Jeyaraj et al. (2006), we encapsulated this vast empirical literature on ITO In a way that was concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 36 dependent variables, 138 independent variables, and 741 relationships between Independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of outsourcing: one model addressed ITO decisions and one model addressed ITO outcomes. The model of ITO decisions includes Independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, client firm characteristics, and influence sources. The model of ITO outcomes includes Independent variables associated with client and supplier capabilities, relationship characteristics, contractual governance, decision characteristics, and transaction attributes. We also examined the interactions among broad categories of variables and the learning curve effects resulting from feedback loops. Overall, ITO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of ITO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done. We reviewed recent studies that have identified gaps in current knowledge and proposed future paths of research pertaining to strategic motivations, environmental influences, dynamic interactions, configurational and portfolio approaches, global destinations, emerging models, reference theory extension, and grounded theory development. </jats:p>",

Despite the Impressive scope of this phenomenon, very little Is understood about what motivates users to disclose personal Information. Integrating focus group results Into a theoretical privacy calculus framework, we develop and empirically test a Structural Equation Model of self-disclosure with 259 subjects. We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose Information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users’ perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Managing Identity Tensions during Mobile Ecosystem Evolution",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The idea of an ecosystem suggests a holistic framing of how heterogeneous actors relate to one another and of the dynamics of their relationships. Because of the dynamics some relationships will become uncertain, posing significant challenge to the identity of participating organizations. Unfortunately, the Information Systems (IS) literature has not examined how organizations develop and negotiate their identities during ecosystem evolution. We fill this void by exploring identity challenges that Swedish Road Administration (SRA) faced while implementing the Radio Data System – Traffic Message Channel (RDS – TMC) traffic information service. Through a longitudinal case study we follow how SRA's inherited expectations, guiding norms, and standards of sense-giving about its identity prevented it from becoming a flexible service provider within an emerging mobile ecosystem. We record a constant clash – the identity tension – between the old inherited identity of a public road administrator and the aspiring new identity of a digital service provider. To enact a successful identity change, SRA had to engage in a series of change episodes whereby it deliberately implemented new routines that forged novel relationships with actors within the ecosystem. This permitted SRA to gradually align its identity to the evolving needs of the RDS-TMC service ecosystem. Our findings suggest that deliberate attempts to implement innovative mobile services – especially those involving public-private partnerships – trigger intriguing identity ambiguities and role dilemmas, and future research should therefore focus on effective strategies to identify, manage, and resolve inherent identity tensions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Critical realism has attracted increasing attention as an alternative to positivist and interpretive research for explaining contemporary phenomena. There are now several sources for information systems' (IS) scholars providing guidance on conducting critical realist studies. However, the most challenging step of a critical realist data analysis, the identification of causal mechanisms, is still insufficiently described. Identifying mechanisms is challenging. Drawing on the concept of affordances as an analytical construct offers the researcher a tool to identify and analyse mechanisms. We present a stepwise framework for identifying structural components of a mechanism, how these components interact to produce an outcome and contextual influences on this outcome. We illustrate the application of the framework through an example of the identification of IS innovation mechanisms in a case study in the airline industry. In doing so, we argue that the approach offers a methodological tool for identifying generative mechanisms, helping the researcher in conducting a more precise data analysis in empirical research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In order to foster knowledge-sharing among employees, an increasing number of companies has recently begun implementing social network-based enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs). Although employees are expected to adopt these platforms quickly and use them as actively as they use public and free social media, patterns of private and corporate usage differ. While some research on the determinants of using public and free social media like Facebook has been conducted, empirical studies on the factors determining active participation in ESMPs is scarce. Based on research derived from a survey of 492 respondents carried out in a large knowledge-intensive firm, this paper addresses this gap. The results of our empirical quantitative study reveal that extrinsic motivation in particular – that is, anticipated gains in reputation and reciprocal benefits – drives employees to share knowledge in ESMPs. Knowledge-sharing self-efficacy also facilitates participation, while the enjoyment in helping others does not. The study contributes to information systems and knowledge management research, as it reveals motivational factors that drive the individual adoption in terms of active use of ESMPs. Managerial implications are derived from these results. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital innovation enables new forms of cyber-physical innovation based on digital business ecosystems. However, the realization of the opportunities arising from such innovation substantially hinges on interoperability, that is, the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and understand that exchanged information. While interoperability is a long-standing topic in research and practice alike and a valuable knowledge base exists, digital innovation poses novel challenges that might not be covered by conventional wisdom. Accordingly, we review the literature and, first, propose an organizing framework for existing interoperability knowledge involving the contextual conditions of low interoperability, the mechanisms to increase interoperability, and the associated outcomes. Second, we use the framework to identify previous research foci in the scholarly discourse about interoperability and to discuss the potential limitations of this past work in light of digital innovation. Third, we propose a research agenda that enables information systems (IS) research to address the identified limitations—involving conceptual, scoping, and methodological issues—and provide specific recommendations on how to address the identified issues in future IS research. Finally, we propose five major research topics for further inquiry by combining the challenges identified in current knowledge with the current shift toward hyper-connected ecosystems underlying digital innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we focus on the growing evidence of unintended harmful societal effects of automated algorithmic decision-making (AADM) in transformative services (e.g., social welfare, healthcare, education, policing and criminal justice), for individuals, communities and society at large. Drawing from the long-established research on social pollution, in particular its contemporary ‘pollution-as-harm’ notion, we put forward a claim, and provide evidence, that these harmful effects constitute a new type of digital social pollution, which we name ‘algorithmic pollution’. Words do matter, and by using the term ‘pollution’, not as a metaphor, but as a transformative redefinition of the digital harm performed by AADM, we seek to make it visible and recognized. By adopting a critical performative perspective, we explain how the execution of AADM produces harm and thus performs algorithmic pollution. Recognition of the potential for unintended harmful effects of algorithmic pollution, and their examination as such, leads us to articulate the need for transformative actions to prevent, detect, redress, mitigate, and educate about algorithmic harm. These actions, in turn, open up new research challenges for the information systems community. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Business Process Outsourcing Studies: A Critical Review and Research Directions",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizations are increasingly sourcing their business processes through external service providers, a practice known as Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Worldwide, the current BPO market could be as much as $279 billion and is predicted to continue growing at 25% annually. Academic researchers have been studying this market for about 15 years and have produced findings relevant to practice. The entire body of BPO research has never been reviewed, and this paper fills that gap. We filtered the total studies and reviewed 87 empirically robust BPO articles published between 1996 and 2011 in 67 journals to answer three research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about BPO decisions and outcomes? How do BPO findings compare with Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) empirical research? What are the gaps in knowledge to consider in future BPO research? Employing a proven method that Lacity et al. (2010) used to review the empirical ITO literature, we encapsulated this empirical literature on BPO in a way that is concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 43 dependent variables, 152 independent variables, and 615 relationships between independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of BPO: one model addresses BPO decisions and one model addresses BPO outcomes. The model of BPO decisions includes independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, and client firm characteristics. The model of BPO outcomes includes independent variables associated with contractual and relational governance, country characteristics, and client and supplier capabilities. Overall, BPO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of BPO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done. We propose nine future paths of research pertaining to innovation effects, retained capabilities, environmental influences, global destinations, supplier capabilities, pricing models, business analytics, emerging models, and grounded theory development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘It's only a web site. What could be so difficult about that?’ This quote is from the cafeteria of a start-up business funded by a North American retailer, after the disastrous ‘Black Friday’ of 2000, during which its web site experienced systemic failure. This case describes the dynamics, complexities and consequences of fast tracking an e-business start-up. This consumer electronics retailer created one of the most visited retail web sites, from concept to operation in 6 months. Market analysts were predicting a major increase in online sales while consumers were adopting the Internet at a rate faster than any previous technology. Meeting the multi-channel demands of the dynamic and competitive environment required operational balance, stability, innovative flexibility, organizational fit and the alignment of resource capabilities with technology. This case challenges the reader to comment on how a large company positioned itself and integrated the necessary competencies to compete successfully in a developing market by establishing a spin-off operation, separate from the main company. </jats:p>",

    "title": "E-commerce and firm bargaining power shift in grocery marketing channels: A case of wholesalers' structured document exchanges",
    "abstract": "Electronic commerce is transforming interorganizational relationships in marketing channels. Reports frequently note that ‘power’ goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or ‘automated’ trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers' incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers' perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers' perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss. This results in higher trust and cooperation in their trading relationships.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a manufacturing systems engineering view of important issues relating to IT research and development. It argues for an approach to the next phase of information technology development which is heavily based on real-world applications with the dominant influences held by educated users and engineers who have added computing skills, rather than information technologists. It argues for ‘consolidation’ with particular attention to total systems integration and an emphasis on the need to professionally engineer the human interface. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Organizing for Crisis Response",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Crises are turning points in organizations. When crisis strikes, fast-response management depends on quickly configuring and deploying information and communications. This paper brings together research and practice in crisis response management, information technology and news media fast-response methods to derive principles for using information technology as an organizational resource. Firms increasingly recognize the need to view their information technology (IT) platform as a key business resource for just-in-time scheduling, distribution, coordination, service and logistics. If they see it as an equally key resource for just-in-time crisis response, it then creates a powerful base for crisis response management. Exxon Valdez and the Gulf War illustrate these requirements. They provide a stage model of crisis response. The model is not intended as a general description of crisis, but as a more specific modelling of organizational response capability. This stage model is illustrated by Dow Coming's recent silicon-gel implant crisis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Electronic commerce changes the relationships between sellers and buyers dramatically. The new properties of electronic markets offer customers added values. New customer value propositions have to be established in most markets and new marketing strategies must be formulated. One of the business sectors most heavily affected is banking. How can banks retain loyal customers when moving into electronic banking? Research in marketing has unveiled several determinants of customer loyalty. However, this knowledge is based on research on customers in traditional markets. In this paper we focus on customers’ loyalty in on-line banking. The findings indicate that determinants of loyalty in on-line banking environments are similar to those in the physical market-place. However, customer satisfaction is found to have the most significant impact, followed by brand reputation, while switching costs and search costs, although significant, have minor explanatory power. The implications of these findings on banks’ marketing strategies are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Boundary resources have been shown to enable the arm’s-length relationships between platform owners and third-party developers that underlie digital innovation in platform ecosystems. While boundary resources that are owned by open-source communities and small-scale software vendors are also critical components in the digital infrastructure, their role in digital innovation has yet to be systematically explored. In particular, software libraries are popular boundary resources that provide functionality without the need for continued interaction with their owners. They are used extensively by commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products, by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control. This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London. Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment. These findings portray a balanced picture of digital infrastructure as neither the community-based utopia of early open-source research nor the dystopia of the recent digital dominance literature. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizational restructuring focuses on making business operations more flexible and responsive to customers. This has led to team based decision authority structures and horizontal business processes. Concurrently, the management of information has been decentralized in many organizations. Horizontal processes create information interdependencies among previously independent tasks, and call for high levels of information sharing among decision units. However, the decentralization of information management raises the possibility that units controlling specific information repositories may not readily make them available in the required form to other units, leading to poor organizational payoff. Thus it is critical to create an environment which will promote effective information flows across the organization. We suggest that mechanisms involving organizational outlook, social orientation, equitable information processing capability and communication across decision units regarding information requirements can help mitigate the information sharing problem. Using stylized game-theoretic models, we show that these organizationally oriented mechanisms have a sound economic foundation. We use these results to build a managerial basis for improving information exchange. </jats:p>",

This paper theorizes such a link by drawing on Jensen’s (2010) conceptualization of processes of demoralization to operationalize two notions from critical social theorist Zygmunt Bauman: workers’ moral impulse and moral ambivalence. We conducted a case study of a large luxury resort hotel to examine how digital platforms (specifically TripAdvisor and WhatsApp) facilitate surveillance. Our findings show how digital platform-facilitated synoptic and panoptic forms of surveillance can suppress workers’ moral impulse and foster moral ambivalence towards such issues as invading others’ privacy, pressuring others outside working hours, and increasing surveillance in the workplace. This paper offers a novel perspective on theorizing the links between digital platforms, surveillance, and workers’ morality and highlights some unintended consequences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Teaching Cases for Information Systems",
    "abstract": "The teaching value of cases is well recognized in business schools. They are widely used both in MBA programmes and in short executive development courses. Typically, they provide a moderately realistic context in which to explore the application of academic theories and models, though this, of course, does not exhaust their potential value. Their relevance is less well recognized in undergraduate IS departments and still less in computer science and other technical departments that sometimes house IS faculties. Established case providers such as Harvard Business School, Ivey School of Business and Case Clearing House have typically set and sustained high standards of quality. The downside has been that the set of available cases is constrained, with access limited for some educational institutions by their, or their students’, ability to pay. The style of each providers’ cases is regimented, with some providers seemingly encouraging highly detailed, `mega-cases’ that are perhaps not appropriate for all classes and purposes. While their life span varies, many lose their freshness quickly. This is particularly so in a fast moving area like IS/IT. The major case providers offer little room for innovation. Furthermore, because most of the best-known cases have US and Canadian settings, notwithstanding such famous cases as Singapore’s TRADENET, they can lack appeal for European, Asian and other students. Though in the last ® ve years we have seen a growing published supply of topical cases that are set outside the North American context. In the past, teaching cases have often been written by doctoral students under the supervision of a senior faculty member. For the faculty member there has usually been little academic recognition for their effort. This is curious given that the case has often been the subject of rigorous and intensive research, and that the development of an effective set of teaching notes (or instructor’s manual) is both an intellectually challenging exercise and offers substantial academic value to other course leaders who use the case and notes. In championing the introduction of, and acting as track chairs for, a refereed teaching case track at the Seventeenth International Conference in Information Systems at Helsinki Finland in December 1998, our purposes were to:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A recurrent mantra of the technology industry is that all forms of ‘friction’ should be eliminated from online interactions (especially commercial transactions). In this context, ‘friction’ refers to any unnecessary retardation of a process or activity that delays the user accomplishing a desired action. This broad category can therefore include online adverts that link to the wrong webpages, pop-up windows that block access to content or delays in the physical delivery of an ordered item. Although visions of a frictionless future have been common since at least 1995 (the year Bill Gates popularised the phrase ‘friction-free capitalism’), the basic notion has remained unhelpfully vague. Accordingly, this article focuses specifically on the phenomenon of online friction (i.e. ‘e-friction’) and elaborates a typology of the main subtypes. An analytical framework of this kind makes it much easier to compare and contrast distinct kinds of e-friction, recognising that important differences distinguish those that are ‘elective’, ‘non-elective’, ‘impeding’, ‘distracting’ and so on. Having sketched a preliminary typology, the article reflects upon the ethical implications of the distinct varieties, and concludes by suggesting that there are several reasons why an entirely (e-)frictionless future is a profoundly disturbing one. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: The virtual community",
    "abstract": "This book could almost be subtitled 'Confessions of a Spod' to adopt the slang by which users of bulletin boards and virtual discussions refer to themselves. Howard Rheingold bases it around his own experience over several years as a user, particularly of a system called WELL. But Rheingold is no preoccupied hacker with limited social skills. He joined an electronic community in the mid-1980s, attracted by the chance to watch a society growing, developing its own conventions and learning how best to use its own peculiar method of communication. His (real life) family became used to seeing him in earnest discussion with the computer, and his description of this society and its members as he meets them is varied, absorbing and at times touching. Without leaving his home, he has met students, medics, librarians and lawyers, many with a story to tell about themselves. He has watched history unfold as it happens, participated in fund-raising for sick members of the community, watched romances made and broken and in extreme cases met people in real life once he had got to know them over the net. Even when he addresses the allegations that such systems are for the lonely, it is refreshing to see that he refuses to be pejorative about users who are lonely: 'one honest answer... is that most people don't have a terribly glamorous life'. Within the virtual world there are numerous communities general fora for asking specialized questions, cult discussions, live chats (the most addictive and potentially damaging to productivity) where users can watch words appear on a screen as their counterpart types them, pornographic bulletin boards with their attendant ethical problems and multiuser dungeons (the connotations of the word dungeon vary amongst different people). There are people hiding behind multiple identities, crafting their own personalities, sometimes creating complete fictitious characters and joining the network in character, sometimes disguising their gender (Rheingold is rather over-charitable on this; in practice most networks have more male than female users, so presenting as a woman is a way of attracting attention). The book is an engaging account of what it feels like to join such a borderless community. While clearly enthused by the network's possibilities, Rheingold ends by looking at some of the drawbacks, not so much of virtual community but of a society where there are no restrictions on spreading information (unfortunately there is no mention of the British Data Protection Act) and the infrastructure to distribute it is very cheap. His (powerful) analogy for people feeling imprisoned by technology is the Panopticon, a prison proposed in the 19th century by Jeremy Bentham where every inmate would be under constant surveillance but unable to see anybody else. Nevertheless, Rheingold raises more questions for the researcher than he answers. When do bulletin boards become addictive? What are the implications of users revealing or concealing their identity? What sort of ethical code is needed to control interactive behaviour on the network? How close to universal access will such networks get in the future?

    "title": "The Case Study: A Useful Research Method for Information Management",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper urges greater recognition of the case study as a research method for information management. It acknowledges concern about the representatives of case studies but by specifying the relationships between epistemology and research methods shows that this concern is misplaced. Representatives is irrelevant for many research purposes, particularly when the distinction is made between logical and statistical inference. The validity of explanations or theory derived from case studies depends on the logic of the analysis and acknowledgement of ceteris paribus conditions, not on how typical the cases may be. Typologies of case studies have been proposed and these are considered, together with recommendations for the conduct of systematic and rigorous case study research. It is stressed that research problems should be addressed using appropriate research methods. Research of the important problems within the management area frequently demands a qualitative research approach, though it would seem that such an approach is often ignored because of a positivist research orientation. An assessment of the strengths and weakness of the case study method, which highlights its potential in the vital role of theory-building, leads to the conclusions that this method has much to commend it to information management researchers (1). </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Business Process Reengineering: BreakPoint Strategies for Market Dominance",
    "abstract": "Let us not mince words: Business Process Reengineering is not recommended reading. First of all, the book is poorly written. The authors use jargon excessively. Transitions between paragraphs and different ideas are often startling and it sometimes hard to see any continuity at all. For all the drawn out and nitty-gritty description, the case study examples do not illustrate or explain re-engineering: instead, they seem to be thrown in, almost as a filler. The diagrams, charts and graphs tend to be overly-detailed and unclear. Secondly, the book emphasizes manufacturing to a fault: it lacks description and discussion of the breadth and variety oftypes ofre-engineering initiatives. Finally, and most importantly, the book is deficient in its treatment of its main theme, re-engineering. It spends an undue amount of time discussing other business issues such as just-in-time (lIT), total quality management (TQM) and globalization, to name a few. Most of the discussion and case examples, though claimed by the authors to concern re-engineering, are actually better classified as product innovation, process simplification or incremental improvement. And many of the comments that are made about re-engineering are all too superficial. As a result, after finishing the book the reader is left with little sense of what re-engineering is, what the important issues are or how to go about performing re-engineering. The authors' fmal words on the subject are of little help: if business leaders 'work hard enough, listen to those ... who have good ideas, have a little luck, and are willing to take a few hits', they may succeed such that the market-place says 'WOW' (p. 206). There is, however, one contribution the authors make to the re-engineering literature. They remind us that reengineering cannot be done in a vacuum. Re-engineering must be aligned with overall corporate strategy: strategy must be broadened to think about production processes so that it includes not only the traditional questions of what, where and to whom do you sell, but also, how do you organize and operate in order to produce it? The authors insist that re-engineering should be demand driven that it should maintain a strong external focus on the marketplace, on the customers the re-engineered processes (or businesses) are supposed to serve. The authors suggest that after assessingmarket demand, the company can then work backwards to design the processes necessary to deliver the desired product or service and, fmally, acquire the assets (people, materials, information systems, etc.) needed to operate them. They advocate that special attention in re-engineering be given to interfaces in the value chain the upstream and downstream connections Book reviews",

In the past Information Systems (IS) was spread across the various product divisions, supporting a highly decentralized corporate structure. Now it has been charged with transforming itself to facilitate the company's need for greater integration, including a move to standardized systems. IS must redefine its role and restructure itself to fulfil its new mandate. After an extensive analysis and design exercise, the IS function has been revisualized as centring on three key processes: client management, solution delivery and business support. This represents a significant change from a traditional IS shop that focuses on building applications and infrastructure. While there is broad support for the changes in principle, actually getting the new processes fully articulated and implemented presents a significant challenge. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Information Technology - the Catalyst for Change, CBI 1990",
    "abstract": "This recent offering from the NCC builds on Remenyi's previous book* and define.s strategic information systems as those systems which support company activities in the business environmen.t. Remenyi's main purpose is to introduce Strategic Information Systems as a new research area and. to review some recent case study work on the evaluation and implementation of these systems. The introduction is lengthy, but fails to provide the reader with any clue as to how the case study findings are to be used. There are three case studies; one from IBM, one from Peat Marwick McLintock Management Consultants (PMM-MC), and one based on the introduction of an SIS into a disguised company known as 'Associated Commodities'. The case study evidence is preceded by a review of some recent research on SIS from the DTI; the Butler Cox Foundation; the Oxford Institute of Information Management and a consultancy firm known as PRISM. There is a substantial overlap in the core findings of these reports but Remenyi raises the interesting point that the first three studies are 'based on what had already become the established view of SIS', Le. that 'there are specific information system opportunities which, if properly exploited will afford the firm a competitive advantage'. The fourth research study according to Remenyi 'very substantially challenges this view by suggesting that a.search fo~ s~­ called hot systems is a non productive exercise. According to the PRISM group, 'the reality of competitive information systems is far more complex than many of the current reports suggest. Failures are widespread and very costly, and for obvious reasons tend to be less well documented than successes. Remenyi argues that 'There are in fact fundamental misunderstandings and misapprehensions about the nature of strategic and competitive edge systems ... systems should not in themselves be consid~r.ed strategic or competitive as they are not usually entitles",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> From many empirical studies, organizational issues have been considered the most critical bottleneck for successful information system (IS) implementations. In this paper, an organizational issue of resolving conflict of interests among the stakeholders is addressed. Using the decision analytic approach, the major sources of disagreement among the stakeholders were identified, discussed and resolved. The approach was applied to a problem of implementing an information system for advanced telecommunication services. The case presented here showed how to resolve the conflicting interests proactively and demonstrated the value of the approach. The decision analytic approach presented in this paper was a viable and very useful tool in resolving the conflict of interests among the people included in the negotiation process. As a result of the successful negotiation, it was estimated to have saved $6.9 million dollars after tax for AT&amp;T. </jats:p>",

It is clear from the findings that while IT is being used in marketing and CS, such application of IT is still in its infancy. It is equally clear that there is great potential for using IT in marketing and CS, at both operational and strategic levels. Organisations that fail to recognize the strategic value of IT in marketing and CS run the risk of being at a considerable disadvantage. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Teleworking: An Information Technology Tool for Integrated Broadband Communication Development in Rural Areas of Europe",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology has an increasing impact in the development of rural areas but the development and implementation of telematic services in these areas present special problems such as the appropriate mix of communication technologies, the commercial prospects of recovering the cost of investment, the social problems etc., which currently limit their effective use. With the recent introduction of narrowband ISDN (Integrated Services Data Networks) in Europe it is now possible to offer various services on a single subscriber line. In addition, with the development of both high reliable fibre-optic transmission and very fast switching systems, the introduction of broadband ISDN can also be considered. Unfortunately, the less favoured regions of EC (European Community) lack infrastructure. The development in these areas will be a gradual process. Large investments will be required, and the systems installed will have a lifetime of some decades. Therefore the right decisions on the chosen technologies and on the appropriate system configurations have to be taken to ensure success. In this work, the teleworking prospects as an IT tool for rural development are studied in detail. The motivation, the technology and the prosperity of teleworking in the less favoured regions of the EC are analysed and discussed. The analysis considers the existing telecommunication infrastructure in each one of the six peripheral member states in relation with the development and implementation of some important telematic systems in these areas. The main features of the proposed technologies as well as the establishment of the possible cost effective strategies for IBC (Integrated Broadband Communication) implementation in rural areas is also provided. It appears that teleworking is a key element for rural development and can be implemented through the realization of the IBCNs (IBC Networks). By taking lessons from some of the most important experimental initiatives which have already been introduced in some countries, useful recommendations in the policy to be adopted by the EC are drawn and presented. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards Dissolution of the is Research Debate: From Polarization to Polarity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The debate between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ research approaches continues in the IS field, but with little prospect of resolution. The debate is typically characterized by tendentious arguments as advocates from each approach offer a somewhat one-sided condemnation of the counterpart from the inimical research tradition. This paper begins by relating two fictitious tales which serve to highlight the futility of research conducted at the extremity of each research approach. The dichotomies which characterize these rival factions are also summarized. The debate is then framed in terms of the polarization problem whereby IS researchers are divided geographically and paradigmatically into ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ camps. A variety of different strategies have been proposed for resolving the debate and these are discussed in detail. They are grouped into four categories, referred to as supremacism, isolationism, integration, and pluralism. Finally, the paper contends that the debate cannot be resolved, and offers the metaphor of magnetic polarity as a means of reflecting this. The paper concludes by arguing that it would be more appropriate to recast the debate at a macro level in order to accommodate different research agenda and recognize the strengths within each tradition. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Identifying the idiosyncrasies of behavioral information security discourse and proposing future research directions: A Foucauldian perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information security (InfoSec)–related behaviors have been defined in many different ways in the security literature. Indeed, the coexistence of varying terms describing IS security behaviors could be seen as a conceptual inconsistency. However, we believe that it could also be construed as the sign of a vivid and living field embracing dispersed objects of study without changing the disciplinary discourse itself. To test this belief, we conduct a two-part study. Study 1 analyzes the definitions of InfoSec-related behaviors in the existing security literature. The result of Study 1 uncovers the Foucauldian rules that make possible the discourse on behavioral information security, including the surface of emergence, authorities of delimitation, and the grids of specification. Study 1 also indicates that, although behavioral Information Systems Security (ISS) shares the three rules with other disciplines, it is the only field that studies the relations between them. We therefore propose a disciplinary question that reflects this idiosyncrasy. We then conduct Study 2, using Foucault’s view on preconceptual schemata as a theoretical lens, to identify understudied areas in the ISS literature. We found that the existing literature utilizes two variations of the actor and organization schemata to form or to adapt concepts, and utilize two different approaches to study these two variations, namely, an antecedents approach and a dialectics approach. It is noteworthy that the latter is important but understudied in the literature. We then draw an analogy from moral studies to develop three concepts for future ISS research, namely, Stages of Awareness Development, Security Agency, and Security Disengagement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Radical shifts in large information technology programmes or digital infrastructures are unusual, but they do occur, usually as a consequence of problems or misalignment. What we know less about is the role of discourse in these shifts. Our interest in this article is to investigate the role of discourse when digitalisation programmes encounter problems. Building on Foucault’s theory of discourse, our research question is: what is the role of discourse in the transformation of digital infrastructures? Our research approach is a critical realist case study, discussing three cases from eHealth innovation. We use Foucault’s archaeological methodology to identify the emerging discursive formations when a programme encounters difficulties. This enables us to analyse the causal relationship between discursive formations and other mechanisms in the infrastructure. We offer two contributions: first, we outline a framework to understand the role of discursive formations in digital transformation; second, we propose a set of configurations to explain how contextual factors and causal mechanisms contingently lead to the transformation of a digital infrastructure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Increasingly, organizations are looking towards IS planning in an effort to force information technology to live up to its heralded promise. Many of these are finding that their efforts are resulting more in disappointment than in organizational advantage. This article reviews the principles of information systems planning and reports the practices found in organizations. The authors argue that these practices lack the high level direction required to achieve mastery in the area. To rectify this, they propose a four-tier planning framework for information technology, information systems, and information management. This framework provides guidance for an integrated approach to the management of an organization's information and technology resources by promoting the development of a planning platform from which consolidated planning can take place at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates how digital platforms can drive the digital transformation of participant firms in their surrounding business ecosystems. To do so, we conduct an in-depth case study of Alibaba’ cross-border e-commerce platform and eleven seller firms operating on the platform. Our results highlight the importance of proper empowerment in platform-driven digital transformation. In particular, we observe that Alibaba attempts to facilitate the digital transformation of seller firms through three types of activities: resource empowerment, psychological empowerment, and structural empowerment. Moreover, we find that the sequence of these empowerment activities plays a critical role. Without being psychologically empowered first, seller firms react quite passively to Alibaba’s resource provision and structural support. Psychological empowerment provides the activation triggers for the sellers to renew their mindsets and become receptive to Alibaba’s support and guidance, which ultimately contribute to the digital transformation of their businesses. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Organizational Principles of Systems Decentralization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> A study aimed at a determination of the organizational principles involved in systems decentralization (SD). It is based on a survey of 14 American and British companies selected for their significant investments in and mature experience of decentralized systems. There were eight principles underlying the policy and practice of SD in these companies, and the inference is that these principles appear to work. That is, considering their commonality of use and the depth of experience in the companies concerned, these principles appear to be optimizing the potential gains achievable through SD, while minimizing the potential losses. The implication is that, if these organizational principles can be effectively implemented in other organizations, they may facilitate success in systems decentralization, as well as the evolution toward distributed systems. Viewed as a whole, the principles appear to complement each other, such that they may be viewed as a conceptual model, wherein each depends upon at least one other for its effectiveness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Managing a project is an involved and many faceted job requiring a combination of management, organization and technical skills. Current methods tend to be based on lifecycle principles and so are project management tools. Additionally, project management is learnt by a process of ‘coming up through the ranks’. Modern methods of structured analysis and design, computer aided coding and the move towards prototyping cause one to question whether or not the current management style, the support tools and training methods are going to be appropriate for tomorrow's technology. This paper proposes an alternative model of management and examines it to see whether or not it is better suited to modern methods, to being computer aided and to training the next generation of project managers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The idea of information is closely related to the abstract idea of knowledge, yet seems to imply knowledge in a form that can be communicated or at least interpreted. It is natural therefore in investigating this question to examine the ideas of Chomsky, Winograd, Schank and Abelson concerning natural language and also the ideas of Shannon concerning the transmission of information. In examining the ideas of these researchers we will also concern ourselves with the problem of finding formalisms to deal with the complexities of language and indirectly of the real world. It is often the limitations of these formalisms that also provide the greatest obstacle to our understanding the nature of information. The most basic method of communicating information available to humans is language. What are the ingredients of language that enable it to act in this way? One of the first researchers to seriously investigate this question was Chomsky (1957). His initial attempt to understand language led him to generative grammar. This seeks to outline a system of rules which are capable of generating all the grammatical utterances of a language and no ungrammatical ones. A central notion is that",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper uses a ‘case in sector’ analysis to investigate the extent to which the success criteria imposed by cost accounting constrains the ability of engineers to acquire and make effective use of computer aided design (CAD). The paper examines two periods of CAD investment in a sample of UK manufacturers. In the first ‘early adoption’ period CAD proposals were made by junior engineers on a locally initiated ‘bottom up’ basis. Proposals were made according to the dictates of conventional cost benefit analysis, engineering and accounting priorities were separate, and senior management were not involved. In the second ‘general adoption’ period there was a general uptake of CAD throughout the sector. The paper demonstrates that the evaluation of CAD was influenced not just by the rival claims of accountants and engineers, but also by long run changes in the operating environment, and by the control devices employed by senior management. The findings bear out the view of technological change as a socially negotiated process. However, it would appear that the oranizational practices associated with CAD evaluation are continually re-negotiated in the light of dynamic organizational interests and changes in the broader sectoral context. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The First Annual Conference and Exhibition on Business Process Re-Engineering",
    "abstract": "Business process re-engineering involves a fundamental rethinking of business process resulting in major changes to the way in which at least some part of the business operates and is informed by a greater focus on how the organization can deliver value to its customers. IT occupies a special place in such projects. Existing systems and future plans are profoundly affected by the changing organizational structures and work roles produced by redesign. Whether IT is a key enabler as Hammer and Champy (1993) suggest is more debatable. This conference considerably advanced understanding on how and when to attempt re-engineering. It provided a valuable forum to both speakers and audience alike, for the discussion and analysis of the problems involved in managing such projects. Speakers came from nearly 20 companies or agencies to report on the experience of their own organization in attempting business re-engineering projects. Most had been initiated within the last 3 years. The size of potential benefits forecast by writers such as Hammer and Champy (1993) seemed to be supported by results quoted here. CIGNA, for example, one ofthe four companies to have completed a re-engineering exercise, claimed to have reduced time to quote for insurance from 17 to 2 days and to have achieved a cost decrease of 25%. However, few of the contributing organizations had progressed far enough to be in a position to assess the scale of potential benefits. A large audience of nearly 200 underlined the current high level of interest in this subject. Judging from the people that I spoke to, almost all of them must have represented organizations that had begun projects of their own or were seriously considering doing so. The conference, held in November 1993, ran for 2 days. It was jointly organized by Business Intelligence and the Business Re-engineering Special Interest Group of the Strategic Planning Society. The introduction wasgiven by the conference chairman, Rohit Talwar (chairman, Business Re-engineering Special Interest Group). Rohit established the relevance of process redesign initiatives now and the need for business transformation as one way to surmount the diverse competitive and financial pressures that we are all experiencing. This theme was returned to by speaker after speaker throughout the conference. A wide range of organizations contributed from the financial sector (Aetna Life, CIGNA, Birmingham Midshires Building Society, Barclays Bank, Prudential and National & Provincial), the manufacturing sector (BP, British Alcan Aluminium, Zeneca Agrochemicals, Pilkington Optronics and Baxi), transport (American Airlines), telecommunications (BT), R&D (International Research and Development), the public sector (The Contributions Agency and Post Office Counters) and services (Reuters and IBM). Two presentations were on experiences from the United States by very different contributors: Mark Maletz, a consultant on business process design advising American Airlines, and Joseph Matejek from the Aetna Life insurance company.",

    "abstract": "This extract describes the principles of the advanced programming techniques involved in decision making. Such principles are founded in mathematical logic and are an example of the way in which robotics demands a knowledge of a wide variety of disciplines. Automated decision making in the context of robotics can adopt many aspects. At the most obvious level, a robot may have to plan a sequence of actions on the basis of signals obtained from changing conditions in its environment. These signals may be quite complex, for example the input of visual information from a television camera.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Software Development to Support Organizational and Business process Change: A Case Study Account",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the issues of software development in situations of organizational and process change. There is wide agreement in the literature that organizations have to be increasingly flexible in order to survive in the current economic climate. They must innovate, replicate, adapt and extemporize. As they do so, the requirements they have of their software applications are likely to change. Equally, as new software solutions are provided, new opportunities for business change arise. The situation is made still more complex because even if the needs of organizations were stable, we still could not be certain of the validity of an application's functions. This is because the process of program development is inherently uncertain. From this situation arise difficult, practical challenges for those concerned with the deployment of software in organizations. Starting with a consideration of the nature of organizations themselves, this paper takes looks at these problems by moving between three related points. It looks at software development methodologies and suggests that these have in the past tended to assume that discrete IT solutions can be cast for a ‘steady state’ which the organization is attempting to achieve. From the second vantage point it looks at the role of IT staff in supporting the operational needs of the organization. The third is the nature of software systems themselves. </jats:p>",

To fill these gaps, we consider the antecedents of workplace cyberbullying under the theoretical lens of the general theory of crime and routine activities theory. We build a model incorporating low self-control, a widely discussed perpetrator trait in criminology theories, with three types of routine activities representing the unique occurrence context for workplace cyberbullying—mWork, boundary-spanning in enterprise social media, and proactive email checking. We tested our model with 2025 employees in the United States. Our findings demonstrate that low self-control and the three routine activities are strong motivators for workplace cyberbullying. Our findings further show that the effect of low self-control on workplace cyberbullying is amplified by the three routine activities. The study contributes to our understanding of why workplace cyberbullying occurs and offers potential implications for managers interested in reducing incidences of workplace cyberbullying in their organization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper addresses the human resource issues associated with the implementation of IT into the Production facilities of a company operating in the process industry. The primary focus of the research is a field study based on a questionnaire issued to the process workers who would be most affected by the changes. Management was initially concerned that resistance to change could pose a significant problem. In this respect there was particular concern that the age and background profile of the workforce could exacerbate any underlying tendency to change resistance. This paper evaluates the background to these concerns and illustrates how this particular organization dealt with them. The questionnaire results indicated a very low level of initial familiarity with any form of computer based technology. Nonetheless the results indicated a very positive response to the IT implementation proposals with virtually no evidence of attitudinal rigidity. In this sense, the results broadly support many of the observations revealed in the literature. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of electronic mail and the non-use of an accounting information system (IS) by a group of executives at a major telecommunications company provided the opportunity of exploring the reasons why executives use information technology (IT). The paper draws on qualitative and quantitative research data to give a holistic and integrative explanation. This is based on the perceptions of executives and is interpreted through a wide range of prior research which incorporates media richness theory, social interaction theories and technology acceptance modelling. The case study draws particular attention to the concept of media style. Structuration theory is used to draw together the several factors which are to be found in the existing literature and in the case study. Individual action and structure interacted to create the changing conditions which typify the context for executive use of IT at the case study site. The structure comprises IT itself, task and social and technological factors. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From Traditional EDI to Internet-Based EDI: Managerial Considerations",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional EDI/VAN technology has been used for almost three decades and has brought its users significant advantages resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. However, implementation constraints have restricted the technology to predominantly large corporations, thus limiting EDI's reach to a broader base of small suppliers and customers. Internet-based EDI, with significantly fewer implementation constraints, can play an important role in extending EDI benefits to a wider spectrum of businesses. Recently published articles reflect a reluctance on the part of traditional EDI users to adopt this new communication modality. The reasons for this reluctance include the newness of the Internet technology, potential Internet legislation and lack of Internet standards plus the reliability and security of data transmission within the Internet environment. This paper examines these management issues and describes existing and potential solutions available to both new and traditional EDI users. Since few companies have embraced Internet-based EDI, this paper concludes with some successful Internet EDI-based cases. Along with these cases, the authors present a very broad description of the nature of the products and services currently available in the market today to support Internet-based EDI. </jats:p>",

We initially deal with the issue of social data and the role it plays in the current data revolution. The massive involvement of lay publics as instrumented by social media breaks with the strong expert cultures that have underlain the production and use of data in modern organizations. It also sets apart the interactive and communicative processes by which social data is produced from sensor data and the technological recording of facts. We further discuss the significance of the very mechanisms by which big data is produced as distinct from the very attributes of big data, often discussed in the literature. In the final section of the paper, we qualify the alleged importance of algorithms and claim that the structures of data capture and the architectures in which data generation is embedded are fundamental to the phenomenon of big data. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Operational Capabilities Development in Mediated Offshore Software Services Models",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper expands theoretical and empirical understanding of capabilities development in the mediated offshore outsourcing model whereby a small or a medium-sized firm delivers offshore software services to a larger information technology firm that in turn contracts and interfaces with the actual end-client onshore firms. Such a mediated model has received little prior research attention, although it is common particularly among Chinese firms exporting services to Japan, the largest export market for Chinese software services. We conducted case studies in four China-based software companies to understand the mechanisms used to develop their operational capabilities. We focused on client-specific, process, and human resources capabilities that have been previously associated with vendor success. We found a range of learning mechanisms to build the capabilities in offshore firms. Results show that the development of human resources capabilities was most challenging in the mediated model; yet foundational for the development of the other capabilities. This paper contributes to the information systems literature by improving our understanding of the development of operational capabilities in small- and medium-sized Chinese firms that deploy the mediated model of offshore software services. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to highlight the relevance of a cultivation approach with the goal of exploring the concrete implications it may have for public administrations (PA) involved in projects of organisational change. We suggest that adopting an approach to change that reflects the cultivation perspective is an unavoidable choice for PA, much more so than it is for the corporate world. The claim is that public-sector organisations design and implement organisational solutions that find it hard to move away from the ‘maintenance’ logic of legacy systems. Compared with the rational perspective, which is geared entirely to establishing optimal relations between means and ends, the cultivation approach enables us to make valuable advances at the interpretive level. We argue that the value of the processual and incremental perspective can be useful in creating a more realistic and less illusory reconstruction of the relationship between technological change and organisational change. In this paper, we discuss how combining policy studies with ICT social studies can help empower the cultivation logic, originating new tools for analysing and evaluating e-government results. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we are concerned with the features of information infrastructure development strategy, the social determinants for a country to choose a strategy and the principles of its design. We investigate China's telecommunications market transformation over the last two decades. China's experience is interesting as it is a case par excellence of a large transitory economy. We observe that China's national strategy was based on multiple social elements, not on technological prerogatives alone. This suggests that a national strategy for infrastructure construction should be derived from carefully considering both the technological options available as well as the social and political environment and the situation in the market structure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Global virtual teams are playing an increasingly important role in international business by offering organizations the opportunity for reaching beyond traditional boundaries. However, their use has outpaced our understanding of their dynamics and unique characteristics. For example, global, multicultural, interorganizational, virtual teams and the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) present real and compelling challenges to facilitators, but they also present teams with unparalleled opportunities for expanding on perspectives, approaches and ideas. However, crossing organizational, cultural and time and distance boundaries requires training, experience and organizational support. While research shows that the development of personal relationships between virtual team members is an important factor in effective working relationships, little research has been conducted on the effects of crossing organizational, cultural and time and distance boundaries on relationship building in virtual teams. This paper reports on a field study of New Zealand-based virtual team facilitators working with boundary-spanning virtual teams. From a facilitator's perspective, boundary-crossing issues (organizational, cultural, language and time and distance) can affect relationship building in many important ways. For instance, facilitators found that organizational boundary crossing was affected by differing organizational cultures and policies, while working across cultures required awareness and adjustment in relationship-building expectations and strategies. Crossing time and distance barriers necessitated the skilful use of synchronous and asynchronous ICTs and communication channels. These findings will be explored and the implications for practice and research will also be discussed. </jats:p>",

Mobile broadband will provide a means for moving seamlessly between the office, home and beyond, potentially blurring organizational and community boundaries and likely contributing to ongoing changes in both individual and public behaviours. The continued rollout of broadband infrastructure and growing levels of access to this infrastructure is making possible new forms of e-commerce and mobile commerce. But how will the potential for dramatic changes in daily life, the workplace and learning be realized? There is an extraordinary level of interest in broadband technologies from industry, government and potential users. Many governments are committed to extending broadband networks as a national priority (BAG, 2003; National Broadband Task Force, 2001; Office of the e-Envoy, 2001; Task Force on Broadband Communications, 2002). This high level of interest is explained by the understanding that broadband is seen by these nations as integral to achieving their electronic commerce goals and bringing social and economic benefits to their citizens (ITU, 2003; OECD, 2002). While there is much attention on broadband deployment, pricing and access in the policy domain, there is little research, particularly in the IS discipline that looks more deeply into the uses and roles of broadband and mobile infrastructures. While there have been studies on policies and deployment at the national level, business and consumer perspectives are noticeably absent. For example, how can broadband be adopted by residential customers and SMEs at a faster pace, what impact does broadband have on individuals’ daily lives (work, entertainment, education, healthcare etc.) and will the enhanced connectivity through broadband increase e-commerce transactions? These are only a few of the questions we need to address. This special issue on broadband Internet and electronic commerce was initiated to respond to these questions. There are four papers, which vary in research method, research subject, unit of analysis and geographical focus (Table 1). Interestingly, and understandably, all four papers come from the world’s most advanced broadband markets. South Korea is the leading country in broadband deployment with more than 70% of the households connected through broadband; Canada is second, while the United States has one of the largest subscriber bases. In terms of the unit of analysis, two of the papers focus on individuals, while the other two have a wider focus – one examines communities and the final paper presents analysis at the national level. The two papers focusing on individuals use experimental and survey research methods; the other two use interviews and focus groups. While all four papers are based on empirical work, two papers further extend their findings to make a provocative argument (Middleton) and to apply the stakeholder analysis (Choudrie, Papazafeiropoulou and Lee). The first paper, by Middleton, challenges a commonly held view that a killer application should be found in order to spur widespread adoption of broadband. Based on an early broadband project (the Netcom Trial in Canada) and recent studies on consumer broadband usage, Middleton argues that access to broadband itself, and the enhanced connectivity it offers, are valuable for users. Thus, there is no need for so-called killer applications, such as video-on-demand. Enhanced connectivity will lead to shifts in the dynamics of broadband development in a way that more users become content creators and distributors. Therefore, broadband researchers and stakeholders need to explore the implications of these changes, rather than hold on to the unfounded search for a killer application. The second paper, by Adelaar, Chang, Lancendorfer, Lee and Morimoto, presents a counter-intuitive result regarding broadband impact on user’s buying behaviours. They report on an experiment where three different media formats of web pages (text of the lyrics only, still images from a music video and the music video, all three with a song played simultaneously) were compared in relation Editorial: Broadband Internet and Electronic Commerce",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Webservices (WSs) are believed to be among the key technologies to enable the transformation of current static supply chains into dynamic virtual networks of enterprises. Others have said that these technologies are not yet ready for large-scale applications to supply chains and propose ‘traditional’ cross-enterprise integration methods. However, there is currently little research available that objectively evaluates the usefulness of WSs to enable smart business networks. In this study, this question is addressed through developing a typical scenario in which we transform a static supply chain into a ‘loosely coupled’ business network. We implement the scenario using state-of-the-art ‘enterprise application integration’ and WSs orchestration technology. The comparison of these alternative approaches reveals that WSs technology has some clear advantages above enterprise integration technology currently in use. However, there are also some limitations and research issues which are presented as a future research agenda for WSs technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Financialization describes a phenomenon whereby financial markets assume an increasingly dominant role within the economy. This paper seeks to dissect the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in financialization by following a cross-disciplinary approach across finance, economics and information systems. Accordingly, we develop a general framework describing the relationship between ICT and financialization. This framework allows us to investigate the recent rise of online marketplaces for credit. Consequently, ICT is not only facilitating, but fundamentally driving a disintermediation of banks through advances in computing, communication and information technology. We also provide supporting evidence from interviews with almost 40 senior experts and C-level executives. Interestingly, only rather recent innovations have enabled the popularity of marketplace lending, such as cloud computing, big data, scalable IT infrastructures and comprehensive ecosystems of programming interfaces. In contrast, we observe a slow integration of advanced analytics in the field of risk management. Based on our analysis, the paper also discusses cross-country implications for marketplace lending, financialization and regulation. </jats:p>",

Compatibility is also significant, however, with regard to value compatibility between the organisation, and the adopted IT innovation. We propose a framework to determine value compatibility analysing the organisation's and information system's structure, practices and culture, and explore the value compatibility of an organisation with its adopted self-service computer-based information system. A case study was conducted to determine the congruence of an organisation's value and IT value compatibility. This study found that there was a high correspondence in the organisational structure and practice dimensions; however, there were organisational culture disparities. The cultural disparities reflected the self-service acceptance and training issues experienced by the case organisation. These findings add insight into the problems experienced with value compatibility and the adoption of the information systems, and show the potential use of the proposed framework in the detection of such problems. </jats:p>",

This paper takes a closer look at one of the primary issues raised when supporting the management of knowledge: how to understand the role of knowledge classification and codification as means for further organizational learning and innovation. Two manufacturing cases are analysed using particular perspectives from current theories on classification, namely the management of knowledge and organizational innovation. It is concluded that a more complex understanding of the interplay between cognitive and community models for knowledge management as informed by research on the social processes of classification can inform our understanding of both the role of classification of knowledge for organizational innovation and the viability of providing ICT support based on codified knowledge. </jats:p>",

The professional criterion to deal with these degrees of freedom is cost minimization. However, a scientific approach has been rarely applied to cost minimization and a rigorous verification of professional design guidelines is still lacking. The methodological contribution of this paper is the representation of complex infrastructural design issues as a single cost-minimization problem. The approach to cost-minimization is empirically verified with a database of costs that has also been built as part of this research. The paper shows how an overall cost-minimization approach can provide significant cost reductions and indicates that infrastructural design rules previously identified by the professional literature can lead to sub-optimal solutions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article complements a paper in an earlier special issue of this volume of the Journal of Information Technology which was entitled ‘What Does it Mean to be “Critical” in IS Research?’ That paper conducted a preliminary review of the state of critical thinking in the fields of information systems (IS) and organization. In addressing the question ‘what is critical research?’ it showed how its definition has changed and broadened over time. This paper follows on by opening up some key questions relating to why researchers in IS should view critical research as having a valuable contribution to make. It begins by considering the apparently wide range of researchers for whom critical research has become an activity. Noting earlier calls for more empirical research, the paper looks at some examples of specific empirical applications. This leads us to consider how critical research impacts upon actual IS praxis, in particular the role of the IS professional, systems development and changes in the nature of organizational life itself. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the literature. Rather by drawing upon a sample of material covering a range of perspectives it aims to give an impression of the many developments in critical studies on organization and IS and to consider their implications for future direction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This case describes the implementation and subsequent failure of an innovative system installed in the bars of Alvalade XXI, the recently built football stadium in Lisbon, Portugal. Casa XXI, the company running the bars, had entrusted the project to an IT supplier who had limited experience with large systems. During the inauguration, the system failed spectacularly creating a chaotic situation. The fiasco meant not only a financial loss, but also a blow to the reputation of the company. The management blamed the supplier for the failure. The supplier, however, claimed that the problem was not technical but organizational, that is, poor planning of operations. Subsequent tests were inconclusive and failed to restore trust. At the end of the case, the CEO is considering the possibility to switch to an alternative supplier. He also wonders what they could have done to manage the project and the associated risks more effectively. The case highlights risk and project management issues in large systems implementations. The discussion can be structured around cost/benefit analysis, risk assessment, and project management. Relevant dimensions include: company operations, project scope, degree of innovation, technology used, system architecture, supplier selection, and project organization. In addition, the case raises governance questions: Who is responsible for the project? Even if the project is outsourced, how should the roles and responsibilities be apportioned between the company and the IT supplier(s)? What mechanisms should be used to plan and execute IT projects, and control their risks? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article deals with the increasing computerization of the financial markets and the consequences of such process on our ability to collect information about financial prices. The concept of information is at the heart of financial economics simply because this notion is a precondition for all investments. Since financial prices characterize an agreement on a transaction between two counterparties, they understandably became a key informational indicator for decision. This article will analyse the increasing computerization of financial sphere by discussing the recent emergence of what is called a “flash crash” and its impact on the traditional ways of collecting information in finance (technical analysis, fundamental analysis and statistical approach). I argue that the growing computerization of financial markets generated a “hyper-reality” in which financial prices do not refer to “something” anymore implying a revision of our usual way of defining/using the notion of information. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Formal models of business processes are used for a variety of purposes. But where the elicitation of the characteristics of a business process usually takes place in a collaborative fashion, the building of the final, formal process model is done mostly by a single person. This article presents the design and Implementation of a Recommendation-Based Process Modeling Support System with ‘social features.’ A process builder using this system will receive recommendations to complete or edit a formal business process model on the basis of previous usage of modeling fragments by her peers. Such features potentially Improve the modeling process and, as such, the modeling outcome, that is, the quality of the process model. This article also contains an evaluation of the system's usage and effectiveness, which builds on an experimental design. It is shown that process builders are inclined to follow up on the provided recommendations and that this will improve the semantical quality of the created model. However, Information on peer usage of modeling fragments does not play a big role in selecting the recommendations being followed up. This article fits within a stream of research that puts emphasis on the modeling process, rather than on the model artifact. </jats:p>",

The data are often no more than microscopic log entries generated by the elements of an information infrastructure or system. Although such records may represent a variety of things outside the system, their powers go beyond the capacity to carry semantic content. In this article, we harness critical realism to explain how such data come to matter in specific business operations. We analyse the production of an advertising audience from data tokens extracted from a telecommunications network. The research is based on an intensive case study of a mobile network operator that tries to turn its subscribers into an advertising audience. We identify three mechanisms that shape data-based production and three properties that characterize the underlying pool of data. The findings advance the understanding of many organizational settings that are centred on data processing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although scientometrics is seeing increasing use in Information Systems (IS) research, in particular for evaluating research efforts and measuring scholarly influence; historically, scientometric IS studies are focused primarily on ranking authors, journals, or institutions. Notwithstanding the usefulness of ranking studies for evaluating the productivity of the IS field's formal communication channels and its scholars, the IS field has yet to exploit the full potential that scientometrics offers, especially towards its progress as a discipline. This study makes a contribution by raising the discourse surrounding the value of scientometric research in IS, and proposes a framework that uncovers the multi-dimensional bases for citation behaviour and its epistemological implications on the creation, transfer, and growth of IS knowledge. Having identified 112 empirical research evaluation studies in IS, we select 44 substantive scientometric IS studies for in-depth content analysis. The findings from this review allow us to map an engaging future in scientometric research, especially towards enhancing the IS field's conceptual and theoretical development. </jats:p>",

The sample comprised 664 IT professionals working in several internet (portal) companies in Turkey. Results suggest that women, married employees, employees who have children less than five years old, employees whose house is big enough, employees whose house is relatively farther to the workplace, and those who perceived more advantages accruing from telecommuting, to themselves, to their organization or to the society, have a more favorable attitude towards telecommuting. On the other hand, employees who perceived more disadvantages accruing from telecommuting to themselves or their organization have a less favorable attitude towards telecommuting. In addition, colleague support and technological-bill support positively influence the attitudes of employees towards telecommuting. </jats:p>",

It is therefore important for the management of such corporations to improve the control and coordination of the corporations’ spatially dispersed subsidiaries. Information technology (IT) has been hailed as an important tool in changing traditional control and coordination processes in complex environments. This paper presents the results of a study that examined the role of IT in the control and coordination of pan-national corporation subsidiaries in Ireland. The findings indicate that IT is being used for changing the nature of the relationship between headquarters and subsidiaries in a manner that makes the pan-national corporation more global in orientation. This is occurring as operations and decision-making processes in subsidiaries are redesigned in order to improve global management and local responsiveness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ERP systems are increasingly accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). If the potential benefits of these systems are significant, the same applies to the risk associated with their implementation. A number of authors emphasize that IS risk management is most effective when it is initiated at the earliest possible moment in the system's lifecycle, that is, at the adoption phase. But how do SMEs actually manage the risk of ERP implementation during the ERP adoption process? The research objectives are (1) to identify and describe the influence of the SMEs’ context on their implementation risk exposure, and (2) to understand whether and how, within the adoption process, SMEs actually manage the risk of implementing an ERP system supplied by an ERP vendor, with open source software, or through in-house development. In order to do so, four case studies of SMEs having implemented an ERP system were undertaken. The study shows that to manage risk at the adoption stage, SMEs can proceed in a rather intuitive, informal and unstructured manner, that is explicitly based however upon an architecture of basic principles, policies and practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we offer a critique of The National Programme for Information Technology’ (NPfIT) currently being undertaken in the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. We begin by offering a brief introduction to the project. Next, we review the lessons learned from a wide range of experience with IT and business change projects and comment on why changes in the NHS are likely to be harder than in most other organizations. We then elaborate the implications of these ideas and identify potential areas for change, with particular focus on the current guiding mindset that this project is about the provision of a technical infrastructure. We argue that this is, thus far, a technology project and question whether the current strategy is the most appropriate way forward to achieve service improvements. We suggest changes in the underlying mindset, along with the leadership, ownership, metrics and labelling of the project. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the role of insurer and broker expectations in achieving long-term benefit success from electronic trading in the insurance industry. The paper highlights the importance of intra- and inter-organisational expectations with the implementation of electronic data intercharge, as a major electronic trading initiative within the insurance industry. A benefits management model is conceptualised to explore the effects of competitive stimuli and depict the technology management response of insurers and brokers within the case study. The model highlights the importance of managing benefits and expectations in developing long-term partnerships for the successful implementation of electronic trading. The technology management response among key stakeholders and the roles of communication, coordination and support during the implementation phase are also discussed. Finally, a number of lessons are recommended, which should be of use to practitioners and concluding remarks indicate areas for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, enterprise system (ES) software markets have been very dynamic. While contemporary customers are increasingly seeking ES solutions that require less and less customization and implementation effort, it is unclear whether all ES providers should take the ‘vertical’ path of offering functionality tailored to specific industries. Given the lack of conceptualization that explores ES markets’ segmentation, this paper offers a typology of generic verticalization strategies. Building on the resource-based view of the firm and the dynamic capabilities perspective, we match ES providers’ organizational characteristics of size and scope with the most effective verticalization strategy. A dynamic dimension is introduced to this framework by analyzing recommended strategies for market entry and growth. Finally, the applicability of the exploratory framework is illustrated using examples from the customer relationship management (CRM) software market. </jats:p>",

However, a large percentage of network users do not recognize any bottom line improvements that can result from ISDN nor do they know how to exploit the benefits of the technology. This study evaluates and summarizes the ISDN implementation experiences of nine organizations that are currently using ISDN. Along with their experiences, the study also investigated potential problems and critical success factors associated with ISDN implementation. Understanding these critical issues provides IS management with new insight, enabling them to strategically expedite their ISDN implementation and diffusion. </jats:p>",

The conference features research and case research tracks, as well as panels. New this year are a crossing boundaries theme track and a teaching case track. For general questions about the conference, please contact one of the Program Co-Chairs Rudy Hirschheim (rudy@uh.edu), or Mike Newman (mike.newman@man.ac.uk). The Journal has a planned theme issue on Interpretive Research in Information Systems. This is guest edited by Michael Myers, University of Auckland, and Geoff Walsham, University of Cambridge, and will be published in December 1998. Pleasingly, we have received over twenty submissions for this theme issue, indicating the great interest in this topic and the healthy amount of research being carried out in the interpretivist tradition. The Journal of Information Technology has always welcomed submissions from different research traditions, and hopefully this theme issue will be a small part of the bigger process of obtaining wider publication for diverse approaches to studying information systems. The Journal will also be publishing a theme issue based on selected papers developed from the Sixth European Conference on Information Systems held at Aix-en-Provence, France, June 4th ± 6th, 1998. The objective is to give a fast track to a limited number of ECIS98 papers into a refereed international Journal such as JIT. Theme issues developed from selected papers from ECIS99 and ECIS2000 are also scheduled for other leading Journals.",

    "title": "Towards a Taxonomy of Information Systems: Or Does Anyone Need a Taxi?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many academic and practical traditions have been brought to bear upon the field of business information systems in an attempt to understand a rapidly changing subject. The insights provided by traditional disciplines to an essentially multi-disciplinary subject is essential and very healthy. However, there is a danger of proliferating many different, overlapping frameworks of information systems. There is a need to review the frameworks and suggest a way of integrating several approaches. The future research effort depends upon a consistent set of data being available and discussed. This paper reviews previous frameworks used to promote the understanding and discussion of information systems. The one-dimensional approach is rejected in favour of a three-dimensional approach built around three basic questions characterized as the three Ts. What tasks does the information system have to perform? What technology can best deliver the systems? In what timeframe are we operating? The paper concludes by suggesting an integrated taxonomy, based on the three Ts as the basis for future research and discussion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While information technology has been recognized as critically important for supporting global business strategy, the contingent relationships between salient dimensions of an information technology and key sources of competitive advantage have not been systematically explicated and discussed in the literature. Instead, a universal view of the role of information technology in developing competitive advantage for a firm is often adopted. Taking a contingency perspective, this paper more systematically examines the links among global business strategies, global information technologies (GIT) and competitive advantage within an integrative framework. Additionally, the issue of sustainability of GIT-based competitive advantages is addressed using the conceptual tool kits of the I/O (industrial organization)-based and resource-based theories of strategic management. The proposed conceptual model provides an encompassing framework for future research on the increasingly important topic of global information technology and its potential to generate competitive advantage for firms. </jats:p>",

The case study and the ETHICS methodology are then compared and contrasted in an attempt to gain greater insight into user participation and to understand why the implementation was successful. Furthermore, techniques of software process modelling are applied to both ETHICS and the case study with the intention of more closely defining the user participation process and potentially also guiding it in future developments. The case study is used as a vehicle both to examine user participation and also to investigate the modelling of user participation. </jats:p>",

The significance of the effect of user involvement varies for users based on their organizational function. Technical users are less satisfied with MIS than administrative users.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While recent surveys suggest that capital budgeting systems in business organizations continue to become more formalized and sophisticated, a constraint on the use of sophisticated capital budgeting techniques seems to be the degree of support provided by firms’ capital budgeting information systems (CABIS). This paper, based on a survey of 146 large firms, outlines the current status of CABIS and their usage pattern. It was found that although two-thirds of sample firms have specific computer application systems for capital budgeting, most CABIS are relatively unsophisticated and less than adequate in providing the information and decision support capabilities required to use sophisticated capital budgeting techniques effectively. In particular, the barrier and problems encountered in the use of probabilistic risk analysis were explored. Implications of these findings are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A multi-sided platform can only succeed if a critical mass of users can join. This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a platform's success. However, there is a limited understanding of the factors that contribute to reaching such critical mass. In this study we identify ways to determine the market potential of a platform and to reach critical mass. We particularly enrich past studies by exploring how the openness of a platform influences market potential. We examine openness at three levels – provider, technology, and user level – and ask the question: to what extent can opening (or closing) each level increase or decrease a platform's market potential? The provider level recognizes the strategic involvement of key stakeholders that provide a platform. The technology level is concerned with the interoperability of a platform across different technologies. The user level relates to what extent a platform discriminates different segments of the customer base. On the basis of analytical modeling and theoretical analysis, we formulate four propositions concerning the effects of openness on platforms’ market potential. We illustrate the strength of propositions through a confirmatory case study, which is informed by five theoretically sampled cases. The cases illustrate cogently the effects of opening different levels of a multi-sided platform. In conclusion, we propose a decision model that can assist decision making concerning the opening of a platform to catalyze its growth. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Managing Technological Change in the Digital Age: The Role of Architectural Frames",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Inspired by Herbert Simon's notion of nearly decomposable systems, researchers have examined modularity as a powerful approach to manage technological change in product innovation. We articulate this approach as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications before production and therefore only allow limited windows of functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher Alexander's notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and network-of-patterns as frames to support innovation of digitized products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address key challenges in innovating digitized products. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Prior research on digital ecosystems focuses on the focal firm (e.g., a platform owner) and its ecosystem governance. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the non-focal actor, that is, an ecosystem participant who is at the periphery of a digital ecosystem. This paper proposes a theoretical perspective of the non-focal firm's participation across digital ecosystems for cultivating its innovation habitat through capability search and redeem. Capability search involves the location of external capability deemed valuable for extending the firm's innovation habitat. Capability redeem refers to the firm's use of external capability to develop, distribute, and/or monetize its products and services. We generate and sensitize the proposed perspective in the context of Sony Ericsson's innovation habitat by interpreting the mobile device manufacturer's participation across four digital ecosystems (Visual Basic, Java, Digital Music, and Android). Our findings suggest that the non-focal actor cannot rely on a single ecosystem for addressing all relevant layers of innovation. It benefits from pursuing a pluralistic strategy, operating across digital ecosystems to avoid investing all efforts in the same ecosystem. The model of ecosystem capability search and redeem, which is a result of ideographic research explanation, extends current perspectives on digital ecosystems and contributes to the emerging literature in the digital age. </jats:p>",

    "title": "On Emergence and Forcing in Information Systems Grounded Theory Studies: The Case of Strauss and Corbin",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Grounded theory method (GTM), which has been increasingly used in the information systems (IS) field, is a contested method. GTM has even been viewed as a family of methods by Antony Bryant and Kathy Charmaz in the respected ‘Handbook of Grounded Theory’. One debate that is of particular relevance is about the metaphor of ‘emergence’ and the most basic rule of GTM - that researchers should not force preconceived conceptualizations on data. This debate has its origins in a dispute between the two co-founders of grounded theory, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss. Glaser criticized Strauss for the introduction of the stage of axial coding and the use of one single coding paradigm. In his view, the paradigm is too rigid, forces data, hinders emergence, and leads to conceptual description instead of grounded theory. It is perhaps surprising then, that this debate has so far been conducted without any empirical evidence in support of the proposition that the Strauss and Corbin version of grounded theory might result in forcing. In this article, we analyse IS studies in top journals where Straussian grounded theory procedures - which have found most adherents in the IS discipline - are utilized. We provide detailed insights into the use and the impact of axial coding and the coding paradigm. We find that the researchers’ use of Straussian coding procedures in the IS field is on a level that is conscious and deliberative. We relate our findings to the broader debate about the contested nature of GTM, and find that axial coding and the coding paradigm are an exemplar that shows that GTM is an evolving method that is subject to idiosyncratic interpretations and flexible deployment. Our findings, we argue, are in line with the more recent development of constructivist grounded theory that holds that grounded theories are not discovered, they are constructed, based on conscious decisions and interpretive acts. We also put forward three propositions, and five guidelines, intended to assist IS researchers in constructing grounded theories using Straussian coding procedures, while adhering to the primacy of avoiding preconceptions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Metaverse has become a buzz-phrase among tech businesses. Facebook’s rebranding to Meta is symptomatic of this. Many firms and other actors are trying to shape visions of the Metaverse, leading to confusion about the term’s meaning. We use social construction of technology (SCOT) theory to disentangle the conflicting notions proposing that what the Metaverse is and will become relies on the collective sensemaking processes. We point out similarities and differences between various concepts presented in the public media and link them to individual actors’ monetary, political, or social motives. We describe the tensions that occur because of the conflicting interests. As the Metaverse is an emerging phenomenon, opportunities exist to reorient it toward humanist values rather than singular interests. However, the complexity of the social processes that shape the Metaverse requires a considerate approach rather than premature conclusions about the Metaverse’s characteristics. The analysis presents the Metaverse as a new, continually evolving sociotechnical phenomenon, and calls for research that explores it as a dynamic, moving target. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Digital Platform: A Research Agenda",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life? </jats:p>",

The quality of software criteria are based on success in the market place, i.e. a larger user base and some special merit. All the old favourites in WP and spreadsheets are included. Its usefulness lies in the clarity of presentation, the provision ofprices and addresses ofdistributors and minimum specification data.

    "title": "IT’s a matter of trust: Literature reviews and analyses of human trust in information technology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Trust is one of the most important constructs for understanding the adoption of information technologies (IT). In this paper, we review and analyze two literatures on the construct of human trust in IT artifacts and in the entities that source, operate, and govern IT. The first literature review focuses on defining of the construct of trust across a range of disciplines. Our analysis of this literature identified 13 assumptions about the nature of trust. The assumptions illustrate the complexities of human trust. The second literature review focused on 214 empirical studies of the construct of trust published in the AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Eight journals. We analyze this literature to identify IS scholar’s most common assessments of trust from qualitative studies and most common measures of trust from quantitative studies. As a cumulative body of knowledge, IS scholars have deeply examined the multidimensional aspect of trust by examining different types of trust, including affective trust, cognitive trust, institutional trust, instrumental trust, intrinsic trust, knowledge-based trust, relational trust, swift trust, disposition to trust, trusting beliefs, and more. IS scholars have also extensively examined the assumption that trust is dynamic, as evidenced by the many qualitative papers that examined trust as a process. Our review also finds that IS scholars have conducted extensive research examining trust in Web2 technologies, which are characterized by centralized applications and centralized governance. While the IS scholarly community has established a substantial tradition around the construct of trust, there is still interesting work to be done. With recent releases of open generative AI and with the rise of Web3 technologies like blockchains that purport to be “trustless,” the construct of trust in IT needs to be re-examined in these emerging contexts. We also encourage more research on trust in bi-directional relationships, on the limits of transitive trust, and on the construct of distrust. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we focus on the growing evidence of unintended harmful societal effects of automated algorithmic decision-making in transformative services (e.g. social welfare, healthcare, education, policing and criminal justice), for individuals, communities and society at large. Drawing from the long-established research on social pollution, in particular its contemporary ‘pollution-as-harm’ notion, we put forward a claim – and provide evidence – that these harmful effects constitute a new type of digital social pollution, which we name ‘algorithmic pollution’. Words do matter, and by using the term ‘pollution’, not as a metaphor or an analogy, but as a transformative redefinition of the digital harm performed by automated algorithmic decision-making, we seek to make it visible and recognized. By adopting a critical performative perspective, we explain how the execution of automated algorithmic decision-making produces harm and thus performs algorithmic pollution. Recognition of the potential for unintended harmful effects of algorithmic pollution, and their examination as such, leads us to articulate the need for transformative actions to prevent, detect, redress, mitigate and educate about algorithmic harm. These actions, in turn, open up new research challenges for the information systems community. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Implementing Interorganizational it Systems: Lessons from a Call Centre Project",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing power of computer-telephony integration (CTI) systems is encouraging many companies to create call centres. These deal with a growing range of business processes and, in doing so, can be used to challenge established organizational arrangements. The range of human and management issues that need to be dealt with has yet to become clear. Some insights into these are offered from a study of one call centre over 2 years, from shortly before its physical introduction to the present day. These empirical observations are set within the wider literature on organizational change and information technology (IT), particularly the processual and integrationist perspectives. The paper uses the evidence of the case to elaborate the integrationist model so that it reflects the areas of human action more fully. It concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for managers seeking to build effective call centres or other forms of interorganizational IT system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology is often used by senior management as an instrument to deliver strategy by influencing day-to-day activities within organisations. We study how local teams appropriate strategy through the use of technology, specifically in instances where it is rigid and single purposed. We show that technology has the potential to act as a carrier of strategic intent. We theorise local practices of appropriation of strategic intent by conceptualising the role of technology in ‘instantiation’, a notion adopted within the strategy-as-practice literature to explain how localised micro events directly constitute higher-level business outcomes such as those that arise from strategy. Through an in-depth case study following the use of passenger self-service kiosks in a UK airport over a period of 20 months, we review the strategic drivers at the top of the organisation and the central role of technology as the delivery mechanism of strategy. We focus on emergent strategising activity by local teams on the ground. Our main theoretical contributions are thus to extend the concept of instantiation to Information Systems studies and to conceptualise technology as a carrier of strategy, particularly in explaining how technology can embed strategic intent ( structural strategising) and then influence the emergence of local practices consistent with these objectives ( emergent strategising). We find and conceptualise how local practices instantiate strategic intent by decoupling, reframing and then recoupling new logics of work to achieve the aims set out in the organisation’s strategy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The integration of information systems (IS) is a phrase which is commonly used in both research and practice within the IS field and across many organizational contexts. This paper uses a historical review to explore how the image of integrated IS has been constructed, evolved over three decades and how this has resulted in the widespread acceptance of idealized goals and benefits. A literature search for an underlying theoretical basis for the concept of systems integration is made, highlighting a diversity of opinion. Two case studies are used to examine the meaning of integration relative to the images and ideals, theory and reality. The study concludes that there is an urgent need for better conceptual and theoretical models of integration to enable more effective discourse of the concept. These models must also encompass and include more diverse non-technical factors for the adoption of more complex forms of IS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Interpretive Research in Information Systems. This is guest edited by Michael Myers, University of Auckland, and Geoff Walsham, University of Cambridge, and will be published in December 1998. Pleasingly, we have received twenty-three submissions for this theme issue, indicating the great interest in this topic and the healthy amount of research being carried out in the interpretivist tradition. The Journal of Information Technology has always welcomed submissions from different research traditions, and hopefully this theme issue will be a small part of the bigger process of obtaining wider publication for diverse approaches to studying information systems. The Journal will also be publishing an issue based on selected papers developed from the Sixth European Conference on Information Systems held at Aix-enProvence, France, June 4th6th this year. The objective is to give a fast track to a limited number of ECIS98 papers into a refereed international Journal such as JIT. Theme issues developed from selected papers from ECIS99 and ECIS2000 are also scheduled for other leading Journals. The Journal is also scheduling a theme issue on electronic commerce and markets for the end of 1999. The call for papers has already been issued. Please contact Leslie Willcocks if further details are required. The main conference to take note of is the Nineteenth Annual International Conference on Information Systems, to be held this year in Helsinki, Finland on 13-16th December , 1998. The theme of the conference is ̀ Crossing Boundaries: Managing Virtual Enterprises’. The Conference features research and case research tracks, and also panels. New this year are a crossing boundaries theme track and a teaching case track. For general questions about this conference please contact one of the Program Co-Chairs Rudy Hirschheim (rudy@uh.edu), and Mike Newman (mike.newman@ man.ac.uk). The Journal will be publishing a Special Issue of case papers in 1999 developed from ICIS submissions to the new Teaching Case track being run at ICIS for the ® rst time in 1998. Following its very successful sixth running at Aix-enProvence attended by over 300 people from around Europe with a strong non-European attendance also ± the Seventh European Conference in Information Systems will be held in June 1999 in Copenhagen. The call for papers has already been issued and paper submissions are due for November 1998. Please contact Professor Niels Bjorn-Andersen at Copenhagen Business School for more details. This issue",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article formalizes an action principles approach for investigating and influencing the adoption of emerging information systems phenomena, particularly for new technologies. It draws upon recent research into robotic process and cognitive automation to demonstrate the concepts and methodology for a further mode of research into practice that is distinguishable from action research and design science. The authors present definitions, research assumptions, and evaluation criteria and provide a six-step process for generating a set of action principles, updatable by new empirical evidence. The process is illustrated by research into 22 automation cases that eventually arrived at 39 action principles for effective deployment of the automation technologies under review. The major objective is to provide guidelines to prospective researchers. A secondary objective is to provide major insights into the management of robotic process and cognitive automation. This provides opportunities for further theorization and research by academics, and more considered action by practitioners. The authors also discuss the value and limitations of the action principles approach, and how the knowledge generated can be disseminated. The article offers a way of doing research on the applied side of information systems that is timely, does justice to the phenomena under investigation, and provides insights for multiple parties. </jats:p>",

The experience of developing countries in introducing IT is reviewed. Based on the stage hypothesis model of growth in computing, a framework to analyse and predict EUC growth in the health sector of developing countries is described. Using the structure, people and technology parameters of the framework, benchmarks applicable to the health sector in developing countries for each stage are applied to case studies from the Asia-Pacific region. The utility of the framework in identifying key issues that need to be addressed in planning information systems in developing countries is presented. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Client/server computing is quickly becoming the computing architecture of choice in the 1990s. However, like many advances in information technology, public sources, such as trade journals and newspapers, portray client/server as a completely new paradigm which will transform our profession. But is it? We are conducting multiple case studies on organizations that have adopted client/server technology in order to extract managerial prescriptions for best practices in evaluating, developing and implementing effective client/server systems. Thus far, we have completed three case studies. Many of the lessons we are uncovering – the need for top management support, redesigning business processes before automation, user participation, phased implementation strategies and buying-in vendor skills to transfer learning – have been identified by previous researchers in other information technology contexts. Thus, although client/server is being touted as a radical change in information technology, practitioners need not discard the lessons from the past. Although there are some unique technical skills required to deploy client/server systems effectively, confirming project management lessons from the past is consoling to practitioners and academics alike. While the context of information technology changes rapidly, the organizational, administrative and policy practices are proving robust. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Information Systems Outsourcing in Theory and Practice",
    "abstract": "During the 1980s, American Airlines, American Hospital Supply (now Baxter), Merrill Lynch, and McKesson provided the exemplars for the management of information technology (IT). These companies testified to the competitive advantage which can be achieved through the successful exploitation of IT. A host of competitive advantage frameworks sought to formalize and further legitimate the strategic potential of IT (Ives and Learmouth, 1984; McFarlan, 1984; Porter and Millar, 1985; Feeny and Ives, 1989). In 1989, Kodak outsourced its IT functions to IBM, Businessland and DEC (Brown and Eckerson, 1990; Applegate and Montealegre, 1991; Hovey, 1991). This event publicized an alternative exemplar for the management of IT (Loh and Venkatraman, 1992a). Kodak was the first visible Fortune 500 company to argue that IT was primarily a commodity best handled by expert vendors, rather than a coveted strategic asset. Even Max Hopper American Airline's symbolic figurehead of the strategic potential of IT claimed in 1990 that the old models of competitive advantage no longer applied because IT is too easily replicated to create a sustainable competitive advantage (Hopper, 1990). Therefore senior executives should seek to minimize IT costs, perhaps by outsourcing to a third party vendor. The new examplars for IT management include British Petroleum, British Aerospace, Continental Bank, Continental Airlines, First Fidelity Bank, General Dynamics, the UK Inland Revenue, McDonnell Douglas, National Car Rental and Xerox (Harrar, 1993; Huber, 1993; Moad, 1993; Ganz, 1994; Melymuka, 1994). As more companies and public sector organizations jump on the outsourcing bandwagon, practitioners are gaining ample experiences of outsourcing 'successes' that lead to, for example, lower IT costs, increased service levels and more flexible IT management, as well as outsourcing 'failures' that lead perhaps to increasing IT costs, decreased service levels and/or inflexibility (see Lacity and Hirschheim (1993, 1995) and Willcocks and Fitzgerald (1994) for documented cases of outsourcing successes and failures). Enough evidence is now being accumulated to analyse and assess the practice through several theoretical perspectives. One possibility may be the eventual adoption of one common powerful theoretical perspective on outsourcing. Through this, academics and practitioners could well come to share a language to explain factors associated with successful and unsuccessful outsourcing experiences and so be able to provide guidelines for practice. It is clear however that we are some way from such an outcome. In practice, as the outsourcing market grows for third party management of IT assets and services estimated in the USA at US$ 49.5 billion revenues in 1994 so information systems outsourcing is increasingly becoming the subject of considerable debate amongst academics and practitioners alike. In this theme issue we seek to contribute to this debate by collecting together a range of new papers that together represent a significant advance in both theoretical and empirical work. Throughout we define IS outsourcing broadly as the handing over to third party management of IT/IS assets, resources and activities for required result. The definition in the Clark et al. paper complements this where they describe outsourcing as the delegation, through a contractual arrangement, of all or any part of the technical resources, the human resources and the management responsibilities associated with providing IT services to an external vendor.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Why is it that technology-enabled industry disruptions appear entirely inevitable with hindsight, yet practitioners in disrupted businesses typically struggle to detect and respond appropriately to disruption while it is unfolding? We term this surprising contradiction ‘interpretive discontinuity’ and use it to problematize the established understanding of disruption in the literature. We suggest that the contradiction at the heart of interpretive discontinuity holds an important key to what exactly changes during disruption and why. By juxtaposing an empirical case of disruption in the music industry with theoretical resources sensitive to the nature of radical change – Thomas Kuhn’s work in the unrelated field of scientific practice – we demonstrate that it is productive to understand disruption as a Kuhnian paradigm shift. We are then able to trace interpretive discontinuity to the gestalt switch in worldview that accompanies such a paradigm shift. This insight sheds new light on both what is actually ‘disruptive’ about disruption and also on the limitations of prior work theorizing disruption. Our work is important because it adds to the literature on disruptive innovation important yet overlooked conceptual tools in Kuhn’s work – the role of exemplars, the worldview aspect of a paradigm, and paradigm incommensurability. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Linking Strategic Information Systems Concepts to Practice: Systems Integration at the Portfolio Level",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Surveys during the past two decades have consistently shown that many of the most critical management concerns with information systems arise at the portfolio, rather than application, level. Architecture-driven planning with a view to the implementation of integrated information systems structures has been widely canvassed as a means of dealing with portfolio-level issues, particularly the problems of inconsistent data and uncoordinated processes which have affected many organizations in recent years. The benefits anticipated from this type of initiative have been such that many organizations have persisted with architecture-based strategies despite reports of high failure rates. This paper reports on some research into IS integration planning in the organization Telstra (formerly Telecom Australia)) during a period of 40 years. The research was conducted as an interpretive case study, with practitioners’ assessments and perspectives on IS planning being incorporated in the data analysis. The focus of the study was on four critical assumptions, which were identified during an initial review of the theoretical literature as having to hold true for an organization to expect success with this form of planning. The study revealed that none of these assumptions held reliably throughout the period studied, a point fundamental to understanding why relatively little progress was made towards published integration targets. The paper then canvasses the view that though traditionally understood as blueprints for implementation, information systems architectures could be reconceptualized as knowledge assets, with independent value as sources of core planning concepts. The conclusion drawn is that their use in this type of role could facilitate the achievement of many, if not all, of the benefits anticipated from more comprehensive approaches. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper will show how the UK banks learnt the strategic value of retaining IT expertise in-house through their experience of the design of EFTPOS networks. The banks began by attempting to ‘buy-in’ IT expertise from other organizations, but they were first compelled to locate expertise in a jointly-controlled organization called EFTPOS UK, then forced to develop the new IT expertise within their existing IT departments. These manipulations of the ‘organizational location’ of expertise gave individual banks the ability to create their own technology strategies, which they promptly exploited in an attempt to gain competitive advantage. It will be argued that a greater capacity to form individual technology strategies and exploit competitive advantage will result from the active management of two other dimensions of expertise: these are termed the internal location and the individual partition of expertise. The first term refers to where in the organization technical expertise is located and the second to how technical expertise is divided between individuals. The process by which the individual partition of expertise changes is called the hybridization of expertise and it is argued that although this is to an extent ‘natural’ it may certainly be managed. The case for a more aggressive and explicit expertise strategy, including the active management of the process of hybridization, is made by reference to the nature of the network design and practices in the management of technical expertise in other industries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology-enabled business process redesign is a means of levering the power of information technology to change organizational processes radically resulting in substantial improvements in corporate effectiveness and efficiency. Some of the greatest opportunities for organizational improvement using IT are associated with the support of processes that cross functional boundaries. In this search for improvement, it is important to recognize that there are both process risks associated with business process redesign and structural risks associated with crossing functional boundaries. This paper proposes a model that relates the risks and rewards of IT-enabled change and reports on the experience of 59 organizations. The study found that organizations tend to emphasize either cross-functional business process redesign or intrafunctional automation projects. The results suggest that corporations that wish to take advantage of the rewards available from information technology-enabled change should recognize the risks associated with cross-functional change and process redesign. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Information Strategies in Public Administration",
    "abstract": "This volume is based on a 1989 conference on informatization in public administration. Contributions come from a spread of European countries, France, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. By way of introduction, the editors identify four strategic approaches for the introduction of computerized information systems in public administration. These are the opportunity, issue, positioning and function approaches, which are developed further in subsequent chapters. They echo the different dimensions of public bureaucracies i.e. political, legal-ethical and organizational managerial. In examining the opportunity approach Lenk raises the question of why existing opportunities for improving public administration are not seized as they emerge. Van de Donk and Frissen outline preliminary observations on the strategic significance ofinformatization for innovative management in the public sector. Glover and O'Dwyer describe how IT can support administrative modernization, in the context of the OECD. They give a comprehensive overview ofthe potential effects ofIT in the public sector. The issue approach tends to be reactive, sought when problems arise. In this framework, Marcel Aucoin traces the development of the corporate plan for the Banque de France and the formulation of a data processing strategy. The positioning approach designates the jockeying for position which occurs between departments. Sally Wyatt identifies the influencing factors behind choices made by UK government departments for telecommunication networks. jens Hoff and Klaus Stormgaard, from a Danish perspective, test the 'reinforcement hypothesis'that information will strengthen existing organizational features serving the interest of the dominant power coalition(s). Although tested in two very different areas, a tax administration system and a social welfare system, the results confirmed the hypothesis. The tax case was clear-cut, the social welfare system less so, until distributed computing was available to mirror the decentralized structure. The functional approach deals with strategy formulation across different functional areas. Ignace Snellen differentiates between types of policy institutional, strategic, structural and operational, while examining the supporting role of information systems. The conflict between administrative policy and informatization strategy is demonstrated by an account of an office automation project in Germany. The last study is from Holland on the necessary cooperation between central government and local administration for the use of IT. The four approaches to strategy formulation are again described and illustrated. This is a theoretical work, although frequently supported by empirical evidence. Familiar themes prevail albeit in different geographical contexts and administrative arrangements such as the Operatie Comptabel Bestel, in the Netherlands in 1988, for the improvement of financial administration, with echoes of the earlier Financial Management Initiative in the UK. Anne Hohmann's recommendations for systems implementation following from the BAR project include a warning against over-reliance on external consultants, not least as it militates against what Willcocks and Harrow (1992) term 'inward learning' . Given the high level of theoretical content and the fact that many of the contributors come from backgrounds in political science or public administration, this book is clearly aimed at the academic sector. Even so, it is not an accessible text; at times the phrasing is somewhat awkward and stilted. The contributors have been illserved by their copy-editors, as typographical errors abound, in a variety of languages. This is inexcusable, given the high cost of the work. A reference to the Chapterwork Reduction Act (1980) in the United States (p. 12), is taken as meaning the Paperwork Reduction Act. While it may be apparent to the contributors, a definition of informatization would have been welcome as a benchmark. One assumes that it concerns both the use of IT and the dissemination of information. How then does it relate to information management? Given that the focus of the work is on informatization is there a nuance to be gleaned from one contributor's use of the term 'dataprocessing strategy' . The most accurate description of this work, unfortunately is frustrating. While it contains interesting and thought-provoking work, the poor presentation frequently jars. Perseverance is necessary, and is indeed rewarded at times. Comparative studies of the use of IT and information management issues in the public sector across Europe would be most welcome, whether from political science or information management viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Administrative reform currently being undertaken in a number of developing countries is focusing on the introduction of microcomputers as a tool for the decentralization of rural development administration. Experience to date concerning these efforts reveals that the key determinants of successful implementation of the technology are associated with organizational factors rather than hardware and software. However, these factors have been inadequately addressed in the literature on information technology in developing countries and empirical research drawing on experience of individual projects in developing countries is needed. </jats:p><jats:p> To this end, this paper describes the case of the Computerized Rural Information Systems Project (CRISP) which is a government initiative to promote decentralization of rural development management in India. The interaction between formal, government-approved guidelines for rural development management and informal practice at the local level is examined. The findings reveal that the diffusion of technology has not been accompanied with changes to local work, decision and administrative processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The determination of value of information or information systems is a basic issue for information management. In order to solve it several questions must be answered like: what is the object of valuation; how is value defined and measured; and what constitutes a coherent and usable method for valuation. In this paper an approach is outlined that combines the information commodity approach, activity-based costing, and graph modelling. The first is used to define the object of analysis (an information commodity) and the nature of value (the demand value at the marketplace). The third allows the modelling of business processes in terms of activities and cost relations between activities. The second enables the assignment of costs to activities modelled in the graph. Together they constitute a coherent and usable method for determining the value of IS. This is illustrated by means of a case study. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on multiple-case research, this paper develops a model of strategic information systems (IS) investment in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). IS investment is modelled as a function of an SME's strategic context as defined by its strategic focus, i.e. cost reduction versus value added and its market positioning, i.e. few versus many customers. The paper first investigates the ways in which IS may add value to organizations. It then outlines the use of IS in SMEs. This is followed by an analysis of competitiveness in small businesses. The paper develops an analytical model, which is termed the focus-dominance model, analyses case studies of 27 firms and reports that IS investment is strongly influenced by an SME's strategic context. Four cases are presented in order to illustrate the four different IS profiles identified. Finally, the implications for theory and practice are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Studies regularly demonstrate how well intelligent agents (IAs) can support humans or are demonstrably superior to them in some areas. Given that some tasks likely remain unsuitable for even the most intelligent machines in the mid-future, work in hybrid teams of humans and IAs—where the capabilities of both are effectively combined—will most likely shape the way we work in the coming decades. In an abductive study, we investigate an early example of hybrid teams, consisting of a conversational intelligent agent (IA) and humans, that aims to improve health behavior or change personality traits. We theorize Transactive Intelligent Memory System (TIMS) as a new vision of collaboration between humans and IAs in hybrid teams, based on our empirical insights and our literature review on transactive memory systems theory. Our empirical evidence shows that IAs can develop a form of individual and external memory, and hybrid teams of humans and IAs can realize joint systems of transactive memory—a competence that current literature only ascribes to humans. We further find that whether individuals view IAs merely as external memory aids or as part of their teams’ transactive memory is moderated by the tasks’ complexity and knowledge intensity, as well as the IA’s ability to complete the task. This theorizing helps to better understand the role of IAs in future team-based working processes. Developers of IAs can use TIMS as a tool for requirements formulation to prepare their software agents for collaboration in hybrid teams.</jats:p>",

In the original language of phenomenology as used by Heidegger, ‘Befindlichkeif means not just ‘state of mind’ but also refers to disposition, mood, affectedness and emotion. The paper reviews the controversies in the literature generated by opponents to the situatedness literature and provides two case studies to show how current IS uses of the situatedness perspectives differ from the original one. From this discussion, the paper argues that the limited IS research agendas on situated action found in Al, cognitive and social sciences need to capture the inner life of the actor, mind and heart, through the scope of a renewed, authentic, phenomenological tradition. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The relative importance of context and generalizability (or particularism and universalism) has long been debated in scientific research. Recently, Davison and Martinsons raised valid concerns about the possibility of false universalism in IS research, discussed its negative consequences, and made a call for explicitly including particularism in research design and reporting. In this commentary, we generally agree with the notion that context should matter more in IS research; yet, the importance of generalizability in research should not be downplayed. Specifically, we posit that generalizability should be given higher position in the scientific process and be the ultimate goal for researchers. Still, researchers need to fully understand the research context, which, in combination and replication, can help to cautiously make generalizable knowledge claims. Therefore, we characterize the relationship between context and generalizability as that of a “King” (as an analogy of the local role of context) versus the “Emperor” (as an analogy of the global role of generalizability). </jats:p>",

Towards this goal, it draws upon dialectical theory, which enables viewing persistence and change during IS development relative to the thesis operating at that time. This approach recognizes that the nature of the system itself often changes during the development process. This also allows simultaneous attention to persistence and change, combining persistence with certain elements of the thesis along with change in some other elements. Empirically based on three cases, the paper provides insights into the content and process elements of theses, governing the characteristics of the system and the nature of the development process, respectively. It offers one possible explanation for the evolution of the IS development process and some insights into the strategies for improving this process through greater attention to the theses and the dialectic processes. </jats:p>",

    "title": "High-Frequency Trading and its Role in Fragmented Markets",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Securities trading underwent a major transformation within the last decade. This transformation was mainly driven by the regulatory induced fragmentation and by the increase of high-frequency trading (HFT). On the basis of the electronic market hypothesis, which poses that coordination costs decline when markets become automated, and the efficient market hypothesis in its semi-strong form, we study the effect of HFT on market efficiency in the European fragmented market landscape. In doing so, we further incorporate the realm of financialization, which criticizes the increase in transaction speed. By conducting a long-term analysis of CAC 40 securities, we find that HFT increases market efficiency by leveling midpoints between Euronext Paris and Bats Chi-X Europe. On the basis of a crosscountry event study, we analyze the effect of the German HFT Act. We observe that the midpoint dispersion of blue chip securities between the two leading venues Deutsche Boerse and Bats Chi-X Europe increased. We conclude that HFT increases market efficiency in the European market landscape by transmitting information between distant markets. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Design Construct in Information Systems Design Science",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper arose from concerns regarding the current conceptualizations of ‘design’ in the emerging literature on design science (DS) in information systems (IS). In this paper, we argue that current conceptualizations of design in IS are overly narrow, which necessarily limits what is viewed as acceptable DS research. In response we advance a more encompassing view of design. The revised view extends the current perspectives of design in the IS literature to embrace broader conceptualizations of design, which are evident in many intellectual communities outside IS where design is viewed as a critical component of both research and practice - such as management, engineering, architecture and others. In addition to the fairly common conceptualizations of design as product and design as process or action, design is also conceived as: intention; planning - including modeling and representation; communication; user experience; value; professional practice; and as service. Further, whereas the current conceptualization of design in IS views IS design knowledge as split across two paradigms, namely DS and behavioral science, in this paper we argue for a broader and more integrated view of design: one that emphasizes both the construction-centered and human-centered aspects of design in IS. Building from our broader view, we discuss some of the implications for design-oriented research in IS, and consider ways in which this human- centered perspective might impact on the context and content of design research in IS. </jats:p>",

A particular focus concerns problems and issues associated with professional cultures and powerful organizational control structures. A review of four empirical DOI studies are undertaken to identify candidate frameworks for the retrospective analysis of a pilot study conducted across General Medical Practices based within a Primary Care Trust in the north east of England. A research approach, based on phenomenology, semi-structured interviews and template analysis is adopted in order to conduct and provide a rich analysis of the data. The findings are discussed using the modified DOI framework. Discussion and conclusions relate to the extended use of the DOI framework, its further development and how it may be used to understand how ICT innovation is politically constrained, perceived and motivated within healthcare environments </jats:p>",

Here we offer a model that explains a firm's success in terms of its adoption know-why and know-when and its implementation know-how. We examine this model in an exploratory survey of some 118 firms’ adoption and implementation of packaged business software in the 1990s. Using multivariate methods, we identify business coordination as know-why and management understanding and vendor support as know-how factors important to success, explaining nearly 60% of the variance. There is limited evidence that the right adoption know-why may help in acquiring or fostering the right implementation know-how. The findings serve to remind practitioners that they should attend carefully to adoption rationales, grounded in business benefits, when they innovate with new IT. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Both the use of Web sites and the empirical knowledge as to what constitutes effective Web site design has grown exponentially in recent years. The aim of the current article is to outline the history and key elements of Web site design in an e-commerce context - primarily in the period 2002-2012. It was in 2002 that a Special Issue of ISR was focused on ‘Measuring e-Commerce in Net-Enabled Organizations.’ Before this, work was conducted on Web site design, but much of it was anecdotal. Systematic, empirical research and modeling of Web site design to dependent variables like trust, satisfaction, and loyalty until then had not receive substantial focus - at least in the information systems domain. In addition to an overview of empirical findings, this article has a practical focus on what designers must know about Web site elements if they are to provide compelling user experiences, taking into account the site's likely users. To this end, the article elaborates components of effective Web site design, user characteristics, and the online context that impact Web usage and acceptance, and design issues as they are relevant to diverse users including those in global markets. Web site elements that result in positive business impact are articulated. This retrospective on Web site design concludes with an overview of future research directions and current developments. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Editorial",
    "abstract": "sory board and everyone associated with the journal, the editors would like to extend their sympathies to the families and relatives of those who were killed on 11 September 2001 in the USA. The events of that day have given rise to an avalanche of opinion, re ection and re-evaluation as commentators consider the past and anticipate a changed future. The importance of information technology (IT) topics has changed. New challenges have been issued for existing technologies. New opportunities have emerged. Less can be taken for granted. So long as we stand up to the challenge and start to think more broadly and more radically then some good may yet emerge. The crucial question for us all is how fragile and how robust is our increasingly electronic world. What can we do to increase its robustness? Clearly, the fact that even the worst hit companies in the World Trade Centre were able to rebuild their operational infrastructure as quickly as they were is a remarkable tribute to the resilience that a distributed infrastructure can impart. However, how much back-up is required? What if a major corporate were targeted both at its operational headquarters and at its principal alternative site? Maybe back-up tapes in secure safes at remote sites would provide adequate protection. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe the real risk is the loss of knowledge associated with the loss of employees. How seriously must companies look at that? We must articulate all such questions and seek answers by carefully assessing how well prepared we are. A particular source of fragility is the increasing tightness of the coupling between units within an organization and across organizations. As companies seek to compete less as company against company and more as supply chain against supply chain, there is enormous pressure to remove the slack resources (inventory, time and people) that currently exist at organizational boundaries. As one company’s systems are integrated with those of another, the costs and implications of having to swap swiftly from an established business partner to a new one become a relevant consideration in architecting integration. A further issue of interest is how companies will view outsourcing. We talked to a consultant to the  nancial services sector about this. He held a strong view that concerns about disaster recovery planning would encourage more companies to hand over their operations to a specialist provider with the capacity and capabilities for providing fail-safe back-up. Such a concentration of responsibility for our systems also has its risks. Vendors must recognize this and step up to the mark. Then we encounter the question of how do systems and processes cope with sudden changes in consumer and business behaviour. The airline industry is most obviously affected. How will the models underlying yield management systems respond to a catastrophic decline in demand? What will be the business implications of those responses? Quite independent of the New York attacks the global airline industry has offered another example of the importance of crisis planning in the recent collapses of Swissair and Ansett (in Australia). The Ansett case is particularly interesting because the Australian domestic market is dominated by Qantas, with limited competition from Virgin Blue. Even to casual observers Ansett’s demise was predictable. Nevertheless, when it came it suddenly left Qantas and Virgin Blue with having to rescue stranded passengers and provide a substantially increased capacity for compensating for Ansett. It would be interesting to know how Qantas and Virgin planned for the non-standard task of rescuing Ansett passengers and what technology issues they faced in taking up the extra workload. More generally, there are interesting studies to be pursued into how companies manage the take-up of business from signi cant competitors who suddenly cease to operate. Moving from the recent extraordinary events to the day-to-day business of the advancement of knowledge, we have a diverse mix of topics in this issue of the journal. Debra Howcroft sets about deconstructing the dot.com boom. She probes a number of assumptions on which the boom was founded and demonstrates that most were absurd. When next a management fad or technology mania starts to take hold, we should turn back to this article in order to remind ourselves that rarely if ever are there simple ways of revolutionizing the pro tability of an individual company’s business model, let alone that of whole sectors of industry. It should help us to stand up and say as much in the face of what we know to be unfounded hype. In doing so we may help those companies that listen gain a strategic advantage through not making the same mistake as the mass of their competitors. Our second article is also something rather unusual.

    "title": "Strategic Systems Implementation: Diffusion through Drift",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems follows various paths in organisations and achieves diverse results. The traditional models of diffusion of innovation applied in information systems are not sufficient to explain such variations in adoption. This study examines the process of drift in an ERP project to answer the questions of how and why drift tends to occur in such projects. It applies Actor Network Theory to interpret the data. This analytical lens reveals that a software implementation project's fate depends on each move it takes and each party involved in handling that move. Every handling of the project by different parties could present either a positive modality (that strengthens it and pushes it forward on its track) or a negative modality (that weakens its initial form and drags it onto a different direction). The study provides an alternative view of diffusion, and an explanation of drift in the ERP case that could be extended to other technological projects. It invites practitioners to monitor the various movements of their projects and to allow strategic drift in order to achieve a successful implementation. </jats:p>",

B2C represents a Type III information systems (IS) innovation that integrates IS with core business technologies. Extant studies on Type III innovations have examined organizational and institutional factors, solely or collectively, in explaining adoption, but not how their effects change under shifting environments over time. We develop an integrated model comprising organizational factors (i.e., espoused values and resources) and institutional factors (i.e., normative and mimetic pressures), as well as the moderating influence of shifting environments (i.e., early period and late period demarcated by changes in the environment). Using a piecewise event-history model specification, we examine the adoption of B2C innovations by 93 organizations over time. Our results show that both organizational and institutional factors influence B2C adoption; however, their effects varied with the environmental shifts. Specifically, senior IS executives influenced adoption in the early period whereas bandwagon mimetic pressures and business norms influenced adoption in the late period. The findings of our research demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling environmental shifts in theorizing organizational adoption of innovations. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a KM governance model and explores its recent validation through six case studies of large, distributed, multinational organizations, and through these introduces the granular constructs of KM governance.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Network effects and switching costs are two major economic forces in information technology industries. Although the consequences of these mechanisms on competition and firm strategy have been well documented in the literature, research on their impact on customer behavior has received less attention. In this study, the authors investigate the role of personal network effects and switching costs in explaining customer choice in the Spanish mobile telecommunications industry. Personal network effects are present when an individual user's utility increases more when some individuals adopt (social network) than when others do. Switching costs refer to costs associated with the process of switching from one provider to another. In addition, this paper studies the drivers of personal network effects and switching behavior. The results reveal that personal network effects and switching costs play a key role in determining mobile users’ choice: the probability that a customer selects a mobile phone company increases with the number of members of her social network already subscribed to that firm, and switching costs are significantly present in the mobile phone market making switching providers costly. Concerning the drivers of both mechanisms, the authors find that relationship characteristics (length, depth and breadth) and demographics differently affect personal network effects perceptions and consumer switching behavior. Implications for decision makers are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Scholars and practitioners alike increasingly recognize the importance of stock microblogs as they capture the market discussion and have predictive value for financial markets. This paper examines the extent to which stock microblog messages are related to financial market indicators and the mechanism leading to efficient aggregation of information. In particular, this paper investigates the information content of stock microblogs with respect to individual stocks and explores the effects of social influences on an interday and intraday basis. We collected more than 1.2 million stock-related messages (i.e., tweets) related to S&amp;P 100 companies over a period of 7 months. Using methods from computational linguistics, we went through an elaborate process of message feature reduction, spam detection, language detection, and slang removal, which has led to an increase in classification accuracy for sentiment analysis. We analyzed the data on both a daily and a 15-min basis and found that the sentiment of messages is positively affected with contemporaneous daily abnormal stock returns and that message volume predicts 15-min follow-up returns, trading volume, and volatility. Disagreement in microblog messages positively influences stock features, both in interday and intraday analysis. Notably, if we give a greater share of voice to microblog messages depending on the social influence of microbloggers, this amplifies the relationship between bullishness and abnormal returns, market volume, and volatility. Following knowledgeable investors advice results in more power in explaining changes in market features. This offers an explanation for the efficient aggregation of information on microblogging platforms. Furthermore, we simulated a set of trading strategies using microblog features and the results suggest that it is possible to exploit market inefficiencies even when transaction costs are included. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the association between the information content of stock microblogs and intraday stock market features. The insights from the study permit scholars and professionals to reliably identify stock microblog features, which may serve as valuable proxies for market sentiment and permit individual investors to make better investment decisions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper investigates how Information Systems (IS) has emerged as the product of interdisciplinary discourses. The research aim in this study is to better understand diversity in IS research, and the extent to which the diversity of discourse expanded and contracted from 1995 to 2011. Methodologically, we apply a combined citations/co-citations analysis based on the eight Association for Information Systems basket journals and the 22 subject-field classification framework provided by the Association of Business Schools. Our findings suggest that IS is in a state of continuous interaction and competition with other disciplines. General Management was reduced from a dominant position as a reference discipline in IS at the expense of a growing variety of other discourses including Business Strategy, Marketing, and Ethics and Governance, among others. Over time, IS as a field moved from the periphery to a central position during its discursive formation. This supports the notion of IS as a fluid discipline dynamically embracing a diverse range of adjacent reference disciplines, while keeping a degree of continuing interaction with them. Understanding where IS is currently at allows us to better understand and propose fruitful avenues for its development in both academia and practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The alignment of business and information technology (IT) strategies is an important and enduring theoretical challenge for the information systems discipline, remaining a top issue in practice over the past 20 years. Multi-business organizations (MBOs) present a particular alignment challenge because business strategies are developed at the corporate level, within individual strategic business units and across the corporate investment cycle. In contrast, the extant literature implicitly assumes that IT strategy is aligned with a single business strategy at a single point in time. This paper draws on resource-based theory and path dependence to model functional, structural, and temporal IT strategic alignment in MBOs. Drawing on Makadok's theory of profit, we show how each form of alignment creates value through the three strategic drivers of competence, governance, and flexibility, respectively. We illustrate the model with examples from a case study on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We also explore the model's implications for existing IT alignment models, providing alternative theoretical explanations for how IT alignment creates value. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Beauty-Contests in the Age of Financialization: Information Activism and Retail Investor Behavior",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Keynes (The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Harcourt Brace and Co., New York, 1936) had rightfully argued that picking stocks is akin to a beauty contest. The chances of winning are amplified if one's choice matches the likelihood of the panel's choice. In this era of financialization, where profit-making has shifted to speculative sways rather than fundamental trade and commodity production measures (Krippner, Socio-Econ Rev 3(2): 173-208, 2005), similar beauty contests have become even more acute. Online, real-time media channels along with pervasive investments applications have ushered in unprecedented online financial information and retail investor interest, ranging from dealing in penny stocks to sentiment-based trading. More than information sources, similar investment sites compete to recommend investment directions and strategies, not driven by strict fundamentals used by “arbitrageurs” or rational speculators but on pseudo-signals proffered by various information investment channels with varying degrees of credibility. This behavior, referred to herein as information activism, concomitantly adds a sociopsychological dimension to the concept of financialization (Lagoarde-Segot, Int Rev Financial Anal 2016) – wherein technology-driven information reach and range contribute to financial dominance of financial actors and practices. Using information activism as a lens, this research empirically evidences the extent to which information activism affects retail investor behavior under various market conditions. This study examines the differential effects of two primary, albeit reputable, sources of information activism: an investment news channel (CNBC – Mad Money) and an online financial blog (SeekingAlpha), and the effect on investor behavior during the 2008 financial crisis. In identifying the specific downstream effects of information activism on capital markets and investor behavior, factors related to investor behavior, such as trading volume and price reaction, are analyzed surrounding information activism events. Results indicate that retail investors appear to rely on online information activists during uncertain economic conditions. Findings denote that abnormal returns are associated with information activism during uncertain economic conditions and for buy recommendations when information asymmetry is high. Abnormal trading volume is also associated with information activism during economic uncertainty and with buy recommendations when information asymmetry is high particularly for stocks exchanges where unsophisticated investors tend to trade more heavily. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Offshore Middlemen: Transnational Intermediation in Technology Sourcing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The tendency of acquiring information systems and other high technology services from international suppliers continues at unprecedented levels. The primary motivation for the offshore sourcing of technology and services continues to be labor cost arbitrage, and secondly, access to higher levels of expertise. Yet paradoxically, large gaps in technical proficiency, cultural values, and communication styles between client and vendor can undermine the overall success of the offshore relationship. This paper argues that a new breed of entities have emerged, brokering or intermediating offshore relations. The capabilities of such ‘middlemen’ include moderating disparities in expertise, culture, and communication styles that often deteriorate performance in offshore relationships. The paper presents a preliminary theoretical justification for the emergence of offshore intermediaries, describes how and why they develop boundary spanning capabilities, and offers a case study as initial evidence substantiating the function and processes in intermediating transnational offshoring relationships.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explains the development of a skills-focused approach that can assist organisations to better anticipate hurdles to successful information systems (IS) adoption. This approach is utilised in an interpretive field study in an Australian information technology company. From a perspective that views IS as tools, the approach is used to analyse the management control skills required to use a specific management IS. A skills match between the set of management control skills assumed by the toolmaker and the skills possessed by the tool user shows why a group of users with a high degree of match adopted the tool, while another one with a low degree of match did not do so. The study thus demonstrates that the skills-focused approach is a valid and effective way of determining the appropriateness of an IS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a new perspective on the problem of bias in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making by examining the fundamental difference between AI and human rationality in making sense of data. Current research has focused primarily on software engineers’ bounded rationality and bias in the data fed to algorithms but has neglected the crucial role of algorithmic rationality in producing bias. Using a Weberian distinction between formal and substantive rationality, we inquire why AI-based algorithms lack the ability to display common sense in data interpretation, leading to flawed decisions. We first conduct a rigorous text analysis to uncover and exemplify contextual nuances within the sampled data. We then combine unsupervised and supervised learning, revealing that algorithmic decision-making characterizes and judges data categories mechanically as it operates through the formal rationality of mathematical optimization procedures. Next, using an AI tool, we demonstrate how formal rationality embedded in AI-based algorithms limits its capacity to perform adequately in complex contexts, thus leading to bias and poor decisions. Finally, we delineate the boundary conditions and limitations of leveraging formal rationality to automatize algorithmic decision-making. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the rationality-based causes of AI’s role in bias and poor decisions, even when data is generated in a largely bias-free context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the general consensus regarding the critical role of top management in the information systems (ISs) implementation process, the literature has not yet provided a clear and compelling understanding of the top management support (TMS) concept. Applying metastructuring (Orlikowski et al., 1995) as a guiding framework for understanding TMS behaviors, this paper attempts to address the gap by focusing on two key questions: (1) What supportive actions do top managers engage in during IS implementations? (2) How do these actions affect IS implementation outcomes? Analyses of in-depth case studies at two Canadian universities that had implemented a large-scale enterprise system revealed three distinct types of TMS actions: TMS - resource provision (TMSR - actions related to supplying key resources such as funds, technologies, staff, and user training programs); TMS - change management (TMSC - actions related to fostering organizational receptivity of a new IS); and TMS - vision sharing (TMSV - actions related to ensuring that lower-level managers develop a common understanding of the core objectives and ideals for the new system). Results suggest that different support behaviors exercise different influences on implementation outcomes, and that top managers need to adjust their support actions to achieve the desired outcomes. In particular, TMSR affected project completion, TMSC impacted formation of user skills and attitudes, and TMSV influenced middle manager buy-in. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘ChatGPT et al.’: The ethics of using (generative) artificial intelligence in research and science",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) seeks to make computers do what human minds can do. By ‘AI’, we refer to the use of machine learning, algorithms, large datasets, neural networks and traditional statistical reasoning by computing. The term ‘AI’ is misleading: Despite suggestions to the contrary (Bubeck et al., 2023) – and some surely impressive achievements in specific areas –we are still far from reaching the benchmark of ‘general human intelligence’. AI has undergone several generations, from ‘good old-fashioned AI’ (Haugeland, 1989), the defined algorithms of which failed at the common sense problem, to the current and more successful generation of neural network and deep learning AI. One specific form of current AI is ‘generative AI’ (e.g. ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney) – and without a doubt, it’s the ‘technology hype’ of 2023 and the focus of this editorial comment. Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, became a ‘cultural sensation’ (Thorp, 2023) rather rapidly in early 2023. When Daniel brought up generative AI as a future ethical issue at a panel for journal editors on publishing ethics in December 2022 (Burton-Jones et al., 2022), many audience members seemed unfamiliar withMidjourney orChatGPT.However, within just a few weeks, the landscape shifted dramatically. Publicly launched on 30 November 2022, ChatGPT – a chatbot built on top of a text-generating AI – had an impressive debut, reaching onemillion users within 5 days and surpassing 100million users in January 2023 (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Since then, ChatGPT has become widely used and is believed to impact many areas, including research and science (Hill-Yardin et al., 2023; Liebrenz et al., 2023; Lund and Wang, 2023). While detailed explanations of the underlying technology can be found in other sources (Goodfellow et al., 2016), generative AI is a subset of deep learning AI that specialises in producing human-like outputs. OpenAI’s ChatGPToperates on a neural network AI architecture, GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). Although ChatGPT might have seemed like a natural progression of the AI domain, especially since Midjourney and DALL-E had been introduced earlier, it astonished global audiences and led companies like Alphabet (Google) to hastily release comparable tools (Teubner et al., 2023). Simplified, deep learning AI systems ‘hallucinate’ ‘plausible looking’ (though not necessarily accurate) responses to user prompts. They base these responses on patterns of ‘likeness’ (associations between words and concepts), stored in a digital neural network (multiple layers of interconnected nodes) and learnt from massive training datasets. Such systems can quickly generate high-quality images and texts, outperforming traditional algorithms. However, this advanced capability is accompanied by the challenge of the ‘black box’ problem:wemay understand the model’s general principles, but the reasons behind specific decisions remain opaque. The neural network provides a flexible, changing structure, inspired by the human brain, that encodes patterns, but not in an intelligible, auditable manner – there is no clear formula to scrutinise. (This is akin to how the reader might instantly and reliably distinguish between their mother and their cat but would be unable to write down a precise formula for this recognition process). As journal editors, the emergence of ChatGPT prompted us – and others (e.g. Hill-Yardin et al., 2023; Liebrenz et al., 2023; Lund and Wang, 2023; Teubner et al., 2023; Van Dis et al., 2023) – to ask foundational questions about using generative AI in research and science. Specifically: Is it ‘ethical’ to use generative or other AIs in conducting research or for writing academic research papers? In this editorial, we go back to first principles to reflect on the fundamental ethics to apply to using ChatGPT and AI in research and science. Next, we caution that (generative) AI is also at the ‘peak of inflated (hype) expectations’ and discuss eight in-principle issues that AI struggles with, both ethically and practically. We conclude with what this all means for the ethics of using generative AI in research and science.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cloud computing (CC) is an emerging form of IT outsourcing (ITO) that requires organizations to adjust their sourcing processes. Although ITO researchers have established an extensive knowledge base on the determinant factors that drive sourcing decisions from various theoretical perspectives, the majority of research on cloud-sourcing decisions focuses on technological aspects. We reviewed the CC and ITO literature and systematically coded the determinant factors that influence sourcing decisions. We show that most determinant factors of sourcing decisions in the ITO context remain valid for the CC context. However, the findings for some factors (i.e., asset specificity, client firm IT capabilities, client firm size, institutional influences, and uncertainty) are inconclusive for the CC and ITO contexts. We discuss how the peculiarities of CC can explain these inconclusive findings. Our results indicate that CC researchers should draw from research on ITO decision making but re-examine ITO concepts in the light of the peculiarities of CC, such as the differences between software and infrastructure services, the self-service procurement of cloud services, or the evolving role of IT departments. By summarizing determinant factors of cloud-sourcing decisions for consideration in future research, we contribute to the development of endogenous theories in the IS domain. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Transaction cost theory has often been used to support the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to reduce imperfection in the economic system. Electronic markets and hierarchies have repeatedly been described as solutions to inefficiencies in the organisation of transactions in complex and uncertain settings. Far from criticising this assumption, this paper highlights the limits associated with this application of transaction cost theory that has been prevalent in IS research. Building on the concepts first proposed by Ciborra, the paper argues that information-related problems represent only some of the elements contributing to transaction costs. These costs also emerge due to the interdependencies among the various factors contributing to their growth. The study of the consequences associated with ICT design and implementation, grounded in transaction cost theory, should consider the overall implication associated with the adoption and use of ICT and not only the direct effect on problems associated with information flow, distribution, and management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the ubiquitous presence of information technology (IT) in the workplace and the continued computerization of all kinds of work practices, investigations into how IT artifacts play a role in professional identity construction remain rare. Existing studies tend to emphasize sense-making and discourses around IT. This study attempts to fill some of this gap by offering an empirical investigation of how IT artifacts play a role in professional identity enactment at a back office of a Big 4 accounting firm. Building on the socio-technical school of thought and the concept of self as storied, the paper offers a complementary perspective to existing views on the role of IT in identity formation. Our findings reveal that IT artifacts become part of professional identity performances by acting as landmarks in individuals’ self-narratives around which the self and others are positioned and a preferred professional identity is enacted. The findings also indicate that different types of preferred selves may be expressed in specific patterns of technology use. As such, our study contributes to a better understanding of professional identity construction, workplace behavior and ongoing use or non-use of IT at work. </jats:p>",

    "title": "IT to Support Knowledge Sharing in Communities, towards a Social Capital Analysis",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ignoring the informal, non-canonical nature of knowledge sharing, including people's motivation, ability and opportunity to share knowledge, is one of the key causes of resistance to use knowledge-sharing tools. In order to improve knowledge sharing supported by information technology (IT), tools need to be embedded in the social networks of which it is part. This has implications for our knowledge on the design requirements of such socially embedded IT. The paper reviews tools that are designed for the purpose to foster social capital. We will then discuss what is needed for an IS design theory related to knowledge communities and how such a theory could incorporate social capital theory. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The process of information systems theorizing as a discursive practice",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although there has been a growing understanding of theory in the information systems field in recent years, the process of theorizing is rarely addressed with contributions originating from other disciplines and little effort to coherently synthesize them. Moreover, the field’s view of theorizing has traditionally focused on the context of justification with an emphasis on collection and analysis of data in response to a research question with theory often added as an afterthought. To fill this void, we foreground the context of discovery that emphasizes the creative and often serendipitous articulation of theory by emphasizing this important stage of theorizing as a reflective and highly iterative practice. Specifically, we suggest that information systems researchers engage in foundational theorizing practices to form the discourse, problematize the phenomenon of interest and leverage paradigms and deploy generative theorizing practices through analogies, metaphors, myths and models to develop the information systems discourse. To illustrate the detailed workings of these discursive practices, we draw on key examples from information systems theorizing. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Opening the Floodgates: The Implications of Increasing Platform Openness in Crowdfunding",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Managing platform ecosystems requires providers to govern the permeability of platform boundaries in order to strike a balance between openness and control. But is it worthwhile for platform providers to conduct screening processes for third-party offerings, or should they rather apply a laissez-faire approach and let the market determine winners and losers? In this study, we compare the market conditions on Kickstarter, one of the world's largest crowdfunding platforms, before and after a policy change that relaxed the previously stringent screening process for new campaigns. By analyzing over 230,000 crowdfunding campaigns with a combined funding of over $1.9 billion that cover a 4-year period around the policy change, we find that increasing platform openness was a double-edged sword for the platform's ecosystem. While Kickstarter's revenue from commissions surged after the policy change due to an increase in the number of campaigns available on the platform, funding conditions for project creators and backers deteriorated. Project creators have to cope with lower success rates and an intensified competition due to a growing disproportion of backers to campaigns, while backers face higher uncertainties as project creators invest less in reducing information asymmetries. Our evidence from this natural experiment therefore suggests that increasing platform openness for third-party offerings can destabilize a platform's ecosystem. We thus extend the literature on platform openness and on the implications of policy changes on platform ecosystems. Our findings also provide practical insights for different platform stakeholders into possible “ripple effects” that are triggered when policy changes alter platform openness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on research conducted by the authors into how to measure the effectiveness of a personal computer network used by a business school to deliver a range of personal productivity tools to MBA students, as well as academic and administrative staff. The use of user-satisfaction is recognized by many IT researchers as an appropriate surrogate for IT effectiveness. The authors decided to use a user-satisfaction model which is based on the gap between users’ beliefs of what is important and their perception of what is delivered by the ISD, to measure the effectiveness of the personal computer network. </jats:p><jats:p> In brief, the research showed that all was not well with the personal computer network in use. The gaps on the two perceptual performance factors, namely effective benefits and system access, are significant in assessing overall satisfaction with the network. The gap on effective benefits is approximately twice as important as system's access in terms of its impact on overall satisfaction. This research study showed that this gap approach is quite effective. It is inexpensive. It does not require an enormous amount of expertize, although an acquaintance with factor analysis is necessary. The study need not take a long period of time; the total lapse time for the above research was six weeks, requiring the equivalent of five person-days work. </jats:p>",

Although there is some evidence on the usefulness of mobile viral marketing from the marketers’ perspective, little is known about the motivations, attitudes, and behaviors of consumers engaged in this marketing instrument. The purpose of this research is to better understand the motivations behind a consumer's decision to engage in mobile viral marketing strategies. The outcome is a grounded theory of mobile viral marketing with respect to the consumer and his social network, decomposing the mobile viral effect and identifying the determinants of reception, usage, and forwarding of mobile viral content. This result helps researchers and marketers to better understand the critical components of mobile viral marketing strategies and prepares the ground for further research in this emerging field. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Theme Issue: Introduction",
    "abstract": "This issue concentrates most of its attention on the subject of evaluation of information systems investments. This theme attracted a substantial amount of interest amongst contributors, and some additional papers will be published in later issues of the Journal in 1991. Here we are only able to publish five. This would seem to indicate what we suspected from our own and other research on the area that this is perceived increasingly as a highly important area in organizations, and one in which a lot of learning and changes in practice need to take place. The papers in this issue are thoroughly up-to-date, discuss present practice, and offer constructive ways forward and as such should be of considerable interest to academic and practitioner audiences alike. We believe that the theme issue format is a very useful way of focusing and influencing research, opinion and practice, and will be looking to devote further future issues to specific themes. Thus the September 1991 issue (Volume 6 Number 3) will concern itself with Information Technology into the 1990sThe Human Resource Issues. This is emerging from a number of pieces of research, including our own, and that carried out by the recent, influential MIT Landmark study, as a major and neglected area in the management of Information Technology. This theme will be interpreted broadly as covering the relationships between information, information technologies and human resource issues in organizations. Typical themes might be business, human resource and IT strategies; human computer interaction; user/IS professional relationships; IT, human resource management and employee relations; analysis and design techniques, including 'soft' systems approaches; human resource issues in respect of prototyping, expert systems, CASE, EIS; managing technological change; IT and politics; IS as social systems; IT and society; management/user/IS professional training and education for IT. This list should not be taken as exhaustive. We invite contributions to this theme issue. These may well be from practitioners, managers, academics, business consultants or researchers. What would seem to be important is to gain an up-to-date, critical and informed cross-section of perspectives on the issues suggested by the theme issue title. Contributions can take the form of research reports, academic papers, or personal views, but should always be rigorously argued and supported by references wherever possible. Contributors should follow the guidelines for authors published on the back page of every edition of the Journal. In the first instance an intending author should send a proposed title and short summary of the paper to one of the editors at the editorial address. This needs to be done before April 10th 1991. The full paper needs to be submitted for refereeing by May 20th; if revisions are required the final paper needs to be submitted by June 8th 1991. Future theme issues are planned, and we invite suggestions for possible titles and contributions. One putative title is Marketing and Information Technology. This theme could be interpreted broadly to cover how information and Information Technology relate to, support or transform any or all marketing activities, with the latter again conceived broadly. This may include, for example, market and marketing research, organizing for marketing, relationships with customers, product innovation, promotional effort, pricing techniques and technologies, place and distribution channels, and marketing planning and decision-making. Once again, anyone wishing to contribute a paper on such a theme should first contact the editorial office.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents findings of an investigation into the relationship between organizational configurations and alternative patterns of information systems (IS) development. The study focuses on the IS strategic process. A theoretical framework is developed to examine the relationships between organizational and IS strategy formulation processes. The framework was evaluated in 56 organizations. Results of the analysis support the theory that different stages of growth in the use and development of IS require different approaches to strategy, and that different approaches to strategy are favoured by different organizational configurations. Evaluation of the relationship between organizational change and IS developments reveals a pattern of strategic alignment reflecting the interdependencies between the organizational configuration and the stage of IS growth. It would appear that transitions through this alignment model are characterized by periods of dynamic change which can be predicted at certain stages of growth. The model may prove useful both to assist in the management of organizational change and to identify appropriate IS strategy formulation approaches. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Computer Representation of Management Policy",
    "abstract": "This workshop was convened under the auspices of the Domino project to discuss issues relating to the computer representation of management policy. The Domino project (Principal Investigator Dr Morris Sloman) is an lED/SERC collaborative project with Sema Group UK and the BP Research Centre, on Management in Distributed Systems. Management policies are one of the project's major concerns. A considerable amount ofwork has already been done on access control policies. However, two other areas concerned with policies are now being addressed: on the one hand the development of protocols for the cooperation of independent managers in setting policies, and on the other the development of a framework so that application-specific policies, particularly for the Domino application areas of Accounting and Quality of Service, can be expressed in a consistent way. It was known that work in this area was being done elsewhere, including HP Laboratories, Bristol, Lancaster University and Newcastle University. Elsewhere in Imperial College closely related work on software development models is being carried out. The workshop aimed to give each group an opportunity to present its ideas, and to identify common ground from which to progress. The emphasis of the workshop was on the goal of producing tools and techniques for specification of 'higher level' management policy rather than mechanisms for implementing distributed systems.Eight presentations were given in a full and productive day, covering three main themes: the general representation of management policies; particular applications which need to use management policies; and the role for the development process in the creation ofpolicies. Morris Sloman began the day with a keynote presentation which surveyed the progress made in Domino and other projects. He noted one firm advance: the use ofDomains as a means of structuring and grouping objects of all kinds was an innovative and",

    "title": "A Framework for Evaluating Organizational Choice and Process Redesign Issues",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a new framework for the evaluation of organizational choice primarily within the context of process redesign issues and the information technology support of those ideas. Through a process of scenario generation, the framework is designed to identify and evaluate choices in work organization and to make more explicit the implications that such choices might have for people and work roles. A central aim is to encourage the participation of different organizational stakeholders in the evaluation process. Process redesign has hitherto tended to be explored predominantly through software engineering and functionally driven approaches. The framework presented here offers a counterbalance to those works by offering an organizational perspective. It is based on a broad, scenario-generating technique which is firmly rooted in the organizational vision of a broad range of interest groups. Some work has already been undertaken in this field. Previous research has demonstrated the value of taking a broader organizational approach to workplace technology redesign and shown that the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders during evaluation can result in some very creative, practical and productive solutions. Nevertheless, this paper identifies some potential weaknesses in that previous body of research and proposes a new approach. The author draws upon earlier work in order to develop a framework which will provide more guidance to stakeholders during the scenario-generating process and which will make even more explicit the values and assumptions underlying alternative choices. The framework enables an evaluation of those technological choices at a fairly deep level, whilst remaining relatively simple to apply. The new approach presented in this paper is currently being adopted by an EPSRC-funded research team exploring issues of the relationship between business processes and legacy systems (for details of the project, please see web site: www.dur.ac.uk/CSM/SABA ). Future work will concentrate on producing further, industry-based case studies of its application and assessing its value when applied alongside traditional and technically focused software engineering methods of technological evaluation and development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper looks at the contribution that computers have made to the delivery of the National Health Service through a period of major reform that began in 1986, and is still ongoing. The paper starts with a retrospective analysis of the first generation of NHS Reforms and the role played by computer systems. The major empirical component is a case study looking at the impact of computers on health promotion activities among over 1 million patients in Lancashire. Finally, the paper looks forward to the latest NHS reforms, as outlined in the 1997 White Paper The New DHS (Department of Health, 1997, HMSO, London) and outlines the information implications and a strategic framework to deliver changes required if the reforms are to succeed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The knowledge base for software design standards is predominantly that of psychology, a rather soft science. Software standards are lagging behind hardware standards and have their critics who maintain that they are too general, liable to be misapplied and difficult for designers to use. These criticisms are valid. Standards aim to offer broadly applicable guidance which, as a result, is often too vague for a specific system application. They are certainly open to misinterpretation. Many standards offer conflicting advice because they are a conglomeration of current practices. The principles or guidelines contained in some standards are not the result of rigorous experimentation (the more controlled the experiment, the less generally applicable are the results). Often the expert has devised the guideline by inferring from other applications.",

    "abstract": "The study on which this paper is based started with the hypothesis that many of the implementation problems met in introducing new information systems. or in making use of new IT-based tools, stem from social and organizational factors rather than from shortcomings in the technology itself. Prior studies, such as the Tavistock Institute's classic study of productivity changes in the coal mining industry (Trist et al., 1963), and Woodward's studies in the 1960s (Woodward, 1965) had indicated dearly that organizational and social issues had a significant effect on the level of success obtained in utilizing new technology in the workplace. A prior study carried out by one of the authors (Land et al., 1983) had indicated that within a single organization the same system introduced into a number of different locations yielded widely different degrees of implementation success. That study suggested that a critical factor in success is the extent to which those who sponsor and champion the system share values with those who use or operate the system. Other studies (Heath, 1988) have suggested that a necessary condition for successful implementation is the presence of a 'product champion'.",

In this paper we present the results of our exploratory, empirical research into the practices and views of IS outsourcing. The research methodology of a questionnaire-based mail survey was used. The survey sample consisted of companies that were identified as the most effective users of IS by Computerworld magazine. The paper provides empirical evidence on the extent to which outsourcing of various IS functions is being practised, and the views of CIOs concerning the advantages, disadvantages and motives of IS outsourcing. The paper also sheds light on the relationship between various firm characteristics and IS outsourcing, and investigates the economics of, and decision-making processes in, IS outsourcing. There is a special focus on the comparison of USA-based and global IS outsourcing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Wine tasting is a multisensory collective activity because it involves other senses in addition to sight and hearing. The importance of these multiple senses for wine tasting makes it more challenging to digitalize than other collective activities. We conducted an ethnography and used a semiotic analysis to explore the strategies to digitalize wine tasting sessions. In so doing, we examined how small artisanal winemakers and wine merchants in Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland moved their wine tasting sessions online to compensate for their lost key revenue streams during the global Covid-19 crisis. Based on our analysis, we present a typology of virtual wine tasting and illustrate how the approach to digitalize wine tasting evolved from a reactive approach to a more proactive one. We also identify strategies to digitalize wine tasting and characterize its social space. We discuss some avenues to regard virtual wine tasting as something more than just a digital representation of in-person wine tasting session by highlighting the mediating role of an information system. Finally, we propose some implications for digitalizing other multisensory collective activities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Championing is key to the success of an IT implementation. Recently, changes in the nature of technologies used in organizational contexts and changing organizational structures call for a renewed focus on IT championing to explain its distributed nature. Following an analytic induction approach and drawing from semi-structured interviews with 37 practitioners (physicians, residents, nurses, IT staff, and administrators) in three healthcare-related settings, the study conceptualizes distributed IT championing as a process constituted of multiple individuals’ behaviors, unfolding over time, that proactively go beyond formal job requirements in support of an IT implementation. While multiple individuals may enact similar championing behaviors, the data indicate that multiple individuals may also enact distinct, yet complementary, championing behaviors over the course of the IT implementation. Overall, distributed IT championing evolves through cycles of distinct stages of bridging-in, bonding, and bridging-out, with each stage being shaped by different dimensions of social capital. Also, IT artifacts that are particularly generative appear more conducive to distributed IT championing than closed ones. This article contributes to extant literature on IT championing by developing a process model of distributed IT championing in the context of an IT implementation. </jats:p>",

The organization was seeking ways in which to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity through technology management. Robotics process automation was strategically deployed to automate their business processes. Although many benefits are associated with robotics process automation, the details of how it can be implemented successfully into existing infrastructure are not well known. This teaching case focuses on problems with how to automate processes in two locations and deals also with the resources and tools and techniques related to project execution. In addition, the case also points to future issues and challenges related to robotics process automation, cognitive tools, and blockchain integration. Students, researchers, and practitioners will obtain an understanding of the benefits and project activities required for robotics process automation and learn how to anticipate future issues and challenges including how to leverage the current implementation into future intelligent automation initiatives.",

    "title": "An ERP Implementation Case Study from a Knowledge Transfer Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> An enterprise resource planning (ERP) application is an enterprise-wide package that tightly integrates all necessary business functions into a single system with a shared database. An ERP implementation often entails transferring the business knowledge incorporated in the basic architecture of the software package into the adopting organization. This article proposes a new approach to analysing ERP implementations from a knowledge transfer perspective. It also contributes to a better understanding of competitive advantage based on process knowledge when standardized business processes are implemented by an organization. The article begins by identifying the types of knowledge transferred during an ERP implementation and the factors affecting this transfer. It then investigates how conflicts between the business knowledge transferred from the ERP package and the existing organizational knowledge are resolved. During our investigation, we used in-depth interviews, process analysis and documentation analysis in order to analyse an early implementation stage of ERP. The results indicated that the business processes which are incorporated in an ERP package are transferred into an organization along with the business rules inherent in the processes due to process automation, the limited flexibility of such packages and the cross-functional nature of an ERP package. The results also suggested that an organization's adaptive capability concerning role and responsibility redistribution, the development of new types of required knowledge and the introduction of a different knowledge structure influence an organization's ability to internalize these standardized processes into business routines that provide a competitive advantage </jats:p>",

He offers not only relevant points of critique but works towards reframing the debate about technologies’ impact on work. We join him in this effort, however, we challenge him to deepen and sharpen his arguments. Moreover, we are uncomfortable with his style as it undermines the very credibility that we see as crucial to the ability of academia to contribute to public discourse. In this commentary we examine what we find to be the two main contributions of his article and attempt to expand these perspectives to set the stage for a more nuanced view.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Low-code platforms can provide a learning environment that integrates academic theory with practical experiences, allowing students to experience real-world ISD projects. Such a pedagogy is known as work-integrated learning (WIL). In a low-code WIL course, the focus is on the practical development experiences and the delivery of a business application based on client’s requirements. Yet, the real-world ISD experiences may inhibit metacognition, which is essential for students to succeed in future learning of digital innovations. Without metacognition, students struggle to learn how to learn and be reflective about their learning. This study uses a mixed-method design and draws on Flavell’s (1979) theoretical framework to examine metacognition in the context of low-code WIL. In particular, the study examines the effect of learner-oriented factors and task-oriented factors on metacognition and its impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge confidence, app delivery, and grade. The quantitative results indicate that metacognition is influenced by motivation, the strategic approach, and autonomy, whereas self-efficacy beliefs have no effect. The learning outcomes are also achieved. Qualitative results (students’ essays and apps) corroborate the quantitative results while also providing additional insights into the learning in low-code WIL showing the impact of the platform and agile ISD practices on metacognition. Overall, this study offers IS educators a better understanding of how low-code platforms can foster learning-to-learn while providing real-world practical experiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It has long been argued that we need to consider much more than an observed point estimate and a p-value to understand statistical results. One of the most persistent misconceptions about p-values is that they are necessarily calculated assuming a null hypothesis of no effect is true. Instead, p-values can and should be calculated for multiple hypothesized values for the effect size. For example, a p-value function allows us to visualize results continuously by examining how the p-value varies as we move across possible effect sizes. For more focused discussions, a 95% confidence interval shows the subset of possible effect sizes that have p-values larger than 0.05 as calculated from the same data and the same background statistical assumptions. In this sense a confidence interval can be taken as showing the effect sizes that are most compatible with the data, given the assumptions, and thus may be better termed a compatibility interval. The question that should then be asked is whether any or all of the effect sizes within the interval are substantial enough to be of practical importance. </jats:p>",

We urge future information systems research to emphasize, with equal vigor, the joint goals of compassion and financial gains from information and communication technologies.

We also discuss how certain core assumptions underlying traditional information systems research—so far, driven primarily by economic value as outcome—would need to change in order to support this new agenda emphasizing compassion and economic value as complementary and synergistic outcomes. We provide a brief concrete illustration of this proposed agenda, and its underlying revised assumptions, by drawing on the example of a prominent field of study in information systems research, namely health information systems research. </jats:p>",

Subjects reported the completion of only one of every four systems development projects within their estimates.

Organizations using sophisticated cost estimating software packages were less successful at preventing large cost overruns than organizations not using them. However, the use of the estimator as system developer, the careful monitoring of systems development projects, and the inclusion in performance evaluations of success in meeting estimates were associated with more accurate cost estimating. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite its prevalence, there is a lack of understanding regarding the effect of telework on an organization’s knowledge base. Recognizing the enabling role of electronic communication media, this article therefore addresses the interaction effects of media synchronicity and temporal as well as spatial separation among colleagues on sharing in knowledge networks. Special attention is paid to knowledge awareness (a form of metaknowledge representing “who knows what”) as well as homogeneous and heterogeneous knowledge sources to further explicate the relationship between coworker separation and knowledge sharing. Multiple surveys were placed between two smaller ethnographic investigations and combined with whole network data to form an in-depth study of 64 knowledge workers at a medium-sized European research and advisory organization. The results reveal that spatial separation directly reduces the frequency of knowledge sharing between colleagues, whereas temporal separation affects knowledge sharing through reduced knowledge awareness, resulting in lower job and proactive performance. The use of asynchronous media can serve to mitigate most of the negative effects of spatial separation on knowledge sharing but may also exacerbate the negative effect of temporal separation on teleworkers’ knowledge awareness of colleagues with identical expertise. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Demystifying beliefs about the natural sciences in information system",
    "abstract": "Beliefs about natural science have been influential in information system (IS; Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991).1 For example, a belief exists that ‘the methods of natural science constitute the only legitimate methods for use in social science’ (Evaristo and Karahanna, 1997: 39). These legitimate methods include the use of ‘quantitative empirical methodologies—field experiment, survey, and laboratory experiments’ (Evaristo and Karahanna, 1997: 39). Understandably, many qualitative IS scholars have reported serious pressure to meet such standards. For example, De Vaujany et al. (2011) asserted that ‘in order to survive, the IS field had to draw on a model of research attributed to the natural sciences’ (p. 405). Similarly, Lyytinen and King (2004) referred to the ‘orthodox’ view in IS, according to which the IS ‘field’s survival depended on . . . drawing on a model of research attributed to the natural sciences’ (p. 222). If quantitative methodologies are the only legitimate scientific methods, then how did those IS scholars who did not use quantitative (e.g. statistical) research methods survive? One strategy was to accept the orthodox position: ‘Organizational researchers must try harder to make the study of organizations fit the natural science model, since (according to the positivist approach) this is the only way in which organizational research can become truly scientific’ (Lee, 1991: 343). This strategy aimed to show how qualitative studies could meet the alleged natural science beliefs or how ‘[q]ualitative research is just as able as quantitative research to follow certain fundamental principles of . . . scientific reasoning’ (Lee and Hubona, 2009: 237). Furthermore, the strategy led to the development of the ‘natural science model of social science’ in IS (Lee, 1989; Lee and Hubona, 2009; Ngwenyama and Lee, 1997). This oft-cited model endeavours to reflect ‘how research proceeds in physics, biology, and other natural sciences’ (Ngwenyama and Lee, 1997: 149). Seminal studies have reported that ‘the natural science model of social science’ is ‘now widely accepted’ (Klein and Myers, 1999: 67) and has ‘become [the] de facto standard’ (Klein and Myers, 1999: 69) for case studies in IS. Other strategies for justifying qualitative approaches have varied even more. A common tactic has been to make a sharp distinction between the natural sciences and social sciences. The former is sometimes characterized as objective, positivistic, and quantitative, while the latter is regarded as qualitative and interpretive (e.g. Orlikowski and Baroudi, 1991). This tactic does not question the existing natural science beliefs in IS; rather, it attempts to show that these beliefs are unsuitable for qualitative research, or that qualitative research benefits from alternative approaches. For example, Klein and Myers (1999) noted, ‘While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies’ (p. 67). These developments resulted in natural science methodological beliefs being formulated by various parties: those who view quantitative methods as the methods of natural science, those who advocate the ‘natural science model’, and those who view natural science beliefs as inappropriate for qualitative (or interpretive) research. A similar trend has continued in design science. For instance, the most frequently cited design-science article in IS separates ‘behavioural science’ from design science, noting that the former ‘has roots in natural science research methods’ (Hevner et al., 2004: 76). In IS, certain beliefs are customarily distinguished as belonging to the realm of natural science, with others belonging to social science with such a distinction described as the ‘technical-natural science-positivistic paradigm vs social constructivist-social scienceinterpretive paradigm’ (Iivari, 2008: 171). None of these parties has questioned whether the prevailing beliefs about natural science in IS are supported Demystifying beliefs about the natural sciences in information system",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we consider how the notion of the negotiated order can be reinterpreted by drawing on ideas from sociomateriality. We argue that the negotiated order is an ongoing accomplishment in which a heterogeneous set of situated sociomaterial practices (or actors) are implicated. To do this, we draw upon an in-depth study of the use of a computerised physician order entry system in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. We explore how a computerised physician order entry system, as a new sociomaterial actor, performatively repositions the actors involved and hence offers the conditions of possibility for medical work practices to be renegotiated. We show that it is often contingent, mundane, situated sociomaterial practices that enact the conditions under which the negotiated order becomes re-established in terms of division of labour, legitimacy, collaboration, and social capital. We argue that as the social and material are co-constitutive, or intra-actional, it makes more sense to talk about the negotiated intra-actional order rather than the negotiated order. Importantly, such a change in conceptual vocabulary reveals the empirical and ontological issues at stake; essential for a more nuanced understanding of change/becoming. </jats:p>",

Organizations and their sourcing practices have been undergoing significant shifts in the digital era, involving not only human but also technology agency (e.g., artificial intelligence), malleable digital assets that can be flexibly recombined (e.g., in platform ecosystems and low-code development), and digital technology that attenuates bounded rationality (e.g., generative artificial intelligence). Such fundamental changes call for the re-examination of such past assumptions in the IS sourcing literature.

Asynchronous groupware tools, such as electronic messaging systems, have found widespread use in organizations yet very little field research exists on how PI groups are affected by such tools. We try to fill this gap with a field study of the effects of asynchronous groupware support on seven PI groups in two New Zealand organizations. Our study indicates that, while not having perceived negative effects on group effectiveness, asynchronous groupware support was perceived as increasing process adoption, hierarchy suppression, departmental heterogeneity and contribution length and decreasing discussion duration, cost and interaction in PI groups. We argue that, based on these findings, the use of asynchronous groupware tools is likely to be beneficial in PI projects, particularly where a large number of PI groups proposing incremental process changes is conducted. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Continuous development extends the agile approach and focuses on bringing valuable services to users with the aim of achieving a continuous flow of learning and development in short cycles. The objective of this work is to theorize the idea of continuous development in the context of digital infrastructure evolution and explore the organizational interactions underlying continuous development. By drawing on literature on digital infrastructure theory and continuous development as it has emerged as an idea from the DevOps thinking expanded from agile, we outline main characteristics of continuous development and propose a theoretical definition of continuous development in organizational contexts. Then, in answering our research question “which patterns of interactions can be identified in the continuous development of digital infrastructures?”, we conducted a longitudinal case study at a Norwegian grid company and explored how a specific digital infrastructure evolved through continuous development. We identified generic interaction patterns with two cycles of sense-giving and sense-making between organizational actors, enabling the continuous development of the digital infrastructure. Our findings and model of interaction patterns offer a nuanced perspective on both digital infrastructure evolution and established views of sense-making and sense-giving mechanisms, as well as new ways to think about digitalization in incumbent firms. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Polyhierarchic Model of Intelligence",
    "abstract": "It has been said that we humans are `starfolle, creatures who have 'emerged from 'star-stuff'.1 This is a dramatic way of expressing one consequence of the current theory that all the chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were synthesized in the interiors of stars billions of years ago. Such new perspectives on our place in the universe can have the emotional force of great imagery in literature. One thinks, for instance, of the famous lines in Act IV of The Tempest, during which Prospero declares: We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.' In his book The Future of Intelligence, Victor Serebriakoff explores the nature of intelligence in its broadest sense, and in the course of his exposition puts forward several ideas which provide just such new ways of evaluating our position in the scheme of things. In this critique I shall discuss these, and other issues he raises, relating them where I can to the work of others in the field. It would be presumptuous of me to pretend that what I offer here is any more than a very superficial treatment of the material involved.",

    "title": "A Framework for Deciding what to Outsource in Information Technology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The theory and background of outsourcing are examined from a general perspective. It is concluded that the pressures to outsource activities can best be understood through two main sources: the work of organization theorists on the management of organizational complexity and the transaction economics approach of Williamson which argues the virtues of provision of many organizational services through market mechanisms rather than by internal departments. Within IT, the early motivation for outsourcing was the cost reduction one implied by the Williamson approach. However, a number of authors have argued that the complexity of managing IT outsourcing means that it is often preferable to try to improve the efficiency of internal suppliers. This suggests that there is a need to develop a framework that will enable a decision to be made about what to outsource and what to insource. A model is applied to the IT sourcing decision. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Interoperability promotes data-driven practices by enabling the aggregation and sharing of data from distributed information systems. It thus offers potential benefits to organizations for delivering more efficient and sustainable services. Despite its potentials, achieving interoperability remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we shed light on the obscure landscape of organizational challenges that lead to low interoperability. Based on a 3-year longitudinal single-case study of a public agency’s attempts to enhance interoperability, we uncover how three major categories of equivocality – scope, needs, and priorities – hinder approaches to interoperability at the data, software, and IT levels. We also reveal that entangled organizational tensions explain why such equivocalities emerge. By analyzing interoperability challenges from the combined concepts of equivocality and tensions, this paper offers a unique perspective on their intricate nature, making sense of the obscure landscape of challenges in various approaches to interoperability. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Improving the governance of information technology: Insights from the history of Internet governance",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Governance of the Internet is a matter of global importance and concern. The multi-stakeholder (MS) and multilateral (ML) forms have been presented as two competing and plausible models of Internet governance. Drawing on actor–network theory (ANT) and building on an interpretive case study of rich archival data, this paper examines how the focal actor’s (i.e. the U.S. government’s) beliefs influence the choice of Internet governance form. It further explores the strategies of the focal actor to translate the interests of the ML network’s supporters, with a view to enrolling them in the MS governance network. The analysis shows how the focal actor has established the MS governance form through the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as an Obligatory Passage Point to keep the Internet successfully operational. The analysis also illuminates the combination of structural and collaborative strategies employed to allay the growing dissatisfaction with the MS governance form. The paper suggests that whilst the protocols and technical standards of the Internet are increasingly relegated to the background, the social and political network that Internet artefacts draw together in a meta-form has grown in prominence. It also argues that there may be a hierarchy of beliefs, which influence how actors enact their translation strategies. Finally, the paper discusses parallels between the MS/ML forms of Internet governance and IT governance in organizational contexts. </jats:p>",

It is argued through the cyber-ethnographic examination of two virtual communities that, interpretative research methods traditionally associated with the social sciences enforce preconceived ideas and normative frameworks on to the virtual community. Cyber-ethnography allows a reflexive methodology to emerge, thus enabling the participants of virtual communities to define their own reality and perimeters. It is propounded that there are two elements to the virtual community. First, it is emphasized that a hybrid space is rapidly emerging that is neither absolutely physical or virtual. Through its convergence with the physical the virtual community's existence is apparent, though not unconditionally virtual. Secondly, the participants are depicted as having a transitory, unconditional relationship with the virtual community. That is; they will only participate for short periods when they require use of the resources that the virtual community has to offer. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although well over 1000 journal articles, conference papers, books, technical notes and theses have been written on the subject of information technology (IT) evaluation, only a relatively small subset of this literature has been concerned with the core issues of what precisely is meant by the term ‘value’ and with the process of making (specifically) IT investment decisions. All too often, the problem and highly complex issue of value is either simplified, ignored or assumed away. Instead the focus of much of the research to date has been on evaluation methodologies and, within this literature, there are different strands of thought which can be classified as partisan, composite and meta approaches to evaluation. Research shows that a small number of partisan techniques are used by most decision makers with a minority using a single technique and a majority using a mixture of such techniques of whom a substantial minority use a formal composite approach. It is argued that, in mapping the set of evaluation methodologies on to what is termed the investment opportunity space, that there is a limit to what can be achieved by formal rational evaluation methods. This limit becomes evident when decision makers fall back on ‘gut feel’ and other non-formal/rigorous ways of making decisions. It is suggested that an understanding of these more complex processes and decision making, in IT as elsewhere, needs tools drawn from philosophy and psychology. </jats:p>",

New technology may be appropriated to the teaching of information systems namely the use of Self-Monitoring And Reactive Tutoring Systems (SMARTS). These systems will include elements of intelligent tutoring systems, artificial intelligence, hypermedia, information tracing and students’ thought processes. A framework outlining the objects or elements of a SMART and their relationships is presented as an initial guide to researchers interested in further development of these technologies. Mention is also made of an experiment underway in the USA on customized text book publishing which provides tailored resource material chosen by the lecturer for a particular subject which is then published as the customized text for that subject. </jats:p>",

When I finished the book though, the first chapter seemed concise and short enough. One has to start somewhere and Steve Pollitt does not labour the point anywhere in his short book. Its conciseness is indeed one of its major qualities. The topic is also well covered and very up to date (with English examples which makes a change from the numerous American books). There are many figures, illustrations and examples of real systems. Any recent text on computerised retrieval systems which does not give pictures of real screens should be questioned. Pollitt would certainly agree with this statement and this illustrative approach is another major quality of his book.",

    "abstract": "to information systems (IS) academics. Change occurs so quickly in our domain of study. Some technologies build on their predecessors, some replace them. Likewise, the demands of businesses change. Some competitive ideas leave an enduring legacy while others dissolve almost without trace. As a researcher who wants to have an impact you must gamble. On the one hand, you may opt for a current problem within a hot topic such as disintermediation within electronic retail. The advantages of this strategy are many. It is stimulating work because it breaks new ground, there are fewer competitor researchers, there are fewer knowledge barriers to entry into the ® eld and there is an eager market awaiting your results. The reward comes through making an impact, with the associated bene® ts of reputation, citations and the buzz of being at the leading edge. The problems are that it is hard to conclude anything with certainty while the research is in its developmental stages, the pressure is intense to achieve quick results, the problem you tackle may prove intractable and there is little by way of prior research on which to build. The risk you take is that your expertise will be obsolete by the time you have developed it to maturity. Thus, in our earlier example, electronic retail, with or without disintermediation, may prove pro® table for so few lines of business that your expertise becomes devalued. On the other hand, you may seek out an enduring problem such as escalating commitment to failing projects. The advantages are that you are immune to fashion, there is probably an incremental base of knowledge and you have the time to undertake disciplined research in order to achieve rigorous results. The reward is that you can fashion a research career with a degree of certainty. The problems are that market pressure to deliver results is lower, there is less buzz, there are more competitors (or partial competitors who have dabbled in your topic) and it is harder to sell the importance of your ® ndings. To a lesser extent, you too face the risk that the problem you have chosen may just not prove to be enduring ± for example, researchers who have devoted themselves to systems development methods for in-house information technology (IT), an apparently enduring topic, confront this risk today as ® rms migrate to packaged software solutions offered by vendors and application service providers. Of course, the truly smart researchers are those who are able to parlay their expertise in one or more enduring problems into knowledge relevant to the latest hot topic. Earl and Feeny’s (2000) recent article in the Sloan Management Review about the required characteristics of chief executive of® cers (CEOs) in the new economy is just such an example. The Journal of Information Technology is keen to publish research relating to both the enduring and the up to the minute. Both have a place. Both are needed. We recognize though that each offers distinct advantages and faces distinct problems. As a result different criteria apply. We know that articles dealing with hot topics are likely to have been rapidly researched and may have a less focused literature base. However, they do need to argue clearly why what they say is important. With the enduring topics, importance has typically been established by the community’s continuing interest. What authors can do to develop their value is to relate them more clearly to today’ s current topics. In order to sustain the argument that our research is relevant in this dynamic world we need to develop the practical implications of our studies diligently. This often requires a shift in mindset for the academic researcher. If your research ® ndings are provisional, mixed or tentative it may seem premature. Nevertheless, if you believe that you are studying an important topic, you believe you know the literature relating to it and you understand your own results, you should be better placed than anybody to give advice to practitioners. Executives are always taking decisions under uncertainty, so why should you not give advice under uncertainty? Ask yourself, what do you really believe is the meaning of your research. How would you use it if you were a practitioner in the relevant situation? A good test for any article is to ask what do we know now that we did not know before, what can we do now that we could not do before and what difference does it make. Articles which pass this test are those which others read and cite. The current issue offers a balance of hot topics and research on enduring problems. The ® rst piece by Michel Avital and Betty Vandenbosch is a combination of research and innovation. It uses research to construct a case which challenges students in the classroom.

This approach differs from previous research which has concentrated on learning from frauds which have occurred. The main enquiry was by means of a questionnaire sent to members of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Verification and additional information was forthcoming by visiting some respondents. </jats:p><jats:p> Almost a fifth of internal audit departments reported that they had no specific responsibility for either prevention or detection of computer fraud. It was clear that where responsibility was acknowledged, it is generally on an informal basis or is self imposed. </jats:p><jats:p> Internal auditors reported that most reliance was placed on computer assisted tools and manual techniques like input/output reconciliation for detection of computer fraud. Few of the organisations surveyed had any laid down guidelines what to do in the case of a fraud discovery. Where guidelines did exist they called for dismissal and prosecution. In smaller firms, external auditors have a larger role in the prevention and detection of computer fraud than in larger firms. </jats:p><jats:p> Opinion on the prevention and detection of computer fraud included the view that as network systems become more common, so detection and prevention will become more difficult. In addition it was claimed that management did not appreciate the level of the threat. Internal auditors feel that they have a role to play, but highlighted the fact that there is a shortage of staff with the requisite skills. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The digital transformation of the FinTech industry has revealed a plethora of significant challenges for industry decision makers and wider stakeholder groups as organisations contend with the onset of new regulatory frameworks, legacy systems, flexible business models and alignment with corporate social responsibility practice. The reshaping of organisations and drive to greater levels of decentralisation and employee centric practice, presents a cultural shift for the sector, with implications for the success and resulting benefits of change across the industry. This study aims to develop novel insight to the ‘lived in’ impact of digital transformation within the FinTech industry from a factor interdependency perspective. This research adopts a mixed methods approach incorporating Interpretive Structural Modelling, Analytical Hierarchy Process and interviews with expert participants, to offer a unique perspective on the challenges and unintended consequences of industry level technological change. The findings highlight the high levels of interdependency and priority for challenges related to the investment in products and infrastructure for new markets, criticality of stakeholder support and development of a digital mindset for the adoption of new technologies. </jats:p>",

This paper analyses how outcomes tied to ICT innovation are shaped by choices about whether and how to use, or not use, the technology to reconfigure access to people, services, information and technologies in ways that significantly change the communicative power of individuals, communities, organisations, nations and regions. It explains why these outcomes are not predetermined by the technology, but unfold over time through the complex interplay among many actors, in many arenas. A framework is presented to assist in addressing the issue of digital divides and other areas of research, policy and practice affected by the design and use of broadband Internet and related ICTs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How can firms improve the degree of social alignment between their business and IT units? Many years of research have shown the importance of business-IT alignment and its various facets, yet research on the efficacy of IT governance mechanisms to improve business-IT alignment is scarce. In this paper, we develop a model of social alignment at the operational level that considers the degree of social capital between an organization's business and IT units, IT personnel's business understanding, and a set of formal and informal IT governance mechanisms that drive the creation of social alignment and business value. Using survey data from 132 US banks, we show that social alignment is driven to varying degrees by a broad variety of IT governance mechanisms ranging from top management support and IT representation on the executive board to joint IT planning and IS training, regular meeting cycles, and liaison units. Our research contributes substantially to the practical demand on business-IT alignment research for an effective toolkit of IT governance mechanisms. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the impact and analysis of language and linguistic communication during requirements development is still an open issue. In our research, we claim that requirements development depends on the ability to deal with language and communication issues in practice and reach shared understanding of requirements. We propose the concept of language quality as a suitable means for analyzing the emergence of coherent and meaningful requirements. By applying the thereby developed dimensions of language quality to a real information systems development project, we are able to obtain practice-grounded propositions to further evaluate the consequences of different actions on the interaction and communication process of stakeholders in requirements development. </jats:p>",

Coupled with the increasing levels of mobile Internet connectivity, broadband may allow for a new round of changed patterns in the ways computers are used. Direct effects models of the deployment, use, value and futures of broadband connectivity are unlikely to cope with the social and technological complexity of broadband. A socio-technical theoretical perspective, with its emphasis on the complex relations among social and technical aspects of a phenomenon, can provide useful insight into the potential societal impact, institutional effects and changes to individual work and life behaviours that may arise from the increasing level of bandwidth available.

    "title": "Exploring Temporal Coordination of Events with Facebook.com",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The coordination of a social event requires a number of time-bounded tasks (exact time, location, activities of the event) to be determined prior to the event. On university campuses, Facebook is increasingly used to organize ad hoc physical gatherings within social groups. The coordination takes place via Facebook event pages and a ‘wall’ that represent online, shared, interactive spaces. This paper explores how such online interactive spaces facilitate the temporal coordination of social events. We content analyze Facebook's event pages and walls to understand how social group behavior is different from prevailing theories of group task progress and media use. The results suggest that, similar to many work groups, social groups exhibit differential interactive behaviors before and after the midpoint of when the event is created on Facebook and when the offline activity is going to happen. However, the results differ in the sense that the interactive behavior is highest before rather than after the midpoint. We also found that the involvement of the creator of the event pages is associated with higher interactive behavior of the social group. We discuss the findings and derive implications for the design of online tools for social event management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Once an organization has adopted packaged software, upgrades to newer versions are inevitable. Anecdotal reports suggest that software upgrades are extremely costly and may not bring actual benefit to stakeholders in the organization. Because software upgrades recur periodically, it is important to understand the impacts of software upgrades on organizational stakeholders. In this study, we examine the impact of packaged software upgrades from the perspectives of IS staff and IS users. A dual case study was conducted to understand the impacts of an SAP upgrade and a Windows upgrade. Our study shows that there are two essential costs in each upgrade, the cost of implementation and the costs of users’ learning. Moreover, not all users experience positive impacts from software upgrade. Users’ experience of beneficial impact is contingent upon users’ explicit adoption of useful new features and improvement in features that users use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a multi-method analysis of the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. It argues the majority of research treats these systems as having essential technical properties that enable them to bring about positive organisational effects. In contrast, we adopt a post-essentialist perspective that understands discourse as constructing ERP systems, rather than reflecting their essential properties. Discourse analysis of interviews and focus groups was used to compare justifications for the implementation produced by members of the ERP project team with end users’ reactions to the system. In contrast to previous studies, this opens the ERP black box by illustrating how the capabilities of these systems, and their organisational effects, are constructed through language. Moreover, it demonstrates the important function these constructions perform in legitimising or undermining ERP implementation. Statistical analysis of post-implementation questionnaires identified the predictors of established measures of users’ reactions to IT systems. By comparing these data with end users’ discursive reactions to the project, we identify several constructs for inclusion in future studies of users’ reactions to ERP systems. The paper concludes by summarising the contributions and limitations of the study and its implications for future research and practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology-mediated learning (TML) is a major trend in education, since it allows to integrate the strengths of traditional- and IT-based learning activities. However, TML providers still struggle in identifying areas for improvement in their TML offerings. One reason for their struggles is inconsistencies in the literature regarding drivers of TML performance. Prior research suggests that these inconsistencies in TML literature might stem from neglecting the importance of considering the process perspective in addition to the input and outcome perspectives. This gap needs to be addressed to better understand the different drivers of the performance of TML scenarios. Filling this gap would further support TML providers with more precise guidance on how to (re-)design their offerings toward their customers’ needs. To achieve our goal, we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and evaluate a holistic model for assessing TML performance. In particular, we consolidate the body of literature, followed by a focus group workshop and a Q-sorting exercise with TML practitioners, and an empirical pre-study to develop and initially test our research model. Afterward, we collect data from 161 participants of TML vocational software trainings and evaluate our holistic model for assessing TML performance. The results provide empirical evidence for the importance of the TML process quality dimension as suggested in prior literature and highlighted by our TML practitioners. Our main theoretical as well as practical contribution is a holistic model that provides comprehensive insights into which constructs and facets shape the performance of TML in vocational software trainings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Offshoring of services will shape the economic landscape for the coming decades, and present opportunities and challenges for individuals, organizations, and countries. Many countries are jostling in the global services marketplace to take advantage of the emerging opportunities. The success of an organization's offshoring initiative depends critically on the selection of a right destination; a wrong choice may result in a failure and impose significant costs. This paper presents a framework to assess the attractiveness of a target country, which identifies various motivating, inhibiting, and facilitating factors that may influence its attractiveness. The framework is used to analyze the future attractiveness of India, a topic that continues to be debated. The relative attractiveness of other potential competitors for offshoring of services is also discussed. Contrary to other analysts’ opinions, we conclude that India is likely to sustain its leading position for a long time in the services sector, and that it is likely to emerge as a global hub for the delivery of services, analogous to China's role in the manufacturing sector. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is ample evidence of deviations between the actual and planned interaction structures between a firm's IT department and business units. Such deviations can hinder senior managers from governing their IT organizations effectively because they do not know how work really gets done. This paper develops an explanation for why actual structures differ from planned structures. Understanding this phenomenon is indispensable for managers to govern the real organization, to uphold compliance with important standards (e.g., ITIL, COBIT), to decide whether the formal or the actual organization is more effective, and, finally, to identify management actions that support the optimal structure. To develop this understanding, we analyze the interaction structures at the interface between firms’ business units and IT units in four rich cases, using data from 56 interviews and 47 questionnaires, and applying qualitative methods and social network analysis, which give us deep insights into planned and actual interaction among employees. We test two different explanations for deviations of actual from planned interaction structures and find that boundary-spanning theory provides the dominant explanation for such deviations: Inclined to span the business/IT boundary most effectively, the actors involved deviate from planned structures especially when other structures offer better boundary-spanning potential, which is influenced primarily by cross-domain knowledge. In addition, relationships also play an important role. On the positive side, relationships provide opportunities for such deviations, while on the negative side, a conflict-laden relationship might hinder deviations even if they were advantageous. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> For three decades, research has investigated the role of information systems integration (ISI) in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). This research has improved our understanding of the M&amp;A IS challenges and their solutions. However, consolidation and integration across the research is limited. To redress this omission, we review 70 articles published between 1989 and 2016. To do this, we adopt and extend the methodology developed by Lacity and her colleagues to review the empirical evidence in a fragmented IT literature. We code 53 dependent variables and 195 independent variables to identify the robust relationships among them and to model how ISI decisions, including the choice of IS integration methods, partially mediate the effects of the independent variables on ISI outcomes. Examining the relationships in this model, we identify five quasi-independent thematic domains on which we draw to develop an agenda for future research. Our contribution is the aggregation, organization and structuring of the empirical findings in the M&amp;A ISI literature as a basis on which to develop a cumulative knowledge process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Tool support for information systems (IS) development can be considered from many perspectives, and it is not surprising that different stakeholders perceive such tools very differently. This can contribute on one side to poor selection processes and ineffective deployment of CASE, and on another to inappropriate tool development. In this paper, the relationship between CASE-tools and IS development methods is considered from three stakeholder perspectives: concept developer, IS developer and product developer. These perspectives, and the tensions between them, are characterised within a ‘stakeholder triangle’. Some of the major issues related to each tension are highlighted, and the triangle is then used to consider the importance, and implications for all stakeholders, of considering all tensions together. In particular, we suggest that the concept of ‘method in action’ be complemented by that of ‘method in tool’. We believe that these insights will contribute to the continuing debate on how to reduce adoption failures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Institutional theory has proven to be a central analytical perspective for investigating the role of social and historical structures of information systems (IS) implementation. However, it does not explicitly account for how organisational actors make sense of and enact technologies in their local context. We address this limitation by exploring the potential of using institutional theory with sensemaking theory to study IS implementation in organisations. We argue that each theoretical perspective has its own explanatory power and that a combination of the two facilitates a much richer interpretation of IS implementation by linking macro- and micro-levels of analysis. To illustrate this, we report from an empirical study of the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system in a clinical setting. Using key constructs from the two theories, our findings address the phenomenon of implementing EPRs at three levels: the organisational field, the organisational/group, and the individual/socio-cognitive level. The study shows how a rationalised myth of an efficient EPR system has travelled from the organisational field to the hospital ward and on to individual doctors. The findings also provide evidence of a strong human agency by showing how doctors enact their work practices and shape the use of the EPR system. The study contributes to IS research by showing the need to address macro-level structures, as well as individual interpretations and practical use situations, in order to identify how and why information systems are adopted by users. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the role and explanatory value of context-, task- and information-related characteristics vis-a-vis individual characteristics in relation with respect to the adoption of mobile technologies and applications. We combine insights from adoption and acceptance literature with media choice and task-technology fit theories. These insights are applied to a case in which police officers use mobile communication tools and information technologies. Officers were asked which mobile applications they preferred to use in specific situations (contexts) and for specific tasks. In a structural equation model focusing exclusively on individual TAM-related characteristics, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as on a generic media fit concept, the explanatory value of these concepts turns out to be high. We extend our study, based on Ajzen and Madden (1986) by arguing that, in addition to personal characteristics, contextual characteristics, in combination with task-related characteristics, play an important role in people's preferences for specific technologies. Conjoint analysis focusing on contextual and task-related characteristics yields relevant insights. When context-related and individual characteristics are combined into a single hierarchical linear model, the significance of the concepts used in TAM turns out to be low, while context-related issues stand out. On the basis of our research, we conclude that TAM models are too generic to fully explain people's intention to use mobile technologies. Future research should aim at developing models that take contextual and task-related factors into account when studying mobile applications. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is about a proposal to develop a component-based design (CBD) framework of the international information technology standardization (IITS) process. This process is criticized widely in information systems (IS) literatures for its complexity as a barrier to successful project development. These criticisms have not challenged this process itself or accede to proactive action toward positive changes. We stress the importance of reconstructing this process within a CBD framework, not only to reduce sources of complexity but also to give special prominence of project development. Primarily, our qualitative empirical case study of five projects is grounded in the organization information processing theory (OIPT) as a lens. Theorizing from the qualitative empirical evidence we define the IITS process, followed by its inductive analysis guided by OIPT as a lens through three levels: its environment, content and performance. Through this lens we articulate assumptions about IITS process complexity. From rich descriptions of this process, we combine selected dimensions of CBD and OIPT as a lens to develop the theoretical depth of concepts that add detail to our CBD framework. One implication for practice of this framework is for provisioning incisive IITS process change strategies drawing upon its dominating qualities. This article makes three contributions to the IS field: this CBD framework is a key contribution. We bridge the gap in knowledge by defining the IITS process, explicating its complexity toward proactive action. By using OIPT as a lens we extend its application. </jats:p>",

This paper categorizes the global distribution of authors and their research methods. Five research streams are identified, including human behaviors in IS adoption and use, IS management, e-Business, social media, digital collaborations and group support, and industry and societal issues in IS. While each stream is examined in detail, we specifically pay attention to the effect of the Chinese context in each paper and the approaches to contextualizing the research.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The automotive industry must significantly change its outdated and unprofitable ‘sell-from-stock’ business model to a streamlined ‘build-to-order’ model. Extra-organizational systems (EOS) enable multiple firms to share industry-level systems linked by electronic portals and hubs. Successful EOS implementation requires a coordinated effort among various stakeholders including customers, dealers, vehicle manufacturers, first- and second-tier suppliers and logistics firms. However, each of these stakeholders erects different but significant structural, managerial, user and technical barriers to EOS. This paper analyses these stakeholder barriers and prescribes how they must be managed in order to implement EOS successfully. Three recommendations raise concern over (1) the differentiation between EOS and inter-organizational systems, (2) industry dynamics, particularly the role of suppliers and customers and (3) supply topology, i.e. the importance of World Wide Web services and standards in creating electronic markets. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this study is to explore the use of Enterprise Social Networks (ESN), namely, Yammer and Chatter, using the lens of resistance and deployment of workarounds among individuals employed in a large, service sector organization. By doing so, we can illustrate the motivation behind individual use of ESN within a large organization, the reasons for not using it and the outcomes of their choices on the organization's performance and day-today activities. The research approach of our study involves employing a qualitative approach and adopting the interpretive research perspective. Our findings illustrate that there are several bottom-up and top-down pressures, which effectively hinder the adequate or successful use of ESN and drive user resistance and workarounds. The contributions of our study are manifold. First, since ESN are actively considered by organizations, our findings can inform policymakers on the issues that might arise beyond implementation, more so, during the actual use of the system. In other words, the results of this research can shed light on the areas where their efforts are best placed. At a theoretical level, our study enriches the extant literature associated with adoption issues, by explaining that ESN involve multi-level organizational characteristics found within a specific context of use, that of ESN. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The application of e-ordering systems has brought significant changes to the drug distribution industry in China, but the effects of these changes have remained unclear. Adopting a practice perspective and based on longitudinal data collection using multiple methods, we reveal that the Chinese drug distribution practice has passed through the following three stages: the stage before e-ordering, the transitional stage in which the government attempted to impose a centralised platform, and the current fragmented systems stage. We draw upon the theoretical foundations of the network relations model and the boundary spanning theory developed by Schultze and Orlikowski and Levina and Vaast, respectively, to formulate a taxonomic framework for understanding inter-firm network practices. Applying the framework to explain long-term changes in drug distribution in China, we discover that the practice in the field has evolved from traditional, socially embedded relations to information systems-based, socially embedded relations, while the centralised platform deployed by the government was unable to establish a practice with arm's length relations. Our theoretical work contributes an integrated framework for studying inter-firm practices that explicitly incorporates the presence of inter-organisational information systems. Our empirical findings offer helpful practical insights for facilitating collective efforts toward the innovative use of novel IT in the drug distribution industry in China and in other contexts that are similar. </jats:p>",

    "title": "High-Frequency Trading and Conflict in the Financial Markets",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The last few decades has seen an ever-increasing growth in the way activities are productized and associated with a financial cost. This phenomenon, termed financialization, spans all areas including government, finance, health and manufacturing. Recent developments within finance over that past decade have radically altered the way trading occurs. This paper analyses high-frequency trading (HFT) as a necessary component of the infrastructure that makes financialization possible. Through interviews with HFT firms, a software vendor, regulators and banks, the effects of HFT on market efficiency, and its impact on costs to long-term investors are explored. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the conflict that exists between HFT and traditional market makers in today's fragmented markets. This paper argues that society should be unconcerned with this conflict and should instead focus on the effects these participants have on the long-term investors, for whom the markets ultimately exist. In order to facilitate the best outcomes, regulation should be simple, aimed at keeping participants’ behavior stable, and the interactions among them transparent and straightforward. Financialization and HFT are inextricably linked, and society is best served by ensuring that the creative energy of these market participants is directed on providing liquidity and removing inefficiencies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate information systems (IS) projects as a liminal space ‘betwixt and between’ the status quo and the new environment, using a case study of the implementation of an enterprise system (ES). This liminal space provides a stabilizing platform whereupon the project team can develop new and potentially transformative IS. However, after a project team has completed its initial IS design for roll-out, this liminal space must be bridged to incorporate process-generated learning and new systems back into the organizational working environment. We demonstrate how this bridging involves negotiations that attempt to reconcile divergent perspectives by adopting a conciliatory or peacemaking attitude. As such, our analysis focuses on the IS project as a multi-phased process that includes the creation of a liminal space for the project team during development and on the negotiations that ensure the ES becomes a working IS in the post-implementation environment. </jats:p>",

Much can be learned at the industry-level of analysis that might not be revealed in studies conducted at the organizational level of analysis. This article summarizes a case study of one industry - the US home mortgage industry - in order to illustrate three types of industry-level phenomena that surface when examining use of interorganizational IT-driven coordination systems: collective actions among industry participants, performance effects, and structural effects. Our discussion of case results distinguishes between industry outcomes that are the net result of the accumulation of organizational actions vs. outcomes where industry-level consequences are qualitatively different from what is observed at the organizational level. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Key Information Technology and Management Issues 2012-2013: An International Study",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of a very slow recovery from the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences in IT managerial and technical trends. Identifying these influential factors is one thing; the paper also looks at the challenges in addressing them, taking into account both local responsiveness and global pressures. By comparing and contrasting IT trends from different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors, including management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, and organizational considerations). In addition these trends help to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. The IT trends also serve as an indicator as the respective geographies address their difficult economic environments. The research is based on data from four geographic regions, namely United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The same questionnaire (albeit translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead author's well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across the geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 787 organizations (195 U.S., 360 European, 55 Asian, 41 Australia, and 136 Latin) in 2012. The top five management concerns were: (1) Business productivity &amp; cost reduction, (2) Business &amp; IT alignment / integration / fusion, (3) Business agility &amp; speed to market, (4) Business process management/reengineering, and (5) IT cost reduction. The five most influential technologies were: (1) Business intelligence, (2) Cloud computing, (3) Enterprise resource planning, (4) Apps developments, and (5) Customer relationship management. Overall, the paper finds that while the economic climate is improving at different rates around the globe - albeit at a slower pace than anticipated - ITs role continues to evolve as it provides organizations with a fundamental vehicle for reducing business expenses and new opportunities for increasing revenues. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Computerization has transformed financial markets with high frequency trading displacing human activity with proprietary algorithms to lower latency, reduce intermediary costs, enhance liquidity and increase transaction speed. Following the “Flash Crash” of 2010 which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1000 points within minutes, high frequency trading has come under the radar of multi-jurisdictional regulators. Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the ‘dark art’ of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice. It is implicated in market events, but correlation does not imply causation, as isolating causal mechanisms from interconnected automated financial trading is highly challenging for regulators who seek to monitor algorithmic trading across multiple jurisdictions. This article provides information systems researchers with a set of conceptual tools for analysing high frequency trading. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Impact of Enterprise Systems on Organizational Resilience",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Enterprise systems are used to facilitate the seamless integration and exchange of data between the various departments within an organization. In order to achieve this, rigidly defined control mechanisms must be in place in the system, which safeguard the company's data and protect the company against unauthorized and unintended uses of the system. This is ideal for total control; however, is only achievable to a certain extent. The configuration of controls in the enterprise system may have unintended organizational implications, due to organizational necessities. The purpose of this paper is to present the findings from a company case study, where an enterprise system is being used. We suggest that the introduction of an enterprise system creates power differentials, which serve to increase control in the organization. This results in increased rigidity, and a possible decrease in organizational flexibility and resilience. On the other hand, enterprise systems can also cause drift, resulting from the unexpected consequences of these power differentials, as well as from the role of perceptions of people in solving a problem within the enterprise system. This reduction in control may serve in some circumstances as an enabler to organizational resilience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The term ‘risk management’ implies that risk is something which can be quantified, predicted and controlled. This paper seeks to demonstrate the limits of this assumption where complex projects are involved. The argument is based upon a case study of a failed &amp;pound;80 million IT venture known as Taurus. Analysis focuses upon the relationship between politics and the assumption of risk. Acceptance of risk, it is argued, is ultimately determined by the balance of power between decision makers. Moreover, risk analysis and other techniques of management may actually compound the difficulties by fostering an illusion of control and escalation. The implications for project management are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent times societal crises such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak have given rise to a tension between formal ‘command and control’ and informal social media activated self-organising information and communication systems that are utilised for crisis management decision-making. Social media distrust affects the dissemination of disaster information as it entails shifts in media perception and participation but also changes in the way individuals and organisations make sense of information in critical situations. So far, a little considered notion in this domain is the concept of sense-giving. Originating from organisational theory, it is used to explain the mechanisms behind intentional information provision that fosters collective meaning creation. In our study, we seek to understand the potential impact of sense-giving from Twitter crisis communication generated during the Hurricane Harvey disaster event. Social network and content analyses performed with a dataset of 9,414,463 tweets yielded insights into how sense-giving occurs during a large-scale disaster event. Theoretically, we specified (1) perpetual sense-giving, which relies primarily on topical authority and frequency; as well as (2) intermittent sense-giving, which occurs from high value of message content and leverage of popularity, that is, retweets. Our findings emphasise the importance of information-rich actors in communication networks and the leverage of their influence in crises such as coronavirus disease 2019 to reduce social media distrust and facilitate sense-making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology is crucial for modern services. Service delivery may include a complex mix of information technology and telecommunication providers, global networks and customers’ information technology devices. This research focuses on service failures that are caused by information technology problems, which we conceptualize as information technology-based service degradation (ITSD). When information technology-based service degradation occurs in a modern service, the information technology problem may originate from the service provider, another partner or any information technology equipment involved. But the customer may not be able to pinpoint the source of the problem immediately. We argue that existing research can only partially explain customers’ behavior following information technology-based service degradation; current research cannot account for the way in which information technology characteristics in information technology-based service degradation influence customers’ decisions to continue using or rejecting the service. To fulfill this gap, we interviewed information technology-based services’ customers. Our interviews suggest that the reasons affecting customers’ behavior may change and have differing importance during the information technology-based service degradation experience. We theorized the information technology-based service degradation experience into five stages: blaming, bypassing, tolerating, abandoning and overcoming. The first two stages contain stage-specific factors influencing the progression of service usage, and the final three stages contain stage-specific factors that matter in the decision to use or quit the service. As a new contribution, we propose a stage theory for explaining customers’ behavior following information technology-based service degradation. Our results outline new research directions in information technology-based service degradation, including further testing and refinement of our proposed theory in the case of different services. For service providers, our findings provide new information for improving service recovery strategies to keep customers engaged. </jats:p>",

It aims to show why this method is superior to other well-known focusing techniques or group evaluation methods. </jats:p><jats:p> The scenario playing business game consists of submitting to managers a sequence of reports, one after the other. Each report (called a scenario) contains randomly generated outcome values for some parameters of the business (called candidate critical success factors) which the manager deemed to be most important for the business at hand. After reviewing each report i.e. scenario, the manager has to give a value judgement about it, like ‘good’, ‘bad’ or ‘indifferent’, reflecting his perception of how the business would be doing if the report was real. A statistical method is used to evaluate these answers and deduct from them which parameters are the most important for the manager who played the given session of the game. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper contains a short outline of the statistical evaluation (learning) algorithm used by the author and the description of a software tool that contains an implementation of this technique.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper introduces the idea of ‘Appropriate Technology’ and applies it to some of the choices organizations make when designing, implementing and managing information technology (IT). It questions whether companies make appropriate choices about the extent of technology, the allocation of system functions between humans and machines, the design of jobs and roles for humans, the design of supporting organizational structures, and the methods used during design and implementation. If inappropriate choices are made in these areas, problems of morale, motivation and system performance can occur. The objectives of the paper are to examine whether these ideas can help to identify and explain problems in the implementation of new technology, and to argue that social scientists have so far achieved relatively little in helping organizations to make more appropriate choices in these areas. The paper makes a number of propositions about new technology from a social science perspective, introduces what is meant by Appropriate Technology, uses manufacturing as an example of an environment within which new technologies are being implemented, and describes five key decision areas for managers. As a result, a new set of propositions is made, this time from the perspective of general management and engineering. The author draws on research and development experiences with a number of companies, and on work undertaken within the ESPRIT and Alvey programmes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In response to their growing importance, digital infrastructures (DIs) are increasingly subject to governmental regulation due to concerns over the downside risks posed by digital technologies to individuals and society. There is a general paucity of studies that address the impact of regulations on DI innovation. In addition, existing research presents seemingly contradictory findings on regulations governing digital technologies as both enabling and inhibiting innovation. This paper, therefore, elaborates on how different types of regulation impact various forms of DI innovation. We draw on modular systems theory to enrich extant conceptualisations of DIs and develop a related conceptual model that demonstrates the paths by which two types of DI regulation influence DI architectural modularity, which is proposed as a mediating mechanism that influences DI innovation. Our model makes a theoretical contribution through an in-depth explanation of the relationship between regulation and DI innovation by articulating and illustrating the effects of regulatory provisions and thereby extends the extant DI literature. In terms of practical implications, our model can help stakeholders both create DI regulation and respond to regulatory provisions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines a number of issues to be addressed in teaching information systems to visually handicapped students. It is a case history in that it draws on the authors’ experience of teaching a multiply handicapped student over a three year period. Its particular emphasis is on the need for early preparation, in advance of the student's arrival and then throughout the teaching process. It points to the type of support facilities required. Although all the main headings would need to be considered in the teaching of any subject to visually handicapped students there are several that have added importance in the teaching of information systems. The paper is an attempt to share experience rather than make a case for tackling the issues raised in one particular way. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Letting living intelligence put the artificial version in its place",
    "abstract": "The phrase ‘Artificial Intelligence’ brings a particularly sinister note to media headlines on the effect of automation on work. Machines such as ‘dumb’ robots that replace physical work have now found a reasonably uncontroversial acceptance as part of productive efforts. It seems to be largely accepted that such machines are needed to work in collaboration with humans to extend production beyond human limitations or capacity. Such robots weld, paint, lift, move, even predict future markets and, generally, perform tasks that leave humans free to plan, manage, invent, design and try to understand the world in which they live. But point to a robot equipped with ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and the old ‘hype–and-fear’ attitudes (as identified by Willcocks [lead paper]) percolate back into the discourse. They appear to threaten human intelligence-based activities. The fear is not entirely surprising. Working humans cherish their intelligence for setting them apart from machines that might replace them. I argue that there is a massive divide between intelligence acquired by living creatures, and the artificial version which is the effort of human programmers. The fear results from an inappropriate use of the word ‘intelligence’ in the context of computation. It is a category error, that is, one where things of one category are being presented as if they belong to another or, alternatively, assigning a property that belongs to a category of objects to another category where it does not belong. That is, it is an error to take ‘intelligence’ as known to belong to the category of living things and apply it to the category of machines that someone has just chosen to call ‘intelligent’. The category error is intensified every time that headlines such as this appear:",

    "abstract": "Over 300 of the European academic I.S. community attended the Fifth European Conference In Information Systems in Cork in mid-June 1997. The conference also attracted a larger number of colleagues from USA and Australasia, and hopefully this is a trend, because it greatly increases the opportunities for establishing social networks so important to mutual in ̄ uence and growing the IS ® eld. The ® rst AIS PHD Colloquium for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region was held in Cork immediately before the conference. It was attended by eighteen students. Sponsors were the AIS, Andersen Consulting and the Commonwealth Secretariat. The programme chairs were Leslie Willcocks and Chrisanthi Avgerou. We were fortunate to attract a large and excellent faculty of nine led by Philip Ein-Dor, Kuldeep Kumar and Geoff Walsham. The event was widely deemed a success amongst the participants and a very good esprit de corps developed during the course of the three days. Hopefully the PHD Colloquium will now be a ® rm ® xture at the front end of ECIS. The future is promising, with next year’ s event already planned in conjunction with the Sixth Conference at IAE at Aix-en-Provence in France. Please note that the submission dates for paper copy submissions for ECIS 1988 is November 3rd 1997. Further details are available from Jacques-Andre Bartoli, Conference Chair, email: bartoli@univ-aix.fr.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information systems (IS) evaluation is a difficult problem in both theory and practice. While theoreticians are moving away from a positivistic approach towards a more interpretive approach, organizations are adopting a more entrepreneurial approach. We examine such a move through a case study of a large utility company in the UK which was relatively unsuccessful in its attempts at improving the evaluation of its IS. This paper uses an interpretive approach to explain the lack of success in introducing the new entrepreneurial evaluation procedures. However, we argue that the failure was not so much due to a lack of understanding of evaluation but more due to a failure to appreciate and support the necessary organizational changes. </jats:p>",

After completion of the project an evaluation may show that many of the problems encountered during the project could have been foreseen before they actually occurred. Risk management is an approach that is aimed at predicting the occurrence of this type of problem and at taking counter measures to either prevent them from affecting the project or to soften their impact. In this paper the basic activities related to risk management are described. Furthermore a concrete method aimed at supporting risk management is presented.

Some conclusions are that: </jats:p><jats:p> (1) the use of a short and structured checklist will ease identification of and discussions about risks, </jats:p><jats:p> (2) a risk management method in which explicit use is made of a group related approach, involving all parties, will increase reliability and acceptance of the results, and </jats:p><jats:p> (3) involvement of a neutral process risk advisor will further both the successful use of the method and the acceptance of the results. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Vendor capabilities development in blockchain sourcing: A parallel play approach",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Vendor capabilities development has been an important research stream in the information systems (IS) sourcing literature. The existing research, which was based on the context of implementing centralized enterprise systems, focused on the adoption of deliberate learning and implicit learning, with the assumption that effective selection between these two learning approaches is sufficient for service providers to acquire vendor capabilities. However, this assumption may not hold in implementing a decentralized system based on enterprise blockchain. Because an enterprise blockchain system affords a new way of governing transactions and demands a new governance mode, it creates an uncertain and complex landscape in which the mere selection between deliberate learning and implicit learning becomes insufficient. Addressing this gap is crucial because many enterprise blockchain projects fail due to the incompetence of service providers. By conducting an in-depth case study of a successful blockchain service provider, our study reveals a new mechanism for developing vendor capabilities: parallel play. As with parallel play by preschoolers, the service provider combines a set of learning approaches featuring borrowing from peers and learning through experimentation. Our study extends the IS sourcing literature on vendor capabilities development from the context of implementing centralized enterprise systems to the context of implementing decentralized enterprise blockchain systems. Our findings also provide guidelines for blockchain service providers to follow when acquiring vendor capabilities and for clients to use when selecting service providers. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Is Innovation and Organizational Alignment – a Professional Juggling Act",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The securing and maintaining of alignment between business strategies and information systems (IS) strategies is frequently cited as a critical concern of IS managers. Consequently it has been ranked as an important issue for IS research agendas over the last decade. Very few empirical studies, however, have been reported with the result that there is no firm evidence to support the need for alignment, far less evidence for the way that strategies might interact. This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study which examines both IS and business strategies using an external-internal alignment model. After four years of data collection and analysis there is strong support for an alignment model which follows a lead-lag strategy. This implies that alignment is not a steady state but will reflect a dynamic model of change. In order to foster innovation in IS this change model requires to be managed through a ‘r'evolutionary cycle. This resembles a professional juggling act rather than a managed stage growth process. The alignment and change models are described and related to the management of innovation and organicity. In addition a continuing and future research agenda is identified. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper considers how a methodology's theory and practice shapes contexts for interpretation. With these two terms as starting points, we also address a paradoxical situation: any description of interpreting contexts is bound to leave something out. To address this, we propose deconstruction as a double strategy for critically interpreting contexts in each situation. This relies on terms of existing oppositions in conceptual frameworks but seeks to displace the limitations they impose on how we conduct inquiry. Since meaning is context-bound but contexts are boundless, we argue that inquiry should be conducted through critical perspectives, and we describe this in terms of a systems analyst's expertise in conceptual triangulation: the defining of an unknown point in relation to two known extremes. </jats:p>",

SRA has been used, very successfully, to perform risk analysis both for security-oriented risk analysis in the City and safety-oriented risk analysis for the European Space Agency. This paper develops and describes a particular instance of the SRA methodology for IS. Excluding safety-critical applications allows certain simplifications to the methodology in the case of IS. These simplifications make structured risk analysis for information systems (SRA-IS) a practical and cost-effective basis for risk analysis and risk management in commercial organizations. </jats:p>",

Technology implementation is now widely regarded as a ‘socially negotiated’ process the outcome of which is likely to be shaped by different interests and constituencies within the innovating firm. However, the explanatory status accorded to questions of power and political process remains problematic. This paper combines an empirical investigation of the political processes associated with the implementation of CAD/CAM with a cross-disciplinary treatment of the underlying theoretical issues. The concluding part of the paper focuses on ‘political’ and ‘learning’ aspects of technical change. ‘Power’, ‘knowledge’ and ‘control’ rationalities are included in a revised theorization of the technical change process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "High-tech entrepreneurs seem to behave as though aiming at leadership is the only strategy. This is incorrect. It is the high-risk-but-rewarding-ifsuccessful strategy but it is not the only or even the dominant strategy. The strategy always aims at creating a new industry or a new market. It requires careful analysis (not merely the 'brilliant idea') and, when successful, demands substantial effort to maintain the leadership position. For example, the research budget should be higher after the innovation than before. The successful leader must make the product or service obsolete before the competitor does it for him. Similarly, the successful leader must cut the prices down so that he does not create an innovative opportunity for the competitor who comes in under the high price umbrella. The requirements of the strategy of aiming for leadership are so stringent that one can readily appreciate that it is an all or nothing affair. In most cases of innovation, other strategies are preferable: IBM's usual strategy may be available; do what someone else has done but understand better what their innovation represents, understand what their success means and the work the customer wants and pays for. Risk is reduced because the market is established and the new venture accepted. Market research can find out what customers value. This strategy is most likely to be successful in the high-tech area precisely because high-tech innovators are least likely to be market focused and hence not understand their success and the demand they have created. Even so, the strategy still requires alertness, flexibility, hard work and effort.",

To the student he says clearly that systems analysis is a list of activities which allow the systems analyst to exert a significant influence over the organization in which he works; while to the instructor he issues the warning that systems analysis is one of the most difficult activities to teach.

    "abstract": "Business Computing & Communications was launched in November 1983 specifically to address the management issues associated with information technology (IT). It is written primarily for senior executives, as well as management information services and data processing managers, concerned with the way computer systems are changing the corporate, business and social environment. The magazine deals with all aspects of the impact of information technology on companies. IT's significance for business strategy has become an increasingly important theme over the past year or so. Interest in conducting a survey that explored how the leading consultancies tackled the problem of aligning information technology with business objectives was a natural extension of Business Computing & Communications' concern with the strategic dimension of IT.",

    "abstract": "approaches. But there is more. What Landauer has added in 'The Trouble with Computers, is the evidence to show that when computers are around, humans can act ridiculously, if not stupidly at times. In the first paragraphs, the author gets the reader immediately on his side by recounting the frustrating story of someone unable to buy a product because it did not have a stock number to key into the computer. This episode causes the reader to remember many similar experiences and to identify with the unneces­ sary complications of modern life. The outcome, as indeed it was in this case, is a dissatisfied customer, a sale lost, a host of irritated potential customers kept waiting and a demoralized shop assistant. Everyone ends up blaming the computer. In the initial analysis of what is going wrong, Landauer defines two phases to the integration and use of computers in business. The first phase was the replacement by computers of employees doing jobs that required massive or repetitive numerical calcula­ tions. This was the relatively easy, although obviously painful beginning, but as Landauer states: 'It's getting hard to think of useful new jobs to do by arithmetic'. Phase two is what he calls the augmentation phase, which is turning computers into tools to help humans operate in our world of speech, understanding, creativity, and interaction. The trouble with computers is that for the jobs we now want them for, they are not doing enough, or as the author defines, 'they don't yet do a sufficient number of sufficiently useful things'. This is where the crux of the current problems lies. The cause of this is our failure to design suitable soft­ ware due to lack of regular, relevant and adequate feedback or evaluation. Landauer could be criticized for spending too much time (over 200 pages) on the analysis of prob­ lems, including revisiting familiar territory such as the difficulty of measurement and our ability to adapt to the speed of technical development. In addition, there is not much said about the overall management of technology and the issues of organizational impacts which are part of this. However, where the book really begins to make a valuable contribution to addressing the identified problems differently is from Chapter 10 when it focuses on user-centred design. What this is exactly and how it can be incorporated into the normal software design and development process form the bulk of the rest of the book. Although some user testing is now widespread in all serious software design processes, it often fails to address many fundamental design faults. This book is advocating a more scien­ tifically-based approach using a number of more struc­ tured techniques which require close monitoring and evaluation as part of a continuous process.

In this article, we aim at increasing our understanding of modifying of borrowed theories in IT-rich contexts. We present a framework in which we discuss how two recontextualization approaches of specification and distinction help with increasing the IT-richness of borrowed constructs and relationships. In doing so, we use several illustrative examples from information systems strategy. The framework can be used by researchers as a tool to explore the multitude of ways in which a theory from another discipline can yield the understanding of IT phenomena. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> All Decision Support Systems (DSS) are, by their nature, designed to improve decision making effectiveness, yet a review of the experimental literature reveals that achievement of this objective is mixed. We propose that this is because DSS effectiveness is contingent upon a number of factors related to the task and DSS under investigation. This paper reports a longitudinal experiment designed to evaluate the relationship between DSS effectiveness and two such factors: DSS sophistication and task complexity. In comparison to unaided human judgement, two levels of DSS were evaluated: a deterministic spreadsheet model and a probabilistic model with a graphical risk analysis aid. Our subjects made decisions in a business simulation providing two successive phases of increasing task complexity. Initially, when task complexity was low, we found that neither DSS affected subjects’ performance. In the more complex phase, both types of DSS users performed significantly better than unaided subjects. However, risk analysis users performed no better than model-only users. Interestingly, DSS users performed less homogeneously than unaided subjects in the complex phase. DSS users had greater confidence and considered more alternatives than their unaided counterparts. Risk analysis users took longer making decisions in the early stages, while model-only users became the most efficient in the later stages. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Prior literature has identified several outsourcing motivations, such as cost reduction and access to expertise, and deciphered the influence of these variables on outsourcing decisions. In another stream of outsourcing studies, researchers have gauged the degree of outsourcing, unearthing how companies may choose to outsource a set or processes instead of the whole business function. In this article, we draw on both of these streams of outsourcing research to study the relationship between outsourcing motivations and the degree of outsourcing within a particular business function. We probe the effect of nine motivation items on outsourcing decision through an empirical study using survey data gathered from 337 small and medium-sized enterprises. We find that cost reduction, a focus on core competence and business/process improvements are all associated with a higher degree of outsourcing, but interestingly, access to expertise is negatively associated with the degree of outsourcing. This finding suggests that companies that outsource mainly to acquire external expertise outsource only a limited number of processes within a specific business function. Our main theoretical contribution lies in uncovering the dynamic nature of outsourcing motivations, meaning that as companies outsource a larger degree of their business processes, some motivation items become more accentuated and others fade in importance. </jats:p>",

This is counter to the prevailing assumptions of cloud adoption as being more impersonal and distant, with less interaction between provider and purchaser than on-premise technologies. We do this through an interpretive study of cloud computing adopters across Europe. We develop a conceptual framework of cloud proximity which draws attention to its locational, relational and temporal proximal dimensions. Our proximal analysis leads us to identify three aspects of cloud adoption where proximity plays a key role: mercantile aspect (e.g., cloud sales support), counsel aspect (e.g., access to internal and external expertise) and organi-technical aspect (e.g., the understanding of cloud technology and services alongside their organizational adoption context). By challenging assumptions of distant and remote adoption, we contribute to the cloud computing adoption research and raise questions for IT adoption in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the widespread adoption of Executive Information Systems (EIS) and their increasing importance in organizations, the process of their development is not well understood. The mainstream EIS literature tends to report success stories of EIS in the organizations studied and attribute this to a pre-planned rational process of origin and design of EIS. In this paper, a case study of the EIS development process in a manufacturing company is used to critique this rational view and to illustrate the applicability of an alternative perspective based on an organizational behavioural model. This paper suggests that greater recognition of the social nature of the process of IS development is necessary to understand how systems projects may be better managed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The types of benefits which a business can obtain from investments in information Systems (IS) have developed and become more varied over time. During that same period many organizations have become dependent on their Information Systems in terms of how they do business and some have used IS to gain competitive or strategic advantages. This article explores the nature of the benefits that can accrue in relation to the business objectives of IS investments. A portfolio model is discussed which helps management evaluate the relative importance of such investments to the business and hence to define how each investment can be appraised and managed. In order to maintain a coherent strategy for managing IS investments, not only must they all be evaluated on a consistent basis, but priorities amongst the applications must be established on the same set of criteria. Again the portfolio approach enables management to address this issue in a rational way, based on business needs and imperatives. </jats:p>",

Recently, a new generation of entrepreneurs seized this emerging market opportunity by positioning themselves as service providers for free/open source software users. Conceptualizing such providers as “institutional entrepreneurs,” we find that due to the nature of the free/open source software context, they exhibit a different set of legitimation actions compared with similar efforts in other contexts. Based on our empirical analysis of free/open source software service providers and drawing on prior theory, we identify two entrepreneurial actions aimed at gaining legitimacy specific to the free/open source software context, namely, product-based theorization actions and evangelization actions. We also demonstrate that institutional entrepreneurship is shaped by the nature of free/open source software products and the openness values at the core of the free/open source software movement. Our work hence underscores the importance of the context of institutional entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Although much as been written about “big data” and “big data analytics”1 and how these will revolutionize how decisions are made, I have a sense of unease and feel the need to not only question the veracity of this claim but also question the implications of what “revolutionizing how decisions are made” means. Big data analytics and its sister technology “machine learning” are touted as the next wave of technological advancement which will obviate the need for humans to deal with repetitive processes (they will be automated through robotic process automation—RPA) while traditional (and non-traditional) decision making will be transformed. Maybe. But such pronouncements sound suspiciously like prior technological waves which were also promoted as “revolutionary” and “transformative.” In this essay, I wish to explore some of the underlying assumptions associated with this inexorable drive to base decision making on big data and big data analytics. In my analysis, I will attempt to highlight some of the fallacies and misconceptions that lie behind big data and how these assumptions are dysfunctional. In particular, I want to explore how these dysfunctions might manifest themselves when it comes to practice. In doing so, I want to tie the hype associated with big data to the Information Systems (IS) academic field’s focus on—dare I say worship of—“theory.” Interestingly, my objection is not so much that big data does not generate theory but rather that both theory—as it is widely conceived by the academic community—and big data do not yield understanding/insight. They generate “something”—in the case of theory, supposed relationships between variables and in the case of big data, the behaviors of large populations—but this is not understanding. It is my belief that we have mistakenly adopted the view that knowledge is the same as understanding. Knowledge may be the product of our research, but this is not the same as understanding, which is how to use that knowledge in practice. It is something I have written about in my “Against Theory” paper (Hirschheim, 2019). This is a key notion which I will explore later in the essay. My contention is that academics continue to make the same mistakes, continue to embrace erroneous assumptions about what they should be doing with their research, what the products of the research should be, and how we can help drive practice. Big data is just the latest in a series of waves of technological advancements which will supposedly change what we do and how we do it. But will it? And if it will, what are its likely implications? I am hopeful this essay, which came about after reading Gary Smith’s (in press) insightful “Data Mining Fool’s Gold” paper, will help bring these issues to the fore and possibly allow for a meaningful dialogue to take place.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Policymakers often rely on pre-release polls to design and deploy public health apps. However, these apps often fail to realize their full potential because the actual size of the user population is significantly lower than expected, and the characteristics of those who use the app differ from those previously inclined to install it. This study aims to understand the success of public health apps by examining shifts between expected and actual user populations during app releases. Rooted in the context of public health apps, we identify factors that potentially intervene in the time between an initial poll of intentions and actual behavior. We delineate two deviations between stated installation intentions in polls and actual installations at an individual level, which have been commingled in literature thus far: inclined nonusers (Type I deviation) and disinclined users (Type II deviation). By introducing this distinction, we hypothesize that app releases can suffer from (1) a volume shift, which results in overly optimistic expectations of user numbers, and (2) a profile shift, which results in biased expectations of user profiles. Using data from a multi-wave survey, we find evidence for the postulated deviations. Our findings also unveil how contextualized factors from the health belief model can explain the occurrence and extent of these deviations. The findings contribute to information systems research that aims to predict technology adoption based on behavioral intentions. The results also offer actionable guidance for policymakers who rely on stated intentions in polls to tackle public health issues. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Work flow management systems (WFMSs) are an important new technology, which are likely to have a significant impact on the way in which clerical and administrative operations are organized and executed. This paper seeks to investigate how WFMSs are being exploited and used commercially by UK-based organizations operating in the financial services sector. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 project managers to explore the development, application and commercial implications of this powerful yet flexible technology. The results indicate that work flow technology has the potential to facilitate significant changes in the way in which an organization conducts its business, through the automation of a wide range of document-intensive operations. Furthermore, when applied in a well-focused manner, it has the potential to realize significant increases in an organization's flexibility and productivity, as well as delivering major improvements to the quality, speed and consistency of customer service. </jats:p>",

    "title": "New Management Patterns: Key Findings from the Mit90S Research Study",
    "abstract": "This conference was a timely and important attempt to publicize more widely some of the findings of the MIT90s research study. One of the day's speakers described the MIT90s programme as 'the largest and most authoritative research programme yet conducted into the impact of Information Technology upon organizations. It has established beyond question that IT investment decisions and their implementation are becoming crucial to most organizations' future and as such are now one of management's central concerns'. The conference, held in July 1992, was organized by The Long Range Planning Society and sponsored by BP, ICL and AMED. The Vice President of the Long Range Planning Society, Philip Sadler, chaired the day. His introduction established the day's theme when he stated that 'the focus of the conference was to be the interface between IT and Business Strategy' . The MIT90s research study was conceived as a close collaboration between academic researchers at the MIT Sloan School of Management and representatives of major corporations. It was started in 1984 and since then has generated a large number of academic papers and one book (Scott Morton, 1991). Of the ten initial industrial sponsors, two companies were British, ICL and BP. This conference concentrated on their experience and use of the programmes findings. Professor Venkatramen, who participated in the programme and was a major contributor to the book resulting from it, both opened the conference and concluded it. In his summing up he noted that the industrial sponsors had made widely varying contributions ranging from the relatively passive contribution of money to active collaboration to research projects. CIL had been an outstanding partner. One member of ICL's staff, K.H. Macdonald, had remained permanently connected to the programme throughout its life, also contributing a chapter to the resulting book. He had made a major contribution to the translation of the research findings into practical application within companies. This is a continuing focus of ICL's effort and formed the core of their contribution to the morning's sessions. The afternoon's main speaker was from BP.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We theorize mobile knowledge workers’ uses of digital and material resources in support of their working practices. We do so to advance current conceptualizations of both “information infrastructures” and “digital assemblages” as elements of contemporary knowledge work. We focus on mobile knowledge workers as they are (increasingly) self-employed (e.g., as freelancers, entrepreneurs, temporary workers, and contractors), competing for work, and collaborating with others: one likely future of work that we can study empirically. To pursue their work, mobile knowledge workers draw together collections of commodity digital technologies or digital assemblages (e.g., laptops, phones, public WiFi, cloud storage, and apps), relying on a reservoir of knowledge about new and emergent means to navigate this professional terrain. We find that digital assemblages are created and repurposed by workers in their infrastructuring practices and in response to mobility demands and technological environments. In their constitution, they are generative to both collaborative and organizational goals. Building from this, we theorize that digital assemblages, as individuated forms of information infrastructure, sustain stability and internal cohesion even as they allow for openness and generativity. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Human in the loop",
    "abstract": "Klein and Myers’ (1999) statement that the natural science model of social science is widely accepted in information systems (IS) epitomises the ongoing debate in IS research about the research foundations and the methods that are applicable in the discipline. This is neither a new problem, nor one isolated to IS. Right from the enlightenment, the abandoning of the theological and the metaphysical led to the reliance on science as the philosophical foundation and direction for enquiry and study. This developing view of what is scientific led to the classification of sciences and an increasing dominance of reductionism as the consensus approach. Comte placed sociology as the pinnacle of science, where all science merges to act on humans. Furthermore, it was Durkheim who sought to place social science on what was perceived as the firmer foundation of natural sciences, viewing the social realm as external to us and hence best addressed by the empirical methods of natural sciences (Prowse, 2005). Human agency was eclipsed and individuals became part of a collective, a deterministic social machine. While Durkheim’s influence may have waned, the ideas of what is scientific and its application to our understanding ourselves as social beings have been woven into our culture and way of thinking. The dominance of logical positivism and empiricism in the 20th century right up to the 1960s suggested that anything not grounded in empirical, repeatable observation should be rejected and was ‘unscientific’. The high regard for natural sciences by the logical positivists led to its reification and the view of social sciences as a lower form of academic pursuit. Popper’s refining of logical positivism established an ideology that scientific method required theory and that theory must be refutable. Good scientific theory is a prohibition (Ebringer, 2011). Such a philosophy underpins much of IS research in which hypotheses are proposed and then declared true or false as a result of the statistical analysis of surveys. Critical to the logical positivism view of scientific endeavour was a stripping of context and time. Science practice was seen as ahistorical (Okasha, 2002). Positivism sought to strip philosophy itself of reflection and metaphysics and make it more ‘scientific’. However, as logical empiricism disintegrated; it was understood that science is far from a simply neutral and objective process. Rather it is influenced by history, context and is strongly political. Kuhn’s (2012) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions opened the debate on the nature of science and its practice; something reflected in sociological treatments such as Latour’s (1988) Science in Action. The underlying belief or rather worldview which sees science and scientific ‘method’ as the sole arbiter for thinking and acting has not only persisted but grown in academia. In business schools, a dominant scientific model including abstract financial and economic analysis, statistical multiple regressions, and laboratory psychology (Bennis and O’Toole, 2005) not only excluded exploration of alternatives but rendered research irrelevant to practice and devoid of political and economic context. The questioning of whether IS is a science only reflects debates in business schools or in economics departments where the failure to predict the recent financial crisis despite a plethora of mathematical models raised severe doubts as to the scientific credentials of economics (Wang, 2013). The afterglow of positivist philosophy permeates popular culture: ‘Philosophy is dead . . . scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge’ according to Hawking and Mlodinow (2010). This dominant paradigm subordinates social sciences as secondclass citizens below the natural sciences and creates an ambition to rise to the standards of natural science in our study of IS. And yet as the paradigm of the scientific method frays at the edge as Kuhn predicted, more and more effort is made to ignore problems or explain away the inadequacies of the scientific method in social sciences. The authors’ treatment of natural sciences and questioning what we believe in natural science is one such attempt. If efforts to achieve our ambition to raise social science to the level of respect accorded natural sciences in our society is failing our response will be to reinterpret natural sciences. If we apparently cannot raise our status to that of Human in the loop",

However, there is limited research on the effect of vendor-based sponsorship on the management of information technology (IT) projects. This paper contributes to that emerging body of evidence. Drawing on literature on psychological contract, management control and project sponsorship, the authors propose that vendor-based sponsors influence project performance in two main ways. One is to protect project quality by renegotiating contract with the client; and the other is to resource the project. Based on a survey of senior managers in IT services vendor organisations, it reports that project sponsorship improves the quality, but not the cost or timeliness, of vendor delivery of IT projects. The findings suggest that IT services vendors can improve their project delivery capability by appointing project sponsors. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Making of Institutions of Information Governance: The Case of the Internet Governance Forum",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Histories of information systems are inseparable from the histories of their governance. In the case of the Internet, governance structures informally developed during its early design were substantially different from the typical mechanisms resulting from public policy decision-making. Traditionally, global information systems, such as telecommunication systems, were governed through state-centric mechanisms that would set treaty-based framework for non-state actors to operate within. Legitimate participation in these traditional governance structures was the prerogative of states that possessed sole decision-making authority. In the case of the Internet, non-state-actor-driven governance frameworks were developed outside of those traditional mechanisms. They relied on a different conception of legitimacy and authority. This paper discusses how the state and non-state actors were forced to cooperate around the creation of institutions that could accommodate the variety of views on authority, legitimacy, and decision-making processes in Internet governance. It tracks the creation of the Internet Governance Forum as a case where notions of legitimacy and authority were redefined for policy deliberations of complex information systems. The paper concludes with whether those changes lead to the emergence of new institutions that contribute to the sustainability of the network by enabling coexistence of competing political interests and values; and what this could mean for the future of the network. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The mobile ecosystem has recently experienced a transition in platform leadership from network operators to mobile operating system providers. In each system the platform provider exerts effort in order to attract other firms for generativity and profitability. In this paper, we identify and analyze the working mechanism of one business practice that significantly influences the ecosystem's generativity and platform provider's profitability via value appropriation. Revenue sharing has become a common practice in the mobile ecosystem following NTT DoCoMo's radical revenue-sharing model contributing toward mobile service success in Japan. Studies further argue that offering a wide portfolio of services through an attractive or innovative revenue-sharing model is one of key success factors in the mobile ecosystem. However, app developers have continuously claimed that they do not receive their fair share and the press reports a substantial number of disputes concerning revenue sharing between the platform provider and app developers. We propose a new bargaining model, the modified apex game, that investigates how value is likely to be appropriated between the platform provider and app developers within a given mobile platform mediated network. We support our theoretical predictions using data collected from the early mobile ecosystem by a network operator as well as the iOS and Android mediated networks. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Icarus Paradox: An Analysis of a Totally Destructive System",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper uses a case study to illustrate and further extend the notion of ‘socially destructive systems’. Baskerville and Land define a destructive information system as either coming apart internally or threatening to take their environment apart. Building upon their insights, this paper suggests that destructive systems emerge from the very attributes that attract organisations to information systems in the first place - a phenomenon encapsulated by the so-called ‘Icarus paradox’. Icarus flew so close to the Sun that his wax wings that had enabled him to fly in the first place melted sending him plunging to his death. The case study of an insurance company shows how a system that increased claims processing productivity in the short run resulted in higher costs and lower customer satisfaction in the long run. The paradox is explained by a disconnect between ‘espoused-theory’ and ‘theory-in-use’. Issues for further research include developing techniques of impact analysis to measure recursive losses arising from ‘destructive systems’ and for gauging the level of complexity at which computer-based automation becomes counterproductive. An important recommendation for practice is that computer-based systems are efficient only to a point. For more complex tasks organisations may need to put more emphasis upon developing people. </jats:p>",

It shows that emergence of the network economy and network society necessitates a paradigm shift in the IS discipline, and that complexity science offers the apposite concepts and tools for effecting such a shift. To avoid confusion of fundamental complexity science concepts with the more colloquial uses of complexity terminology, the paper provides an introduction to concepts from complexity science for those in the IS field who are unacquainted with complexity theory.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technologies can transform an organisation's capacity to act effectively and achieve its performance aims. This theoretical paper presents a framework, adapted from the work of the semiotician A.J. Greimas, for qualitatively analysing this shaping of organisational behaviour and effectiveness around the use of IT. This framework permits various forms of capability or constraint in organisational action to be distinguished, in terms of the functional capacities of IT systems or key dimensions of social structure. A multi-faceted consideration of positive and negative outcomes of IT-based activities is thus supported. The use of this framework is demonstrated through brief case examples that illustrate its utility in providing a dynamic perspective on organisational performance and alignment in the use of IT. This theoretical framework equips IS interpretive studies to analyse the shaping of IT-based organisational activity from a standpoint of structures of behaviour or significance in a context of purposeful action. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information systems research has become methodologically pluralistic, not least in the hope of achieving greater relevance of scholarly output to practice. Although interventionist approaches have considerable potential for bridging the theory–practice gap, they are dismissed as unscientific because of the purported absence of a philosophical foundation that would justify the interactive research process and the co-productive relationships between researchers and practitioners that are so defining of this type of inquiry. The intention in this paper is to demonstrate that philosophical foundations for interventionist research strategies do exist. This task is pursued by the introduction of the participatory worldview, as articulated in the fields of sociology, philosophy and organization studies. The paper shows its distinctness to other, non-positivist paradigms, describes the participatory research process, presents participatory inquiry methods and extrapolates the distinctness of the knowledge they produce. The application of its paradigmatic principles is illustrated through an empirical example of a participatory research programme and the challenges that this approach presents for research practice are indicated. </jats:p><jats:p> … most of our knowledge, and all our primary knowledge, arises as an aspect of activities that have practical, not theoretical objectives; and it is this knowledge, itself an aspect of action, to which all reflective theory must refer. </jats:p><jats:p> (Macmurray, 1957, p. 12) </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Map and the Territory: An Ethnographic Study of the Low Utilisation of a Global eHealth Network",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent years were marked by the implementation of many eHealth projects using information and communication technologies to provide health services in developing countries. While generating great expectations, these projects remain poorly documented and available data suggest high failure rates. This raises a practical question: How are such eHealth networks to be effectively designed and implemented? This paper addresses this question. Specifically, it presents an ethnographic study of the Pan-African e-Network, a project which connects many hospitals all across India and Africa, providing medical teleconsultations and distance learning services. The study investigates the low utilisation of the network, an issue undermining its potential and efficiency. Factors contributing to this situation include communication barriers, the presumed ego of doctors, poor awareness of the project, and a lack of flexibility to work with the specificities of the connected sites. Above all, these factors point towards a dichotomous approach across the project's design and implementation, and taking two distinct yet related forms: (a) an ontological divide between technical and ‘non-technical’ domains; (b) a political sorting out of what is and what is not the project, aimed at neutralising and accounting for heterogeneous processes and practices. In both cases, low utilisation reveals tensions between processes of closure and control, and the openness of a life that will not be contained. Ultimately, this paper intends to destabilise binary modes of thinking as they crystallise oppositions between design and implementation, project and context, technical and social worlds, efficacy and improvisation, mastery and unruliness, map and territory. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizations that make use of computer information systems (CIS) are prototypical complex adaptive systems (CAS). This paper shows how an approach from Complexity Science, exploratory agent-based modeling (ABM), can be used to study the impact of two different modes of use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on organizational culture (OC) and performance. The ABM includes stylized representations of (a) agents communicating with other agents to complete tasks; (b) an OC consisting of the distribution of agent traits, changing as agents communicate; (c) the effect of OC on communication effectiveness (CE), and (d) the effect of CE on task completion times, that is, performance. If CMC is used in a broad mode, that is, to contact and collaborate with many, new agents, the development of a strong OC is slowed, leading to decreased CE and poorer performance early on. If CMC is used in a local mode, repeatedly contacting the same agents, a strong OC develops rapidly, leading to increased CE and high performance early on. However, if CMC is used in a broad mode over longer time periods, a strong OC can develop over a wider set of agents, leading to an OC that is stronger than an OC which develops with local CMC use. Thus broad use of CMC results in overall CE and performance that is higher than is generated by local use of CMC. We also discuss how the dynamics generated by an ABM can lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of a CAS, for example, allowing us to better design empirical longitudinal studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although the telecommunication industry in China is growing at a fast pace, and firms are making strong efforts to provide customers with various services, customer switching continues to be high. Satisfaction has been considered as one of the most important antecedent of customer loyalty. However, little attention has been paid to dissatisfaction, a qualitatively different construct from satisfaction, which also influences loyalty. Relying on the two-factor and three-factor theory, this research proposes a theoretical framework to demonstrate the coexistence of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and investigates the different antecedents and influences of satisfaction and dissatisfaction on customer loyalty. Through an exploratory study, we derived 11 telecom service attributes and further classified them into three categories, namely, hygiene factors, bivalent factors, and motivating factors. Each of these categories has a distinct effect on shaping customers’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The PLS analysis of the survey data collected from 679 respondents provides insights into the complex interrelationships between 11 telecom service attributes, functional perception, motivating perception, customer satisfaction, customer dissatisfaction, and customer loyalty constructs. This study has a few interesting implications for researchers and telecom industry managers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we focus on the neglected role of anxiety and psychological security in organizational life, specifically in the context of the organization and development of offshoring relationships that extend across time and geography. In contrast with much of the literature on offshoring (and inter-organizational relationships more generally), which tends to take a very conventional rational decision-making perspective on the phenomenon in question, we emphasize the less tangible, emotional dimensions. In particular, we are concerned with understanding the processes by which clients, who have little or no previous experience of offshoring, may develop and sustain adequate levels of psychological security to enable them to bracket risk and productively engage in such unfamiliar and alien work arrangements. To this end, we draw on Anthony Giddens’ distinctive, non-cognitivist conception of trust, supplemented by other important contributions in the area, to explore the processes by which a sense of psychological security and stability is achieved in the face of the quotidian anxieties provoked by engagement in these contemporary modes of global organizing. Our synthesized theoretical framework is developed and illustrated in the context of an ongoing, in-depth, longitudinal study of the evolution of an Ireland-India information systems offshoring relationship. By tracing the dynamics of this relationship over an 18-month period, we examine the practices (or ‘relationship work’) through which trust is produced, and suggest that different mechanisms can be discerned at different (albeit overlapping) stages of the relationship. In the earlier phase, the emphasis is on the role played by care and attentiveness in producing a sense of trust in the qualities of the supplier. As the relationship develops, however, the emphasis shifts to the production of a stable collaborative order. Here, we focus on the micro-political dynamics of such processes and draw attention to three important tactical interventions (brokerage, signaling, and the ‘third man’). We conclude by arguing that the sense of trust that was carefully cultivated in the earlier phase of the relationship provided a crucial foundation, which not only facilitated the subsequent development of a stable collaborative order but, most noticeably, helped contain a serious crisis that beset the project in December 2006. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a design theory that tackles dynamic complexity in the design for Information Infrastructures (IIs) defined as a shared, open, heterogeneous and evolving socio-technical system of Information Technology (IT) capabilities. Examples of IIs include the Internet, or industry-wide Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) networks. IIs are recursively composed of other infrastructures, platforms, applications and IT capabilities and controlled by emergent, distributed and episodic forms of control. II's evolutionary dynamics are nonlinear, path dependent and influenced by network effects and unbounded user and designer learning. The proposed theory tackles tensions between two design problems related to the II design: (1) the bootstrap problem: IIs need to meet directly early users’ needs in order to be initiated; and (2) the adaptability problem: local designs need to recognize II's unbounded scale and functional uncertainty. We draw upon Complex Adaptive Systems theory to derive II design rules that address the bootstrap problem by generating early growth through simplicity and usefulness, and the adaptability problem by promoting modular and generative designs. We illustrate these principles by analyzing the history of Internet exegesis. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Generative Innovation: A Comparison of Lightweight and Heavyweight IT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavy-weight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "An Exploratory Study on IS Capabilities and Assets in a Small-to-Medium Software Enterprise",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a dearth of research on the capabilities of innovative small-to-medium software enterprises (SMSEs). Understanding how SMSEs build and apply business and information systems (IS) capabilities is important, as such firms account for over 90% of software enterprises operating in Europe and the US. This paper elaborates and applies dynamic capability theory to explore and help understand the web of conditions and factors that shaped and influenced business and IS capability development and application in one European SMSE. Drawing on the overarching theory of dynamic capabilities, a theoretical model is presented that posits relationships among (1) a firm's past activities; (2) its integration, learning and reconfiguration, and transformation capabilities; (3) its financial, complementary, locational, and technological asset positions; and (4) the products and services that result, and which are of value to an SMSE's customers. The paper refines and elaborates the model by describing and enumerating the business and IS capabilities, assets, and products and services of the SMSE under study. To properly assess whether this firm's products and services were of value to its customers, research was also conducted at two customer sites in Ireland and the US, in addition to the investigation at the primary research site in Dublin. The study therefore informs both practitioners’ and researchers’ understandings of this complex and under-researched phenomenon: for practitioners, it highlights the characteristics required to build innovative software solutions; for researchers, it illustrates the patterns and regularities associated with the development and application of business and IS capabilities. </jats:p>",

The findings indicate that changes in ISs were not envisaged as being central to the PI programs. However, the implementation of the PI programs had a significant effect on the roles and responsibilities of those people impacted by the program. Information requirements changed as a consequence of these responsibility changes. ISs were found to make a significant contribution to meeting these new information requirements. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Jürgen Habermas is a wide-ranging thinker whose ideas have formed the philosophic foundation of critical systems thinking (CST). But can the Critical approach incorporate ideas from other thinkers without abandoning its Habermasian roots? The danger of adding ideas piecemeal to address specific difficulties in CST is that the whole will eventually collapse because of inconsistencies. So if we wish to import ideas from other thinkers we need to understand the points of agreement and disagreement with critical theory. This requires reference to a set of criteria, though not necessarily in any rigid way. This paper applies a set of criteria to a philosophic framework of ideas (that of the Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd) in order not to ‘score’ the ideas for Criticality, but rather to understand the process of bringing the ideas of a thinker from a different tradition to bear on the Critical approach in a commensurable way. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents the findings from a longitudinal research study on regulatory technology in the UK financial services industry. The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘ tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences of IT managerial and technical trends. Going beyond identifying these influential factors is also the need to understand the considerations for addressing them, in light of recognizing the respective local characteristics, especially when operating in a globally linked environment. By comparing and contrasting different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) necessary to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. The research is based on data from four geographic regions (United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America). The same questionnaire (although translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead authors of the well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 472 organizations (172 US, 142 European, 103 Asian, and 55 Latin) in mid-2010. The top five management concerns were: (1) business productivity and cost reduction; (2) IT and business alignment; (3) business agility and speed to market; (4) business process re-engineering; and (5) IT reliability and efficiency. The five most influential technologies were business intelligence, cloud computing, enterprise resource planning, Software as a Service/Platform as a Service, and collaborative tools. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Rise of the Phoenix: Methodological Innovation as a Discourse of Renewal",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The imperatives on contemporary organizations to adapt to an increasingly uncertain and turbulent environment are intense. The pace of change is at least as great in the public as the private sector, with technology being integral to the UK government's modernization agenda. Resilience refers to the ability of individuals and organizations to cope with change through a continuous process of renewal. Much research on resilience is uncritical, normative and written from a detached perspective that emphasizes the agency of senior management. In contrast, this paper provides an ethnographically based account of resilience at the middle level of a large, public sector bureaucracy. Finding itself under increasing pressure to move away from its traditional, technically oriented role, the IS function sought to reinvent itself as a strategic driver of business transformation. The development of a business process reengineering methodology was seen as the key to operationalizing this new role. Although innovation in IS methodology can be problematic, here it was brought off successfully. This was attributed to several factors, including the adoption of a participative action research approach and the commitment of IS management. Above all, the sense of crisis prevailing at the outset of the initiative was decisive. Crises present a major challenge to organizational sense-making; here, a resilient ‘discourse of renewal’ was kindled with the impending threat interpreted positively as a proactive opportunity to develop the new strategic identity. The paper concludes with some critical reflections on the limits of managerial agency and the notion of resilience as a designable capacity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Failed or partially failed information systems (IS) investments continue to be a problem in both public and private sectors. Although there are many causes of such failure, lack of clarity about the goals and benefits expected and how they are to be realized is one of the major contributors. This is particularly so in the public sector where the purpose of IS investment is not to increase profits, but to accomplish social and political goals. One way of reducing failure and wastage rates is to have ex-ante evaluation. Over the past three decades IS research has proposed a plethora of new theoretical approaches to improving ex-ante evaluation, but with a few exceptions, these have had little impact on practice. This paper presents a way to address this gap between theory and practice. It proposes a way in which managers can improve IS investment evaluation by changing perspective from a focus on traditional analytic tools towards a design attitude that seeks to develop multi-criteria IS evaluation approach based on contextual experience and prior knowledge. The proposed approach enables organizations to design and develop a value case using value dials as a common language that defines what constitutes the value of particular IS investments for a specific context. To assess its effectiveness, this approach was applied using a multilevel dialogical action research project within a Swedish public organization. The findings show that managers in this organization significantly improved the effectiveness of their evaluation of IS investments. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From Origins to Implications: Key Aspects in the Debate over the Digital Divide",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Defined as the differential extent to which rich countries and poor countries benefit from various forms of information technology (IT), the global digital divide has been extensively measured and described in national as well as international debates. The problem, however, is that the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely, there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in developing countries. </jats:p>",

In this paper we seek to apply a historical perspective in order to understand what factors shaped its development path. In particular we are interested to document and explain changes that took place in the captive sector vis-a-vis extant country attractiveness frameworks. To achieve this objective, we examine changes that multinationals introduced in their offshore captive investments concerning the type of the captive they set up, the functions they offshored through a captive centre and to which location. Information was collected from secondary sources on offshore captive investments made by Fortune 250 global firms between 1985 and 2010. On the basis of the analysis the paper considers the importance of disrupting factors to the extant country selection literature. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Control is vital for IS projects to be delivered on time and within budget. Control theory helps us better understand and explain control in information systems operations and development. However, simplistic notions about control do not correspond to how control actually works. We believe that a social perspective that sees controls as negotiated orders, and not just things imposed by controllers on controlees, better explains control of IS projects and operations. Through an interpretive case study of client-vendor control in the IS department of a large agricultural distributor, we show that: (1) control enactment involves the controller's consideration of the social and organizational context as well as the controller's intention. (2) Control enactment involves a socially constructed meaning and unintended consequences. (3) The control enactment also involves controlee intent either because of negotiation with the controller, or indirectly by way of alternative structures. Finally, (4) the control itself influences the controller and controlee in unanticipated ways. Seeing control as the result of negotiated orders between controllers and controlees contributes to control theory by suggesting that, in practice, negotiation, shaping and re-appropriation are necessary for successful control enactment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the influence of information technology (IT) on a distinct but closely related industry, the video game industry. We conceptualize the effects of IT as a process of translating three related dimensions of a technological frame - technology performance, industry practices, and use vision - from one industry to another. Through historical examples, we argue that the impact of IT on the video game industry is shaped and limited by this translation process, particularly when tensions between the two industries lead to the development of new complementary or replacement technologies, practices, or visions. Although heavily dependent on IT, the video game industry has had to ignore, postpone, or substantially modify important IT software tools, processors, storage media, graphics, and networking technologies because of these industry contradictions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards Modelling the Effects of National Culture on it Implementation and Acceptance",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Two of the most significant forces shaping organizations are globalization and the continued, rapid and, some would say, radical changes taking place in information technology (IT). To date, the extant literature has centred on the technology acceptance model (TAM) because it is arguably one of the most widely cited and influential models used for explaining the acceptance of IT. However, this literature has remained relatively silent with respect to the role that differences in national culture might play in IT acceptance as globalization continues. In order to begin to address this deficit, this paper offers a series of research propositions that explore the potential impact of differences in national culture on IT implementation and acceptance. Specifically, the paper explores the effects of culturally induced beliefs – including individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long-/short-term orientation and power distance – on the implementation processes that impact on key variables in the TAM. The paper then discusses the potential importance of the revisions it has made for both researchers interested in employing the model for predicting IT acceptance in cross-cultural contexts and for managers faced with introducing new IT in a global organization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information system (IS) project alignment has been defined as the degree to which an IS's project deliverables are consistent with the project's objectives, which are shaped by the organization's IS strategy. These objectives may change as the project unfolds, reflecting emergent opportunities, limitations, and strategy (Jenkin and Chan, 2005). The IS project alignment process refers to the sequence and flow of events that lead to project alignment and, thus, strategy execution. To develop an understanding of project alignment processes – how IS projects become aligned or misaligned – this study examines nine projects across two organizational settings to analyze the key events and processes of project alignment. By analyzing three different project patterns using different organizational metaphors, this study explains evidence contradicting widely held beliefs about project management. Rather than planning and process maturity, the results of this study highlight the importance of executing processes, change, learning, knowing in practice, and heedful interrelating between project team members to align final project deliverables. This research, based on an empirical study, contributes to both the IS alignment and project management literatures by further developing the emerging concept of project alignment to include a process view of how to achieve alignment of final project deliverables with IS project objectives and the IS strategy. </jats:p>",

However, a number of other technological options are now available, which include EPC Gen2-based RFID systems, Global Positioning System solutions, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-based systems, and manual hand-held data collection devices integrated with the current Freight Operations System. Each of these systems has its own advantages and limitations. Although Indian Railways officials are going ahead with the pilot project, they are uncertain as to the appropriate technological choice, given the wide range of available technology options. Further, they are faced with competing interests from different stakeholder groups (departments), who favor different technologies. </jats:p>",

Using data collected from the Slashdot forum, this paper reconstructs the discussion threads as hierarchical networks and proposes a model for their comparison and classification. In addition to the substantive topic of discussion, which corresponds to the different sections of the forum (such as Developers, Games, or Politics), we classify the threads according to structural features like the maximum number of comments at any level of the network (i.e. the width) and the number of nested layers in the network (i.e. the depth). We find that political discussion networks display a tendency to cluster around the area that corresponds to wider and deeper structures, showing a significant departure from the structure exhibited by other types of discussions. We propose using this model to create a framework that allows the analysis and comparison of different internet technologies for the promotion of political deliberation. </jats:p>",

More agile, with less pain, with more return to all the members of the network, now and over time? The technical answer is to create a ‘business operating system’ that should run business processes on different organizational platforms. Business processes would become portable: The end-to-end management of processes running across many different organizations in many different forms would become possible.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of grounded theory method (GTM) as a research method in information systems (IS) has gradually increased over the years as qualitative research in general has become more prevalent. The method offers a systematic way to generate theory from data, but is rarely used to its full potential in IS as a number of myths and misunderstandings about GTM prevent researchers from getting the full potential out of the method. To address this problem, we advance the general level of knowledge of GTM. We clarify aspects of the method that are often misunderstood by novice users or casual observers and provide guidance to address common problems. Exemplars from the IS literature are used to illustrate the concepts and to promote the informed use of the methodology. By doing so, this paper will contribute to improving the use of the method and to the quality and dissemination of grounded theory research outcomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate the emerging meanings of “value” associated with the Internet of Things. Given the current political economy, we argue that the multiple meanings of “value” cannot be reduced to a single domain or discipline, but rather they are invariably articulated at the juxtaposition of three domains: social, economic, and technical. We analyse each of these domains and present domain challenges and cross-domain implications – drawing from an interdisciplinary literature review and gap analysis across sources from academia, business, and governments. We propose a functional model that aggregates these findings into a value-driven logic of the emerging global political economy enabled by digital technology in general and IoT in particular. These conceptual contributions highlight the critical need for an interdisciplinary understanding of the meaning of “value”, so that IoT services and products will create and sustain such concurrent meanings during their entire lifecycle, from design to consumption and retirement or recycling. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From transformation to normalisation: An exploratory study of a large-scale agile transformation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the highly pervasive and effective use of agile methods at the team level, many software organisations now wish to replicate this success at the organisational level, adopting large-scale agile methods. However, an analysis of extant literature reveals (i) a lack of theoretically grounded studies of large-scale agile transformations; (ii) weak assumptions underpinning those that do exist; and (iii) an overly simplistic and often problematic over-reliance on simple adherence to agile methods. In addition, there is a lack of insights on why large-scale agile transformations fail. To explore this, we apply normalisation process theory (NPT) to examine key challenges in normalising (i.e. the process of embedding and sustaining) large-scale agile methods. We present an in-depth case study of large-scale agile transformation and demonstrate how failing to normalise a large-scale agile method can unravel an organisation’s transformation efforts. There are four key contributions from this research. First, this study shows that the standard focus on initial adoption is one of the main reasons for the widespread failure of digital transformations and in this case a large-scale agile transformation. Second, this is the first study to introduce and empirically apply NPT to information system development (ISD) as an illustrative guide for those across information systems field to follow. Third, we present key recommendations based on NPT to guide researchers and practitioners on the normalisation of large-scale transformations. Fourth, we present an agenda for future research on large-scale agile transformations. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Innovation and Scaling of ICT for the Bottom-Of-The-Pyramid",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Scaling represents successful diffusion that ensures sizeable impact and earnings from information and communication technology (ICT) innovations in emerging markets. Practice can still be shaped by dualistic views - innovation vs diffusion, pilot vs scale-up, lead firm vs other actors, technical vs social. Synthesising the literature that challenges these dualities, this paper creates a systemic perspective that is particularly appropriate for scaling of ICT to bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) markets. That perspective is then instantiated through the case study of a successfully-scaled ICT innovation that has reached millions of poor consumers: the Kenyan m-money system, M-Pesa. It finds that scaling of this ICT system can be understood as a four-stage process of exploratory, incremental then aggressive growth, followed by (attempted) standardisation. Throughout these stages of scaling, ongoing adaptive innovations have been fundamental and have been both necessitated and shaped by the BoP context. These innovations have been more socio-technical than technical, and have emerged from a growing variety of actors and locations closer to poor consumers than the lead firm. The lead firm has buffered the unfamiliarity of BoP markets by approaching them through the ‘middle-of-the-pyramid’ and by intensive learning. At times, its planned ‘shifts’ in scaling strategy have triggered adaptive innovations. At other times, emergent innovations and learning lead to incremental ‘drifts’ in lead firm strategy. ICT firms wishing to scale goods and services for BoP markets must therefore recognise the multi-locational, continuous, and emergent nature of innovation, and develop processes to monitor and address those innovations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses on local adaptations, referring to the significant or subtle changes local firms make in their local business processes and rules in order to fit with a generic application system, and to the changes they make in the features of a generic application system. Local adaptations are therefore bidirectional in nature. Although several studies stress the importance of local adaptations for the overall success of information technologies (IT) used across locations, more research is needed regarding what kind of local adaptations are required for a particular generic application system to work well in particular localities. The nature and extent of local adaptations are still poorly understood. This paper provides a concrete illustration of a historically situated local adaptation: the case of Veiling Holambra. This Brazilian cooperative has imported a generic auction marketplace model from Holland and adapted it to local conditions, to succeed in a globalized and competitive flower market. Using concepts drawn from studies on globalization, cross-cultural implementations, and IT-based organizational change literature, we put forward three propositions that help to explain the success of local adaptations. The results of our case study indicate that the immigration of Dutch people was critical for bringing knowledge of cooperative structure and flower production to Holambra and led to a relatively small design-use gap. The ability to take local, contextual requirements into account without neglecting the ‘generic’ knowledge led to the successful implementation of the generic auction model. This mutual influence was particularly enabled by the Brazilian culture of improvization. </jats:p>",

To familiarize researchers with some of the recent trends in this area, we outline how AI can expedite individual steps of the literature review process. Considering that the use of AI in this context is in an early stage of development, we propose a comprehensive research agenda for AI-based literature reviews (AILRs) in our field.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> High failure rates of information systems development (ISD) projects continue to trouble organizations and information systems practices. Such a state of affairs has been of great concern for the information systems discipline for decades, motivating information systems researchers to focus on and extensively study ISD project failure. However, the increasing complexity and uncertainty of ISD projects and contemporary system development processes are challenging ISD project failure scholarship. In this article, we ask the questions: What are the contributions and weaknesses of the extant ISD project failure/success literature? What are potential avenues to move the ISD literature forward? To answer these questions, first, we present a literature review that assesses research contributions within the major perspectives on ISD failure (i.e. rationalist, process and narrative). While the extant research within all perspectives make significant contributions to knowledge, we find that researchers remain preoccupied with ‘project failure’ as an end state of an ISD project. They pay little attention to problematic situations arising during ISD projects before they become failed projects. Based on the review and critique of the literature, we then argue that there is a significant benefit in extending research focus from ISD project failure to ‘ISD project distress’, which we define as a harmful project condition involving dynamic and fluid constellation of critical problems that are difficult to identify, understand and resolve. While ISD project distress is an increasingly perilous and consequential phenomenon, little is known about its nature and potential responses. Drawing from the sensemaking literature, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework for understanding the nature and sources of ISD project distress that provides a foundation for exploring early detection and timely response. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical relevance of the concept of ISD project distress and propose a corresponding research agenda. </jats:p>",

However, its inclusion raises essential questions regarding the review’s methodology, quality, and ethical implications. Previous research predominantly focused on the capabilities and limitations of Gen.AI to establish guidelines for research practices. However, the rapid evolution of Gen.AI often outpaces the publication of methodological papers. In response, our study adopts a criteria-centric approach, scrutinizing the scientific quality standards that Gen.AI must meet. In other words, instead of discussing\n            <jats:italic>what Gen.AI can and cannot do</jats:italic>\n            , we discuss\n            <jats:italic>what we should allow Gen.AI to do</jats:italic>\n            , irrespective of its capabilities. Our study informs researchers in the art and science of SLRs. First, we analyze the established state-of-the-art processes and associated quality standards in SLRs. From this, we synthesize a unified process and criterion set, not only underpinning a comprehensive understanding of the extant SLR methodologies but also serving as the foundational framework for integrating Gen.AI. Second, we delineate the specific scenarios conducive to incorporating Gen.AI into this fundamental framework, as well as situations where its integration may not be suitable. Our contribution is further solidified by providing a detailed, step-by-step guide—akin to a “cooking recipe”—to effectively integrate Gen.AI in SLRs, ensuring adherence to established quality criteria.\n          </jats:p>",

With the blurring boundaries between work and personal life, business software vendors have begun to deliberate on the possibilities for enhancing the rather rigid and impersonal structures in enterprise systems (ES) by integrating social features. In doing so, they frequently assume that business users share the same interaction patterns as private users. In this paper, we challenge this belief and explore the factors that stimulate business users to share information in ES environments. By means of a design experiment, we show different use scenarios and explore business users' attitudes toward open and unconditional information sharing in ES. Our results demonstrate that business users are less ‘social’ and that applying social features in ES is highly context dependent.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research proposes and validates a design theory for digital platforms that support online communities (DPsOC). It addresses ways in which digital platforms can effectively support social interactions in online communities. Drawing upon prior literature on IS design theory, online communities, and platforms, we derive an initial set of propositions for designing effective DPsOC. Our overarching proposition is that three components of digital platform architecture (core, interface, and complements) should collectively support the mix of the three distinct types of social interaction structures of online community (information sharing, collaboration, and collective action). We validate the initial propositions and generate additional insights by conducting an in-depth analysis of an European digital platform for elderly care assistance. We further validate the propositions by analyzing three widely used digital platforms, including Twitter, Wikipedia, and Liquidfeedback, and we derive additional propositions and insights that can guide DPsOC design. We discuss the implications of this research for research and practice. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Is code law? Current legal and technical adoption issues and remedies for blockchain-enabled smart contracts",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Blockchain technology has enabled so-called smart contracts between different parties on a decentralized network. These self-enforceable and self-executable computerized contracts could initiate a fundamental paradigm shift in the understanding and functioning of our legal practices. Opportunities for their application are increasingly understood, and numerous tests of feasibility have been completed. However, only very few use cases have yet been implemented at scale. This article—as the first of its kind—comprehensively analyzes the underlying challenges and locates a key reason for the slow adoption in the discrepancy between legal requirements and IT capabilities. Our work combines a wide range of academic sources and interviews with 30 domain experts from IT, the legal domain and private industry. First, we establish that smart contracts still fall within the boundaries of the general legal framework. We then systematically dissect current shortcomings of smart contracts on three distinct levels, namely, (1) how smart contracts are likely to cause conflicts with existing laws, (2) how smart contracts are intrinsically limited on an individual contract level and (3) how they are impeded by their current technical design. Across those levels, we dissect 20 distinct issues concerning the current implementation of smart contracts for which we derive potential remedies. We further outline implications for policy-makers as well as IT management, and examine how information systems research can play an important role in advancing smart contracts. Finally, we show how managerial and organizational issues might represent an ongoing challenge for the widespread adoption of smart contracts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Maturity models can be seen as support tools for an organization. Their importance is increasing in the scientific community and IT (Information Technology) organizations are starting to implement them. The main objective of maturity models is to evaluate and improve the organization’s practices by creating an improvement roadmap. However, the utilization of the methodologies and methods by this community for the development of this kind of tools is not consensual. Several investigators have created guidelines for the development of maturity models, but the authors are not adopting them; they prefer to adopt their own methodologies. In this research, with the objective of reviewing the methodologies, methods, and guidelines used by the scientific community to develop IT maturity models, a Systematic Literature Review and a Critical analysis were made in order to realize a comparison between IT maturity models and Non-IT maturity models. In total, 109 articles of maturity models’ development were analyzed. A discussion of the articles’ results was realized. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Orchestration of digital platform ecosystems has been well examined in the context of markets and the private sector where an orchestrator is a resourceful firm exploiting commercial opportunities in an industry. However, little is known about how it occurs when a government organization orchestrates to address societal challenges. We build upon the construct of “robust action”—identified with chess masters who play to advance a broad strategy while simultaneously maintaining flexibility—to explain how orchestration by a government organization might overcome initiation, stabilization, expansion, and meta-governance challenges through digital platform-enabled participative architecture, multivocal inscriptions, and distributed experimentation. Evidence for our theoretical framework is drawn from empirical studies of the Aadhaar, a platform ecosystem orchestrated to address multiple societal challenges stemming from identity and its management. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Not only data: The necessity of abstract thinking to make sense of digital phenomena",
    "abstract": "We appreciate Grisold et al. (2022) commentary on our article Grover and Lyytinen (2022). There is much to like about the commentary: it offers strong advice and develops plausible solutions and policies of how endorse inductive digital “trace data” based platform research. This engages with and leverages the increased access to large swaths of heterogeneous digital trace data and applies powerful computational methods to analyze it. We stated already in Grover and Lyytinen (2015) such that efforts are laudable and necessary and should be pursued. We note this in (a) the debate article’s section “Barrier 2: Descriptive studies are not valued unless informed by reference theory-based framing” and (b) the section “Barrier 3: Belief that big data obfuscates the need for innovative theory” where we urge scholars to leverage computationally intensive techniques to go beyond the local data to broader and bolder abstractions (Grover and Lyytinen 2022 p 6). For us, investing in community wide efforts to leverage digital (trace) data in reporting and analyzing emergent digital phenomena is thus in line with the pursuit to rebalance the intellectual investments in the IS field (Grover and Lyytinen 2015, 2022). So, most the Grisold et al.’s proposals and policy recommendation do not contradict, nor do they rebuke our position of loosening institutional structures and norms to promote more flexibility in our theorizing approaches. The question for us is: what is the proper way to balance the field’s intellectual effort as we need to deal with deeply digital phenomena. Here, we disagree with Grisold et al. in what ways two alternative pathways—blue ocean theorizing (theory from the mind) vs. inductive/abductive theorizing (theory from data)—need to be juxtaposed during balancing. Simply, what is the right balance between the two pathways for the field’s intellectual effort in the coming decade? We object and challenge the premise of Grisold et al.’s argument to pursue only the latter because innovative theorizing is now ‘moot’ given the high fluidity of digital phenomena. Or, as they put: “we offer an alternative view: we suggest to focus less on explaining phenomena and instead concentrate on making them explainable, by finding ways to capture and represent the complexity and detail about dynamically evolving socio-technical phenomena in a precise and timely manner...such that any researcher, from within our field or from elsewhere, will be better enabled to analyze, reason, or theorize about them.” (Grisold et al. p.1–2). Clearly, for Grisold et al. the two alternatives form a dualism (with either/or logic) and exclude one another. In contrast, we approach the two as a duality (both/and logic) where both are necessary to rebalance the field’s intellectual effort. We proposed such duality already in Grover and Lyytinen (2015) with the phrase “push to the edges.” We repeat this idea in Grover and Lyytinen (2022) where we are clear that both approaches are necessary and useful. Though the Grover and Lyytinen (2022) centers on formulating theories of the mind (one pathway), we never posit that this pathway excludes other pathways including even drawing on reference theories when they serve their purpose. Our core justification for honoring this logic is simple. Given the fundamentally different nature of digital phenomena, we need also more embedded constructs and more powerful abstractions. Our modus operandi of relying on reference theories, treated as immutable, is not likely to work for digital phenomena—and we need to promote the tremendous latent potential of abstract thinkers by allowing more flexibility to our theorizing. This flexibility also includes digital trace data, and platform-based research, albeit with some cautionary notes that we describe in Grover, et al. (2020). Therefore, we want to rebuke Grisold et al.’s fixation to dualism. This is mainly backed up by claims of the disutility of innovative theorizing and that this comes at the expense of inductive/abductive data driven research. We back our position with two general notes that put this specific debate in a broader disciplinary perspective. The first one focuses on the general role and impact of data driven research in the evolution of disciplinary fields and what we can learn from it. The second one touches on some premises of Grisold",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information systems development methodologies are frequently classified according to themes or features. Yet potential users are more concerned with the situations in which different approaches are appropriate. In this paper, five problem situation types are identified: (1) well-structured problem situations with a well-defined problem and clear requirements, (2) well-structured problem situations with clear objectives but uncertain user requirements, (3) unstructured problem situations with unclear objectives, (4) situations where there is a high user interaction with the system and (5) complex problem situations. Typical information systems development methodologies are placed in each of these groups. Some strengths and weaknesses of this classification are discussed. One conclusion is that most projects will fall within the category of complex problem situations, for organizations (and therefore their information systems needs) are invariably complex in terms of the human and social aspects at least as much as any technological ones. The Multiview approach is discussed in more detail because the authors claim it is suitable for such situations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ERP (enterprise resource planning) packages provide generic off-the-shelf business and software solutions for customers. However, these packages are implemented in companies with different corporate and national cultures and there is growing evidence that failure to adapt ERP packages to fit these cultures leads to projects which are expensive and overdue. This paper describes research which synthesizes social science theories of culture in order to be able to model and predict the impact of culture on ERP package implementation. It describes a knowledge meta-schema for modelling the surface and deeper manifestations of culture and predictions of ERP implementation problems based on national culture differences. It reports on an empirical study into the implementation of ERP packages in a large pharmaceuticals organization in Scandinavia and the UK. The results provide evidence for an association between corporate culture and ERP implementation problems but no direct evidence for an association between national culture and implementation problems. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that these diverse implementation problems can be caused by a mismatch between a small set of core values which are indicative of a customer's corporate culture. The paper concludes with revisions to the design of our extended method for ERP package implementation to the design of the meta-model and to rules that codify culture constraints that are applied in order to analyse instances of the meta-model. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cognitive automation (CA) moves beyond rule-based business process automation to target cognitive knowledge and service work. This allows the automation of tasks and processes, for which automation seemed unimaginable a decade ago. To organizations, these CA use cases offer vast opportunities to gain a significant competitive advantage. However, CA imposes novel challenges on organizations’ decisions regarding the automation potential of use cases, resulting in low adoption and high project failure rates. To counteract this, we draw on an action research study with a leading European manufacturing company to develop and test a model for assessing use cases’ amenability to CA. The proposed model comprises four dimensions: cognition, data, relationship, and transparency requirements. The model proposes that a use case is less (more) amenable to CA if these requirements are high (low). To account for the model’s industry-agnostic generalizability, we draw on an internal evaluation within the action research company and three additional external evaluations undertaken by independent project teams in three distinct industries. From a practice perspective, the model will help organizations make more informed decisions in selecting use cases for CA and planning their respective initiatives. From a research perspective, the identified determinants affecting use cases’ amenability to CA will enhance our understanding of CA in particular and artificial intelligence as the driving force behind CA in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the ways in which to conduct planning for information services (IS) so that both computing and business problems may be addressed in an integrated fashion. It traces the evolution of IS planning from a more reactive mode, with a steering committee deciding on future directions, to a value-added approach where incremental components of a total IS product are offered to user managers for consideration. This helps overcome problems with the strategic planning process itself which is both incremental and cyclical. The organisation often focuses on a direction, only to change as the economic environment or market conditions change. The IS function consequently must move away from plans set in concrete in spite of implementation difficulties associated with that approach. The problem is one of aligning the IS plan with an often mobile corporate plan. In order to respond to this situation, there has been a move towards a marketing of IS services, so organisations can avail themselves of IS opportunities that are within the capabilities of the IS function to deliver. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Challenging the Hierarchical Perspective on Information Systems: Implications from External Information Analysis",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The strategic choices of organizations have traditionally been influenced by their environmental interactions. Consequently, the field of information systems has become increasingly concerned with providing managers with external information. However, such systems are largely based on research that was conducted prior to the important organizational and environmental changes of the late 1980s and 1990s. Much of this research focuses on hierarchical differentiation when providing information (especially external information) to managers. This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the sourcing, dissemination and use of external information in organizations. The results show that managerial demand for such information is unrelated to managerial level, but is influenced by functional affiliation. The study also contradicts many of the previously held beliefs about managerial preferences for information channels and media. These findings have important implications for the field of information systems, especially personnel involved in systems design. </jats:p>",

Chris recently relocated from the Australian Graduate School of Management, University of New South Wales to join the Oxford Institute of Information Management, Templeton College, Oxford.

The  rst, an International Advisory Board, will provide feedback and direction, and a source of expert advice to the Editors-in-Chief. The second will be absolutely vital to our operations, indeed in many ways it will be the engine of the Journal. The following excellent colleagues have agreed to join the new Editorial Board, and we are delighted that they have chosen to devote their considerable energies, experience, academic prowess and commitment to the cause of strengthening even further the quality and speed of reviewing. We shall continue to increase the strength of the Editorial Board over the next few months, but in the meantime we are very pleased indeed to welcome on to the new Board:",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has come a long way since the pioneering Dartmouth Conference which fixed upon the name. It has been a long road to the place at which the science now finds itself, but it may be an even longer road to its stated aim of producing a machine which can think. This is why the new paradigm of neural computing, or connectionism, seems so tempting: connectionism copies the way in which a realized thinking machine, the brain, works, in a 'nice' way; it has produced some extremely impressive results in a relatively short period of widespread study and, for the moment at least, it seems to take a step back from the superficially contrived and convoluted methods of representing knowledge and reasoning that traditional rulebased methods use.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines public discourse in order to illuminate the processes by which issues of anonymity, surveillance, security, and privacy are integrated into public understandings of, and interactions with, consumer payment systems. Using theories of the social construction of technology, and Gamson's model of issue construction, it analyses the issue package deployed by the developer of the Ecash electronic payment system. An issue package is a set of framing devices which focus and constrain discussion of a particular issue. The paper then analyses three different discursive sites (print media, US Congressional deliberation, and an electronic mailing list) to gauge the success of that package, according to its presence and its resonance within each site. Using theories of frame alignment and social mobilization, the package is identified as a globalizing framing strategy. Its failure is explained by the difficulties a frame of such structure will have in meshing with the discursive practice of each site, in resonating with cultural themes of each site, and in provoking social action. </jats:p>",

The increasing encouragement given by the information systems industry to regard this expenditure as a business opportunity has made CEOs regard this expenditure less as a necessary operational cost and more as an investment. However, the ‘post-crash’ environment from 1987, and the 1990-93 recession have brought to business a new atmosphere of cost justification in information technology (IT) expenditure, and managers are seeking a realistic benefit evaluation to accompany computer investment submissions to the board.",

    "abstract": "Volume 5, issue number 1 marks the start of a new era for the Journal of Information Technology. We publish our revised policy statement on page 3, it charts a new direction for the Journal. The central theme of the redeveloped policy is the study of all aspects of the management of the production of information by technology, and how it could affect the performance of organizations and of methods of ensuring that this information is both effective and efficiently produced. Of particular interest are issues concerning the penetration of IT into the traditional arena of general management. For example, the crucial role of commissioning and paying for information systems which has caused many severe problems for organizations, has repercussions for general management training. The recent BCS task group report on hybrid managers (From Potential to Reality, Jan 1990) is a major contribution to the debate on management education and IT to which J/T looks forward to contributing. Discussion of the future of IT takes JIT into the arena of general management because the lesson that successful IT comes from a partnership between business and technical people (sometimes within the same person the hybrid) is being learnt by an increasing number of organizations. Each group has a crucial and equally important role to play in ensuring that the technology delivers what it is capable of delivering. This means that J/T is concerned not only with the detail of making the technology work but much more importantly with the challenge of getting the right systems in place for a given organization to match the requirements of the current business environment. Discussion of these issues takes place against the background of today's models of structuring organizations with respect to the IT function. The business survey from MSA, 'Excellence and the IT factor', describes the way today's excellent companies organize their IT; there are few surprises there. This is in itself surprising because of the skills shortage and the range of initiatives to counteract this issue. JIT aims to enter the debate on ways of combating the IT skills shortage. To achieve these aims JIT will publish original papers and reports on research from industry and academia, appropriate conference proceedings, case studies, book reviews.JIT aims to stimulate discussion of further major issues such as national and international policy on IT, funding of research and development, security of information, and international sharing of the technology. JIT wants readers to contribute to this discussion by means of personal view articles and letters to the editor. The editorial team has put in place a fast refereeing process and the publication time is getting shorter; both factors contribute toJIT's aim of producing high quality issues in as short a time as posible.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Xcert's business is in developing Internet and Intranet security enhancement technology. Xcert was founded in April 1996 by Andrew Csinger and Pat Richard and was headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Xcert's solution to Internet security was a public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI is a system of digital certificates, certificate authorities (CAs) and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an Internet transaction. Xcert's PKI technology allows organizations of any size to issue digital certificates to their members. These organizations become their own CA and are empowered to issue digital certificates to their individual client base. This case study is about a start-up company that is in transition from a dream stage to a reality stage. One of the issues that surfaces in the case study is intraindustry competition. Despite being an early entrant into the Internet security business, Xcert faced brutal competition from companies such as Entrust, Nortel, VeriSign and Netscape. The problems facing the company include (1) finances, (2) future direction and leadership, (3) structure, experience and size and (4) marketing. This is a very rich case study with a number of interrelated issues. The case serves two teaching aims. Firstly, this case allows students to confront and discuss real-life issues facing a start-up information technology (IT) company. The students analysing the case are asked to provide alternatives and solutions to the problems by putting themselves in the positions of the founders of the company. Students should come to understand the difficulty in managing a start-up company and the various trade-offs the management needs to make. Secondly, the case study introduces various Internet security concepts to students. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Methodology for the Evaluation of IT for Strategic Implementation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The integration of business strategic planning and IT has been raised as one of the most important issues facing management in the 1990s. At the same time, there have been spectacular failures when business ventures have sought to exploit information technology. So how does business management go about applying information technology in order to maximize the possibility of gaining success, while minimizing the possibility of failure? Most literature concerned with information technology and evaluation focuses on the evaluation of benefits from the use of a technology. The limited amount of literature which considers the ‘front end’ of the process of selection, as well as implementation of information technology, is more concerned with identifying the business problem areas, the actions of competitors or how to set priorities between projects, than looking at the potential utility of a new or emergent technology. This paper presents a practical methodology which can be used by management to evaluate an information technology and to determine its apparent suitability for their business at this particular time. Its strength lies in the capability of IS management and line managers to quickly and cost-effectively identify the major opportunities for the application of technology to business problems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are comprehensive packaged software solutions that integrate organizational processes through shared information and data  ows. With their promise of being cheaper to acquire and maintain than custom-built applications, they are often the preferred replacement for legacy computer systems. Although highly con gurable to different situations, ERP systems’ data structures, program code and in-built assumptions about processes can impose patterns of behaviour on organizations that some  nd very dif cult to accept. Today’s ERP systems have evolved from packaged software and now support material requirements planning (MRP) and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II). With additional functionality, including sales,  nance, human resources and purchasing, today’s ERP systems provide support for most commercial functions of any organization. They may be con gured for organizations in many different sectors. In response to developments in electronic business, ERP systems are now being extended to include World Wide Web capability, customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM) and support for the electronic market-places, thereby creating a suite of enterprise applications software. ERP vendors experienced rapid growth throughout the 1990s and most Fortune 500 companies now have them installed. Revenues  attened out in 1999 because both year 2000-related implementations were being completed and the market was saturating: many large organizations have now converted to ERP systems. Notwithstanding this, the 1999 market for ERP software and services was estimated at US$17 billion and is forecast to grow to US$21 billion by 2004 (AMR Research, 2000). Five major vendors dominate the ERP market. Market shares in 1999 were SAP 30%, Oracle 14%, Peoplesoft 7%, J. D. Edwards 5%, Baan 3% and ‘other’ 41% (Gilbert, 2000). ERP system implementation costs are often reported to be  ve to ten times the cost of software licences (Davenport, 2000, p. 68). If so, organizations worldwide spent something like US$90–180 billion on ERP systems in 1999. Looking to the future, AMR Research forecasts that, by 2004, sales of CRM, SCM and electronic marketplace software will each match the current US$20 billion per annum sales of ERP software, up from only a few billion dollars each today. Today, there is also a sizeable and growing market in upgrading ERP software to accommodate new software releases, particularly as ERP vendors Internet enable their product offerings. In addition, there is a growing market in enterprise application integration (EAI) tools for binding various software packages together and a move to outsourcing the provision of enterprise application services through what are known as application service providers (ASPs). Developments on so many fronts make it hard to predict what the enterprise application software market will look like in even a few years time, but the future looks bright. In this special edition of the Journal of Information Technology, we focus on the core systems in today’s enterprise applications market-place, namely ERP systems. ERP systems in organizations have been likened to nervous systems in people. Because they affect so many parts of an organization, ERP systems can provide a huge range of bene ts and problems, often with different bene ts in different organizations. In a recent study of 233 organizations that had implemented ERP systems, Shang and Seddon (2000) classi ed the bene ts of ERP systems into  ve categories.",

    "abstract": "We take this opportunity to remind readers and those wishing to contribute that the December 1990 edition of the Journal will be devoted to the theme The Evaluation of Information Systems Investments. Recent surveys carried out by ourselves as well as Business Intelligence indicate that this is a theme of widespread current interest, as those who stay in contact with the lecture and conference circuit will also readily appreciate. Readers who wish to gain a taste of some of the current debates and thinking in this area are referred to the conference report in the December Volume 4 No. 4 edition of the Journal, and the book review (Parker et al. Information Economics) in Volume 5 No. 1. The major interest in IT evaluation seems to stem from a combination of the increasingly large amounts being spent on IT together with considerable dissatisfaction and scepticism about the efficacy of the more traditional methods used for analysing costs and benefits from IT. As a related point, the perceived increasing importance of evaluation methods to organizations would also seem to arise as a reaction against the consequences of too often abandoning normal business rigour and practice when deciding on making investments in IT. Whilst the decision to invest in strategic information systems is often characterized as an 'act of faith', unfortunately this has too often been interpreted too literally; belatedly managers are realizing that there are possible gradations in the quality of the 'act of faith' and that those responsible for making and controlling IT investments are not, and should not be, helpless in the face of the seeming inevitability of the need to adopt IT. The December issue will include the results of recent research on the evaluation of IT investments, and on methods adopted by successful companies, as well as details of a benefit-level matrix usable with strategic information systems as a tool for analysis and synthesis. Contributions in the form of refereed papers, personal reviews or reviews are always welcome and should be sent to either editor at the editorial office address in the first instance.",

    "title": "Book Review: The Trouble with Computers: Usefulness, Usability, and Productivity",
    "abstract": "Imperial College. From 1990 the group have been engrossed in the development of a virtual neural state machine, known by this name, to investigate through experiment the explanatory potential of automata theory for the variety of mental properties we conscious humans enjoy. Inspired by the structure of George Kelly's 'Theory of Personal Constructs' he begins with what he modestly terms a Basic Guess, that the sensations of consciousness are founded in the firing patterns of neurons within a neural state machine. The Guess is followed by a series of thirteen Consequences which expound the relevance of this Guess to both our personal experiences of this phenomenon and the theo­ ries and debates, philosophical and psychological, which have attended them down the decades. Through the topics of memory, self awareness, language, meaning, abstraction and emotion he introduces the issues and protagonists and reinterprets them with reference to automata theory. Locke and Kant, Frege and Wittgenstein, Chomsky, Piaget and their modem day successors appear in cameo and these sections are themselves a clear and useful reprise for the casual student of philosophy. Central to the author's belief in the relevance of automata theory to consciousness is the ability of a neural state machine to learn iconic representations of its environment. In this way he undercuts Searle's famous 'Chinese Room' objection that a rule-based AI could do no more than seem to be conscious, for such a machine would indeed ground its internal, 'mental' processes in the stuff of experience. But this can only be a foundation for consciousness; Aleksander goes on to argue that self awareness arises from the ability of the organism to act upon its environment in response to the internal processing of sensory experience with reference to memory. Abstraction derives from the ability to generate labels by binding together repre­ sentations and by grouping sets and subsets of such labelled images, where the labelling scheme is learnt, reinforced and developed by social interaction through language. He further postulates that a sense of free will arises from the ability to trace ahead multiple trajectories through a state space of experience coupled with the learnt ability to act on the environment in favour of desired outcomes. The analysis of emotion is perhaps the most ephemeral and least satisfying, attributing emotional responses to the internalisation and elaboration of instinctive sensations though experience. As if to compensate, and to leaven the rather weighty subject matter, Aleksander interleaves a short science pction, both romantic and satirical. In Molecula's Tale his anagrammatic alter ego, Red Naskela, attracts the fasci­ nation of a research council co-ordinator, and the fury Book reviews",

    "title": "Under pressure: Understanding the dynamics of coordination in IT functions under business-as-usual and emergency conditions",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an era when technologies have become a backbone of most organizations, IT support functions are under immense pressure not only to ensure provision and reliability of IS and technologies but also to resolve IS incidents of different severity when they disrupt organizations’ “business-as-usual.” This article addresses this challenge by investigating how organizational IT functions coordinate their work under different degrees of uncertainty in order to provide reliable IT services. We conceptualize coordination in IT support functions as a process that unfolds over time through interactions between four underlying coordination practices employed to provide reliable IT services: prioritizing tasks, following procedures, using roles and responsibilities, and utilizing networks. Furthermore, we show how these coordination practices change when IT incidents cause a shift from normal (i.e. “business-as-usual”) to emergency conditions. Our empirical research in two IT functions supporting two types of organizations (traditional and fast-response) demonstrate that IT functions in these two types of organizations respond to emergencies differently. Specifically, in emergencies, an IT function supporting a fast-response organization shifts to emergency coordination practices momentarily, as it abandons “normal” coordination practices to rely on an extensive set of formal practices specifically designed for such situations. In contrast, an IT function supporting a traditional organization is unprepared for emergencies—coordinating under emergency conditions involves improvisation, because coordination practices designed to support business-as-usual are not suitable for dealing with emergency situations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes a design methodology of information technology architectures tying organizational requirements to technical choices and costs. The primary goal is to provide a structured support for the selection of the minimum-cost architecture satisfying given organizational requirements. Previous empirical studies have attempted absolute cost comparisons of different architectural solutions, primarily relying on the expertise of practitioners and a priori beliefs, but have rarely taken into account the impact of organizational requirements on costs. Requirements are modelled as information processes, composed of tasks exchanging information and characterized by varying levels of computational complexity. Different architectural distributions of presentation, computation and data management applications are compared. The cost implications of organizational requirements for processing intensity, communication intensity and networking are analysed. The results show a relationship between structural features of information processes and architectural costs and indicate how architectural design should be based on organizational as well as technology considerations. </jats:p>",

Against that backdrop, we draw on the distinction between digital mediation and digital representation to investigate tensions in how actors transfer information across organizational and technological boundaries, how they translate information into meaning, and how they eventually transform information into action in digitalized work. We illustrate and develop this framing through detailed analyses of digitally enabled, condition-based maintenance of equipment in a mining context. Drawing on these analyses and extant literature, we advance theory on tensions in how digital technologies are implicated in producing and consuming information in today’s increasingly heterogeneous work practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to attend the under-theorisation of gender within the Information Systems (IS) literature by adopting a critical and feminist approach to the organisational context of IS development and use. The IS are conceived of as innovations with theoretical concepts and observations for comprehending the innovation process advanced within Social Studies of Technology being described and applied to IS. Consequently, a conceptual framework for studying gender and IS is constructed by combining insights derived from: (1) gender and computing, concerning the differences and inequalities of development and use of IS; (2) gender and society concerning the existence of gendered spheres; (3) studies of gender and organisations concerning the social division of labour; and (4) gender and technology, concerning the masculinity of technology culture. The developed framework is tabulated, areas for future research suggested and potential research questions outlined. The latter employ examples from the field of nursing to illustrate their tangible application. The framework constitutes a contribution to IS research by providing access to additional explanations for organisational phenomena (such as user rejection); by deepening our understanding of the innovation process; by improving IS practice through increased awareness of social issues (especially gender); and by promoting further potential topics for IS researchers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Component-based development (CBD) can be an appealing proposition to globally distributed software development teams because of the almost endless possibilities to recombine and reuse components in new products. In particular, it has been suggested that CBD will improve globally distributed software development practices by allowing each site to take ownership of particular components, resulting in reduced inter-site communication and coordination activities. Such an approach may indeed overcome breakdowns in inter-site coordination efforts; however, it may also lessen opportunities to share knowledge between sites and may hamper opportunities to reuse existing components. A case study approach, exploratory in nature, was adopted to explore knowledge aspects in global component-based software development. Evidence collected at several globally distributed CBD projects suggests that the true potential of CBD, which mainly relates to reusing components, can also be achieved when components are developed in a joint manner (i.e. by several sites) by accessing and utilizing expertise regardless of its geographical location. To improve the rate of component reuse, the studied teams developed capabilities in three particular areas: inter-site coordination, communications, and knowledge management. The paper concludes by discussing the links between component reuse, CBD principles and organizational capabilities, and offers managers and engineers some guidelines to consider in their CBD projects. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research into the acceptance of technology is in need of an alternative approach. Despite repeated calls for research to guide our colleagues-in-practice in the deployment of systems that are accepted, there has yet to be systematic research into the relationship between the decisions made by individuals and the bottom-line impact that is derived from user acceptance. This study fills the gap in the literature by theorizing a process-based view of information technology (IT) acceptance. We report on a narrative study of 30 users of an ERP deployment and, analyzing this qualitative data through the lens of the five decisions of acceptance proposed by Schwarz and Chin, propose a process model of IT acceptance. We conclude by theorizing on the relationship between these structures and the corresponding bottom-line impacts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In virtually every information systems (IS) project, control is exercised on multiple hierarchical project levels. For example, senior managers exercise control over project team leaders, who in turn exercise control over distinct groups of project team members. Most prior studies have exclusively focused on one specific controller-controllee dyad. As a result, there is little understanding of how IS project control is exercised across different hierarchical levels. To close this research gap, we conducted a case study of a large IS project at a major engineering firm. Our study helps enrich the traditional mode-based typology of control with the dimension of control style, that is, the distinction between enabling and coercive control. Our research contributes novel insights to the IS control literature in three ways: (1) we find that the senior management level and the project management level differ in the use of control style but not in the use of control modes, (2) we identify several factors that influence the choice of a particular control style, and (3) we find that senior managers can influence project activities on lower levels by implementing controls that can be readily emulated by project leaders as well as transmitted through hierarchical levels with little distortion. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Advances in Intelligent Information Technology: Re-Branding or Progress towards Conscious Machines?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Is artificial intelligence (AI) just something that is done in laboratories disconnected from the development of the pragmatic computing, which constitutes current information technology or does it contribute to progress in computing and information technology? It has even been suggested that advances in AI are merely a re-branding exercise for promises that are rarely kept. This paper is a personal view of the forces that have driven the development of AI in the past and what might be a serious paradigm shift in the future. The latter points to what appears to be the most abstruse corner of the subject: the modelling of the human brain and the possibility of designing systems with the brain's ability to create conscious thought. There have been accusations that AI is always ahead on promise and behind on delivery. This is an inaccurate view. In broad terms, the argument presented here suggests that as AI developed, progress was achieved by overcoming unforeseen difficulties in the pursuit of very ambitious targets, not just a re-branding of promises. This process not only advanced AI but also fed into the mainstream of computing that underpins the information technology of the present time. While the outcome of the paradigm shift towards conscious machines, which is examined at the end of this paper is still unclear, it is possible to speculate how information technology might be affected in the future. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Predicting the Implementation Effort of Erp Projects: Empirical Evidence on SAP/R3",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the impact of the technical size and organizational complexity of SAP/R3 projects on implementation effort. Traditional models for predicting software implementation effort tie measures of code size and programming complexity to development time. ERP projects shift a significant proportion of the implementation effort from code development to the parameterization of a pre-existing software package. At the same time, they move complexity from technical to organizational factors since they force companies to adapt to predefined work processes embedded in the software. This paper redefines the concepts of size and complexity for ERP projects and empirically verifies their impact on implementation effort. Specifically, project size is measured in terms of the number of SAP modules and submodules that are implemented, while complexity is defined as the organizational scope of the project in terms of users involved and overall company size. Hypotheses are tested on 43 SAP/R3 projects conducted in a cross-section of manufacturing companies. The findings show that both the technical size and organizational complexity of projects are relevant drivers of implementation effort. The results indicate that implementation effort not only grows with the number of modules and submodules that are selected for implementation, but that SAP is found to require increasing resources to be implemented in larger companies and for a higher number of users, thus indicating that, while there is a technical component of effort that is independent of the organizational breadth of the project, each user adds an organizational component of costs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Trust is a complex phenomenon that pervades human relations. It is essential for the success of business-to-consumer electronic commerce, where many of the tools that can be used in its absence (contracts, advance payments, insurance, etc.) may not be available. However, research as to how consumer trust can be built in an online environment is limited and varies considerably in terms of the dimensions of the problem that are examined. Consequently, much of our understanding of the antecedents of trust in online shopping context remains fragmented. This study uses a previously validated measurement instrument to investigate, in an Irish context, the existence and importance of specific perceptions and factors that are thought to predict the generation of consumer trust in Internet shopping. The research results provide evidence that Irish consumers’ perception of vendor trustworthiness is the result of specific factors that it is possible for vendors to manage. A modified model that addresses the key dimensions of consumer trust in Internet shopping in Ireland is proposed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of a very slow recovery from the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences of IT managerial and technical trends. Going beyond identifying these influential factors is also the need to understand the considerations for addressing them in light of recognizing the respective local characteristics, especially when operating in a globally linked environment, although somehow heavily influenced locally. By comparing and contrasting IT trends from different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) necessary to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. It can also serve as an indicator as the respective geographies evolve from the economic conundrum. The research is based on data from four geographic regions (United States (US), Europe, Asia, and Latin America). The same questionnaire (although translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead authors well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across the geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 620 respondents (275 US, 100 European, 59 Asian, and 186 Latin) in mid-2011. The top five management concerns were: (1) IT and business alignment; (2) business agility and speed to market; (3) business process management and business process reengineering; (4) business productivity and cost reduction; (5) IT reliability and efficiency. The five most influential technologies were: (1) business intelligence; (2) enterprise resource planning systems; (3) cloud computing; (4) mobile and wireless applications; (5) customer relationship management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although inter-organizational information systems (IOIS) implementation has been widely studied, mainstream literature has not focused on understanding how implementation unfolds and how the existing components of the installed base shape the process. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a socio-technical, process-oriented, and multilevel study. Based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of the implementation of an industry IOIS, we develop an explication of IOIS implementation that considers the role of the installed base. Using the lens of actor-network theory (ANT), we counter the mainstream IOIS literature by showing that IOIS implementation cannot only be explained by a fixed set of independent factors; instead, the dynamic mutual shaping of socio-technical actors throughout implementation complements existing factor-based models in explaining the evolution and the outcome (success or failure). The study also shows the importance of complying with the technical and non-technical components of the installed base for an IOIS to be successfully initiated. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Extending the Research Agenda on Diffusion: The Case of Public Program Interventions for the Adoption of E-business Systems in SMEs",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Given the importance of contextual influences on the diffusion of innovations, the theories and methodologies that take context into account are increasingly relevant to research and practice. One such approach, the systems of innovation approach, considers context to be a cascading set of effects arising from various participants and innovations surrounding the production and diffusion of a focal innovation. Based on this approach, we focus on a public program involved in the diffusion of e-business systems to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). E-business systems are complex innovations, and the contextual influences are particularly important here, because SMEs often lack the knowledge and resources to strategically adopt, modify, and use these innovations. Using the systems of innovation approach, we examined the contexts around public program interventions with an SME in order to explain their form and influence on e-business adoption processes. The empirical findings suggest that many public programs fail to effectively deliver interventions because program contexts restrict program personnel's ability to completely assess and respond to the range of adopter needs. While some aspects of the program contexts can be altered by the program directors, others are further removed and are currently beyond our collective control at this point-in-time. The implications for diffusion research and practice are discussed. </jats:p>",

A multi-perspective approach to the BPO decision, encompassing the transaction, the organisation and its context, is proposed and a set of supplier capabilities to deliver upon it is outlined. A case study of outsourced call centres in Australia, based upon interviews with three suppliers and three clients, suggests such a multi-perspective approach is useful but that the interaction between the factors shaping the BPO decision is more complex than envisaged. The case also suggests that a common set of capabilities is sought from suppliers – though it is narrower than first proposed. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Limitations to Building Institutional Trustworthiness through E-Government: A Comparative Study of Two E-Services in Chile",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is much interest in the application of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve the quality, performance, and responsiveness of public sector Institutions thereby potentially Improving trust. However, there is little empirical evidence about the interaction of ICT Implementations on institutional trust of the public sector. This article extends our understanding of the interplay of ICTs in the public sector and Institutional trust through an in-depth comparative case-study of two successful Chilean e-servlces. The article begins by developing a relational conception of institutional trust of which Institutional trustworthiness is a component of that relationship. It then analyses the two cases separately with respect to three dimensions of institutional trustworthiness: good performance, aligned incentives, and the values of fairness and distributive justice. Following this, a comparative analysis of the two cases shows that while the implementation of technology may bring anticipated efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency gains, there are fundamental limitations to improving institutional trustworthiness through technological interventions. In particular, where points of discretion and ambiguity remain, or power asymmetries are exacerbated, trustworthiness is challenged. Furthermore, drawing on the cases and the relational conception of institutional trust, the article argues that enhancing trustworthiness is a constrained optimisation problem in an environment of competing and often conflicting values. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cross-Cultural (mis)Communication in IS Offshoring: Understanding through Conversation Analysis",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The offshoring of information systems (IS) work has seen phenomenal growth in the past 5 or more years. This has resulted in IS professionals, interacting with workers from vastly different cultural backgrounds, in order to deliver IS project and support services. This cultural ‘barrier’ has been highlighted in the IS literature as a key challenge for offshoring; however, the attention given to research in the field has in the main been restricted to surveys or interviews, often reliant on reductionist national culture models. Within the fields of linguistics and anthropology, the ethnographic research technique of conversation analysis (CA) has been successfully applied to cross-cultural communications. However, there have been no concerted research efforts to apply CA to IS research in general and to IS offshoring in particular. Our research aims to address that gap by analysing naturally occurring recordings of telephone conferences between offshore vendor staff in India and UK/US employees of a major pharmaceutical company. The research has identified and analysed two important phenomena observed within these communications. Firstly, evidence of asymmetries of participation across cultural divides has been documented, and analysed for underlying causes, such as different attitudes to hierarchy and a lack of shared understanding of expected responses. Secondly, differences in the rhetorical organisation of conversation by participants have also been observed and clearly documented within transcribed specimens of these conversations. These phenomena led to seven findings that are aimed to stimulate further research. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this paper demonstrates how the methodological approach of CA can be applied to IS offshoring research, producing key insights into culturally loaded conversations with clear applications for practice. We hope that this evidence of the potential of CA in IS research will inspire IS researchers to use the approach in other domains as well as in further work in offshoring situations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Whereas multimedia systems development (MSD) is inherently complex, and increasingly so, little is known about how multimedia designers manage or cope with this complexity. In particular, little is known about complexity beyond technical and process levels, and how such complexity impacts design activity. In this paper we construct a model of MSD based on the formulation of the broader concept of context complexity. This concept, which subsumes but also transcends technical and process complexity, is used to explain design strategies and their consequences. We identify four design contexts that explain, and are also explained by, complexity. These contexts map out the ‘landscape for action’ over which design activity takes place. They shape the design environment and the responses taken to it. We use a grounded theory approach to study what designers actually do (as opposed to theorising what they should do). We argue that a better understanding of context determined and context determining strategies better informs interventions aimed at improving MSD design practice. Our main conclusion is that interventions should be directed to those situations where there is a mismatch between the level of complexity in the design context and the level of complexity in the design strategy taken in response to that context. We call these situations ‘breakdown’ contexts and examine their causes and consequences in greater detail. Our claimed contribution is to broaden the concept of design breakdowns through a specific understanding of the role and impact of (context) complexity in MSD. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Claudio Ciborra's improvisation argument provides a realistic dynamic account of how organisational practices address technology. This was developed from the study of malleable open-ended technology, but little research has occurred to investigate the theory's validity within different settings. This paper seeks to address this gap, by examining improvisation in the context of a rigid highly structured technology. It presents findings from the successful implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system within a large international organisation, which was subsequently defined by the ERP vendor as being an ‘exemplary site’. Through the theoretical lens of Actor Network Theory, the paper reveals the improvisation, enactments and constant work around the plan that took place in dealing with the high contingencies of ERP implementation. The study extends the discussion on improvisation and contributes to an already illuminating argument. It invites practitioners to reflect on ERP implementation practice and review their evaluation methods. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports an exploratory case study that used boundary theory to investigate the impact of organisational virtualisation on work units. Specifically, the research analysed the transition in a public sector organisation from permanent, co-located teams to temporary virtual teams and its impact on team boundary properties and activities. The study contributes to existing knowledge of virtual teams and virtualisation processes in several ways. The findings suggest that, contrary to existing thinking, rather than removing organisational and institutional boundaries, virtualisation increases the number and complexity of such boundaries at the work unit level. The findings also indicate that the chronic lack of knowledge sharing on virtual teams is, in addition to difficulties of establishing interpersonal trust, due to a lack of trust in the technology as an appropriate medium for sensitive knowledge sharing. The implications of the study for practice are that efficiency gains from organisational virtualisation can easily be offset by the need to invest additional resources and team members’ time into cultivating a greater number of transient relationships at a distance. Organisations also need to invest in opportunities for face-to-face interaction where sensitive knowledge sharing is a critical resource for a virtual team. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on virtual teams (VTs) has proliferated in the last decades. However, few clear and consistent theoretical attempts to integrate the literature on VTs in a systemic way have emerged. This paper uses the complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to integrate the literature on emergent states in VTs. According to this general framework, VT effectiveness depends on the interaction between three levels of dynamics: local, global and contextual. Team cognition, trust, cohesion and conflict are described as states that emerge from the interactions among the VT members and as parts of global dynamics, they impact on VT effectiveness, and in the same time they are influenced by the outcomes of the VT. The insights on this bidirectional causality as well as other benefits of using the CAS framework to improve our understanding of VTs are discussed in the paper. It also provides an overview of artificial simulation models as well as simulation results concerning the emergence of the four states described in the CAS framework and discusses several ways to improve the accuracy of the simulation models using empirical data collected in real VTs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "clear that ‘knowledge management’ has captured the imagination of both academics and practitioners across a broad range of  elds. These include, for example, information systems (IS), organization theory, strategy, human resources and accounting as well as domains more peripheral to management studies such as library studies and health care. The intense interest in knowledge management is re ected in the surge of articles that have been devoted to the subject since the mid1990s (see, for example, Scarbrough and Swan, 2001; Raub and Rüling, this issue) together with an increasing number of academic and practitioner conferences and workshops in recent years. The papers in this collection are derived from one of these events: the conference on Knowledge Management: Concepts and Controversies. Hosted by the Economic and Social Research Council’s Business Process Resource Centre at Warwick University in February 2000, this drew together academics from across disciplinary boundaries and countries together with a number of practitioners keen to re ect on issues in knowledge management. The fact that this conference, with its emphasis on ‘concepts’ and ‘controversies’, drew over 120 submissions and 200 participants indicated the level of dissatisfaction with what had been previously written in the name of knowledge management. Many of the papers attempted to develop more critical re ections on, and understandings of knowledge management, thus moving the subject away from the overly technocratic and prescriptive accounts that had dominated to that point. The papers were broad and eclectic, illuminating the subject from different aspects. Those selected for this issue were chosen for their particular emphasis on developing more critical and inevitably less optimistic insights into the role of information technology (IT) in knowledge management. It is not the purpose of this editorial to impose some super cial logic or overarching perspective on knowledge management from the papers included. Diversity, we assume, provides the best basis from which to question and develop our understanding of the role of IT in knowledge management. That said, what became evident in bringing this collection together is that all the articles represent a ‘new wave’ of research in the ‘ eld’ (using the term loosely) of knowledge management. Essentially, this can be described as the reintegration of technology with people and their organizational context. Each paper tackles the subject of knowledge management from a different angle and different level of analysis (for example, contrast Raub and Rüling’s meso-level study of knowledge management discourse with the micro-level analysis of codi cation in IT design of Sørensen and Snis). However, a common strand is the willingness to question oppositional categories that pit technology versus social relations. They do so by highlighting the mutual shaping of technology, people and organization that forms the nexus of the production and exploitation of knowledge. This involves unpacking the ‘black box’ of IT by exposing the speci c processes (of learning and innovation) and mechanisms (of organization and power) in knowledge management initiatives through which technological artefacts shape and are shaped by social relations. Thus, the papers in this collection provisionally reunite (although not in any universal sense) the development of IT systems with their social, cognitive and organizational contexts and seek to break down the reductive dichotomies that have characterized much of the debate on knowledge management to date. Although ‘knowledge’ and ‘management’ as terms have been around for a long time, their combination is relatively new. It can be traced back to the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that allow interaction regardless of distance (Alavi and Leidner, 1999), but also resonates well with ideas in organization studies and strategy regarding the importance of knowledge-intensive  rms, knowledge work and knowledge as an organizational resource (cf. Starbuck, 1992; Grant, 1996). This is set against a backdrop painted by management gurus that suggests that knowledge is the organizational asset that secures competitive advantage in hypercompetitive environments (Drucker, 1988). Arguably, then, the key problems that knowledge management attempts to address are those associated with the distribution of knowledge across increasingly  uid social boundaries (for example hierarchical, horizontal, spatial and temporal). Firms introducing knowledge management initiatives seek to improve their exploitation (reuse) and exploration (creation) of knowledge (cf. Levinthal and March, 1993) by providing ways of interconnecting disparate knowledge domains as they restructure (e.g. into  atter, decentralized or networked forms) and reorganize (e.g. around process lines), sometimes on a global scale. Clearly IT has a role to play here. Ironically, the subject of knowledge management has itself fallen prey to problems of distributed knowledge.

The interaction of micro and macro aspects of IT provides an economic rationale for the IT community to go beyond questions of firms’ operations and strategies and to look towards national and international economic change. The micro-economic roles of transactions, communication and information infrastructure are analysed. These are then considered in terms of IT-related policy, from the local to the international level, illustrated by property rights legislation and changes in the European economic environment. It is concluded that the significance of IT lies primarily in its role as the very means by which markets and other economic mechanisms operate. </jats:p>",

A process of evolutionary change, initiated during the 1980s, may not suffice because the current thinking on management theory – upon which information management is defined – is changing significantly. The salient points of this shift in the paradigm of strategic management are outlined and an indication is given of how this will impact the management of information technology. An outline of an adapted model is attempted, using a simple four-component framework: The most influence will be felt in the area of information technology planning. Systems acquisition will need to develop new, proprietary methods. The character of the day-to-day management is also significantly affected, mainly by an increased use of external agents in what will probably be new and innovative forms of alliance. The idea of an information technology keiretsu is used as an example of how such alliances could be structured. </jats:p>",

The paper reviews current thinking on risk as it relates to information systems, and the approaches to risk that have been adopted in IS projects. The paper considers, in the context of IS, the processes of risk identification, structuring, assessment, and aggregation, and the use of such risk analysis to inform the process of risk management. The paper analyses available risk management techniques, and then proceeds to develop a comprehensive decision support system to aid risk analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article constructs explanatory theory on trust in e-voting, a term that refers to the use of stand-alone IT artefacts in voting stations. We study e-voting as a techno-organisational arrangement embedded in the process of elections and the broader socio-economic context of a country. Following a critical realist approach, we apply retroduction and retrodiction principles to build theory by complementing existing studies of e-voting with insights from an in-depth case study of elections in India. First, we seek evidence of trust in e-voting in the responses of the public to the announcement of election results. Then we derive the following four mechanisms of trust creation or loss: the association of e-voting with the production of positive democratic effects; the making of e-voting part of the mission and identity of electoral authorities; the cultivation of a positive public attitude to IT with policies for IT-driven socio-economic development; and, in countries with turbulent political cultures, a clear distinction between the experience of voting as orderly and experiences of malpractice in other election tasks. We suggest that these mechanisms explain the different experience with e-voting of different countries. Attention to them helps in assessing the potential of electoral technologies in countries that are currently adopting them, especially fragile democracies embarking upon e-voting. </jats:p>",

Much information stored in computers and transmitted over the various communications networks that connect them represents valued property that is vulnerable to unauthorized access and disclosure, fraudulent manipulation, and disruption. Also, the expanding scope of networks for data communications includes important functions such as electronic funds transfer, stock transfers, valuable corporate data transfers, and the use of the networks for personal and sensitive data communications. These functions coupled with the advent of the Integrated Service Digital Network, generate an increased awareness of privacy issues, and in particular, information and network security, the topic of this special issue of IEEE Network Magazine. To address these issues, we have invited several authors, all of whom are exceptionally well qualified, to write on several topics in network security.",

    "title": "CASE Requirements for Data-Centred Business Applications",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> From a CASE point of view business applications can be divided into three broad classes depending on their generality: those requiring general workbenches, those requiring specifically tailored workbenches, and those that could use blueprints. A CASE environment for all seasons is not what many business users really need. They would prefer an environment tailored to the specific class of application under development, one that will bring that application into being most efficiently and effectively, and keep it in vigorous operation over its lifetime. We have therefore concentrated on one particular application class of interest to the business community, namely interactive, data-centred systems. A model for the application class of interest is presented. The main CASE environment requirements identified, which should be integrated through a common project database and tailored to the characteristics of the application class, include business profile, semantic data model, state transition control model, system dictionary active during development, inheritable and tailorable objects such as reports, transactions and other user interactions, procedural facilities, configuration control, project control including costing and scheduling, and interfaces to decision support systems. It is noted that development and production have quite different characteristics and require separate environments. The need for flexibility and adaptability in some CASE environment areas, such as effort estimation and project control, is recognized and it is suggested that existing rule-based techniques should be used. Limitation of a CASE tool set to a rather narrow but common application class should result in substantial productivity gains. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent and growth of recent discussion on business process re-engineering (BPR) has been accompanied by its increasing application to a myriad of research areas and approaches. This paper examines its tenets using sociological and organizational paradigms and investigates its significance for software geared to enhancing coordinative and cooperative working methods and relationships within organizations. By taking the experience of implementors of such software and using a grounded and interpretive approach, initial conclusions suggest that BPR concepts have an impact for large scale and highly structured working activities but seems to have an interestingly inverse relationship with information-oriented cooperative and user-enhanceable approaches to process coordination and improvement. Taking these themes, this paper outlines some conceptual interpretations and theoretical managerial considerations for cooperative/coordinative and process work flow implementations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The Journal is going to have a highly interesting 1999 with a number of additions to the Editorial Board underway and some innovative quarterly issues. One issue will be devoted entirely to Teaching Cases. 'There are eight such cases fully developed from submissions to the new Teaching Case Track at the International Con-erence in Information Systems in Helsinki in December 1999. The Editors are Chris Sauer and Leslie Willcocks who were Co-Chairs for the ICIS track. The ICIS submissions were synopses only and were designed to support the presentation of the cases at the conference. The _7IT issue will consists of fully developed versions of these cases. The teaching cases have been heavily reviewed and have been selected from 28 original submissions. Teaching notes will also be available from the authors.Our belief is that the issue will help to feed the continuing demand for up-to-date and relevant cases, and our hope is that making them available in this form will give the cases wide availability. A second _7IT issue will consist of eight papers developed after further refereeing from the best submissions to the European Conference in Information Systems June 1998 held in Aix-en-Provence. The ECIS Programme Committee unanimously supported a JIT proposal that this should be an annual event, with a different leading IS journal developing and publishing the papers each year, thus making the material available to a wider audience and in a more developed form. This issue will be edited by Hubert Oesterle, Giorgios Doukidis and Leslie Willcocks who oversaw the research, case research and research in progress tracks at the Aix conference. A third YIT issue in 1999 will focus on Electronic Commerce and the Editors will be Troy Strader and Leslie Willcocks. The Call for Papers for this issue has been available for some time and is also posted on the ISWorld website. Submissions to the Editorin-Chief in the first instance are still welcome. In addition in 1999 we will be publishing a range of papers received outside these Special Issues. More immediately we have in this issue a special collection of papers edited by Michael Myers and Geoff Walsham on the theme of Interpretive Research in Information Systems. The Journal has encouraged and is supporting this theme issue in order to signal strongly its appreciation for all research that has been rigorously carried out and that deepens our understanding in the IS field. We look forward to further submissions from interpretive researchers, and indeed will be publishing several more papers in this tradition later in 1999.",

This paper proposes one way of acquiring knowledge for expert system development: through the use of the Internet. Internet resources (e.g. Usenet groups, ListServ discussion lists, archive sites and on-line literature/database searches) are knowledge sources. Internet tools such as newsreaders, electronic mail, Telnet, FTP, gophers, archie, WAIS and World Wide Web provide access to these sources. The results of an exploratory study that examined the use of the Internet as a knowledge source are presented here in conjunction with a framework for using the Internet in the planning phase. Four major advantages can be found in this: the availability of multiple experts in multiple domains, the interaction of domain experts and end users, time/cost savings, and convenience. The lessons learned and some additional issues are also presented. </jats:p>",

The former is the process of keeping up the enthusiasm in those who are led, in the belief that they are partaking in a very exciting venture. But not all ventures are exciting, and this is where the transactional leader comes in. Transactional leadership is based on real power. It has to do with demanding high standards and not quitting until such standards are achieved. A third form of leadership, 'leadership fi-om below', is also discussed, where it is developed largely from a knowledge of those who are doing the work. Clearly, one cannot look at these forms of leadership and say that one is good and the other is bad, as successful projects have been carried through by all three forms. And in the rest of the first part of this book, the author makes it clear that he subscribes to the IBM policy of almost military organization of the firm.",

This paper, based on research carried out from July to September 1990, identifies the methodologies which organizations applied to define performance indicators presented on their Executive Information Systems and if these indicators helped steer the organizations towards their strategic objectives. Organizations applied either a critical success factor, an alternative top-down, or an evolutionary/prototype methodology to build their EISs. Unfortunately, not one organization which took part in the research modelled its EIS on its overall business strategy, thus limiting the use of their EIS to that of a glorified fire extinguisher rather than using it to help bridge the gap between formulating and implementing a business strategy. </jats:p>",

Typical reporting systems are unable to cope with a mixture of short term control information and broad strategic information, as well as information generated from external sources. </jats:p><jats:p> The move to a distributed environment has led to a need for the management of information flows, and specifically with the management of integrated data, often directed at the very top levels of management. There has been a recognition of the need for a formal information management programme and in response to this a new type of information professional is emerging - one trained specifically in the management of information as a corporate resource. This person may well have different skills from a systems analyst, possibly more oriented towards improving the efficiency of operational procedures. The information management profession must understand the technology, especially in the communications area, must be able to sell to and educate at various management levels and be able to formulate and implement a plan for increasing the effectiveness of the use of the information resource. </jats:p>",

The Renaissance information system, which was intended to bring enormous cash flow to IMC's subsidiary, Vending Services of America (VSA), was behind schedule and over budget. Furthermore, VSA was experiencing serious managerial problems. IMC had cash flow problems that were reaching crisis levels due to, among other things, economic volatility in Venezuela where IMC had a major food business. IMC struggled with organization structure issues and was pressed by its investors to reorganize. As Renaissance-related and other problems brewed within VSA, the CEO of IMC resigned, and an interim CEO had to step in and somehow move the company out of the crises at hand. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The reuse of existing knowledge is an indispensable part of the creation of novel ideas. In the creative domain knowledge reuse is a common practice known as “remixing”. With the emergence of open internet-based platforms in recent years, remixing has found its way from the world of music and art to the design of arbitrary physical goods. However, despite its obvious relevance for the number and quality of innovations on such platforms, little is known about the process of remixing and its contextual factors. This paper considers the example of Thingiverse, a platform for the 3D printing community that allows its users to create, share, and access a broad range of printable digital models. We present an explorative study of remixing activities that took place on the platform over the course of six years by using an extensive set of data on models and users. On the foundation of these empirically observed phenomena, we formulate a set of theoretical propositions and managerial implications regarding (1) the role of remixes in design communities, (2) the different patterns of remixing processes, (3) the platform features that facilitate remixes, and (4) the profile of the remixing platform's users. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Inclusive Technologies, Selective Traditions: A Socio-material Case Study of Crowdfunded Book Publishing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The number and scale of crowdfunding platforms has increased dramatically in recent years, arguably more so than any other open phenomenon. This increase has allowed several crowdfunding websites to capture significant public attention, e.g. Kickstarter, Indiegogo. Yet, the growth of these specialist websites is only one aspect of the increasing popularity of crowdfunding technologies. Another, less-commonly discussed development is the propagation and integration of crowdfunding technologies into novel hybrid or proprietary production contexts, such as t-shirts (e.g. Threadless) or video games (e.g. Star Citizen). Such integrations are to be expected as crowdfunding technologies grow and evolve. However, they also present new challenges for managers and system designers, as the manner in which different features of crowdfunding technologies are enacted becomes decreasingly predictable the more their application domains diverge. This study performs a socio-material case study of Unbound, an innovative book publisher based in the UK. Unbound uses crowdfunding technologies to help authors raise the funding necessary to publish their books. However, once this funding has been reached, Unbound assumes more typical publisher responsibilities, such as editing, printing, binding, shipping, and promoting these books. Findings from Unbound identify four categories of socio-material practices in this hybrid model, each of which contains multiple sub-practices enacting different material features. This includes practices for fundraising, practices for maintaining traditional publishing standards, practices for creative contribution by backers, and practices for motivations. Further, tensions are observed for each of these categories of practices, due to the conflicting demands for inclusivity and selectivity associated with crowdfunding and publishing, respectively. </jats:p>",

To assess this idea, a research model was developed where POIT was hypothesized to mediate the influence of user participation on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). This model was tested with questionnaire data collected from 91 physicians who were using a newly implemented clinical information system across a network of medical clinics. The results of partial least square analysis of the data indicated that POIT was a significant mediator of the influence of user participation on PU and PEOU, providing strong support for the research model. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Political Lacuna in Participatory Systems Design",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper critiques three prominent information systems (IS) contributions to the development of social (work) systems, namely ETHICS, UTOPIA and Multiple Perspectives. They are based on the socio-technical Quality of Working Life and generally rely on systems design for improving working conditions by allowing employees to appreciate a holistic work experience, instead of being treated as a cog in the profit-making machinery of capitalism. However, this paper argues that ETHICS and Multiple Perspectives in fact shy away from the ideo-political differences that cause workplace conflict in the first place. Their pluralist means of resolving workplace conflicts through discussion and negotiation fail to problematize the colonizing or hegemonic influence of economic rationalism in obscuring the feasibility of alternative modes of workplace relations. They play down the asymmetrical power relations that perpetuate the exploitation of weaker stakeholders in real-life employment negotiations. Hence, political quietism in social IS approaches fail to acknowledge the ideological causes of conflict, that is the pursuit of profit at any cost, as opposed to a more sustainable and ethical approach to workplace relations. This paper presents a study of an organizational accounting IS system and uses it for illustrating the ideological roots of differences in employee–employer needs and priorities and revealing how reflexive decision makers are alienated when they attempt to distance themselves from the myopic ethos of economic rationalism. Despite these criticisms, the paper concludes on a relatively positive note. It argues that, since the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future was released in 1987, there has been increased awareness that organizations cannot continue to exploit our resources (and ourselves) blatantly in the name of profit maximization. This process of redefinition opens the door for more realistic and politically challenging systems approaches. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study, we examine the influence of a firm's environmental factors on its intention to adopt software as a service (SaaS). We operationalized our assessment of a firm's environmental pressures as mimetic, coercive and normative pressures and examined the moderating role of perceived technology complexity. Mimetic forces are pressures to copy or emulate other organizations’ activities, systems or structures. Coercive pressures are formal or informal pressures exerted on organizations by other organizations upon which they are dependent. Normative forces describe the effect of professional standards and the influence of professional communities on an organization. We empirically tested our research model using data from 289 valid survey responses. The results provide support for the assertion that there are both significant direct and interaction effects that influence a firm's SaaS adoption intention. Most important was the significant interaction effects between mimetic pressure and perceived technology complexity. This suggests that the complex relationships proposed by institutional theory and diffusion of innovation help to describe how environmental pressures and perceived technology complexity combine to affect intention to adopt an emerging technology. The theoretical contributions of this study are (i) we integrated, tested and validated mature theories in today's supply chain era with a new but rapidly diffusing technology, (ii) and we answered the call to include practical technology artifacts in information systems studies. From a practical perspective, through this work managers may develop a better understanding regarding environmental factors and whether or not they should consider these issues for their firm when formulating an intention to adopt SaaS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Internet-based information systems (IS) have enabled various forms of collective intelligence, action, and resources (e.g. open source software, innovation marketplaces, crowdsourcing, and crowdfunding). Within the domain of crowdfunding, Internet-enabled Peer-to-Peer Lending Systems (IP2PLS) have emerged as a disruptive technology, with implications for the financial services sector, business capitalization strategies, and personal and community development. IS research investigating user behavior in IP2PLS has revealed the saliency of social identity and personal transparency (as expressed through information sharing) in such systems. Prior research has largely focused on a small number of IP2PLS providers, thus this study examines a very large but under-researched platform. The study tests a theoretical model based on Social Identity Theory and prior IP2PLS studies, through an analysis of 116,667 loan records, and a subsequent analysis of 1000 manually coded records, to investigate the impact of information sharing on user (lenders and borrowers) behavior. The study reveals the importance of social ( vs financial) data, and further reveals relationships that frequently contradict prior findings from other IP2PLS. The study thus implies the need for a more heterogeneous view of the IP2PLS domain, and the need to more fully understand as systems that support user behavior by enabling social information exchanges. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Internal Crowdsourcing: Conceptual Framework, Structured Review, and Research Agenda",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of IT-enabled crowdsourcing with employees in enterprises has increased substantially in recent years. This phenomenon, which we refer to as ‘internal crowdsourcing’, is distinct both from external crowdsourcing with end users and from hierarchy-based work with employees. A literature stream has emerged that corresponds with the increased relevance of internal crowdsourcing in practice. The purpose of this review paper of internal crowdsourcing is to provide conceptual development, synthesise the literature, and provide a research agenda. In the review reported in this paper, we systematically analysed and critically reviewed the literature in this domain published thus far (74 papers). We found useful findings and insights into a new and relevant IT-enabled phenomenon. At the same time, we also found conflicting definitions and conceptualisation, as well as research efforts that are not well integrated. The paper supports future research on internal crowdsourcing by providing improved conceptualisation, consolidating insights, and identifying important areas for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Owing to increasing regulatory pressure and the need for aligned information technology (IT) decisions at the interface of business and IT, IT governance (ITG) has become important in both academia and practice. However, knowledge of integrating the determinants and consequences of ITG success remains scarce. Although some studies investigate individual aspects of ITG success and its impact, none combine these factors into a comprehensive and integrated model that would lead to a more complete understanding of the ITG concept. To address this gap, our research aims at understanding what factors influence and result from successful ITG, and at determining how they can be translated into a model to explain ITG success and the impact thereof. Therefore, we conducted interviews with 28 IT decision makers in 19 multinational organizations headquartered in Europe. Our study synthesizes the fragmented previous research, provides new empirical insights gathered on the basis of a clear ITG conceptualization, and suggests three innovative constructs heretofore not related to ITG. Moreover, we elucidate in a holistic model the factors that make ITG successful, how ITG contributes to an IT organization's success, and how it eventually unfolds throughout the overall organization. The resulting model allows organizational decision makers to develop an effective ITG implementation and to explain the implications of successful ITG, thus providing a justification for the respective investments. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Bureaucracies in the Weberian mould, whether of the state or corporate type, are rational-legal structures organized to deliver order, stability and predictability. Early developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) appeared set to deliver such an outcome. Yet the new economy turns out to be more ‘distributed’ than had originally been expected. What is the nature of the challenge that this poses for bureaucracies? To address this question, the paper first presents a conceptual framework, the Information-Space or l-Space, which allows us to explore the relationship between how knowledge is structured and how it flows within and between populations of agents. The paper then examines what cultural and institutional challenges the new ICTs pose for both state and corporate bureaucracies, confronted as they are with the complexities of an increasingly distributed social order. </jats:p>",

It is argued that the battle has died down and a period of stability has emerged. But further development needs to occur, especially in the area of critical management, and the philosophy of critical realism can be a significant way forward. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Most software firms struggle to take advantage of the potential benefits of software process improvement (SPI) as they adopt this technology into the complex and dynamic realities of their day-to-day operation. Such efforts are therefore typically fluctuating between management's attempt to control SPI technology adoption and events that causes the process to drift in unpredictable directions. To further understand how management's attempt to control the process is complemented by drifting, this article investigates the role of improvisation in adoption of SPI technology in a Danish software firm, SmallSoft, over a 10-year period (1996–2005). We found that micro-level and macro-level improvisations interacted, often in uncoordinated ways, to shape SPI technology adoption at SmallSoft. The improvisations enhanced employee creativity, motivation and empowerment, created momentum in the adoption process despite constrained resources, and, most importantly, helped adapt SPI technology to the everyday practices at SmallSoft. However, we also identified un-called for improvisations and outcomes that were uncoordinated with SmallSoft's goals. Based on these findings we discuss how management in small software firms can exploit improvisations to facilitate adoption of complex technologies like SPI. </jats:p>",

Against that backdrop, we synthesized the literature into three types of voluntariness - perceived, intended and realizable voluntariness (RVOL), and showed how prior literature had not adequately accounted for RVOL. Moreover, we examined the multiple mechanisms that influence voluntariness and created a model to describe how to advance new knowledge about the important relationships among the three types of voluntariness and between voluntariness and user behavior. We argue that these concepts and relationships may help advance our knowledge of how a new technology is used individually and collectively in organizations. </jats:p>",

Component-based (software) development (CBD) involves (i) the development of software components and (ii) the building of software systems through the integration of preexisting software components (developed in-house or procured from the component market). For companies involved in software development, CBD offers agility in design by basing software development on methodologies that support the recombination of reusable components, being an approach that rapidly expands product variation and sustains the build-up of product families. It also promises significant improvements in software development through shorter time-to-market and reduced development costs. However, being an innovative approach to software development that emerged in the mid-1990s, the adoption of CBD requires companies to re-engineer existing software systems (products) or to develop new systems from scratch using component technologies and to deal with additional challenges associated with the management of CBD. LeCroy Corporation was one of the early adopters of CBD that decided to adopt CBD to gain competitive advantage in its markets. The case describes an actual situation at LeCroy Corporation, involving several decisions, challenges and opportunities faced by the managers of a globally distributed software development team over a period of time when they re-engineered a monolithic system into a component-based system. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Understanding Knowledge Re-integration in Backsourcing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Backsourcing is the process where a client firm brings previously outsourced services from a supplier back in-house. Traditionally, the existing literature on backsourcing has focused on how firms reach the decision to bring back previously outsourced services. In this paper, we move beyond focusing on IT backsourcing decision to explore the process of backsourcing from a knowledge perspective. The predominant view in the relevant literature argues that the re-acquisition of knowledge by a client firm during backsourcing takes place similarly to knowledge acquisition by a supplier in a typical outsourcing process. In this paper, we argue that knowledge re-integration in backsourcing occurs differently from outsourcing projects mainly because of the existence of knowledge asymmetries between the client and the supplier. By examining seven backsourcing events, we reveal that knowledge transfer and re-integration in backsourcing emerges as a coordinative activity, complementing knowledge transfer mechanisms reported in the IS outsourcing literature. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Linking macro-level goals to micro-level routines: EHR-enabled transformation of primary care services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Information and communication technologies are known to be instrumental in the enhancement of healthcare management capabilities in developing countries. Turkey - a developing country - has undergone a major healthcare transformation marked by the redesign of primary care delivery and the implementation of a nation-wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. In this research, presenting Turkey's case, we investigate the consequences of EHR implementation in developing countries. We argue that to better understand the consequences, we need to link macro-level healthcare goals with micro-level system usage behaviors that actualize the macro-level goals or alternatively result in unintended negative health outcomes. We posit that this linkage is achieved through the meso-level structures, namely the EHR and the organizational context, in which it is embedded. Hence, we examine the EHR's role in this relationship. Our findings indicate that EHR usage both enables and constrains the achievement of clinicians' professional goals in the context of primary care delivery. Moreover, goal alignment between the government agency as the designer of the system and the clinicians influence the outcomes of the EHR-enabled transformation. When the healthcare goals are aligned, the system enables the clinicians to achieve their professional goals and their system usage behaviors converge, contributing to improvements in health outcomes. Contrarily, when the goals are misaligned, the system constrains goal achievement and the clinicians show divergent usage behaviors, including goal abandonment. In turn, goal abandonment may lead to negative consequences and even adversely affect the achievement of population-level healthcare goals in the long run. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have been performed with the aim of examining the impact of information technology (IT) on the performance of firms and have arrived at multifaceted conclusions that have sometimes been conflicting. Very few studies have been performed with the objective of understanding investment in IT and the diverse dimensions of organizational performance with an attempt at using aggregated measures. An exploratory attempt has been made in this paper into understanding the linkage between IT and a firm's economic performance using aggregated measures of accounting-based and market-based performance while considering intervening variables such as firm size, capital intensity, research and development intensity and advertising intensity. The results indicate that various dimensions of IT are significantly and positively linked to a firm's performance irrespective of the different criteria of performance measures. The results also show that IT has a significant effect on aggregated composite measures of accounting-based and market-based performances.",

In this paper, we review the philosophical and methodological basis of this Metaphor and its main statements. We also apply it in analyzing a case of mobile ICT adoption. The application of the Hospitality Metaphor enables a clear understanding of this process as an incremental and open one in which social, existential and ‘mundane’ issues play a major role, and where technology reveals its dubious character, leading to unplanned results. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How value is created for the customer from e-business is a topic of much concern in academic and practitioner circles. In the light of the dot.com downturn, numerous e-business firms ceased to exist. This paper reports the findings from an ongoing research study on the development and decline of the application service provider (ASP) industry. Having witnessed the decline of the first wave of ASPs, with many failing to convince small and medium businesses (SMBs) of the value of adopting an ASP solution, the second wave calls for a more rigorous approach that clearly identifies the key performance areas and indicators of the ASP business model. Applying the constructs of strategic positioning, product/service portfolio, and value proposition, this paper represents the findings from 215 responses to a questionnaire survey on how potential and existing ASP customers evaluate the benefits and risks of ASP. The findings suggest that, if the ASP model is to succeed, vendors will need to carefully identify customer requirements and avoid the pitfalls that beset the first wave of the ASP model, which was largely based upon a technology push strategy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This is the second of two special issues dedicated to exploring the theme of critical approaches to information systems (IS) research. The  rst issue focused on the historical roots of critical theory as well as more recent perceptions of it and the two key issues of emancipation and power relations. An overriding theme of the  rst issue was the need for broadening our perspective on what actually constitutes ‘critical’ inquiry, notably to move away from an over-reliance on Habermasian theory. To this end the work of a number of writers was explored, including Foucault, Heidegger, Callon, Latour and a range of feminist theorists. In this issue the exploration of alternative theorists and frameworks continues, though the substantial in uence of Habermas is more tangible. The seven papers in this issue represent a range of paradigms including labour process theory, critical systems theory and critical post-modernism. Three of the papers (by Oliver and Romm, Cecez-Kecmanovic et al. and McAulay et al.) focus on empirical studies, two (by Saravanamuthu and Varey et al.) explore methodological issues and one (by Basden) presents a comprehensive theoretical framework drawn from the Dutch philosopher Dooyeweerd. The paper by Brooke takes a broad sweep across the critical organization and IS research landscape in order to highlight developments at theoretical, methodological and empirical levels, including impacts upon praxis. In considering the range of frameworks and theories on offer in this issue the main themes arise again in respect of power relations, emancipation, participation and dialogue with different stakeholders. Also to the fore are rationality issues, in particular economic rationality, instrumental rationality and the effects of focusing on cost ef ciency. We also  nd ourselves brought to the heart of another debate within critical research concerning pluralism and paradigm incommensurability. Brooke’s paper gives a more in-depth treatment of this issue, but most of the contributions in this issue make some reference to it and in several cases an attempt is made to combine different perspectives and then to critically evaluate this process against the plausibility of pluralism in action.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizational change in today's competitive landscape is no longer just an option, but a fundamental strategy for success. In order to be the premier player in this type of competitive landscape, customer focus has to become a priority, and bearing this in mind both academia and competitive organizations have one key objective in common. Their current focus is on implementing successful support systems in order to meet their end-users’ needs. As early as 1995, University College Cork (a Third-level Irish university) introduced on-line support to provide learning material for students ranging from full/part-time undergraduates and postgraduates to distance-learners. However, students identified a need for more support, the type that only a more interactive system can provide. This paper focuses on the evolution of e-learning and learning management systems (LMS) in considering e-learning as the academic equivalent to the customer relationship management (CRM) challenge. This research outlines the different characteristics necessary for the successful management of the learning process and the support needed by students, through the investigation of current research and the analysis of the case environment. It also highlights the potential of the system to overcome the physical barriers of the traditional classroom aligning the key critical factors necessary for e-learning with those of CRM. Through the adoption of the CRM philosophy, the system presented here strengthened its link between the different actors and additionally provided the university with a more in-depth view of its target audience. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Analysing Business Losses Caused by Information Systems Risk: A Business Process Analysis Approach",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Increased reliance on computers by many companies and public organisations has generated a business risk for them. For example, problems in systems availability can lead to additional cost in operations, lost revenues and competitive losses. Systematic analyses are needed to avoid such losses. Prior research provides rigorous methods for identifying information systems risks and reducing the likelihood of these risks. The analysis of potential business losses in the user organisations has, however, received only limited attention. The objective in this paper is to investigate methods that can be used in the systematic identification of potential losses in the user organisation. The paper provides a review of prior literature on methods that can be used to analyse and report such losses. One understudied method is business process analysis that entails a systematic analysis of potential losses in different phases of the organisation's core business processes. Action research was used to examine the use of business process analysis as a method to associate information systems availability risk with potential business losses. The analysis was carried out in two different companies, one operating in the paper industry and the other one in the finance sector. The study contributes to research by summarising prior research on the analysis of business losses and by illustrating how the use of one method, business process analysis, assisted the client organisations. Perhaps most importantly, it identifies a new topic that has received very little attention in information systems research, despite its obvious managerial and practical significance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> What value does information technology (IT) create in governments and how does it do so? While business value of IT has been extensively studied in the information systems field, this has not been the case for public value. This is in part due to a lack of theoretical bases for investigating IT value in the public sector. To address this issue, we present a conceptual model on the mechanism by which IT resources contribute to value creation in the public-sector organizations. We propose that the relationship between IT resources and organizational performance in governments is mediated by organizational capabilities and develop a theoretical model that delineates the paths from IT resources to organizational performance, drawing upon public-value management theory. This theory asserts that public managers, on behalf of the public, should actively strive to generate greater public value, as managers in the private sector seek to achieve greater private business value. On the basis of the review of public-value management literature, we suggest that the following five organizational capabilities mediate the relationship between IT resources and public value - public service delivery capability, public engagement capability, co-production capability, resource-building capability, and public-sector innovation capability. We argue that IT resources in public organizations can enable public managers to advance public-value frontiers by cultivating these five organizational capabilities and to overcome conflicts among competing values. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the role of trust and regulation where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) In the European Union (EU) make use of e-business in a digital business ecosystem (DBE). We argue that In order for digital business to develop among entrepreneurs In the EU and within different industry sectors and geographical locations, trust and regulation are of critical Importance. The article assesses the importance of this argument and focuses on the Interplay of regulatory and trust-based issues that need to be accommodated before one can expect SMEs to engage in e-business supported within a DBE environment. It then presents a taxonomy that addresses key regulatory issues and fosters trust. The article proposes the taxonomy as the vehicle for the simplification of a bewildering array of laws, standards, norms and expectations, as well as for the elimination of regulatory overlap and conflict. The contribution of the taxonomy is demonstrated in the last section of the article, where it is empirically tested and applied to SMEs which participated In the EU-funded DBE project. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The scientific origin of information technology (IT) does not make it a neutral witness to the ongoing struggle over how scarce resources are used for generating more wealth. This paper argues that the manner in which the technology is used for capturing, reporting and disseminating information reflects the underlying dialectic of control among competing organizational stakeholders as they contest the logic of capitalist priorities. IT's politically intrusive role in the struggle for control is discussed through a critique of a people-oriented information system methodology, Multiview 2, which fails to problematize the struggle over workplace ideology. The paper highlights the significance of this shortcoming by analysing capital's ideological use of business process re-engineering for gaining workers’ consent to their own exploitation. This 1990s’ innovation portrays the subjugation of social interests in favour of the relentless pursuit of profit as a coherent social approach to transforming labour relations. In conclusion, it is proposed that IT's social role should be an emancipatory one, which, given the competitive-interdependent context of work, should facilitate the emergence of multiple worldviews. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> New technologies, notably service-oriented architectures and Web services, are enabling a third wave of business process management (BPM). Supporters claim that BPM is informed by complexity theory and that business processes can evolve and adapt to changing business circumstances. It is suggested by BPM adherents that the business/IT divide will be obliterated through a process-centric approach to systems development. The evolution of BPM and its associated technologies are explored and then coevolutionary theory is used to understand the business/IT relationship. Specifically, Kauffman's NKC model is applied to a business process ecosystem to bring out the implications of coevolution for the theory and practice of BPM and for the relationship between business and IT. The paper argues that a wider view of the business process ecosystem is needed to take account of the social perspective as well as the human/non-human dimension. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent high-profile antitrust cases and policy proposals have put a spotlight on the relationship between firms’ access to big data and sustained competitive advantages in digital markets. In Europe, concerns about data-driven market power have led policymakers to propose far-reaching regulations of information technology (IT) in these markets. Despite the global policy relevance, the regulation of big data and its competitive effects has so far received little attention in information systems (IS) research. This article addresses this research gap by developing an overarching framework for future IS research on the role of IT for the regulation of data-driven market power. The proposed research framework builds upon a three-part analysis: First, we review the academic literature and show that there is extensive, although nuanced, empirical evidence for business value creation from big (user) data. Second, we draw on the resource-based view of the firm and recent policy reports to derive six facilitating factors that enable firms to establish market power based on sustained data-driven competitive advantages. Third, we characterize three regulatory approaches to govern market power and competition in data-driven digital markets: (i) empowering consumers, (ii) data openness, and (iii) limiting data scale. For each of these approaches, we highlight the key role of IT artifacts in mediating the effect of regulatory rules on actual practice. </jats:p>",

Following the resource-based view of the firm, strategic CRM is conceptualized as an endogenously determined function of the organization's ability to harness and orchestrate lower-order capabilities that comprise physical assets, such as IT infrastructure, and organizational capabilities, such as human analytics (HA) and business architecture (BA). Our results reveal a positive and significant path between a superior CRM capability and firm performance. In turn, superior CRM capability is positively associated with HA and BA. However, our results suggest that the impact of IT infrastructure on superior CRM capability is indirect and fully mediated by HA and BA. We also find that CRM initiatives jointly emphasizing customer intimacy and cost reduction outperform those taking a less balanced approach. Overall, this paper helps explain why some CRM programs are more successful than others and what capabilities are required to support success. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The enterprise resource planning (ERP) software market has been growing at a very fast pace over the last few years and has been predicted to keep growing rapidly in the long term. This has led to an abundance of media reports on the subject of ERP and to managers wondering whether their companies should implement ERP systems. In order to separate the reality of the ERP phenomenon from the hype that surrounds it, we studied 14 ERP implementation projects in Irish organizations and focused on the key relationships between organizations which attempt to implement ERP systems and their implementing partners. We found that the ERP implementations that are going on in Ireland at the moment are different to the projects that have been reported elsewhere in two key respects. Firstly, the organizations interested in ERP software are, on average, far smaller than the case studies reported in the literature and the majority of the cases we reviewed were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Secondly, the durations of implementation were far shorter than reported elsewhere. These results are not surprising if one considers the smaller average size of Irish organizations, but they indicate that the ERP movement is truly ready for an extension towards the SME market. They also indicate that the duration of the implementation of ERP software may be related to the size and complexity of the client organization and that SMEs can expect to have an easier time implementing ERPs than the current literature suggests. We also found that software implementers play a key role, not only in technical terms, but also in managerial and political terms, because they can help their clients in correcting their expectations and perceptions of ERP systems and ERP implementations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines an approach to information systems planning (ISP) that addresses not just the technical problems encountered in ISP but the whole range of problems which derive from social systems, organizational processes, formal organizational arrangements, technology and the external environment. The approach is designed to improve the effectiveness of the high-level planning processes for information systems (IS). A five-phase framework is proposed. The first phase, the perception phase, aims to provide the managers with an environment that enables them to recognize the strategic value of IS and that activates them to participate in strategy formulation. The second phase, the evaluation phase, involves the evaluation of the organization's systems. The third phase, the selection phase, is focused on analysing the data collected from previous phases in order to select feasible projects. The fourth phase, the construction phase, is responsible for producing a set of preliminary IS plans. The fifth phase, the review phase, aims to ensure that ISP effectiveness is further enhanced by ongoing adjustments to the plans. The paper includes brief comments on the initial application of the framework in the Mingchi Institute of Technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Offshoring—the transfer of work activities to providers in offshore countries—has for some time affected the nature of work in onshore locations. Not much is however known about the reactions of onshore job incumbents to such changes. In this article, we use a survey of UK firms to examine the relationship between perceived changes in onshore managers’ work characteristics induced by information systems offshoring and managers’ affective organizational commitment. We found that a perceived increase in onshore managers’ job complexity was associated with higher affective organizational commitment only if managers also perceived organizational valence, that is, only if they believed that information systems offshoring benefited their organization. A perceived increase in cross-cultural work was associated with higher affective organizational commitment, and this association was positively moderated by managers’ perceptions of organizational valence. Using the offshoring context, our findings provide insights into consequences of contemporary changes in the nature of work in developed countries and to explain the diverse reactions of onshore job incumbents to such changes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As banks face heightened levels of regulatory challenges, many of them, especially those in developing countries, are struggling to maintain their reputations. This paper addresses the following questions: How do commercial banks in developing countries like Lebanon respond to institutional pressures for compliance concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT)? How do Regulatory Technology (RegTech) solutions contribute to solving their compliance problems in this domain and why may the potential of RegTech be limited in the Lebanese context? To answer these questions, we conducted a field study among Lebanese commercial banks and their vendors. Based on thematic analysis, findings reveal the importance of technology for enhancing compliance of Lebanese banks with international regulations, especially US ones, thereby avoiding sanctions. Thus, the adoption of RegTech is mainly due to coercive pressures, whereas the choice of RegTech solutions is highly dependent on mimetic and normative forces, and happens later. Results also show that manual processes are insufficient for compliance due to the huge number of regulations and transactions. Hence, RegTech for AML/CFT is notably adopted for the efficient screening of clients and monitoring of their transactions. These solutions enhance decision-making processes for compliance teams, which become effective when the banks ensure an adequate interaction between employees and the new technologies. However, RegTech presents several additional challenges that have to be overcome for effective compliance such as finding the right vendors and ensuring data quality. Moreover, the geopolitical context in developing countries like Lebanon limits the potential of RegTech for AML/CFT. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This special issue aimed to attract articles situating digital transformation in the geopolitical-organizational nexus. Unlike innovation and change panaceas (or fads) like business process reengineering (BPR) which became popular in the 1990s, digital transformation is a multi-level concept. Extending beyond the redesign of organizational and business processes, the analytical boundaries of digital transformation include ecosystems, organizational networks, business and operational processes, organizational identities, governance structures, and quality/cost dynamics. However, the extant literature on digital transformation continues to use the organization as the primary unit of analysis. Definitions of digital transformation vary widely, with some not dissimilar to the BPR era. The papers included in this special issue provide analytical and empirical examples on the pervasive effects from contemporary digital technology for society, organizations, and citizens. Future work which isolates the digital technology artefact would benefit from further refinement of the digital transformation concept. A starting point is to revisit the digital technology evolution over past decades which reveal the inflection points of technological change, specifically for mainframes, PCs, and the Internet. Such analysis will increase our understanding and contextualization of past panaceas like BPR for generating new insights on how digital technologies are front and center in debates on digital transformation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital platforms provide organizations with new ways to conduct sourcing activities. Crowdsourcing has emerged as one potential method of sourcing various kinds of information technology (IT) services. Notwithstanding the benefits of IT crowdsourcing services (ITCSs), there is a lack of clarity about why some firms procure services through ITCS, whereas others do not. Drawing on the organizational capabilities perspective, we hypothesize that in-house IT administration capability and IT flexibility jointly enhance a firm’s ITCS Platform Suitability Assessment, which, in turn, leads to higher ITCS Service Procurement. We also posit that ITCS Platform Suitability Assessment mediates the relationship between IT Administration Capability and ITCS Service Procurement. Our empirical analysis of survey data from 308 firms in the United States supports our hypotheses. Our results suggest that firms that develop IT administrative capabilities and IT flexibility assess ITCS platform characteristics as more suitable for ITCS-related activities. ITCS Platform Suitability Assessment, in turn, drives firms to procure operational services (e.g., setting up automatic payments) and strategic services (e.g., project management) from the loose configuration of workers in the gig economy. Our results contribute to theory by positing and testing a theoretical model that expands the theoretical base used to explain ITCS sourcing. We discuss the implications for the business value of IT platforms, organizational structure, and capabilities in regard to future sourcing strategies. </jats:p>",

The production of these services requires the cooperation of assets and competences owned by different categories of firms. The first part of the paper points out the nature of the services and identifies a number of firms which are involved in the VAS production. The second part of the paper is based on a statistical analysis of an original sample. Three classes of services are discriminated: enhanced communication services, dedicated services, and information services. Then, we focus our attention on the dedicated services. A detailed analysis of this category enables us to identify three sub-groups of services: specialized communication services, community services and on line transaction services. Moreover the production of these dedicated services is driven by users. It is concluded that users have gained control over a wide segment of the VAS market because they own some specific competences and knowledge. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Toward a Theory of Identity Performance in Unsettled Digital Work: The Becoming of ‘Digital Nomads’",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of ‘digital’ ways of working and organising is unequivocally transforming the very fabric of work, leading to an increasingly uncertain, unsettled, and fluid environment. Research has traditionally anchored worker identity in fixed and place-bound concepts. However, in the digital workplace, where work is more akin to a performance, unfolding over time, and processual in nature, our understanding of work and theories of worker identity are called into question. In this paper, we ask the question: how is digital worker identity performed in such fluid and unsettled work settings? To explain digital worker identity performance, we investigate digital nomadism as an extremely fluid and unsettled case of digital work. We study digital nomads, high-skilled professionals who use digital technologies to work remotely and lead a nomadic lifestyle, in a multi-sited ethnographic field study. Based on a process-relational perspective, we are theorising how the identity of digital nomads, their “becoming,” is performed as an ongoing process along lines of identity performance. This is an intermediate “product of theorising,” in accord with the aim of the special issue, but provides a foundation for a novel process-relational theory of identity performance in unsettled digital work. </jats:p>",

Also highlighted are computer security, information management education and application of soft information systems concepts to buying and selling on stock markets. The coverage provided by the journal is deliberately broad, though our policy is that selective future issues will be more focused on specific themes, for example 'Evaluation of IS investments' (December 1990 issue), Information technology futures' and 'IS strategies'. Contributions on these and all issues relating to our policy agenda (published in the March 1990 edition) are always welcome. The last few months are notable for a strengthening of the editorial board. In addition we welcome Professor Ivan Jackson from the Victoria University of Wellington, and Professor Charles Wiseman of Columbia University. Both have immense experience in the information management field and have published widely. Ivan Jackson has worked in the USA and New Zealand for Burroughs Corporation and the State Service Commission. More recently he has been active in a number of governmental reviews of electronics and information technology within the public services. Charles Wiseman is the president of Competitive Applications, an international consulting practice, and formerly the manager of IS Planning at the American Can Company. He is a frequent speaker at professional meetings and conferences in North America, Europe and the Far East. Ivan includes amongst his publications a major textbook Corporate Information Management (Prentice Hall 1986). Charles Wiseman has published well-known texts including Strategic Information Systems (Irwin, 1988), and Strategy and Computers: Information Systems as Competitive Weapons (Dow Jones Irwin, 1985). We look forward to working with them closely on policy content issues in the journal.",

    "abstract": "Public conversations, driven by media, research institutes and professional services firms, typically predict the future of work in one of two rather polarising ways. On one hand, techno-positivist utopian accounts predict ever-increasing productivity, efficiency and work quality as a direct and deterministic outcome of technologies and automation with artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g. Deloitte, 2019; Manyika, 2017). On the other hand, dystopian accounts paint an equally deterministic picture of automation destroying jobs and ‘the robots coming for us’ (Schiller, 2015; Wolf, 2019), with impacts on skills displacement and skills shortages that will cripple businesses (Gasca, 2019). What unites most accounts is that they foreground technology and focus on, and extrapolate, applications and their likely effects, making assumptions about technological progress that, with hindsight, time and again turn out to be too simplistic. It has been argued that, although predictable in their development, most digital technologies we invented in recent times ‘have had consequences wildly different from those anticipated’ (Lepore, 2018), and we have ‘[fallen] short in identifying and contesting the most crucial and unprecedented facts’ of their existence (Zuboff, 2019).",

    "title": "Digitalization and network capability as enablers of business model innovation and sustainability performance: The moderating effect of environmental dynamism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the face of relentless global competition and regulatory pressures, the imperative for firms to digitally transform has become critical. This is particularly salient for Chinese manufacturing firms as they strive for sustainability, a multidimensional construct comprising both economic and environmental performance. Leveraging dynamic capabilities theory, this study aims to unravel the intricate interplay between digitalization, network capability, business model innovation (BMI), and environmental dynamism in shaping a firm’s sustainability performance. Our research is driven by a compelling question: How do digitalization and network capabilities impact firms’ sustainability performance, and what roles do BMI and environmental dynamism play in this relationship? To answer this question, we employed a robust survey-based methodology encompassing 1600 Chinese manufacturing firms, yielding 255 completed and validated responses. The findings reveal that network capability mediates the influence of digitalization on two types of BMI—novelty-centered and efficiency-centered. Further, these forms of BMI act as mediators between digitalization and network capability, and the two dimensions of sustainability: economic and environmental performance. Notably, environmental dynamism serves as a double-edged sword. It negatively moderates the impact of digitalization on efficiency-centered BMI, but positively moderates the influence of network capability on the same. Our study offers nuanced theoretical and practical implications. It extends dynamic capabilities theory by elucidating how digital and network capabilities can be leveraged for sustainable outcomes via business model innovation. Moreover, the research provides managerial insights, particularly for Chinese manufacturing firms, on navigating the complex landscape of digital transformation toward sustainability. Considering these insights, we recommend that firms prioritize network capabilities and strategically innovate their business models to harness the full potential of digital transformation. Simultaneously, organizations should be cognizant of the environmental dynamism within which they operate, as it can both hinder and enable their journey toward sustainability. </jats:p>",

The manner in which organizational change develops and the theoretical justification for the suitability of the management accounting domain for expert systems developments are reviewed, and a number of hypotheses are considered before describing and reporting the results of a survey into the attitudes and environment of UK practising management accountants. The findings suggest that management accountants may lack both awareness of the term and understanding of the nature of expert systems and that they generally do not believe that software can be trusted to make their job easier and improve the consistency of their decision making.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Business applications represent one of the fastest growing areas for videotex. Due to the efforts to link national videotex systems, we analyse the potential uses and effects of videotex for international business applications. Using case studies of international videotex use by eight firms, we outline the key strategies firms use to exploit videotex internationally, as well as the major impacts of this use. Main strategies include: (1) adding value to basic transactions through the incremental addition of new services, (2) using the basic service as a product leader that draws customers into a relationship, (3) using the information byproducts of transactions to better manage relationships with system users and (4) linking videotex systems with other networks and information systems as a means of broadening reach. Impacts centered primarily on the ways firms related to their customers and suppliers including a shifting of costs of transactions away from the service provider, a more easily expanded base of partners and more standardized interactions with these. International connections via videotex helped to alleviate the high costs of international telecommunications, and in some cases, permitted companies to access foreign markets previously too expensive to reach. Theoretically, the case studies illustrate the use of telematic systems to enable marketing strategies that have characteristics of both market and hierarchy approaches as noted by Williamson (1975), and both cost/volume and product differentiation strategies pointed out by Porter (1980). Regarding international strategy, the case studies further illustrate that such telematic applications can help firms achieve the benefits of both global and multidomestic approaches discussed by Porter (1986). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital platforms have proven to be efficient matchmakers in our networked economy and society. However, their tremendous potential is a double-edged sword, and concerns about their malpractices and negative impact have risen remarkably. In the light of practical relevance, research on digital platform regulation (DPR) did not contribute very much. Especially information systems (IS) which, as a discipline, seems predestined to explain the problems at the confluence of technology–economy–society, has barely grazed the issue of DPR. Particularly, a contribution is missing that at least explores the problems with digital platforms systematically and comprehensively. In response to this aim, we pursue a two-step approach: First, we apply qualitative meta-analysis of 211 cases as well as a number of regulation papers and actual regulation endeavors to identify and conceptualize the problem scope and potential regulatory approaches for platform problems. Second, we condense our findings into a conceptual model. Our findings show that digital platforms exploit both platform- and monopoly-related problems to assert themselves in different markets. Through their impactful platform governance, they even have become serious challengers to the regulator in controlling market access, key conditions, and resources. At this, they rely on the efficient use of data and digital technologies to effectively orchestrate platform agents and their transactions. The outcome of the paper is a set of two structured instruments that fill a void in interdisciplinary research and provide support to DPR practitioners for a systematic approach to regulation. </jats:p>",

By and large, however, the social media community can do little more than improvise reactions, not quite sure how to use the old familiar social scripts as guides to lending effective support. To examine the role of social media in the grieving process, we used a mixed-methods approach: 12 interviews with “social media grievers” reveal the expectations of the bereaved regarding other users’ behavior. By way of two online experiments with 1058 participants, we tested how these expectations are met by the messaging of social media providers in accordance with social norm theory. We found that injunctive social norm messages are particularly effective, whereas descriptive social norm messages vary in their effectiveness, depending on which information is presented and how prominently so. What our study shows, then, is that both are potent socio-technical tools that can guide users towards more empathetic behavior when dealing with the bereaved, so while social media may not be a substitute for therapy, they can offer profound comfort for those of us dealing with bereavement and grief. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Data analytics provides versatile decision support to help employees tackle the rising complexity of today’s business decisions. Notwithstanding the benefits of these systems, research has shown their potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. While technical causes have been studied, the human side has been mostly neglected, albeit employees mostly still need to decide to turn analytics recommendations into actions. Drawing upon theories of technology dominance and of moral disengagement, we investigate how task complexity and employees’ expertise affect the approval of discriminatory data analytics recommendations. Through two online experiments, we confirm the important role of advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility, and dehumanization, as the cognitive moral disengagement mechanisms that facilitate such approvals. While task complexity generally enhances these mechanisms, expertise retains a critical role in analytics-supported decision-making processes. Importantly, we find that task complexity’s effects on users’ dehumanization vary: more data subjects increase dehumanization, whereas richer information on subjects has the opposite effect. By identifying the cognitive mechanisms that facilitate approvals of discriminatory data analytics recommendations, this study contributes toward designing tools, methods, and practices that combat unethical consequences of using these systems. </jats:p>",

This article outlines the evolution of KBS methodologies and the recent change of emphasis from a technology-driven to a business-led approach. It further examines the ‘application identification and selection’ activities of two KBS methodologies, KADS and STAGES. Their weaknesses are highlighted and it is argued that an integrated strategic methodological approach to the development of information systems and knowledge-based systems is required. The strategic phase of an IS methodology is then summarized; specific points within it where KBS-related activities could be incorporated are identified. This exercise illustrates how IS methodologies could be used as a basis for the joint strategic planning of IS and KBS systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses how transactions related to the exchange of goods and services are being performed on the Internet. The adoption of electronic markets in an industry has a disintermediation potential because it can create a direct link between the producer and the consumer (without the need for the intermediation role of distributors). Electronic markets lower the searches cost allowing customers to choose between more providers. This ultimately reduces both the costs for the customer and the profits for the producer. In this paper it is contended that electronic markets on the Internet have the opposite effect, resulting in an increase in intermediators. It introduces transaction streams which model how transactions are being conducted and helps explain the types of new intermediators that are appearing on the Internet. The mechanisms by which companies are exploring ways of extending transaction streams are also described. To illustrate the model, the paper briefly analyses transaction streams in the insurance industry and provides examples related to confidence in electronic commerce. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Analyst and Programmer Stereotypes: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous research into the profiles of analysts and programmers has tended to present their attributes as virtually mutually exclusive and, in particular, has established a stereotype which favours the analyst for development as a manager. This view, historically reified through the division of labour between analysts and programmers and reinforced by the dual-track career paths of many organizations, intensifies the problems which technical staff experience when attempting to develop their potential. Using information from a case study conducted during 1989–1990 this paper proposes that the research profiles have become legitimized and reproduced at organizational level despite evidence of their inappropriateness. The relationship between management practice and documented theory has conspired to produce a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, the methodological basis of previous research is questionable and by recognizing these short-comings (compounded over a period of over 20 years) it becomes possible to critically re-evaluate beliefs about analysts and programmers. The paper argues for a more positive view of programmers and a more appropriate career structure for technical staff. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Denying the Technology: Middle Management Resistance in Business Process Re-Engineering",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) as a methodology for organizational transformation has been around since the early 1990s. There are however, some serious issues of concern surrounding the success of BPR as a methodology for organizational change. This paper attempts to highlight the issues surrounding the BPR approach to change management that remain implicit within the re-engineering literature. The research presented in this paper specifically investigates BPR in practice and concentrates on the issues of power and control that underlie many of the re-engineering methodologies and how these conflict with the prerequisites of the flattened, empowered workforce that BPR envisions. The research presented here was conducted using the interpretive approach of ethnography to investigate how middle management were able to deny the technology of BPR and disable a change project. In order to maintain their hold on power in the organization they needed to revolt against the technology of re-engineering imposed on them by senior management. In using the clinical metaphor, middle management were able to create a reality around technology that portrayed it almost as a function of biological warfare, denying it being seen as a positive social tool. This paper highlights how they were able to manipulate the technology and turn its power around to reinforce their position and power in the process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on a series of structured interviews with several senior management figures, this paper explores two different approaches to competitiveness within the literature, namely the technology-driven approach and the competency-driven approach, and asks whether they can be reconciled with the real world experiences of corporate managers. The technology driven approach is based on the belief that information technology (IT) offers a powerful source of competitive advantage. Popularized by, and based on the work of, Michael Porter there is a corresponding emphasis on planning and the use of ‘generic’ strategies. The competency driven approach, on the other hand, holds that each company possesses unique sources of advantage, which it must exploit to derive maximum benefits. The focus is on flexibility, while no ‘recipes’ for success are offered. Given that these two approaches appear to be diametrically opposed, 16 senior management figures from leading edge companies were interviewed to determine which, if either, of the two views was more in tune with reality. This paper details the findings. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Comparative Study of Business to Consumer Electronic Commerce within the Australian Insurance Sector",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Electronic commerce is causing fundamental changes in the insurance sector. Inherent opportunities of this innovative sales channel are driving the development of a new customer relationship paradigm, development of new products, pursuit of low cost ‘self service’ strategies, and emergence of ‘virtual brokers’. The Australian insurance sector is well positioned to take advantage of electronic commerce due to the high level of PC penetration, high Internet usage, and extensive broadband infrastructure. The perception is that the Australian insurance sector is meeting these challenges. Surprisingly, despite the emergence of electronic commerce as a ‘hot topic’ in the information technology and insurance sector literature, little empirical research has been reported. Much of the extant literature can be criticized as being too generic and superficial. It is argued that until research is focused on specific aspects of electronic commerce, we will fail to capture meaningful insights. The aim of this research project is to develop a research framework appropriate for electronic commerce, research and to apply it to a specific sector (insurance), in a specific geographical region (Australia), using a specific electronic commerce, medium (Internet), for a specific purpose (business to consumer sale of risk products). The research objective is to discover which Australian insurance companies are using electronic commerce for what. The survey found that of the 21 largest Australian insurance companies only 18 have web sites. These sites are mainly used for promotional purposes and not for directly generating sales. Only six companies offer customer-specific pricing of their products. And of these, only four companies sell any of their products over the Internet. Paradoxically, despite pressing business drivers in the insurance sector and a favourable electronic commerce environment in Australia, these findings demonstrate a significant gap between appreciation of the importance of electronic commerce and realization of commercial potential. Whilst most Australian insurance companies are well aware of the special importance of electronic commerce, many fail to take full advantage. Although further qualitative research is recommended to understand why this is so, it is clear that a significant gap remains between the technical capabilities of electronic commerce and actual practice in the Australian insurance sector. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Distributed model management systems (DMMS) represent the next frontier in the organizational usage of DSS technology. Due to the growing popularity of distributed computing systems and increased level of modelling activity in most organizations, significant benefits can be realized through the implementation of a DMMS. In several ways, the functions of a DMMS can be viewed as isomorphic to those of a distributed database system. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper describes the objectives of a distributed model management system and discusses several important issues that must be considered before constructing the distributed model base. In addition, a layered schema architecture is suggested for designing the DMMS. The proposed architecture facilitates sharing, control, consistency and integration of models, without altering the current model representation schemes. This paper also examines the roles of different individuals responsible for managing the DMMS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper presents the findings from empirical research on IT outsourcing in two British companies: ICI Plc and Wessex Water. Both organizations have pursued a selective sourcing approach using multiple suppliers in an attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. Whilst the majority of existing literature on selective sourcing concentrates on the ‘mega-contracts’, this research explores some of the issues and concerns of companies with small to medium sized outsourcing contracts. The findings suggest that selective and competitive sourcing may offer the client company value-added benefits, although it is important to develop strengths in the areas of contract management and negotiation and competitive benchmarking and performance management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is now widely established as an interorganizational system in almost all large and medium size industrial, service and retail sectors and the purpose of this paper is to discuss the experiences of six supermarket chains concerning the use of this technology. Whilst the advantages of conducting electronic transactions are generally recognized, consensus on methodologies for quantifying the benefit success associated with interorganizational systems still remain elusive. It is argued that a comparison of pre-implementation expected benefits with post-implementation realized benefits can offer a reliable way of assessing the benefit success from EDI and other information systems. In this approach, the benefit success is expressed as a function of three benefit states namely, efficiency, neutrality and deficiency depending on whether the gap between realized and expected benefits is positive, neutral or negative respectively. In order to identify the benefit state of each participating organization, initially a series of semistructured interviews was conducted with senior managers followed by the administration of a self assessment rating instrument in the form of a questionnaire. This paper will discuss the findings along with the testing of a new conceptual framework for examining the relationship between benefit success, implementation approach and implementation success. </jats:p>",

The challenge of the ‘90s will be to integrate in an effective manner, the corporate business strategy with the increasing use of IT. In many cases, it will require a new style of management, but for those organizations who do not make this change, their corporate prosperity may be at stake. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper sets out my personal view on this major issue, which was presented on the 23 April 1990, as the British Computer Society 1990 Jubilee lecture and sponsored by Computer Weekly. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the application of the concepts and research derived from studies of dysfunctional and addictive social behaviours to the implementation of change in an organizational arena. The majority of work on change management and, more specifically, re-engineering has been dominated by an emphasis on technical issues and macro-constructs that are important components in achieving successful process-change programmes. However, is it increasingly recognized that the emphasis on these is the cause of widespread disappointment with business process re-engineering. This paper argues that the management of the human and sociopolitical issues of change is a critical factor in determining the success or failure of process-re-engineering projects. It further suggests a methodology that may facilitate examination of these issues within any particular organization, based upon an organizational addictive model, which is developed in this paper. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well known that executive information systems (EIS) are high risk systems to implement and maintain. Factor research is the most commonly used framework for studying the causes of EIS failure yet there is no conclusive evidence that the factors suggested in the information systems (IS) research literature ensure system success. This paper reports on a case study of a failed EIS in a large New Zealand organization and compares this case with the success factors found in the research literature. One of the findings is that the broader issues surrounding the failure were more significant than the more narrowly focused factors suggested by the factor research approach. These broader issues include the social, cultural, political and economic context of the system as a whole. Another finding was that many of these broader contextual issues were not directly controllable by the EIS project team. This paper will have implications for all those who have to develop or are involved with the development of EIS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "is that the sections on managing and implementing the contract are all too brief, considering the importance of post-contract management. Perhaps that can be recti® ed in a further volume. The ® nal part of the book offers an opportunity for the representatives of three suppliers to put forward their perspectives on outsourcing. CSC’s account of its British Aerospace contract is perhaps the most interesting contribution here, Serco’s the most intriguing and that of EDS perhaps the most self-serving. None provide much more illumination than is available in the rest of the book. The authors also provide some detailed documents, for example an illustrative project plan and an overview of the contract management process, that practitioners will ® nd useful. Overall the book is highly recommended and practitioners about to undertake the hazardous business of outsourcing will not baulk at its rather high price. Academic readers who use the book creatively will ® nd much insight here, much to read between the lines and, indirectly, many ideas for new research topics. The authors illustrate that the devil is in the preparation for and in the detail of outsourcing. Their experiences as consultants in this ® eld would seem to have equipped them with ways in which the always possible Faustian descent into hell can be avoided. At the same time, to protect client con® dentiality, it means that they are unable to provide explicit case studies that would have so richly illustrated this volume. All this is perhaps to hope for too much. There is a genuine shortage of informed, practitioner-oriented texts in this ® eld; this is now one that those considering outsourcing will need to read carefully.

    "title": "Micro-randomized trials in Information Systems research: An experimental method for advancing knowledge about our dynamic and digitalized world",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing ubiquity of individualized digital devices expands the scope of Information Systems (IS) research and offers novel opportunities for investigating and influencing individuals’ intentions, cognitions, and behavior. Based on these technological advancements, behavioral science researchers have started to develop experimental methods that allow for rigorously investigating dynamic phenomena in our digitalized world. We introduce an experimental design, called a micro-randomized trial (MRT), and propose that it is widely applicable in IS research for examining complex and dynamic IS research phenomena. MRTs allow for analyzing causalities and testing theories with dynamic components by considering how time-varying personal and contextual factors influence an experimental treatment’s efficacy over time. The resulting insights can be leveraged to refine theories, improve IS design, influence users’ cognitions and intentions, and steer user behavior. This paper motivates the relevance of the MRT experimental design for IS research, equips interested IS researchers with the required knowledge to conduct MRTs, and demonstrates how MRTs can be deployed to advance IS knowledge by achieving research goals that until now, given the standard IS method assortment, could not be properly addressed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Focusing on inter-organizational information sharing in criminal justice, it is found that, while poor project management leads to unsuccessful inter-organizational information sharing, a recipe for success is more demanding as it requires both compatible technologies and good project management implemented either by means of a top-down approach of strategic alignment or an emergent approach of bottom-up alignment. Though unplanned, the latter approach may lead to mistakes that are more correctable than the large mistakes stemming from top-down, deliberate planning. The study is an analysis of context-mechanism-outcome configurations of inter-organizational information sharing activities within criminal justice systems and demonstrates the causal asymmetry between positive and negative cases. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed by highlighting the causal role of different types of governance structure in a crisp set configurational fashion. </jats:p>",

The programme incentives include information technology (IT) seminars, the provision of technical expertise in the forms of advisers and consultants and various financial subsidies and loans. This paper presents the results of a formal evaluation of the impact of the SECP based on the views of various participants in the programme, including chief executive officers (CEOs) of small businesses, technical advisers, consultants, IT vendors and programme administrators. A programme evaluation methodology is utilized in this study. The main finding is that the government programme has lowered the barriers to computerization and aided small businesses that lack the resources to computerize successfully. More efforts need to be expended in promoting this programme to other small businesses that suffer from resource poverty. There is a lack of knowledge of the existence of the computerization programme and a lack of appreciation of the programme. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital transformation is a phenomenon perceived across a multitude of contexts in the organisational societal and individual domains. Conceptualising this broad phenomenon requires an approach that provides structure and comparability across contexts and domains whilst containing sufficient contextual detail and specificity to avoid conceptual stretching. Utilising a multi-method approach, this paper draws from a set of empirical data to develop such a context-sensitive conceptualisation for digital transformation. Utilising a design perspective on digital transformation this paper (1) develops a conceptual meta-structure capable of representing instances of digital transformation independent of domain and context and (2) develops a taxonomy of context-specific categories for the identified meta-elements. The three elements Representation, Technology, and Effect (RTE) constitute the meta-structure, the taxonomy is comprised of seven representation, 10 technology and nine effect categories. We evaluated our results utilising a card sorting approach in a workshop setting. The proposed conceptualisation is capable to accommodate context-specific manifestations of digital transformation in all tested environments thereby indicating its applicability as a foundation for a context-sensitive conceptualization of digital transformation. The paper contributes to the evolving body of literature on digital transformation by providing a conceptual meta-structure capable of capturing manifestations of digital transformation in a uniform and structured manner across domains and contexts. </jats:p>",

We agree with them that the advent of the digital age is calling for a reconsideration of the role of theory and theorizing. We also think their proposal does not go far enough. The time is ripe to question the role of theory in our field more fundamentally. We propose to instead focus on establishing IS research as a platform through which we can collect, organize, and provide access to digital trace data from various sources to analyze contemporary socio-technical phenomena. We believe that such a move allows us to more fully unleash the unique socio-technical competences of our field in the digital age. </jats:p>",

It does this through a series of hermeneutic readings of the situation, which develop an increasingly satisfactory understanding of the complexities of the development process. The paper begins by describing the case study site and the market that it operates within before considering the role of corporate culture on entrepreneurial firms of this kind. The first reading of the situation, using participative methods and the sociology of translation, is then presented and a critique of the limitations of this reading is presented. A second reading, drawing on Heidegger's ideas as applied to the notion of entrepreneurship, is then presented. This second reading proves to be far more satisfactory and the paper ends with a summary and reflections on the process of making a series of readings of the development process at the case study site. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This special issue addresses a largely neglected area of Information Systems (IS) research – the regulation of and through Information Technology (IT). As with other human technologies, IT artefacts present risks and can harm individuals, groups, organisations, economies, and society: However, this remains a largely unexplored topic in IS research. Nevertheless, regulators, social commentators, the media, and the public have voiced their concerns about such risks, particularly those related to artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, privacy, digital assets (e.g. cryptocurrencies), and the market dominance of digital platforms. Accordingly, regulations have been instituted or proposed to regulate IT artefacts in and across several business sectors. Additionally, in response to the informational challenges posed by a complex web of laws and regulations, regulators and business organisations have implemented IT artefacts to transform regulatory and supervisory processes or to enhance organisational risk management and compliance reporting capabilities. This special issue addresses the research challenges related to emergent issues surrounding the regulation of and through IT. In this editorial, we take stock of where the field currently stands. We advance a conceptual ontology of IT regulation to guide future research by specifying several taken-for-granted core concepts. By rendering the concepts, categories, and their relationships explicit, the model and its related research questions provide a firm foundation to generate a cumulative body of research on the regulation of and through IT. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The digitisation of data about the world relevant to business has given rise to a new phase of digitalisation of business itself. The digitisation of data about people has linked with the notions of information society, surveillance society, surveillance state and surveillance capitalism, and given rise to what is referred to in this article as the digital surveillance economy. At the heart of this is a new form of business model that is predicated on the acquisition and consolidation of very large volumes of personal data, and its exploitation to target advertisements, manipulate consumer behaviour, and price goods and services at the highest level that each individual is willing to bear. In the words of the model’s architects, users are ‘bribed’ and ‘induced’ to make their data available at minimal cost to marketers. </jats:p><jats:p> The digital surveillance economy harbours serious threats to the interests of individuals, societies and polities. That in turn creates risks for corporations. The new economic wave may prove to be a tsunami that swamps the social dimension and washes away the last five centuries’ individualism and humanism. Alternatively, institutional adaptation might occur, overcoming the worst of the negative impacts; or a breaking-point could be reached and consumers might rebel against corporate domination. A research agenda is proposed, to provide a framework within which alternative scenarios can be investigated. </jats:p>",

By responding to the commentaries this rejoinder contributes to a debate about potential merits, limitations and wider ramifications of SLR for the IS discipline.

What is the view of ‘evidence’ in SLRs and the evidence-based practice movement and what are potential implications for ‘research informing IS practice'? How can the efficiency and effectiveness of literature reviews be improved? Overall we argue for a practice of critique that scrutinizes methodologies such as SLR in the light of values and ends we seek to achieve in the IS discipline. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Taxonomy of Financial Market Manipulations: Establishing Trust and Market Integrity in the Financialized Economy through Automated Fraud Detection",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Financial market manipulations represent a major threat to trust and market integrity in capital markets. Manipulations contribute to mispricing, market imperfections and an increase in transaction costs for market participants and in costs of capital for issuers. Manipulations are facilitated by increased transaction velocity, speculative trading and abusive usage of new trading technologies, i.e., they are directly linked to financial sector changes that drive financialization. Research at the intersection of financialization and IS might support regulatory authorities and market operators in improving market surveillance and helping to detect fraudulent activities. However, confusing terminology is prevalent on financial markets with respect to different manipulation techniques and their characteristics, which hampers efficient fraud detection. Furthermore, recognizing manipulations is challenging given the large number of information sources and the vast number of trades occurring not least because of high-frequency traders. Therefore, automated market surveillance tools require a comprehensive taxonomy of financial market manipulations as a basis for appropriate configuration. Based on a cluster analysis of SEC litigation releases, a review of the latest market abuse regulation and academic studies, we develop a taxonomy of manipulations that structures and details existing manipulation techniques and reveals how these techniques differ along several dimensions. In a case study, we show how the taxonomy can be utilized to guide the development of appropriate decision support systems for fraud detection. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The stock market reactions to information technology (IT)-related events have often been used as proxies to the value or cost of these events in the information systems literature. In this paper, we study the stock market reactions to information-security-related events using the event analysis methodology with consideration of the effects of a number of contingency factors, including business type, industry, type of breach, event year, and length of event window. We found that pure e-commerce firms experienced higher negative market reactions than traditional bricks-and-mortar firms in the event of security breach. We also found that denial of service attacks had higher negative impact than other types of security breaches. Finally, security events occurred in recent years were found to have less significant impact than those occurred earlier, suggesting that investors may have become less sensitive to the security events. Most interestingly, our analyses showed that the magnitude and longevity of security breaches vary with time across sub-samples. This raises some serious questions regarding the validity of analyzing only short-term stock market reactions as an indicator of the cost of security breaches, and in general, an indicator of the value of IT-related events. The implications of these results are discussed and potential future research directions are proposed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental turbulence (ET), as exemplified by the recent financial crisis between 2007 and 2009, leads to a high degree of uncertainty, and fosters mimicry and resulting bandwagon phenomena in information technology (IT) innovation assimilation processes. In these highly turbulent environments, ‘mindless’ IT innovation assimilation by participating organizations plays a major role in the manifestation and facilitation of mimetic influences. Even in less turbulent economic cycles, highly turbulent industries such as the financial services industry have to deal with demanding IT innovation assimilation processes, and are exposed to varying levels of ET and mimicry. Drawing upon the theory of dynamic capabilities, organizational mindfulness (OM) is one viable means to mitigate the potentially negative consequences of mimetic behaviour. Here, mindful organizations are more successful in overcoming situations of high dynamism, and sometimes are even able to exploit them. So far, little empirical research has been conducted to quantify the influence of OM in scenarios of high dynamism and mimicry. On the basis of 302 complete responses from senior IT managers in the financial services industry from the Anglo-Saxon countries (the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom), this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction of OM with institutional pressures against the background of ET. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organizational information technology (IT) needs are served through increasingly complex configurations of people, technologies, organizations, and shared information. Ideally, an organizational IT service is valuable for both the providers and users of systems and solutions. However, mutually beneficial outcomes may be difficult to achieve within the configurations through which IT services are delivered. We suggest that analyzing stakeholder interplay in IT service processes helps us to understand how information systems (IS) organizations can be leveraged to co-create business value. Through a qualitative empirical inquiry, we explore IT service realization in two case organizations. Through our analysis we find that value creation builds on orchestrated social action among the different stakeholder groups involved. Joint value creation in IT service processes hence calls for specific network leadership and resource integration capabilities from the IS organization. The paper enriches the current understanding of business value creation in IT services by infusing the service logic with traditional IT management perspectives. The findings highlight that the extent to which the IS organization can learn to facilitate the interaction between the essential actors in an ‘IT service system’ and leverage user-perceived value throughout the service process will ultimately determine its success or failure. </jats:p>",

This paper argues that the coevolutionary and emergent nature of alignment has rarely been taken into consideration in IS research and that this is the reason behind why IS alignment is so difficult. A view of IS alignment is presented about organizations that draws and builds on complexity theory and especially its focus on coevolution-based self-organized emergent behaviour and structure, which provides important insights for dealing with the emergent nature of IS alignment. This view considers Business/IS alignment as a series of adjustments at three levels of analysis: individual, operational, and strategic, and suggests several enabling conditions – principles of adaptation and scale-free dynamics – aimed at speeding up the adaptive coevolutionary dynamics among the three levels. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a new model for measuring the digital divide within a set of countries or geographical areas. Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the ‘digital economy’ environment. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Robo-Apocalypse cancelled? Reframing the automation and future of work debate",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Robotics and the automation of knowledge work, often referred to as AI (artificial intelligence), are presented in the media as likely to have massive impacts, for better or worse, on jobs skills, organizations and society. The article deconstructs the dominant hype-and-fear narrative. Claims on net job loss emerge as exaggerated, but there will be considerable skills disruption and change in the major global economies over the next 12 years. The term AI has been hijacked, in order to suggest much more going on technologically than can be the case. The article reviews critically the research evidence so far, including the author’s own, pointing to eight major qualifiers to the dominant discourse of major net job loss from a seamless, overwhelming AI wave sweeping fast through the major economies. The article questions many assumptions: that automation creates few jobs short or long term; that whole jobs can be automated; that the technology is perfectible; that organizations can seamlessly and quickly deploy AI; that humans are machines that can be replicated; and that it is politically, socially and economically feasible to apply these technologies. A major omission in all studies is factoring in dramatic increases in the amount of work to be done. Adding in ageing populations, productivity gaps and skills shortages predicted across many G20 countries, the danger might be too little, rather than too much labour. The article concludes that, if there is going to be a Robo-Apocalypse, this will be from a collective failure to adjust to skills change over the next 12 years. But the debate needs to be widened to the impact of eight other technologies that AI insufficiently represents in the popular imagination and that, in combination, could cause a techno-apocalypse. </jats:p>",

    "title": "How open is this Platform? The Meaning and Measurement of Platform Openness from the Complementers’ Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Software platforms’ success largely depends on complementors’ willingness to repeatedly invest their time and effort to the development of platform applications that attract users and increase the platform's installed base. But how can platform providers encourage desirable behaviours by complementors (i.e., application developers) in the absence of formal roles and hierarchical control structures? Although previous studies of software-based platforms have identified openness as critical instrument at the macro (i.e., platform) level and have provided initial attempts to measure the construct, no research has been dedicated to comprehensively conceptualize and operationalize platform openness at the micro level from the perspective of application developers. To go beyond these preliminary findings and to theorize about the nature and effects of platform openness as perceived by application developers, we develop a construct called perceived platform openness (PPO). Drawing on recently advanced scale development methodologies, we conceptualize PPO as a multidimensional construct and empirically validate it with important consequent variables linked to developers’ continuous platform contributions. Empirical evidence from several rounds of qualitative and quantitative steps supports the conceptual validity of the construct and empirical relevance of the scale across different smartphone platform contexts (i.e., Apple iOS and Google Android). Researchers will benefit from the study's systematic and comprehensive conceptualization of PPO, how it is measured, and how it relates to critical application developer beliefs and attitudes. Platform managers may use our results to target the underlying facets of PPO most likely to contribute to the platform's long-term goals. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Are We Making a Better World with Icts? Reflections on a Future Agenda for the IS Field",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Dramatic changes in context have occurred over the last 25 years for those of us working in the information systems (IS) field, with ICTs becoming pervasive in many areas of human activity and in all countries of the world. It is ironic that the success of ICTs has led to concerns that the distinct research contribution of the IS field could become lost and that the field itself may decline. The literature over the last decade or so has offered different and sometimes opposing suggestions as to how the field should respond to these concerns. In this paper, I discuss these debates and I use the discussion as a basis for putting forward a skeleton future agenda for the IS field as a whole. This agenda emphasises the need for a focus on ethical goals, increased use of critical approaches, welcoming other disciplines with open arms, widening our field of study to many nontraditional settings and rejecting a dominant methodological paradigm. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards a value theory for personal data",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Analysts, investors and entrepreneurs have recognized the value of personal data for Internet economics. Personal data is viewed as ‘the oil’ of the digital economy. Yet, ordinary people are barely aware of this. Marketers collect personal data at minimal cost in exchange for free services. But will this be possible in the long term, especially in the face of privacy concerns? Little is known about how users really value their personal data. In this paper, we build a user-centered value theory for personal data. On the basis of a survey experiment with 1269 Facebook users, we identify core constructs that drive the value of volunteered personal data. We find that privacy concerns are less influential than expected and influence data value mainly when people become aware of data markets. In fact, the consciousness of data being a tradable asset is the single most influential factor driving willingness-to-pay for data. Furthermore, we find that people build a sense of psychological ownership for their data and hence value it more. Finally, our value theory helps to unveil market design mechanisms that will influence how personal data markets thrive: First, we observe a majority of users become reactant if they are consciously deprived of control over their personal data; many drop out of the market. We therefore advice companies to consider user-centered data control tools to have them participate in personal data markets. Second, we find that in order to create scarcity in the market, centralized IT architectures (reducing multiple data copies) may be beneficial. </jats:p>",
