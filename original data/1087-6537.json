    "title": "The northrhine‐westphalia project: “Man and technology”",
    "abstract": "The \"Man and Technology'' programme is part of a wider \"Enterprise for Future Technologies\" programme designed to assist the State of NorthrhineWestphalia to overcome its current economic and social problems, and is concerned with the shaping of technology in a socially compatible way. After a review of the questions and problems raised by the information technology—family interface, the various aspects of the programme are set out. The Background and Political Environment of the NorthrhineWestphalia Programme In the current debate about the future economic and social development of the Federal Republic of Germany, the center of attention is held by the \"new technologies.\" For most of those active in the fields of economy and politics these are the carriers of hope in a situation of intense international competition. The deciding impulse for economic and social change in the direction of the postindustrial society is expected to be given by the new technologies. This potential of the new technologies of being in the position of shaping future events (especially the information, communication, and microelectronic technologies) is not even being questioned by those sceptics of technology to be found in, among others, unions, church organizations, and the fields of science and journalism. Quite the contrary, in fact. The bone of contention is, however, the question as to the relationship between the societal costs and advantages of these developments and the question pertaining to the direction in which, and how, technological progress should be steered. The Federal President, Mr. von Weizsacker, commented on this subject to mark the opening of the 1986 industrial fair in Hannover (Press and Information Bureau of the Federal Government, 1986, pp. 269 ff.): \"The prosperity of our economy can only be secured if we view technological progress positively and participate in it. In order to be able to do this we must be able to understand it. This in turn means that we must also recognize the dangers and risks which have always been and always will be associated with technological progress, and learn to control them. . . . The areas of science and technology, politics and economics frequently overestimate their potential and this often results in opposition from the side of the population which, in turn, is initially underestiThis paper was previously presented at the Home Informatics Workshop of the Six Countries Programme on Innovation, November 1986. 233 D ow nl oa de d by [ N or th C ar ol in a St at e U ni ve rs ity ] at 1 3: 19 2 9 M ar ch 2 01 5 234 Marianne Schatz-Bergfeld mated. This opposition is frequently based upon the fact that risks and dangers are made to appear innocuous. . . . The dangers and risks inherent in the area of data technology for private life and personal freedom cannot seriously be denied, but they can be controlled.\" In the situation of an ongoing controversial scientific and political discussion the State Government of Northrhine-Westphalia decided to start up the \"Enterprise for Future Technologies\" in April 1984. The aim of this programme is to overcome the economic and social problems of the state through the implementation of a group of political measures in the fields of technology, research, and economics, which are to be simultaneously closely linked to environmental protection and maintenance, as well as to the socially compatible shaping of technology. The programme for technological development in Northrhine-Westphalia covers four separate parts with financial backing of, in all, 400 million DM from 1985 to 1988. The four parts are: • the programme for future technologies, which comprises eight areas of technology: environmental, energy, microelectronics, measuring and regulating, information, and raw material; • the encouragement of technology transfer, especially for small and medium sized businesses; • the technologically oriented leading research in the eight mentioned areas of technology, and finally, • the programme \"Man and Technology. Socially compatible shaping of technology.\" This fourth part, the so-called SoTech programme, can be seen as a supporting cornerstone of the technology enterprise, through which the whole of the promotional programme of NRW is meant to take on an autonomous and socially committed profile, thus distinguishing itself from the onesided market oriented growth and technology advancement of other Lander and the Federal Government, and can also be a technological as well as a political novelty. The Programme \"Man and Technology. Socially Compatible Shaping of Technology\" (SoTech Programme) This programme refers to the technological area of \"Microelectronics and information and communication technologies, inclusive of the 'New Media.' \" The technological assessment and analysis, with the aim of shaping technology positively and controlling vthe social consequences and side effects of technological change, should concentrate upon the following main points: the labor market places of work and work conditions co-determination and participation social security system school and professional education (in schools and professions) social relations, social communication and New Media for the family and in leisure. In the four years from 1985 to 1988, according to an official statement, about 67 D ow nl oa de d by [ N or th C ar ol in a St at e U ni ve rs ity ] at 1 3: 19 2 9 M ar ch 2 01 5 The Northrhine-Westphalia Project 235 million DM are to be made available for financing practice and usage oriented research and development projects for the socially compatible shaping of technology. About 100 larger projects, 60 smaller work contracts, 10 large assemblies (exhibitions, congresses, theater-productions, etc.), and up to 280 smaller events (workshops, seminars, etc.), have been planned for the duration of this programme. By the summer of 1986 over 50 larger projects (average financial volume of about 600,000 DM per project) and numerous smaller work contracts had already been given away. A further 50 topics were offered up and a decision about the applications received is being arrived at now. (For information about the development of the programme and its momentary implementation see MAGS 1985; von Alemann and Schatz 1986; MAGS/RISP 1986; Simonis 1986). Some peculiarities of the conception of the programme and the practice of advancement which should be mentioned are: • The programme sees the information and communication technologies as cross-sectional and key technologies, which pervade all areas of society. This is the reason why the areas of everyday and nonworking life, the relationship between the citizens and the state, as well as the future of work and of the economy of NRW are being conceptualized, apart from just working life (industrial work, service sector and administration)— which, nonetheless, is the main field. • The (financially supported) projects should not only ascertain and catalog the social consequences of the diffusion of the information and communication technologies throughout society, but should rather be able to change reality, too. In carrying out the projects, technology is shaped in an exemplary manner, new socially compatible possibilities for the use of technology are being introduced, qualifications are being collected, and possibilities for alternative forms of use are being developed. The project typologies vary accordingly (shaping-projects, analysis projects, studies of prognosis and of new outlooks, future oriented workshops, qualification projects, and mediation projects) (see v. Alemann, Schatz, and Viefhues, 1986, pp. 40ff.). • To make sure that the targets, which have been set by the Government of NRW, are definitely realized, the programme is being developed by the Ministry for Labor, Health and Social matters as commissioning ministry in conjunction with the Rhein-Ruhr Institute for Social Research and Political Advice (\"Projekttrager\") and an advisory committee. • The projects which are being carried out as part of this programme are meant to open up participation and codetermination possibilities. Those affected by the technological development are to be made able: \"— to inform themselves about technology — to handle technology in a way compatible with man and nature — to develop technical alternatives — to find ways of cooperation, codetermination and participation for those affected by technology\" (MAGS, 1985). • The results of the programme are first and foremost to be applied in a decentralized way: on the one hand by the projects themselves and on the other hand through the development of a public debate about a socially compatible shaping of technology at the place of work, in the private sector of home, family, and leisure and through the policy. D ow nl oa de d by [ N or th C ar ol in a St at e U ni ve rs ity ] at 1 3: 19 2 9 M ar ch 2 01 5 236 Marianne Schatz-Bergfeld Whether the SoTech programme is able to reach this ambitious goal remains to be seen. The chance of achieving this will become all the more realistic, if it can be shown that the programme is not a \"technology-hindering\" one, but rather one which will lead to a reduction of anxiety and to a fair compromise of interests through participation, cooperation, and qualification. It is only in this way that these new technologies can be given the seal of approval of employees and citizens. Even considering the sociopolitical orientation it is plain to see the effectiveness of this aim: not only the social consensus in view of the necessity and possibilities for the applicability of the new technologies, but also their socially compatible shaping offer valuable resources for world-market oriented modernization policies. Social consensus guarantees unproblematic production. The socially compatible shaping of technology opens internal as well as external markets. The modernization policies of the Social Democrats base themselves upon the str",

The concept is particularly evident in the state of New Jersey and its legislatively supported plan, Opportunity New Jersey, to deploy advanced telecommunications technologies to all homes and businesses in just 20 yr. This case study of the decision-making process behind the passage of the New Jersey legislation illustrates how telecommunications companies have worked to couple their desire for less regulation with the desire of state officials for economic development, by promising to upgrade the infrastructure of the public network. With the upgrade promise comes a hoped-for economic development payoff in education, through distance learning, in health care, through telemedicine, and especially in new jobs, by attracting information-intensive businesses, like finance and insurance, to relocate in their service areas. The lack of clear connection between infrastructure investments and economic development means that the twenty-first century will come before strategies such as this are proven.",

I characterize those compelling rational arguments as ''informational imperatives,'' and I show that they generate unrealistic expectations based on assumptions about information resource use that do not reflect practice. My ''informational contexts'' acknowledge that people value information and information resources based, in part, on the way they relate to the social world in which they live and work. If we base our expectations about information use on actual practice, would that reduce the potential economic benefit of expanding a national information infrastructure? I examine the social and organizational processes that direct IT use, and conclude that economic potential will remain high even if we alter information infrastructure policies to acknowledge and accommodate those processes that enhance expertise and foster socially mediated relationships.",

    "title": "On Media Concentration and the Diversity Question",
    "abstract": "Abstract Corporate mergers and the consolidation of ownership in the American communications arena have long been sources of concern. U.S. regulatory and antitrust policy traditionally attempted to secure a “diversity of voices” structurally, largely through rules regarding ownership. Although the meaning of diversity was always problematic and undertheorized, the Federal Communications Commission long set ceilings on the numbers of broadcast outlets any single person or corporation could own and enacted cross-ownership rules such as a prohibition against a corporation owning a newspaper and broadcast outlets in the same market. These rules, and the FCC's authority to make them, were upheld, occasionally even compelled, by the federal appellate courts. In the last 20 years, however, legal trends, in conjunction with political developments, have undermined the diversity rationales behind ownership rules and associated structural regulations of mass media. Paradoxically, even as media corporations are becoming larger and presumably more powerful, ownership regulations are being rescinded or struck down. This article explains this history. It concludes with a suggestion that the First Amendment metaphor of a marketplace of ideas is misplaced, and of how our thinking about media ownership and diversity might be better served by the metaphor of a mixed media system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper challenges the assertion that lacking omnibus privacy legislation and a centralized administrative body, the United States is deficient in legal protection accorded to personal data. On the contrary, it is shown that proper safeguards are provided through a variety of interrelated efforts, resulting in privacy laws and programs that share a common dedication to the underlying “fair information” principles found in such international expressions of resolve as the OECD Guidelines and the Convention of the Council of Europe. It is also demonstrated that U.S. privacy laws are strengthened by their diversity of sources, content, and enforcement mechanisms. Voluntary compliance by the U.S. private sector with “fair information” principles is endorsed, and AT&T's privacy program is discussed as a representative of many such undertakings. In conclusion, it is emphasized that development of a properly balanced international comity on information transmission and storage could and must be advanced.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is much excitement about Web 2.0 as a novel platform for experiencing, producing, and consuming leisure, particularly through social network sites. Conversely, there are skeptics who sound the alarm on these spaces, viewing them as diluting of human relations. The perspective that guides this article is invested in neither a utopian nor a dystopian posture, but sees historical continuity, pointing out that performing leisure is a basic human impulse that has found expression over the centuries. With regard to the online sites used for leisure, it makes the case that the history of the development of the public park, the product of a complex interplay of interests and agendas of different stakeholders, provides a particularly rich resource for gaining insights into the evolution of social networking sites. To illustrate this heuristic potential, it draws on experiences ranging from the democratization of Beijing's parks in early twentieth century to the movement of flâneurs across Parisian public spaces to comment on the architecture of and activities on social network sites.",

This article discusses Brazil's somewhat protectionist international economic policy in the telematics sector and its potential impact on social and economic progress.

The primary policy objective should be to create the broadest possible public access to information, a goal best achieved by favoring a relatively open telematics environment.",

    "abstract": "We use the legal framework of captive audience to examine the Federal Trade Commission 2012 privacy guidelines as applied to mobile marketing. We define captive audiences as audiences without functional opt-out mechanisms to avoid situations of coercive communication. By analyzing the current mobile marketing ecosystem, we show that the Federal Trade Commission's privacy guidelines inspired by the Canadian “privacy by design” paradigm fall short of protecting consumers against invasive mobile marketing in at least three respects: (a) The guidelines overlook how, in the context of data monopolies, the combination of location and personal history data threatens autonomy of choice; (b) the guidelines focus exclusively on user control over data sharing, while ignoring control over communicative interaction; and (c) the reliance on market mechanisms to produce improved privacy policies may actually increase opt-out costs for consumers. We conclude by discussing two concrete proposals for improvement: a “home mode” for mobile privacy and target-specific privacy contract negotiation.",

    "abstract": "Electronic commerce is a relatively new concept that crept into the business vocabulary during the 1970s. A picture of electronic commerce is emerging in which the Internet will become the essential dial-tone for conducting business by the year 2000. This contribution addresses definitional, theoretical and contextual issues including the nature, drivers, enablers, and the magnitude of electronic commerce. The author discusses the role of electronic markets, the effects of information technology on electronic commerce, interactivity, and the evolution of disintermediation to reintermediation. A definition and typology of electronic commerce are offered. Theoretical and conceptual approaches to electronic commerce are advanced in terms of (1) transaction cost theory, (2) marketing, (3) diffusion, (4) information retrieval, and (5) strategic networking. Lastly, the author poses the question of how electronic commerce adds value.",

    "title": "The essentialities of productivity in information services",
    "abstract": "The concept of productivity in information services is very elusive. What economic value is created by information services? When we consider the role of information as a lubricant for the development and execution of international trade, this is especially difficult. My position is that information is essential to the development of international transactions. In effect, no international trade can occur in the absence of solid, accurate, and timely information about the trading partners. That assertion is an empty statement in the absence of an understanding about the role of information in enhancing productivity. How do we understand the role of information as a factor in productivity improvement? One approach is that of the librarian, who measures productivity by thinking, \"How much time did I save for the scientist, engineer, or social researcher when I did a more efficient search of the literature as defined?\" A second approach is that of the management analyst. In that case the thinking might be: \"How much did the information I supplied add to the cost effectiveness of the decision that was being made? In other words, did the information make the final decision more accurate, more persuasive, or more defensible?\" In each case there is a subjective judgment to be made about the overall efficacy of the decision itself and of the information that was important to the decision or the action. This subjective judgment is important, yet there is an overall skepticism that information is simply an additional cost, that information does not yield measurable benefits. In these remarks I will seek to set a framework for evaluating the value and productivity of information systems. While this subject has been studied for many years, the reality is that there are not many practical examples of the productivity of information activities and, more importantly, the concepts of measuring the national income accounts make it extremely difficult to measure the impact of value added in information activities. For this reason, I will use examples based on our experience in the United States, but our experience at Dun & Bradstreet is that the models that work in the United States can be adapted to other national settings. In fact, nearly one-third of our revenue and profits originate outside of North America. The basic concept of value added in the national accounts (GNP in the U.S., and the SNA, or System of National Accounts in the United Nations) is that value added is the sum of capital and labor inputs in information activities. Thus, wages of analysts combined with the allocation of computer and telecommunications costs equal the value added. You will immediately note that there has been no recognition of the so-called",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the mix of good and bad jobs in the restructuring of United States’ labor markets for information work between 1900 and 1980. Is the information sector still growing relative to other occupational sectors? What is the relative proportion of good to bad jobs in the information sector today? Is the mix of good bad jobs within the information sector changing over time? To answer these questions, we examine changes in the relative size of the information sector's labor markets and changes in five occupational strata within it—professional, semiprofessional, supervisory and upper‐level sales personnel, clerks, and blue‐collar workers. The information occupations mushroomed in size from 17% of the United States workforce in 1900 to over 50% in 1980. Information sector jobs vary widely in quality. Few information sector jobs are fully professional, and clerical jobs form the largest single occupational stratum. When we examined the growth of the various strata between 1900 and 1980...",

The notion of class needs to be expanded to include everybody who creates and recreates spaces of common experience, such as user-generated content on the Internet, through their practices. These spaces and experiences are appropriated and thereby expropriated and exploited by capital to accumulate capital. The rise of informational capitalism requires us to rethink the notion of class and to relate the class concept to knowledge labor.",

    "title": "A Review of “Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia”",
    "abstract": "Society has definitely changed in our time and few can deny that the Internet’s omniscience is one of its most useful and transformative features, including tools such as the reach and power of Google’s search engine, or the vast entries in Wikipedia. Reagle’s book on the culture of Wikipedia gives an accurate account of this sociocultural and sociotechnological phenomenon that Wikipedia is. The author, Joseph Michael Reagle, Jr., himself a computer scientist at MIT, works efficiently through the different social protocols involved in this “fantastic creature.” Not without reason, the renowned legal scholar Lawrence Lessig comments that Reagle paradoxically tackles this book more as an “ethnographical project” than as a cumulative project on a heavenly creature close to perfection. Reagle’s work strikes a rare balance between two environments, his proper technological background and the new society on the move. It certainly resembles a consortium, but the book is also on a consortium. It traces and analyzes the way Wikipedia started and evolved from an offshoot of Nupedia, without ignoring the sense and meaning of collaborative enterprise applied to both: the community and the encyclopedia. In other words, it approaches the founding spirit of this phenomenon. Reagle adds richness by including sociological comments and opinions from different realms, taken from journalists (Tim O’Reilly, Steven Levy; 152), librarians (Thomas Mann; 152), editors (Chris Anderson; 152), and classic authors such as Aldous Huxley (152). The monograph pays attention to Wikipedia achievements, and though the worries are not ignored and inaccuracies are stated, two other important worries—that it is not financially sustainable, and that Wikipedia has lost touch with its founding ideal—are not as openly dealt with. The volume was written before the semi-namesake Wikileaks and prior to some criticism from variegated sources referring to Wikipedia as “already starting to look rather stiff and middle-aged” (The Economist, January 21, 2011), but it may be that these are agoraphobic and evercriticizers’ statements and that in spite of accusations of nonauthoritativeness or nonaccuracy Wikipedia is, as the author says, a good starting point or an excellent alpha for research, as many experts validated later. Few can doubt that noble criteria guided this book. In fact, the quality of its diagnosis owes a lot to the utilitarian analysis applied to the general principles under Wikipedia, especially the three core policies central to the understanding of the Wikipedia splendor: “Neutral Point of View” (NPOV), “No Original Research,” and “Verifiability.” Each chapter studies Wikipedia with special attention to its “collaborative cover.” Wikipedia is a knowledge staple of our time. Even if some detractors think it is still a “populist offshoot of Nupedia” (6), nobody can think of a true rival in this knowledge contest. The sins are there: lightness, temporary reliability, questionable scholarly approaches, sometimes oversimplification, sometimes data excess; however, these are venial sins and easily absolved. Now that the European Union is trying to adapt this part of Western academia to the global university system (though inevitably AngloAmerican inspired), one of the major virtues that perfectly tunes the new waves is the spirit of access and edition: Everybody can access, anyone can edit, so we have the cornerstone of knowledge, who can ask for more? A possibility mildly ignored in the volume is the grateful comparative analysis that could have risen from what is truly new in Wikipedia and what indisputably belongs",

Principal-agent theory explains future (dis-)intermediation structures in electronic markets. Finally, property rights theory helps to understand why a certain level of market intransparency will remain in electronic markets.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines one of the largest interventions in computer-based learning currently underway, the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project, with 2.5 million laptops in use worldwide. Drawing on 2010 and 2013 fieldwork investigating a project in Paraguay with 10,000 of OLPC's “XO” laptops, I explore the ways in which participants interpreted leisure laptop use as “learning.” I show that the most captivating uses of the laptops were not “productive” or programming-centric, as OLPC's developers hoped, but “consumptive” and media-centric, focused on music, videos, and video games. I discuss the learning benefits and drawbacks of this use, as understood by participants and in light of education research, and in light of the broader context of transnational corporations interested in marketing to these children. In the process, I weigh OLPC's utopian dreams against the interests of the child beneficiaries, concerns of media imperialism, and a potential shift in the meaning of computers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Australia's treatment of information technology (IT) has vacillated between two policy directions: laissez faire, market directed strategy on the one hand, and strong government interventionist, plan directed strategy on the other. The resultant policy mix is more a collection of individual initiatives than a coherent strategy. It produces conflict between initiatives aimed at developing indigenous information industries and those improving the productivity and competitiveness of all industry by encouraging the wider application of IT. Unlike its East Asian neighbors, Australia does not have a powerful, independent economic planning agency capable of creating and implementing industrial and technology policy. Policies must be developed through the give and take of a democratic political process, a process that can lead to fragmented, uncoordinated policies based on bureaucratic inertia, the demands of special interest groups, and short‐term political considerations, rather than long‐term strategi...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prior internet studies research has examined dying, death, and disposal from the perspectives of material practices, new persistences, visibilities, and identities, but less so through the lens of platforms and algorithms. This special issue examines how digital infrastructures, manifested as platforms and algorithms, function to transform experiences of mortality and mortal existences. It opens up discussion about the ways in which intersections of death and digital formations produce and inflect experiences and representations of the body and place, providing fresh analytical insight into and through the concept of digital mortality. In doing so, it reflects on the dialogical relationship between digital infrastructure and mortality, and how digital infrastructure transforms meanings of mortality and death. Inverting prior emphases on the internet and media as transforming death, it shows the value of studying and questioning digital infrastructure through the concept of mortality.",

The essence of the information economy is that information is now the main capital input into manufacturing industry and as such is the key input to economic development. The activities of enquiring, communicating, evaluating, and deciding have become the activities absorbing the major proportion of national resources, with the need to know of the business decision‐maker as the main driving force. In developed information economies, industrial firms have become learning systems and a new division of labor in the economic productive system has evolved. The government‐controlled primary information sector is the source of much of the information input and the provider of the means of information transfer. Developing countries must develo...",

    "abstract": "This article examines challenges of engaging the business/industry sector in research on the use of information technology to enhance accessibility for people with disabilities in two areas of common interest—to employment and to public and retail services. The data presented arise from the joint effort of two research teams who independently encountered challenges in engaging private sector firms in their respective projects. Using a case study approach, the experiences of both groups were examined for themes representing factors that inhibited collaboration between research and business sectors, and those that enhanced collaboration. Trustworthiness of themes was established by submitting them for critique and feedback to key informants knowledgeable in both business and research. From a social systems theory perspective, findings suggest that the most important differences between research and business systems reside in the meaning of communication each uses, and differences in assumptions about and value placed on factors such as pursuit of new knowledge, the importance of marketability of findings, and so on. Additional complications arise in pursuit of research related to disability. Factors to build on when seeking research collaboration include an understanding of the language and culture of business systems, and the very real possibility of developing disability research into secondary goals that business systems typically pursue once the prime need for profitability has been at addressed (the notion of satisficing). Implications for communication between disability research and business systems are identified.",

    "abstract": "This article constructs a new framework for the study of games as sites of social rationalization, applying Feenberg's critical theory of technology. We begin by making the case for a consideration of games as systems of social rationality, akin to other modern systems such as capitalist markets and bureaucratic organizations. We then present a conceptualization of play as a process through which the player focuses attention away from the undifferentiated action of everyday life toward a differentiated sphere of playful activity. This approach reveals how the experience of play changes as it becomes rationalized through the technological mediation and widespread standardization that occurs as games become large-scale social practices. We propose a theory of the rationalization of play (ludification), which outlines the key components of socially rationalized games, which we then apply to the specific example of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs).",

    "abstract": "We examine the effect of public policy on the growth of Internet use. Using a decentralized country—Spain—as an example, we compare the 17 Spanish regions to test different Internet policy designs, taking into account the quality and number of specific programs promoted by regional governments, as well as the presence or absence of strategic planning in each region. We treat the percentage of Internet users as a dependent variable to compare its diffusion in different territories. Our findings show that educational levels and economic differences explain about half of the variations observed. Furthermore, the regional policies play a significant role in explaining regional variations. We investigate which public policy instruments are more significant for the development of the Internet, and find that focused policy intervention and complex policy initiatives are more significant than other policy instruments in explaining the increase in the percentage of Internet users.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The entanglement of social information technologies and their users unfolds as a problem if “wrong” users enmesh with “wrong” technologies. A long-standing debate on the merits of photorealism versus non-photorealism in archaeological visualization provides an educating example of such a “problematic” or in Haraway's words, monstrous social information technology. This article shows how a closer look at the perceived monstrosities of social information technologies can help us understand how people conceptualize information, technologies, and other people and their role in information interactions as they unfold as part of information work. It shows how a lifelike photorealistic visualization together with its spectator forms a cyborg, which is a monstrous runaway “object” when it drives with its own cultural force a programme that contradicts with other programmes considered important. The parallels in the critiques of archaeological visualizations and other informational cyborgs in information research – including search engines, information systems and services – suggest usefulness of a monstrous perspective in the analysis of social information technologies in general.",

    "title": "SMS in China: A Major Carrier of the Nonofficial Discourse Universe",
    "abstract": "As communism loses its tenets as a genuinely believed ideology and becomes a ritualized facet of a regime that strives to prolong and justify its politically and morally shaky mandate, there have emerged two distinct discourse universes in China: the official one and the nonofficial one. Taking advantage of new communication technologies, the nonofficial discourse universe extends its boundaries to such platforms as the Internet and SMS (Short Message Service) messages. This paper examines SMS as a major carrier of the deviant discourse in the following aspects: the development of cell phones from an interpersonal communication technology to a quasi-mass communication channel; the spread of deviant expressions through it; the making of the deviant discourse through SMS; the government's control over SMS; and the role of SMS in increasingly pluralistic political undercurrents in various discourse universes in China.",

    "title": "A Review of “North of Empire: Essays on the Cultural Technologies of Space”",
    "abstract": "The “opportunity” for Canadians to see the world—as Marshall McLuhan observed in typical mediated fashion—is demonstrated in North of Empire: Essays on the Cultural Technologies of Space by Jody Berland. Like Canada’s media studies forebear, Berland argues the “porous qualities of Canada’s borders provides Canada’s thinkers with particular insights on the media age” (p. 3). North of Empire explicitly demonstrates the paradoxical positions of Canada and Canadian-based scholars through centralizing questions of technology, space, and empire. While structured as a collection of stand-alone essays, the chapters of North of Empire intersect, imbricate, and interweave to provide a compelling voice on technology, nature, and empire. Akin to seminal essay collections by feminist scholars such as Donna Harraway’s Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, and Lauren Berlant’s The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and Citizenship, Berland’s North of Empire conjoins seemingly disparate practices to intervene in the oft-silenced topicality of Canada. Culture is not “ordinary” in North of Empire. Nor is technology, nor empire. Instead, Berland utilizes “culture in the context of a complicated social and material process that reproduces and extends itself in time and space” (p. 5). Berland’s intervention illuminates the complicated nature of empire, technology, and culture. Central to North of Empire’s key argument is the term cultural technologies, which “connects the various processes and practices that comprise culture,” including “the materialities that produce it,” “geopolitical contexts,” “the complex machineries of spatial dissemination,” “discourses and narratives,” symbolic practices,” “modes of political and corporate govermentality,” and “responsive subjectivities” (p. 12). If the term’s elaborate definition appears lengthy, it is only because Berland’s deft theoretical move demonstrates that seemingly separate or disparate concepts are, in actuality, dynamically and simultaneously entwined. Berland pulls through “cultural technologies” by nuanced readings in respective chapters “linking the processes of production listeners, colony, and citizen subjects” (p. 132). With only the “ironic complexity” a Canadian could embody, Berland contends how Canada is simultaneously north of, and part of, empire. Positioned as a cultural studies text, North of Empire engages with widely circulated cultural studies scholars and obscure Canadian scholars such as Harold Innis. Berland rereads Innis’s thesis of “manifest destiny,” which focuses not only on “ideologies, states, classes, or representations,” but on “rivers, railways, radios and rationalizations” (p. 81). As Innis (2007) centralized space and technology, Berland argues that “strategic imbrications of technology, culture, knowledge, and power have shaped Western imperialism” (p. 67). Berland demonstrates Canada’s border with the United States embodies cultural technology and “exceeds the symbolic” (p. 63), as “evidently, there is something about that border” (p. 3). In North of Empire, the border is not “natural” but constructed and not limited to physical properties. As evident by Berland’s innovative archive, borders are illuminated through the cultural technologies of music, angels, pianos, weather, maps, and outer space. Provocatively, in",

User feedback on a health care insurance firm's electronic service in South Africa was analyzed qualitatively using pattern matching to test the model's propositions. While functional utility was found to be a significant determinant of voluntary information technology use, both functional utility and symbolic needs were significant for some user segments. Information technology research can benefit from further cross-fertilization with social identity theory to explain use patterns in different voluntary contexts. Providers seeking to move beyond functional utility should consider the symbolic needs of strategically important user segments to strengthen long-term relationships.",

    "title": "A Review of “Inherent Vice: Bootleg Histories of Videotape and Copyright”",
    "abstract": "The rise of digital media studies over the past ten years has coincided with increased scholarly attention to matters of intellectual property and copyright law. As the Internet and other forms of new media have made content more readily available to consumers, corporations and the law have struggled to keep pace with the rate of unregulated use of digitized media, from music files and e-books to television clips and feature-length films. The proliferation of such media has been a boon to many, spurring cultural production, civic engagement, and intellectual debate on a scale wider than any previous calculus might have accounted for. Conversely, consumers’ desire for digital content has raised the stakes on corporations’ efforts to regulate access to and use of their products. Between these competing interests, in a world of seemingly infinite access to copyrighted material, contesting the terms of “fair use” has become a central concern for artists, policymakers, corporate executives, and digital media scholars alike. The salutary achievement of Lucas Hilderbrand’s Inherent Vice: Bootleg Histories of Videotape and Copyright is to show that much of how we think about fair use today derives from debates over the rise of analog videotape in the 1970s and its widespread use in the 1980s and 1990s. In two theoretical chapters and three case studies, Hilderbrand outlines the video era’s advances in making the process of content reproduction available to the everyday consumer. Whether through “timeshifting” (taping a televised program) or “dubbing” (copying a videotape), magnetic analog tape enabled users to access and recalibrate media on their own terms. Against a top-down paradigm of media access, viewers could now “watch whatever whenever” (as a Sony Betamax slogan from the late 1970s advertised). In this context, describing videotape as an “inherent vice” captures the sense that using it made bootleggers of us all: Video recording technology realized “the private reproduction of copyrighted content for noncommercial personal, scholarly, creative, and community-building uses” (25). Hilderbrand’s case studies illuminate landmarks in videotape’s history of contesting copyright law to forge new repositories of memory, experience, and communication. In his first example, Hilderbrand pairs an overview of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive (VTNA)— which has recorded local news broadcasts in Nashville, Tennessee, since the late 1960s—with an account of how the video recording industry ultimately prevailed over media corporations that had objected to timeshifting as a mode of copyright infringement. By allowing users to tape live or prerecorded programs for (indefinite) future viewing, analog technology offered a convenient way to store and consume media. Along with everyday use of video recorders, the VTNA was able to continue its work because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sony v. Universal (1984), which classified timeshifting as a fairuse practice. That decision, Hilderbrand argues, ushered in an era of unprecedented media access nominally defined by personal, noncommercial use of videotape. In the wake of the so-called “Betamax case,” media corporations’ efforts to charge users with copyright infringement often served to fuel the underground circulation of texts. In another case study, Hilderbrand emphasizes the critical role video reproduction played in keeping Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (1987) alive through bootleg copies.

    "abstract": "in their motivations, such as protecting children, any barrier to information is ultimately harmful. The AAUP statement included as an appendix to Jones’s essay is the same one quoted by Gavin-Herbert as an example of the educational system’s brokenness, thus illustrating the wide range of perspectives presented in the first section. The book’s second section is composed of nine case studies involving trigger warnings. All case studies come from the world of higher education, and each presents a unique point of view. There are lessons learned from the inclusion of a trigger warning in an all-campus reading program. A student details the problems she faced after suggesting that a content warning be provided for a specific reading in future iterations of the course (and, modeling her own beliefs about the efficacy of content warnings, included one for her chapter). Two incidents at Smith College involving invited speakers (one who came; one who withdrew) provide an opportunity to go beyond trigger warnings and explore how arguments about academic freedom often ignore the motives of student activists and, in some cases, willfully misinterpret the desire for more engagement with a topic as a demand to be sheltered from ideas that prick their comfort. An instructor details the tools she uses in addition to trigger warnings when addressing traumatic topics in the classroom. One professor reflects on her successful use of content warnings throughout her career while another makes the case that her avoidance of such warnings has resulted in better learning outcomes for her students. Experiences with military veterans in the classroom cause two English faculty to consider adopting trigger warnings in the future. Public speaking courses are held up as an appropriate venue for trigger warnings. Finally, an instructor grapples with his internal conflict over using trigger warnings in graduate courses in library and information science, as the discipline’s enduring focus on intellectual freedom is not a natural complement to content warnings. Like the historical and theoretical essays in the first section, these case studies draw from such a breadth of experience and perspective that the reader is left with more questions than answers about trigger warnings. Spoken like a true librarian, Knox closes her introduction by stating that “readers will have to come to their own conclusions regarding the debate.” Indeed, on any topic, librarians aim to provide information and let the readers decide for themselves. In the case of trigger warnings, the question remains as to whether they interfere with a reader’s ability to make a determination without prejudice or whether they provide a necessary tool for those readers whose lived experiences have impacted the way they need to interact with information. After reading this book, it’s clear that the jury is still out. Knox should be commended for compiling such a compelling collection of essays and case studies that really forces the reader to think critically about trigger warnings.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article explores technological systems that dissimulate by design. Examples include untrustworthy hotel and workplace thermostats, digital applications to spy on workers and family members, and commercial and law-enforcement systems that surreptitiously collect mobile phone data. Rather than view such cases as exceptional, I argue that deceptive communication systems are hidden articulations of normal technological orders. If deception in itself is not the primary problem with such systems, then transparency alone cannot be the solution. As troubling as institutional opacity might be, an analysis of deceptive systems reveals more fundamental problems: imbalances in power and widespread acquiescence to corporate and state efforts to control individuals, groups, and their data. By moving beyond a quest for (or belief in) technological veracity, scholars could redirect attention to power inequalities and the pressing question of how to live together ethically.",

Microtargeting, used by political actors to send citizens tailored messages, could have the potential to overcome barriers that make generic political messages less effective. In this article, we present a small-scale field experiment, which serves as a case study to illustrate how microtargeting’s effects on citizens could be measured. The field experiment showed that receiving a microtargeted message via postal mail increased likelihood to vote for the microtargeting party, but this increase did not translate into actual votes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Innovation which is generated in a specific sector or prepared for it but finds application in others is called transsectorial innovation. This is a subject which, up to now, has attracted very little attention; yet it deserves a thorough examination. Indeed, the incidence of transsectorial migrations is very much on the increase and its impact on industry strongly felt: It generates a multiplicity of new products, causes changes in the location of production units and affects their organization. In this report, the concept of innovation is addressed and studied in depth, then looked at in the context of long‐term economic perspectives (I). Next the emergence of transsectorial innovations and their pervasive influence are described (II). Lastly, the effects on industry (size, location, organization, products) are examined (III). The industrial revolution which is beginning represents much more than what is generally expected. It will cause a complete upheaval, not only in the productive system, b...",

Yet for many older people lack of connectivity remains a challenge, and for those who do have access, skills and usage remain an issue. We report findings of an in-depth qualitative study of older people's perceptions of online communications and also their actual experiences. Findings indicate that older people who are already socially well connected benefit from online communication more than those who are not.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the state of Canada’s federal access to information (ATI) regime. Drawing from literature on government transparency, we conceptualize Bill C-58 and the problems it proposes to address as a form of policy discordance. We assess the recent digitization of ATI in Canada by analyzing data on request abandonment, record exemptions, as well as variation by ministry. In so doing, we identify tensions between strategic narratives of “open, honest, government” and recent changes brought about through legislative amendments. We conclude by problematizing notions of proactive disclosure, open government, and transparency as currently promoted in the Canadian federal context.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The expression “transborder data flows'’ (TBDF) is shorthand for a complex set of issues that have come to the forefront as a result of the electronic transfer or exchange of information across national boundaries. It involves the flow of digital information across borders for the storage or processing in foreign computers and reflects the interests of governments in regulating or otherwise intervening in the free flow of such exchanges for a variety of reasons including economic, social, political, and cultural. This paper provides an overview of these TBDF issues and discusses the policies and experiences of the U.S. National Library of Medicine pertaining to the transfer of biomedical information worldwide. Trends in the international interchange of all types of scientific and technical information are noted and the future of U.S. information policy is addressed.",

    "abstract": "This article complicates concepts of gender and race in virtual environments by presenting a case study of an African American woman's (Celie's) on-line personalities. It discusses how one woman's presence in a college class and her on-line contributions to a (cyber)community of peers influenced her and the group's perspectives on violence and gender issues. The article shows that Celie's interactions on a virtual forum are related to and an extension of a multitude of factors such as her upbringing, her schooling, her wish to succeed in an environment often inhospitable and hostile to her needs, and her gendered identity. A close analysis of her on-line voice provides a starting point for cyberfeminists to look more closely at virtual forums and their potential for enhancing student learning, diversity, and multiple perspectives in classroom environments. This article also encourages feminist scholars to continue explorations centered around the multiple discourse strategies employed by participants in any given conversation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Drawing on concepts rooted in cybernetics and anarchist political theory, this article argues that the shift in Occupy Wall Street from being a physical protest camp in late 2011 to an online movement in 2012 coincided with a shift in social media activity. Analysis of Facebook activity suggests a move from functional to anatomical hierarchy and a corresponding move from many-to-many communication to one-to-many communication. In conclusion, we argue that this development served to undermine the movement's anarchist principles of organization.",

    "abstract": "The need for those working in a variety of settings to interact effectively with technical experts has grown dramatically in recent years as computers have become essential to the performance of an increasing broad range of professional work. This article presents a case of this sort of interprofessional interaction, exploring the process and outcomes of collaboration between technical professionals and educators working to bring Internet access to an urban public school district. Drawing on field note and interview data, the case reported here illustrates how differences in institutional routines and professional values can generate differing agendas, contrasting assumptions, and contrasting expectations concerning project products and outcomes among collaborators from different professional worlds. In the case we describe, these differences affected such central matters as the types and usefulness of technical resources to which users had access as well as users' confidence in the technology. The case also illustrates how aspects of this interprofessional conflict were addressed through an organizational change. The kinds of issues that arose in this project are likely to occur in a variety of professional settings; therefore, examination of this case provides insight into a variety of issues and dynamics that should be considered when embarking upon or analyzing any interprofessional collaborative effort, and particularly one that involves technical professionals.",

    "abstract": "We develop a two-phased survey design—based on the uses and gratifications approach and the theory of planned behavior—to analyze competitive relations between search engines and traditional information sources. We apply the survey design in a large-scale empirical study with 14-to 66-year-old Internet users (mean age 32) to find out whether complementary or substitutional dependencies predominate between search engines and three traditional information sources—paper-based encyclopedias and yellow pages and telephone-based directory assistance. We find that search engines, compared to the traditional alternatives, are gratifying a wider spread of users' needs. Although yellow pages and directory assistance are potentially substitutable, encyclopedias serve those needs that search engines cannot (yet) fulfill. The traditional media companies face increased competition, but do not necessarily have to be in an inferior competitive position.",

The role of social capital in narrowing the digital divides has been frequently mentioned but few studies have empirically examined how various types of social capital may affect people's access and use of the Internet. Drawing on a two-wave national panel data set, this article aims to fill this gap. Results demonstrate that social capital facilitates Internet access and use. In particular resource-rich bonding social capital helps overcome the digital divides in access, general use, and online communication. Before the Internet can revitalize social capital, there must be the right social capital in place to close the digital divides. Highlighting the relationship between social connectivity and digital connectivity, the findings have important implications for policymakers and practitioners.",

It is argued that although a traditional field or disciplinary structure is not yet in place, the current interdisciplinary aggregations may have the makings of institutionalized academic units. Through comparison with the institutionalization of other interdisiciplinary areas of study (primarily that of communication and cultural studies), an argument is made for the need to create a firm intellectual foundation on which an Internet/studies can be built. Such a foundation should not only include sufficient and clear understanding of cognate fields but also include a foregrounding of power (as theoretical construct and practice) as a means of engaging the field in the world.",

    "title": "The Information Society, by Robert Hassan. Cambridge: Polity, 2008. xiii + 266 pp. $24.95 paper. ISBN 978-0-7456-4179-9 (paper)",
    "abstract": "In some ways, Robert Hassan’s The Information Society is decidedly anachronistic—picture an anthropomorphic edition of the book on a platform running after its missed train, which is filled with books investigating technology, cybernetics, and the cyborg—while in others it is strongly prescient and rather refreshing. Hassan’s critical analysis of the information society is admirably balanced as he follows the development of the information society from Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations in the 18th century to contemporary sources, among them Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Virilio, Noam Chomsky, and Naomi Klein. The central tenet of Hassan’s argument is that the information society has replaced the industrial society as a result of global neoliberal capitalist proliferation. “Information,” he says, “in the form of ideas, concepts, innovation and run-of-the-mill data on every imaginable subject—and replicated as digital bits and bytes through computerization—has replaced labour and the relatively static logic of fixed plant and machinery as the central organizing force of society” (23). The shift from the “static logic of fixed plant and machinery” to information production would not, apparently, be so bad except keeping up with information’s tendency to constantly accelerate has ill effects on humanity. Hassan points to what he calls “the ‘network effect’ that is expressed as an increasingly strong compulsion to be part of the information society” functioning as an ideological state apparatus and social normative influence to ensure that individuals are both made jealous of and goaded into envying others who possess the latest and flashiest new technology (2). The angst of this situation is nicely summed up a few pages later, where Hassan clarifies, through the illustrative example of paper mail (now pejoratively called “snail mail”) versus e(lectronic) mail, that the “network effect thus presents us with a choice: which is either to get connected and speed up your mode of communication—or be left behind” (9). The onset of “always on” technology has bereft humanity of its self-reflexivity and ability to think deeply, or essentially its ability to be, well, human. In his historical analysis, Hassan remarks upon the trend beginning with late-18th-century industrialization in Britain moving toward the Fordist method of production in the United States in the early 20th century. Fordism, which quickly became a global standard, viewed complete control of the production process as a given. Ownership of the materials of production, from the factory where goods were assembled and produced down to the mines and fields from which the raw materials were gathered, was a positive, even necessary, means for both quality and cost control. Technology, by which Hassan usually means computers or other networkable devices, was the inspiration for a shift in trend to operating a “weightless” method of industry, meaning that companies became less concerned about who was physically producing their products than about to whom and in what numbers they could sell them. This trend shift has the appearance of inevitability, but only through the effects of historicizing. Here Hassan is quick to remark that much good came during early industrialization, from the standardization of work-day hours to the legal age of employment. However, he expresses a feeling of skepticism that any such corrections are forthcoming to the information society; the ring of your new cell phone calls you, like Althusser’s (1968; 2004) police officer, to remind you that you always already were implicated. If Hassan’s argument seems anticapitalist, it is only in relation to capitalism’s tacit (if not overt) support of the information society as a method of corrupting humanity. It is difficult to say, given the equanimity of Hassan’s prose,",

    "abstract": "This article examines the theoretical assumptions generally used in communication and information policy studies, and suggests that more attention to the institutional determinants of public policies is needed. The first part discusses three alternative theoretical approaches: the interest-group approach, the ideological approach, and the technology-centered approach. The second part outlines the conceptual tools of the new institutionalism approach and discusses its application for the study of regime change in telecoms and media. The third part presents an abbreviated example of such application to the case of U.S. spectrum policies and the licensing of digital broadcasting. The conclusion suggests new directions for research aimed at broadening the set of social actors participating in the global governance of new technologies.",

    "title": "The Quality of Online and Offline Relationships: The Role of Multiplexity and Duration of Social Relationships",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that adolescents use the Internet not only to maintain social relationships with distant relatives and friends but also to create new relationships online; some of these friendships become integrated into their social circle. Research has focused mainly on the effect of the Internet on existing relationships or the nature of online-only ties, so studies comparing the quality of online and face-to-face relationships are missing. The goal of this study is to bridge this gap. In keeping with previous studies on social association, we argue that the quality of social relationships is dependent on duration and diversity of topics and activities carried together. Time is important, as it facilitates the development of a collective shared history and identity. Intimacy develops through the participation in shared activities and discussion of diverse issues of personal concern. Using a representative sample of the adolescent population in Israel, we find that closeness to a friend is a function of social similarity, content and activity multiplexity, and duration of the relationships. Friendships originated in the Internet are perceived as less close and supportive because they are relatively new and online friends are involved in less joint activities and less topics of discussion. The implications of the findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The researchers working on information society measures have recently started to consider how people use the Internet not only as a tool but also as a platform for social relations. As the ultimate objective of information society measures is to provide reliable guidelines for social policy, finding criteria for separating “positive” uses of Internet from “negative” ones is an important task. This article employs the concepts of communicative and strategic action as defined by Habermas for that purpose. A general conceptual typology of three communicative and three strategic social uses of Internet is offered, which can be applied to measure uses of any of the Internet's interactive services. A specific empirical application to social uses of personal web sites demonstrates that the deduced measurement instruments achieve satisfying levels of validity and reliability.",

Maps have always been an important tool, and in recent years computers and new information technologies have expanded the ways in which geographical data can be utilized. Technical specialists continue to develop increasingly flexible and powerful tools which allow emergency managers to examine multiple parameter scenarios treating both human-caused and natural disaster situations. The importance of establishing a coordination center and geographical information network, with appropriate computer support and staff expertise, is underscored in this discussion. 14 references.",

Traditional practices devised primarily to handle paper‐based record material are not readily extended to these new media. The Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Information Systems (ACCIS) identified the need for UN organizations to develop policies and procedures directly applicable to record material in electronic form. Developing such policies and procedures requires an understanding of the kinds of practices emerging within UN organizations as the use of electronic information and communication technologies grows. The survey reported here was undertaken to supply that understanding. The survey addresses four main content areas related to problems of records management in an electronic information environment: (1) the roles of three electronic media—telex, facsimile, and electronic mail—in organizational info...",

    "abstract": "The increasing need for faster, cheaper, and better logistical service has brought forwarders, carriers, and related services such as customs, banks, and handling companies closer together. This suggests a need to adjust coordination mechanisms. Neoclassical theory considers market-oriented coordination superior to hierarchic if the necessary information and communication can be handled. Since these tasks can be taken over by software instead of human agents, basic requirements seem to be fulfilled. This article outlines how market orientation can be realized in the field of air freight by applying easily accessible communication infrastructures and by considering qualitative aspects in price-finding mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Computer networks open new possibilities for scientific communication in terms of quality, efficiency, and rapidity. Consensus journals have the economy of invitational journals and the objectivity of journals based upon peer review. That is, all articles are published and the reader benefits from article selection based upon impartial refereeing. An additional benefit of consensus journals is that the negotiation process, which typically occurs prior to publication, is automated, thus saving efforts of participants. Readers submit reviews that evaluate articles on agreed dimensions. A statistical procedure is used to identify the most knowledgeable representative of each consensus position, and these persons are invited to submit articles that justify the review judgments they have submitted. A major advantage of this approach is the ability to develop reputation without article publication. The approach includes a protection mechanism based upon pseudonyms, which substitutes for the protection of anonym...",

    "abstract": "Abstract This is an appraisal of the impact that the mechanization of knowledge has had upon modern society, and a search for the driving force behind this mechanization. The investigation starts by examining the multimodal structure of social systems, giving special consideration to the discrete modal orders that are found in a civilized and humane society. It proposes a multimodal definition of information that determines the information requirements of such a society. A distinction is then suggested between information systems and information machines, followed by an inquiry into the historical roots that have urged society to rely increasingly upon information machines for knowledge while dismissing information systems. The discussion concludes with some social illustrations that show the effect of mechanistic information upon modern lives.",

    "title": "The Victorian Information Society: Surveillance, Bureaucracy, and Public Librarianship in 19th-Century Britain",
    "abstract": "Contrary to the \"retro\" image often awarded them, and despite their continuing enthusiasm and responsibility for the organization of printed materials, librarians are upbeat about the prospects of an information society driven primarily by electronic technologies, but in which libraries can play an important part. Public librarians detect a natural correlation between the historic democratic mission of their institution and the increased accessibility made possible by digitalized sources. The library community's acceptance of the information society idea as a \"given\" social phenomenon supports discourses that play down historical continuities and herald the dawn of a new age. Such discourses ignore or reject historical evidence that points to the existence of past information societies, revolutions, and infrastructures defined, in part, by the operation of indirect surveillance, constituted by the bureaucratic information systems of modernity. Victorian Britain serves as a good example of an early information society, to which public libraries, themselves micro-information societies, contributed significantly. The role played by public librarians in the Victorian information society, illustrated in this article by evidence drawn from the contemporary library press, is seen in their preoccupation with the surveillance and ordering of knowledge; their adoption for library operations of the businesslike, bureaucratic procedures described recently by business historians; and their panoptic tracking of users and their activities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adopting an agnotological perspective, this article extends the critical literature on APIs (application programing interfaces) by systematically showing that social media APIs are largely blind to acts of disconnectivity such as unfriending and unliking. We do this through analysis of the traces of social media usage that are not accessible through APIs as gleaned from the technical documentation published for developers by 12 major SNSs. Our findings make two main contributions. First, we show for the first time that APIs offer virtually no access to data about disconnectivity. Second, we show that APIs offer a very limited historical perspective, particularly regarding disconnectivity. However, for types of users that might spend money on advertising, far more historical and disconnectivity-oriented information is accessible through the API. This has practical consequences for research and contributes to an agnotology of social media that sheds critical light on the advertiser-friendly atmosphere of connectivity that social media try to create.",

    "abstract": "The chronic shortage of doctors in rural India seriously impacts the quality of health care available to villagers. In recent years, there has been considerable excitement in digital diagnostics as a possible answer to this situation by allowing non-doctors to diagnose and treat patients. In this article, the author focuses on one such diagnostic tool that has gained serious traction among transnational health foundations and state governments alike. The focus is on the customization and localization of this software through a pilot study in central Himalayas. A baseline survey and extensive interviews are conducted for categorization and population of health data content. This entailed analyzing the segmentation and transfer of health information on disease history and symptoms from the patient to the software as well as situating this study in the larger understanding of the healthcare system in this community. In doing so, the author argues that much of such health information is difficult to categorize and sufficiently vague to not provide for a confident diagnosis. Further, the data population of the treatment segment is deeply political and sociocultural. This article thereby problematizes the innate assumption underlying the design of such software, that it is possible to diagnose and treat patients based on pure information.",

We conducted in-depth interviews to empirically answer two questions: First, how do ultra-Orthodox women perceive their internet nonuse? Second, what direct and indirect solutions do they create to realize their desired capabilities that contemporarily require internet access? We found that adhering to religious strictures means more than obedience to religious commitments and community leaders, and that while nonuse may seem like a self-imposed disenabling act, it holds valuable social advantages at the individual, family, and community levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates how an account of hidden, internal properties of an everyday technology became a framework to interpret human action as a serious crime. Using a case study situated in the New York subway system, I examine the criminalization of a practice of New York’s poor known as “selling swipes” performed by so-called “swipers”. A high court came to classify the practice as felony forgery, interpreting it though an expert-witness account of how objects physically manipulated by swipers interact with a secretive, proprietary digital information system. Thousands of felony arrests – overwhelmingly of nonwhite men – have been legitimated under this theory, in which the crime occurs on a plane of technical interactions to which swipers have no access. Through close examination of the underlying technology (known as MetroCard), however, I show considerable problems in the authorities’ understanding of the technology, illustrating the hazards of interpreting human action through proprietary or complex systems, especially as they are represented solely through expert accounts. The case demonstrates fresh connections between technology and unequal outcomes in the U.S. criminal justice system, and suggests an emerging form of social vulnerability, to interpretations of our actions through the logic of technologies black-boxed to us.",

Lessig defines four classes of regulators, forces that control and define systems such as the Internet. They are markets, architectures, norms, and laws. We propose that a “democratic regulator” is a force that serves to enhance civil or political liberties. And we argue by example that there are democratic (and, indeed, anti-democratic) regulators that control aspects of cyberspace. Expressing the democratic effects of the Internet in this manner may prove useful for future comparisons across existing Internet and democracy theories, especially in the realm of quantitative analyses.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT U.S. advocacy for increased international intellectual property protection and a free and open Internet has been criticized as being inconsistent at best and hypocritical at worst. Placing U.S. copyright and Internet policy in a historical context and using Susan Strange's concepts of structural power and knowledge structures, we argue that copyright and Internet policies cannot be analyzed in isolation, but are intimately and inextricably linked forms of knowledge regulation. All knowledge regulation policies involve balancing access and restriction. Our analysis suggests that the current U.S. policy of Internet freedom and strong copyright protection represents a particular, historically situated strategy designed to exert structural power in the global information economy: Free flow of information creates markets by exposure to intellectual properties, while copyright secures economic benefit to copyright holders from the flow. We argue that a full and honest debate over issues of information access requires acknowledgment of contemporary and conflicting values, with the realization that different societies and interests will weigh access and dissemination differently. Recognizing as legitimate and incorporating these different perspectives into the global governance structures of the Internet comprise the key challenge facing those who favor truly democratic global Internet governance.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the 1990s the aphorism “information wants to be free” reigned supreme, limiting our thinking in consequential ways. In actuality this aphorism was a fragment of a much more nuanced statement by Steward Brand, who also talked about “information wants to be expensive.” It seemed for quite a while that there was no resolution to the contradiction: information as both free and expensive. Eventually Web 2.0 resolved this contradiction by providing an architecture where information could be both free and expensive. Web 2.0 was not a product of technological advances: social media, wikis, big data platforms, and so forth. It was borne out of the understanding that free information on media platforms could yield profitable data on users. This article lays bare the discursive moves through which this understanding came about.",

New technologies such as computer networking have given Canadians greater opportunities to directly participate in the information age.

I argue that drivers’ informal, long-standing parking associations, located at well-defined parking spots and based on kinship relations, act as the socio-spatial installed base of Phnom Penh’s tuk tuk infrastructure. I show that two recent infrastructural changes – the increased popularity of ride-hailing applications and “Indian-style” tuk tuks – have made traditional tuk tuk driving more precarious. I show how the parking associations help traditional drivers manage the negative consequences of infrastructural changes. My analysis indicates that parking associations with their kinship bonds, experience, and geographical positioning put established drivers in a privileged position in relation to new independent drivers using digital tools. In effect, while long-standing associations can be effective tools of subversion to platform economies, they also produce barriers to inclusive solidarity.",

    "abstract": "It is a truism among academics that most of the creative work at a conference happens outside the formal sessions, at social gatherings. If this is so, why not drop the formal sessions entirely? In this article, I propose a method for making an entire conference into a formalized social gathering, with a structure that both encourages the exchange of ideas and also records the evolution of thought. In this method, named “Ludium,” games replace presentations as the unifying element. Theme-appropriate games unlock creative juices and allow for soft entry points for networking. A conference meta-game elicits common views about the standing of ideas. A rapid review session concludes the conference and summarizes major points. Past experience with conferences in this vein indicates that indeed a great deal of solid academic work gets done. Moreover, everyone has fun, and the results of the conference, the “sense of the group,” can easily and immediately be broadcast to the public. All of these outcomes stand in stark contrast to the outcome of typical academic conferences.",

Drawing on Marx's understanding of the circulation of value within the capitalist economy as a whole and his concepts of unproductive labor, subsumption of labor, costs of circulation, commercial capital, and primitive accumulation, we analyze the economic relationships of Web 2.0 capital, proposing that revenues from advertising come from value produced in non-Web 2.0 sectors of the economy. On this basis we critique both Fuchs's and Arvidsson and Colleoni's positions on the origin of value in Web 2.0 and recognize some of the difficulties and contradictions of the advertising model as a form of monetization of free services for Web 2.0 capital.",

Such theorists often overlook or discount the liberating aspects of information systems. In this study, we apply the ideal of rational discourse developed by Jürgen Habermas to the phenomenon of Wikipedia in an effort to explore empirically the emancipatory potential of information systems. We contend that Wikipedia embodies an approximation of the necessary conditions for rational discourse. While several challenges persist, the example of Wikipedia illustrates the positive potential of information systems in supporting the emergence of more emancipatory forms of communication. The corresponding implications for researchers and design professionals alike are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Along with informed consent, anonymization is an accepted method of protecting the interests of research participants, while allowing data collected for official statistical purposes to be reused by other agencies within and outside government. The Decennial Census, carried out in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, is a major event in the production of research data and provides an important resource for a variety of organizations. This article combines ethical evaluation, a review of relevant law and guidance, and analysis of 30 qualitative interviews (carried out during the period of the 2001 UK Census), in order to explore the adequacy of the current framework for the protection of informational privacy in relation to census data. Taking account of Nissenbaum's concept of “contextual integrity,” Vedder's concept of “categorical privacy,” and Sen's call to heed of the importance of “actual behavior,” it will be argued that the current “contractarian” view of the relationship between an individual participant and the organization carrying out the Census does not engage sufficiently with actual uses of data. As a result, people have expectations of privacy that are not matched by practice and that the current normative—including the governance—framework cannot capture.",

    "abstract": "In the reconciliation of rational-choice and social-influence approaches to media choice offered here, the choice process is decomposed into two subprocesses. In the first subprocess—that of rational choice—decisional ambiguity frustrates complete optimization. Optimization is partial, yielding a set of effectively interchangeable media alternatives over which the user is indecisive. In the second subprocess—that of social influence—imitation, deference, and other cues act on the set of interchangeables, yielding a single ultimate choice. If in the social-influence subprocess there are benefits to coordinating with others, group choice crystallizes around a single media alternative. If these benefits are absent, individual choice remains idiosyncratic, with each decision maker making random choices within the set of interchangeables. In organizational life, media choice transpires sequentially, with each choice conditioning a succeeding one. In its dynamic form, the present model explicitly incorporates such sequential environments: The twofold choice process transpires iteratively within individual decision sites (in the multiple purchasing decisions of a committee, for example) and sequentially across decision sites (from committee to individual, for example). The model generates considerable empirical implications. As decisional ambiguity grows, the rational-choice component of the choice process shrinks, implying upper-bound conditions for the explanatory power of rational-choice statistical models.",

    "title": "The Evolution of Agency: Spectra of Bioagency and Cyberagency",
    "abstract": "This article examines nonhuman agency, or the capacity of nonhumans to carry out goal-directed action. The central argument is that agency should be conceptualized not as a binary (someone/something does or does not have agency) but rather as a spectrum, with degrees of agency. Based upon an empirical study of the design and use of frog dissection simulations (cyberfrogs) in high school biology classes, the author develops two parallel spectra of agency, bioagency and cyberagency, to describe the degrees of agency experienced by biological life forms and technologies. These spectra put agency into an evolutionary perspective, comparing how humans evolved agency over time to how technologies are now evolving agency. The article concludes with challenges for future research to further explore the validity and implications of a notion of cyberagency that evolves over time, can be represented on an analog spectrum, and is independent of human agency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores some of the tensions that exist between information and religion. Attention is drawn to the concern which is sometimes voiced that the saving transformation which religious teachings variously purport to offer, may be indefinitely postponed by a preoccupation with information. To counteract this possibility, religions act as information‐limiting devices by focusing the individual's attention on a level of concern consonant with the fundamental changes which they seek to bring about. Paradoxically, though, both the nature of the questions asked at this level and the experiences that underlie the authority of the answers that religions give, make it difficult (from a logical point of view) to set limits on the amount of information that might be considered religiously relevant. Reference is made to the important role of silence in religious traditions and to a modem call for the reintroduction of silence into communication, in order to counter “information pollution.” Such dem...",

    "abstract": "Information systems (IS) ironically has no real, long-standing, philosophical depth or roots in a philosophy of information or of technology, but philosophy itself has largely marginalized these subjects. Therefore this article provides a mutual updating, and argues for an integration of concepts, especially of information with that of knowledge, not least to make information and knowledge developments and applications researchable and discussable on a consistent basis. The article points to the too-unquestioned role of data and information in a digitizing, globalizing age, and illustrates the need for a philosophy and ethic of information, able then to inform engineering ethics and design. In particular, the article argues that with technological developments and their penetration into work systems such as they are, knowledge has become a key, under-researched and under-philosophized concept for the IS field, and that this needs to be rebalanced. Here we suggest an integrative framework, and then argue for the key, at the moment largely misunderstood, role Polanyi's work can have in reconceptualizing and studying knowledge in the IS field.",

    "abstract": "Three arguments are raised in this article with regard to the indices used to measure the digital divide. First, I criticize policymakers who rely on simplistic measures of the digital divide, at the expense of a thoughtful analysis of (1) the purpose of the tool, (2) the level of observation, and (3) the method of approaching the data. Second, I argue that networks and associated technologies are not neutral artifacts but are political and social spaces in their structure as well as in their content levels. Accordingly, we need to factor in the context as an important actor in conceptualizing and measuring the digital divide. Third, two general types of indices are used for the measurement of the digital divide(s): focused monotopical indices and comprehensive indices. Monotopical indices are more widely available, while comprehensive ones are rare. I argue that policymakers need to promote comprehensive indices over monotopical indices. Finally, I present a conceptual definition of the digital divide and a framework for developing a comprehensive index to measure it.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Statistics have long shaped the field of visibility for the governance of development projects. The introduction of big data has altered the field of visibility. Employing Dean's “analytics of government” framework, we analyze two cases—malaria tracking in Kenya and monitoring of food prices in Indonesia. Our analysis shows that big data introduces a bias toward particular types of visualizations. What problems are being made visible through big data depends to some degree on how the underlying data is visualized and who is captured in the visualizations. It is also influenced by technical factors such as distance between mobile phone towers and the truth claims that gain legitimacy.",

    "title": "Knowledge Management: A Threefold Framework",
    "abstract": "It is widely claimed by a number of business and academic gurus that in order for organizations to have a lasting competitive advantage they will have to be knowledge driven. If knowledge is viewed as a resource that is critical to an organization's survival and success in the global market, then like any other resource it demands good management. However, the bulk of organizations still have not approached knowledge management (KM) activity formally or deliberately. The cause for this inattention could be that most organizations are still struggling to comprehend the KM concept. To ease the struggle, the fundamental issue of identifying salient characteristics of KM phenomena needs to be addressed. This article helps address this need by introducing a threefold descriptive framework that identifies and characterizes the main elements of KM phenomena and their relationships. The first component provides a generic description of an organization's knowledge resources. A second component introduces elemental knowledge manipulation activities an organization performs in dealing with those resources. The third component identifies major influences that impact an organization's conduct of KM. Results of a survey to assess the framework are reported. They indicate general satisfaction with the framework.",

A summary of the growth and development of religion online is presented along with an overview of how religion has been approached and studied on the Internet. This review shows what CMC studies of religion might offer in approaching research questions related to authority, identity construction, and community online. It calls for recognition of the contribution, and possibilities that underrepresented areas within interdisciplinary research, like religion, might offer Internet studies as a whole.",

We suggest that an analytical framework highlighting the relational thinking in practice theories can serve as a tool to sort through the literature on knowledge sharing. First, we delineate a relational framework consisting of seven attributes associated with a practice theory. Second, we use this framework to analyze a narrow set of practice theories represented by three seminal works on communities of practice. Third, we compare and contrast the relational dynamics found in the three seminal works in regard to how they conceptualize knowledge sharing within and across communal boundaries.",

    "abstract": "This article asks two related questions: Is digital media studies a discipline, and should scholars within the field desire to move toward disciplinarity? Drawing on the writings of Michel Foucualt and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as several Anglo-American cultural studies of disciplinarity, the essay argues that digital media studies has not yet constituted a truly novel scholarly discourse. Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing—to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline—would be largely strategic. Given that the field is already successfully reproducing itself, the symbolic benefits of becoming a discipline are relatively limited, and such a move would also have significant intellectual costs.",

    "title": "Social Networks and the Success of Market Intermediaries: Evidence From the U.S. Residential Real Estate Industry",
    "abstract": "Market intermediaries are usually thought of as bringing together buyers and sellers. However, intermediaries may also connect these principals with other professionals who can provide assistance with and support for the transaction. We address the question of which set of ties—to buyers and sellers or to other professionals—are more important to the success of market intermediaries, using data from the U.S. residential real estate industry. From a national survey of 525 real estate agents, we find that ties to other professionals are more important than ties to buyers and sellers as predictors of the market intermediary's income, counter to the general wisdom about real estate in particular and market intermediaries more generally. We suggest that the professional networks around market intermediaries may behave like “quasi-firms” helping buyers and sellers navigate complex market transactions.",

The forecast is that, in information societies, the threshold between online and offline will soon disappear, and that once there is no difference, we shall become not cyborgs but rather inforgs, that is, connected informational organisms.",

    "abstract": "Recent controversies surrounding privacy have sparked a move by regulators toward the idea of privacy by design (PbD), a concept pioneered by Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian. Industry has also started to recognize the importance of taking privacy seriously, with various PbD corporate initiatives currently underway. However, some commentators have criticized PbD for being too vague. Using three case studies and a range of best practice examples of PbD, privacy impact assessments (PIAs), and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), this article addresses the gap between the abstract principles of PbD and their operationalization into more concrete implementation guidelines for software engineers.",

    "abstract": "To answer the question in the title, the author divides a sample of developing countries according to whether they have experienced a rise or fall of the (absolute) digital divide in the Internet. He suggests that in countries where the divide is falling, incomes will tend to be relatively high, and vice versa in the case of a rising divide. This relationship is examined on the basis of simple regression analysis; the analysis indicates the hypothesis is true with a high level of significance. Interpretation of the findings is carried out mainly in relation to countries from Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. In short, recent changes in the digital divide are associated with global inequality rather than equality, although there are some important anomalies that need to be explained.",

Nonetheless, many individuals still reap few or no benefits from these technologies, and there are resilient gaps in their use. Within this larger context, the authors examine the Internet digital divide between people with and without disabilities from a multidimensional approach. Rather than analyzing the gap in terms of “haves” and “have-nots,” a range of Internet-related dimensions—affordability, motivation and attitudes, skills, usage, and others—is taken into account.",

    "abstract": "This article presents evidence that--alongside the successes-- many information systems in developing countries can be categorized as failing either totally or partially. It then develops a new model that seeks to explain the high rates of failure. The model draws on contingency theory in order to advance the notion of design-actuality gaps: the match or mismatch between IS designs and local user actuality. This helps identify two high-risk archetypes that affect IS in developing countries: country context gaps and hard-soft gaps. The model is also of value in explaining the constraints that exist to local IS improvisations in developing countries. Overall, the article shows how model and theory help understand IS cases in developing countries, and equally, how those cases provide valuable data to help develop IS models and theories.",

The argument mobilizes theories of social rationalization from Max Weber to contemporary critical theory to demonstrate that the appearance of automated profiles (socialbots) on social networking platforms can be seen as a logical step in the progressive enclosure of online social interaction in standardized, simplified, and trivialized forms, frames, and gestures. Critical questions concerning what the growth of robo-sociality may mean for individual users and the online public sphere are posed with a view to charting the directions for a needed public debate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Growth of gig work – short-term tasks organized and mediated by digital labor platforms such as Uber and Upwork – is the focus for an increasing body of research. Yet there has been a lack of systematic frameworks that could evaluate this type of labor against decent work standards, and inform consumers and others about relative adherence to those standards across platforms and sectors. In this article we report the development of the “Fairwork framework”, based on five decent work principles of fair pay, conditions, contracts, management, and representation. The framework and its associated methodology were first field-tested in South Africa and we report on its use to rate seven gig economy platforms. A league table of platforms was widely publicized and one platform was persuaded to improve working conditions. We reflect on the use and content of the framework, and its role in future action research on decent gig work.",

    "abstract": "A common phenomenon in online discussion groups is the individual who baits and provokes other group members, often with the result of drawing them into fruitless argument and diverting attention from the stated purposes of the group. This study documents a case in which the members of an online community--a feminist web-based discussion forum--are targeted by a \"troll\" attempting to disrupt their discussion space. We analyze the strategies that make the troller successful and the targeted group largely ineffectual in responding to his attack, as a means to understand how such behavior might be minimized and managed in general. The analysis further suggests that feminist and other nonmainstream online forums are especially vulnerable, in that they must balance inclusive ideals against the need for protection and safety, a tension that can be exploited by disruptive elements to generate intragroup conflict.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a paucity of granular, high-resolution broadband data in the United States, which limits the prospects of informed telecommunications policy debates. In the absence of regulation requiring telecommunication providers to accurately report service footprints, pricing, and service quality data, providers refuse to disclose this information, routinely citing competition as the primary reason for keeping network and pricing data obfuscated. In addition, many secondary datasets needed for broadband planning and policy research, such as parcel or address point data, are equally challenging to gather. These datasets are often controlled by county governments, with no overarching access policy, resulting in neighboring counties with widely divergent policies for the release of these important data. In this article we explore the challenges of open data and its impacts on telecommunication policy development. A recent project which explored the spatial provision of Google Fiber in the Kansas City metropolitan area helps to highlight these difficulties. Basic strategies for mitigating information asymmetries and the lack of data transparency for telecommunication policy analysis are discussed.",

    "title": "Data by design: Shaping data-producing subjectivities through self-tracking",
    "abstract": "Abstract Recent research into self-tracking devices challenges dominant understandings that such technologies provide wearers with “mechanical objectivity” over their monitoring of their bodies, instead highlighting how the so-called “objectivity” is situated within broader social contexts. In this article we explore the social phenomena arising from the introduction of multiple sensor technologies (activity trackers, productivity monitoring software, and video cameras) in Hong Kong secondary school classrooms within the context of an interdisciplinary research project on digital citizenship. Using participant observation of social interactions between the school students and the research team amidst the implementation of self-tracking technologies in the classroom, our study documents the negotiations surrounding the generation of self-tracking data. It shows how shortcomings in self-tracking data produced call into question persistent expectations of objectivity attached to self-tracking devices, alongside hopes that their use would engender specific forms of engagement with data amongst students. In response, we propose the concept of “data producing subjectivities” as a complement to the existing concept of “situated objectivity.” Taken together, these concepts could contribute to scholarship beyond the realm of self-tracking, providing ways to more fully account for the co-constitutive nature of the production of data and personhood in the contemporary information era.",

It identifies 4 behavioral types – serious trolling (not funny and ideologically motivated), humorous trolling, serious non-trolling behaviors, and humorous non-trolling – and 7 behavioral dimensions – meaningfulness, representativeness, pseudo-sincerity, intentionality, provocativeness, repetition, and satire. Employing Formal Concept Analysis it charts relationships between behavioral types and dimensions and develops a typology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As access to the Internet has become increasingly essential for social and economic participation, public domain Internet measurements have become indispensable for users to validate quality of service their network operator delivers and for policymakers to identify and address gaps in broadband infrastructure. This article evaluates public domain Internet performance measurements available for assessing the state of connectivity and developing universal access service quality standards in Canada. The analysis suggests that different approaches to Internet measurement represent complementary windows into a complex and fast evolving reality of broadband connectivity. Despite their potential shortcomings, large-scale crowdsourced open data network testing platforms have a central role to play in enabling broadband infrastructure policy coordination across different levels of government, empowerment of consumers, and achievement of universal service objectives for quality of service users experience when accessing the open Internet.",

    "title": "Beyond the Inner City: Real and Imagined Places in Creative Place Policy and Practice",
    "abstract": "As the economic and social benefits of creative industries development become increasingly visible, policymakers worldwide are working to create policy drivers to ensure that certain places become or remain “creative places.” Richard Florida's work has become particularly influential among policymakers, as has Charles Landry's. But as the first wave of creative industrial policy development and implementation wanes, important questions are emerging. It is by now clear that an “ideal creative place” has arisen from creative industries policy and planning literature and that this ideal place is located in inner cities. In this article, the authors shift focus away from the inner city to where most Australians live: the outer suburbs. They report on a qualitative research study into the practices of outer-suburban creative industries workers in Redcliffe, Australia, arguing that the accepted geography of creative places requires some recalibration once the material and experiential aspects of creative places are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article offers a short history of the transformation of time signals into a fundamental stability around which new communication infrastructures are built. These infrastructures include the Network Time Protocol, the Global Positioning System, and high-frequency trading. This article argues that “high-resolution time” can serve as a useful analytic framework for understanding the making and appropriation of contemporary temporal standards. Contemporary temporal infrastructures—the systems of time measurement and dissemination that subtend communication infrastructures—are based on the vibrations of caesium atoms, which act as fixed points. A focus on resolution aligns an analysis with the ways that time standards are, in practice, treated as both infrastructures and texts. High-resolution time, therefore, offers an understanding of time as a scalable resource built through contingent media practices.",

    "abstract": "Information and communications technologies (ICT) are becoming pervasive in the residential real-estate industry and their usage is affecting the work lives of real-estate agents. Drawing on data from a regional study of the residential real-estate industry in the United States, we focus on the disintermediation or, more accurately, the reintermediation of real-estate agents in the sales process. Using data collected from interviews, direct observation, and archival records, we examine how real-estate agents are (1) taking advantage of new ICT in their work, and (2) protecting themselves from others wishing to displace their position in the real-estate value chain. Our analysis of this activity draws on two contrasting theoretical perspectives to illuminate the roles of residential real-estate agents: transaction cost and social capital. The results of this study provide insights into the ways in which ICT are used to build and draw on the social relationships that underpin the actual transactions, to help guide the process of buying/selling a house, and to invoke expertise as needed.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the implications of electronic monitoring systems for organizational information flows and worker control, in the context of the U.S. trucking industry. Truckers, a spatially dispersed group of workers with a traditionally independent culture and a high degree of autonomy, are increasingly subjected to performance monitoring via fleet management systems that record and transmit fine-grained data about their location and behaviors. These systems redistribute operational information within firms by accruing real-time aggregated data in a remote company dispatcher. This redistribution results in a seemingly incongruous set of effects. First, abstracted and aggregated data streams allow dispatchers to quantitatively evaluate truckers’ job performance across new metrics, and to challenge truckers’ accounts of local and biophysical conditions. Second, even as these data are abstracted, information about truckers’ activities is simultaneously resocialized via its strategic deployment into truckers’ social relationships with their coworkers and families. These disparate dynamics operate together to facilitate firms’ control over truckers’ daily work practices in a manner that was not previously possible. The trucking case reveals multifaceted pathways to the entrenchment of organizational control via electronic monitoring.",

    "abstract": "While the debate rages on the role of social media technologies in the initial days of the Egyptian revolution of 2011, a more relevant research question today is the role of social media within an increasingly contested and turbulent political sphere. This article identifies three key modes by which social media is being exploited to impact political power, and uncovers the salience of each of these through 2 years of multisited ethnographies and interviews. First, I argue that political actors across the political spectrum, from liberals to Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), are using technologies to build wider ranging, heterogeneous, and diverse networks of supporters, expanding their base from a more historically homogeneous core support group. Second, I argue that actors are working to build bridges between older and newer media platforms, recognizing that each platform is increasingly being shaped by the other. Finally, I describe some of the ways that technology is being used by activists to subvert their competition, promoting campaigns of misinformation and hacking at the expense of others.",

    "abstract": "This study examined how students who had no prior experience with videoconferencing would react to the use of videoconferencing as an instructional medium. Students enrolled in seven different courses completed a questionnaire at the beginning of the semester and again at the end of the semester. Students at the origination and remote sites did not differ in their reactions toward videoconferencing but there was a significant difference for gender. Women reacted less favorably to videoconferencing. Compared to the beginning of the semester, students reported significantly less positive attitudes toward taking a course through videoconferencing at the end of the semester. There were no significant differences in students' attitudes toward videoconferencing across courses at the beginning of the semester but there were significant differences across the courses at the end of the semester. The results suggest the need for better preparation for both students and instructors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely believed that the spread of data extraction technologies on the Internet has led to the erosion of traditional professional content providers and the transformation of the online media ecosystem. To investigate this shift in media ecology, we conduct relational analyses of actual user behavior, departing from existing research that primarily focuses on business institutions and designs of technology. We assess the prevalence of the data extraction business model by grouping websites along two architectural traits that afford data extraction – user content generation and curation – and analyzing how some website architectures get privileged in the web use ecosystem. Since data extraction is relational, we advocate a network measure to capture shared usage in addition to individual popularity of websites. Our analyses of world’s 850 most popular websites in 2009, 2011, and 2013 reveal that data extraction fostered a two-tier hierarchical web use ecosystem, marked by interdependence between professional content producers and data extractors. Our study thereby shows that the dynamics in play are more complicated than what is captured by explanations centered on either capabilities of platform giants or the decline of traditional journalism and media organizations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given China’s political conservativism and limited social acceptance of sexual minorities, it is paradoxical to find that Blued, a gay social app headquartered in Beijing, has become the largest app of this kind globally. Informed by the social construction of technology perspective and based on a yearlong ethnography, this article identifies three major factors that have shaped the developmental trajectory of Blued: (1) work with the Communist Party of China to employ Blued as a health education platform; (2) switch in orientation from a hookup app to a social app; and (3) push for the commercialization and internationalization of the app. This article spotlights that the voices of users were missing in the development process and argues that, for Blued to continue maintaining its success, it must stop relying on the “I-methodology” in its design and development. Lastly, it contributes to the SCOT scholarship and social app studies by deciphering the role of the state in app development in the Chinese context.",

I adopt the inter-referencing Asia approach to facilitate a conversation between the research on precarity in Beijing and Hong Kong contexts and the large body of literature on precarity that derives mainly from the Western experiences. I base my analysis on discourse analysis and visual analysis of three corpora of textual and visual materials, including materials from interviews and ethnographic research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In South Korea, the Advance Notice Legislation (ANL) system requires by law that a public announcement be issued on any proposed bill that is likely to affect the fundamental rights, duties, and/or daily life of the general public. By investigating the effects of public dissent submitted via the online ANL system in South Korea, this study attempts to address the critical issue of how to increase citizen participation in the political process and to offer a possible strategy that modern democratic governments can employ in this regard. The findings suggest that citizens will actively participate in the political process to make their voices heard when an appropriate participatory mechanism is available, but they will be more active if the administration encourages citizen participation with various policies and institutions. In other words, formal and informal institutions actively interact to affect the behavior of actors both within and outside the political arena.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The literature on trolling has viewed trolling as discrete instances of transgression undertaken by antagonistic individuals. We identify three main issues with current theorizations: diffuse definitions of “trolling,” blurred boundaries between trolling and other online anti-social behaviors, and the context dependency of trolling. To address these unresolved issues, we adopt a practice-based theoretical approach. Informed by this approach, we analyze trolling behaviors not as products of individuals' attitudes, values, and decisions, but rather as behaviors embedded within and occurring as part of social practices. Specifically, we conduct a practice-based theoretical analysis in a multi-site exploratory study involving online archival research and in-depth interviews with online community members. Based on this analysis, we propose that trolling be conceived as a constellation of three social practices: learning, assimilating, and transgressing. Also, we find that practices of trolling transgression can have a dual pro-social and anti-social impact in online communities.",

Recent development has been categorized by an explosion in new commercial activity. Despite overwhelming coverage in the popular press, relatively little is understood regarding the impact the Internet is having on firms that use this medium to facilitate commerce. Even less is understood about the impact on small enterprises-the largest segment of U.S., Japanese, and Western European businesses. This article reports the results of an exploratory study examining critical issues surrounding the use of the Internet in emerging enterprises. The survey (1) describes how small businesses develop and use their on-line sales presence, (2) explores factors that motivate firms to invest in electronic commerce, (3) assesses the importance of the expected benefits of an on-line sales presence on the decision to go on-line, and (4) examines some of the barriers that prevent sma...",

One hundred and fourteen undergraduate students were assigned to participate in one of two separate computer-based, bulletin-board-style discussion groups or \"forums\". In one forum, participants were identified by their real names while participants in the other were identified by self-chosen pseudonyms. Consistent with expectations, analyses of conference transcripts and pseudonym choices indicated that (1) women tended to mask their gender with their pseudonym choice while males did not, and (2) women in both forums generally tended to exhibit certain dimensions of social interdependence more frequently than men. These dimensions included references to others, references to self, and supporting statements. Contrary to expe...",

    "abstract": "Abstract The publishing market has gone through deep transformations in the last few years, and the emergence of new media actors like BookTubers has increased the complexity of this system. The article proposes understanding BookTuber practices based on an interface-centered approach that goes beyond the conventional studies of the “graphic user interface”. In the framework employed in the article, the “interface” is considered to be the place where different actors relate to each other and the process between them are carried out. The article also presents a map of the BookTuber interface and its tensions. This interface-centered approach, a work-in-progress, could also be applied to other practices.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Through interviews with migrants and migrant aid-workers at a shelter in the border town of Nogales, Mexico, we examine how undocumented migrants are seeking, acquiring, understanding, and using information prior to, and during, migration across the United States–Mexico border. Our study examines migrants' perceptions of humanitarian service and the use of so-called “border disturbance technologies” by activists to help prevent the death of migrants in the desert, finding that migrants appreciate water-caching efforts but generally distrust technologies they feel could subject them to surveillance by border agents. Exploratory in nature and based on a small sample, our findings are not necessarily representative of the broader population, but provide rich evidence of the prevalence of word-of-mouth information seeking and use of cell phones over other information technologies, and explore the ambivalent nature of information technology use in the vulnerable setting of life at the border. In particular, we find that mobile phones help migrants meet their communication needs, but also increase their exposure to crime and abuse.",

    "title": "Larger Than Life: Digital Resurrection and the Re-Enchantment of Society",
    "abstract": "New debates surrounding the digital remains of people who have died and the possibilities that new technologies raise in terms of symbolic immortality are generating significant interest. These issues provide exciting opportunities for sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists to further understand evolving attitudes to death and mourning. But what happens when the deceased is a popular media figure and the symbolic immortality extends to a digital resurrection played out through the media in new contexts and over an extended period of time? Drawing on sociological, anthropological, and cultural theory, this discursive article addresses some of the reasons for the perpetuation of media personalities whose posthumous careers often exceed their living careers, both in longevity and popularity. It is argued that digital technologies add a new dimension to the many parallels that can be drawn between celebrity culture and religion in what are becoming increasingly secularised societies. For many, digital technology and the Internet remain incomprehensible, leaving room for mythical and magical interpretations especially in relation to a prospect many prefer to deny: ultimate nonexistence. It is proposed that the disenchantment with religious belief, brought about by science and rational thought during the Enlightenment era, leaves many people with inadequate or unacceptable ways of understanding death and mourning. Ironically, it seems that science and new technology now provide the fuel for a re-enchantment of society, and the now normalized suspension of disbelief inherent in the consumption of media entertainment and popular culture helps to facilitate this process.",

    "abstract": "In general, rhetoric and myth play important roles in policymaking. Myths may inspire collective action but may also mystify and blur views on reality. In this article we identify, analyze, and reflect on the myths underlying the e-government programs of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Netherlands. We found that in all national policies myths of technological inevitability, a new and better government, rational information planning, and empowerment of the intelligent citizen can be discerned. Although the mobilizing powers of these myths are acknowledged, we conclude that existing empirical studies have generated little support for the inescapable telos of these myths, which makes canvas cleaning effects of e-government initiatives less likely.",

    "abstract": "New media studies are now benefiting from a burgeoning of empirical studies and theoretical analyses from diverse academic disciplines seeking to locate new media, especially the Internet, within longstanding traditions of social science research. By reviewing and reflecting upon findings from UK Children Go Online, a multimethod research project examining the role of the Internet in children's and young people's everyday lives, the present article takes the opportunity to draw out some general conclusions, and associated puzzles, to guide future research. These contribute toward an emerging framework for understanding questions regarding new media access, use, and consequences within the social, cultural, and political parameters of young people's lives. A range of research findings are discussed that illuminate the shifting balance of opportunities and risks posed by the Internet for children, youth, and the family.",

    "abstract": "In this article we identify four principal dimensions of religious fundamentalism as they interact with the Internet: hierarchy, patriarchy, discipline, and seclusion. We also develop the concept of cultured technology, and analyze the ways communities reshape a technology and make it a part of their culture, while at the same time changing their customary ways of life and unwritten laws to adapt to it. Later, we give examples for our theoretical framework through an empirical examination of ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel. Our empirical study is based on a data set of 686,192 users and 60,346 virtual communities. The results show the complexity of interactions between religious fundamentalism and the Internet, and invite further discussions of cultured technology as a means to understand how the Internet has been culturally constructed, modified, and adapted to the needs of fundamentalist communities and how they in turn have been affected by it.",

Users can, for example, engage in political advocacy, receive counseling, and perform commercial transactions without disclosing their identities. The cloak of anonymity can also facilitate socially unacceptable or criminal activities because of the difficulty in holding anonymous users accountable. This article reports the results of a conference on anonymous communication organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among the findings were that online anonymous communication is morally neutral; that it should be considered a strong human and constitutional right; that online communities should be allowed to set their own policies on the use of anonymous communication; and that individuals should be informed about the extent to which their identity is disclosed online. The article discusses how anonymous communications can be shaped by the law, education, and public awareness, and highlights the ...",

The home has served as a key locus for this interaction. By distinguishing inside from outside, the home supports the allocation of particular behaviors and information to different areas, both physical and virtual. This article explores how different technologies, including structural elements, have affected and reflected over time the boundary represented by the home and how that boundary has helped shape the construction of privacy in the West. This illustrates how privacy might be conceptualized as a social condition arising from the interaction of various boundaries, including the principal one separating the public and the private.",

    "abstract": "Time is affected significantly by the spread of the Internet throughout the world. On the one hand, the new communication technologies provide for \"round-the-clock\" operation, threatening to obliterate time as a function of a culture's sense of identity. On the other hand, the Internet enables local cultures to resist the globalizing and homogenizing tide. The situation points to a dilemma. Local cultures find it hard to resist integrating itself with the world through the Internet, but at the same time they feel a real need to protect and to promote their identities. This article tries to show that local cultures find the medium an appropriate and effective one in putting forward their agenda. As the globalizing force signified by the Internet tends to occur at a superficial level, different conceptions of time can coexist at the same time. The emerging conception of time is thus characterized neither by the premodern one of identification of time with nature, nor by the modern one of an abstract entity pointing forward, but by a \"web\" allowing for different strands to go their own way while weaved together to create a coherent pattern, and this is how the dilemma is resolved. A case study of the Thai conceptions of time and the current debate on changing the time standard is presented in order to illustrate the point.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 35 years, centralized universal-number (in the United States, 9-1-1) systems have come to be the preferred means of emergency-response dispatching. The creation of these systems has motivated the development of information systems that render the landscape, to those with the right access, increasingly legible. This has been to the benefit of those receiving emergency services, but also to the benefit of police and commercial interests, who have used the improved infrastructure as bases for the creation of geodemographic and other profiling systems. More recently, the creation of wireless telephony has motivated the creation of a further surveillance infrastructure built on and integrated into that landscape. One consequence has been the commercialization of the systems in ways that permit the incorporation of more intimate and detailed data into preexisting systems. Public concern with locational surveillance systems has focused on privacy. However, “privacy” may be an inadequate frame through which to understand these issues and to fashion appropriate responses.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method for the automatic identification of communities of practice from e-mail logs within an organization. We use a betweenness centrality algorithm that can rapidly find communities within a graph representing information flows. We apply this algorithm to an initial e-mail corpus of nearly 1 million messages collected over a 2-month span, and show that the method is effective at identifying true communities, both formal and informal, within these scale-free graphs. This approach also enables the identification of leadership roles within the communities. These studies are complemented by a qualitative evaluation of the results in the field.",

    "title": "The Community Network Lifecycle: A Framework for Research and Action Special Issue: ICTs and Community Networking",
    "abstract": "Since the publication of Doug Schuler’s influential book New Community Networks: Wired for Change (1996), community networking has gained definition and momentum as a sociotechnical phenomenon in the U.S. and elsewhere. It has emerged as a research field of enviable vitality as well. This special issue is focused on a neglected but fundamental research question: How do community networks originate, stabilize, and change in their sociohistorical context? I use the term here to refer to systems enabled by information and communications technologies (ICTs) and “intended to help revitalize, strengthen, and expand existing people-based networks” (Schuler, 1996) in locality-based (geographically grounded) human communities. Social activism is an important motif in community networking (Schuler, 1996). I include community technology centers under community networks (the papers in this special issue cover both modes) on the reasoning that, despite differences in emphasis, both modes (see Beamish, 1999) help foster social networking. The framework developed here is grounded in theories of community social organization and is attentive to the social and historical context within which the community network lifecycle—origin, stabilization, and transformation—plays out. Community networks must be analyzed as artifacts shaped within particular systems of social organization (or social structure), and it is here that explanations for variations in technological form and function must be sought. They develop in the “ordered arrangements of relations” (Wellman, 1997) between individuals, groups, and organizations that describe community social structure. They are embedded in these relations; their constitution and ongoing operation are shaped by them. The network may change these relations as it matures as a social object, but the starting point for an adequately historicized and socialized account of the lifecycle would have to be in community social structure. The starting point, in other words, is community (see Calhoun, 1998) or, rather, locality-based community. Community has many meanings. A common sociological focus has been on social organization and activity based in a specific locality. This special issue is concerned with such communities as defined historically, by administrative fiat and/or economic activity. Communities analyzed here range from an urban housing complex (see articles by Pinkett & Hampton in this issue) to a region in south India (Blattman et al., this issue). While community size is important, one may, for a number of reasons, choose to analyze “federated” communities made up of smaller member units. Social life in these units, or even in the larger community as a whole, may evidence the kind of organic unity and intimacy celebrated in Tonnies’ gemeinschaft type. More typically, however, communities are diverse in their social makeup and relations. Community constituents— residents, organizations, groups—may participate in a variety of ties in their daily life. These may be “directly interpersonal . . . and mediated” or indirect (Calhoun, 1998). Some ties may engage a single facet of a constituent (a casual business exchange, for example), while others may involve multiple (see primary and secondary relationships in Calhoun); they may be formal or informal, established or emergent, strong or weak (Granovetter, 1973), intraor extra-local in scope (Warren, 1978). This aggregate, emergent social network describes community social structure. To understand a community is to understand “the interplay of these . . . webs” (Warren, 1999). Arguing their centrality in community life, some (e.g., Laumann, Galazkiewicz, & Marsden, 1978) have characterized community structure more narrowly to refer to inter-organizational relations. The idea of social structure offers the following viewpoints for analyzing locality-based community. First, analytically, structure pre-exists action and both enables and constrains it (Archer, 1995). However, action is not",

    "title": "Strong, Weak, and Latent Ties and the Impact of New Media",
    "abstract": "This article argues that consideration of the strength of ties between communicators can help reconcile disparate results on the impact of new media on social relations. It is argued from the research literature and studies by the author that where ties are strong, communicators can influence each other to adapt and expand their use of media to support the exchanges important to their tie, but where ties are weak, communicators are dependent on common, organizationally established means of communication and protocols established by others. Due to this differential use of media, a new medium that adds means and opportunities for previously unconnected others to communicate will have positive effects on weak ties and weak-tie networks, in particular by laying an infrastructure of latent ties (ones that exist technically but have not yet been activated), and providing an opportunity for weak ties to develop and strengthen. A new medium may also have positive effects on strongly tied pairs where it adds another means of communicating and supports the communication needs and tasks of the pair. However, where a new medium replaces a former, common means of communication, the dependence of weak ties on a common medium makes weak-tie networks highly susceptible to dissolution. In contrast, strong-tie networks, with their connections via multiple relations and multiple media, can be expected to be more robust under conditions of change.",

    "abstract": "Modern information systems not only capture a seemingly endless amount of transactional data, but also tend to retain it for indefinite periods of time. We argue that privacy policies must address not only collection and access to transactional information, but also its timely disposal. One unintended side effect of data retention is the disappearance of social forgetfulness, which allows individuals a second chance, the opportunity for a fresh start in life. We examine three domains in which social policy has explicitly recognized the importance of such a principle: bankruptcy law, juvenile crime records, and credit reports. In each case, we frame the issue in terms of the social benefits of forgetfulness, rather than in terms of individual privacy protection. We examine how different policy approaches to privacy might handle the retention of data and propose a comprehensive policy that includes a variety of strategies. The broad conclusion of the article is that data retention and disposal should be addressed as a part of a broader and comprehensive policy approach, rather than in a piecemeal fashion or as an afterthought.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The importance of intellectual capital in the digital economy implies an increasingly central role of intellectual property rights (IPR). However, there are concerns that the expansion of intellectual property rights concentrates profits from innovation, creating “intellectual monopolies”. This is particularly concerning with respect to strong global regimes of intellectual property that foster economic inequities between the Global South and North. Such arguments imply that IPR is a core driver of structural inequality in the digital economy, yet there is very little empirical analysis of how such conceptual ideas unfold. This study focuses on IPR in the Kenyan mobile money service M-Pesa. It charts how M-Pesa expanded from a development-orientated innovation in Kenya to become part of a global enterprise. Control of IPR has led to bottlenecks in innovation in Kenya and significant South-to-North financial transfers. Overall, this case contributes to expanding the debate about patterns of innovation and governance of the digital economy. As digital firms expand, unpacking the processes by which global intellectual property regimes and cross-border IPR practices shape uneven power relations and inequality is vital.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Contemporary forms of data activism promise community organizers the means to pursue political action, but they simultaneously threaten to responsibilize individuals and communities for documenting collective harms that are already known to the state. In this article, we use Mouffe’s articulation of agonistic pluralism to analyze recent literature on data activism in terms of this double bind, the threat that authentic community voice might be muted when data is used for activist purposes. We argue that community organizers navigate this double bind through agonistic data practices, tactics which draw on the affective and narrative potentialities of data to dispute the terms by which majoritarian political agents rationalize their actions and direct policy. Agonistic data practices do not presume that data will lead to more equitable consensus in representative government or to a more rational debate in the public sphere; instead, agonistic data practices mobilize the antagonisms that motivate people to act, to imagine alternative political arrangements, and to contribute to long-term collective action. We conclude by mapping out a research agenda that focuses on agonistic data practices enacted in minoritized communities in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Storytelling teaches. All good storytelling is good teaching. Storytelling is a form of teaching and learning because it asks the readers or listeners to replace well-established explanations that are considered facts with new, unexpected ones. We always learn new things when listening to good stories. Good stories do so by violating expectations and surprising the listener or the reader. Surprise breeds suspense, which generates engagement, which is a catalyst for learning – even truer for scientific and data-driven stories. In this paper we show how understanding the nature of good stories by focusing on the novelty they introduce and assumption they violate helps us to do effective scientific work and tell excellent data-based stories. We start by providing definitions of “story,” “storytelling,” and “good stories.” We then outline a methodology for building stories and provide an illustrative example of an effective data-based story from the history of medicine.",

    "abstract": "Much of the ethical debate on peer-to-peer (P2P) focuses on the use of this technology for unauthorized and illegal sharing of copyrighted materials. This fixation has led some to believe that P2P is an intrinsically unethical technology. However, P2P has a much wider significance than the unauthorized circulation of copyrighted material. Scholars therefore need to evaluate the global ethical effects of P2P architecture on society, as opposed to focusing on the specific implementations of this architecture. Several criteria have been proposed for the assessment of these implications, ranging from the effects of P2P on the technological progress of a society to its influence on the development of virtuous interactions. This article contributes to this debate by presenting a new approach, which distinguishes between local effects (content related) and systemic effects (communication modality related) of the use of P2P and focuses on the latter. Employing Floridi's information ethics, it considers whether or not P2P is an ethical technology, in a global sense.",

The most consequential outcome of this operation was that it created a focus on privacy violations that occurred at the behest of copyright, and thus revealed the tensions between intellectual property and privacy.

    "title": "Accessing and Browsing Information and Communication, by Ronald E. Rice, Maureen McCreadie, and Shan-Ju L. Chang. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2001. xiii + 357 pp., $45.00. ISBN 0-262-18214-9.",
    "abstract": "The Information Society (TIS) readers will be familiar with the “promise of nearly unlimited retrieval of information” as well as the complaints of “overload, confusion, frustration, becoming lost, not knowingwhere to go to  nd what [one] need[s], or not being able to interpret or evaluate information after obtaining it,” which the authors note on page 1 of this book. They contend that traditional approaches have underconceptualized what has been called information seeking, and undertakean ambitious review of information access (a broader term than information seeking) and browsing, to create a more extensive theoretical base. The book’s title as presented here (and on the title page) gives the six words equal weight. The dust jacket puts “information and communication” in smaller type. This reviewermademost sense of the contentwhen read as (((Accessing andBrowsing) Information) andCommunication), with the emphasis de nitely on Accessing and Browsing. The book treats accessing and browsing to separate analyses throughout; it is clearly a compoundof dissertations by Chan (1995, on browsing) and McCreadie (1998, on access to information), both supervised by Rice at Rutgers University. J. David Johnson’s apt description of the book is quoted on the dust jacket: “Richly detailed case studies and helpful narrative tables enliven this very systematic and orderly review of the access and browsing literature relevant to information and communication.” The authors identify the primary audience as researchers, teachers, graduate students, and service providers. It is indeed a “rigorous academic book” (p. xii). The  rst part of the book (chapters 2–8) focuses on access. Chapter 2 is a wide-ranging review of the literatures from several  elds, including sketches of the perspectives and salient points from the disparate studies. The research literatures surveyed are library studies, information science, mass communication, organizational communication, and economics of information. By the time one reaches the summary, the authors have certainly demonstrated their point that this topic is discussed from many perspectives, and that some synthesis would be useful. Fortunately, the next two chapters extract concepts of access from this panoply of review, then propose a preliminary framework for a multi-disciplinary understanding of access. The preliminary framework is then tested througha set of case studies with intentionally diverse sets of people accessing information. The preliminary framework is revised to re ect what was observed in the real-world tests. Interestingly, the adaptations to the literature-derived preliminary framework re ect human involvement in information access. The initial list of six in uences/constraints included physical, cognitive, affective, economic, social, and political. The revision added a mediative in uence/constraint, re ecting the role of human mediators (rather than technology) as both helping and hindering access to information. The second change introduced from testing the framework is increased emphasis on the iterative nature of information seeking and the prominence of context and outcomes for information seekers. The second half of the book gives the notion of browsing similar treatment. The undertaking begins with an extensive review of literatures from library user studies, end-user computing and information science, consumer research, audience research, environmental scanning, informal communication, and environmental planning/ architectural design. Perhaps because the reader has seen how the information access smorgabord was reduced to a reasonable size, the range of literatures covered for browsing is not as alarming. The authors introduce browsing",

    "abstract": "Barbara Warnick, a well-known scholar in rhetoric and communication who has of late begun applying her skills in rhetorical theory to the Internet, takes a broad look at the Internet in this book, beginning with Wired and moving into online discourse (women online; political parody). In performing such criticism, Warnick invites readers to look at the narratives and messages behind the facade of mainstream presentation; by using rhetorical theory in specific, she invites us to see all technology discourse as persuasive. For example, her critique suggests that Wired is gender and racially biased and that the magazine is undergirded with an ideology of techno-libertarianism. These features are not neutral, and they present the technology in a way that the author suggests we might challenge (or at least be aware of). In this way, Warnick has written a book that performs two tasks: It updates rhetorical theory by illustrating how rhetoric as a discipline must consider technology in its realm of artifacts for criticism, and it updates Internet studies by portraying all discourse about the Internet as persuasive (and to consider what particular message is being pushed, and by whom). Thus, the book has two general audiences. The first is those in rhetorical theory who should be persuaded by this book (if they have not been already) that Internet discourse is an important area of study. The second audience would be more akin to readers of this journal: those looking at the Internet and its social, ethical, and political implications. The book begins with an introductory chapter that makes Warnick’s case for the use of rhetoric to understand the Internet. In particular, she argues that by understanding digital discourse and its motives, we can become more literate in a critical fashion: “Critical literacy,” she tells us, “in part means communicating about communication. It includes the capacity to look beneath the surface of the discourse” (p. 6). Citing other work in digital literacy, including this reviewer’s Cyberliteracy and Kathleen Tyner’s Literacy in a Digital World, Warnick makes the case for her method (rhetorical criticism) and the artifacts that she will critique. Like Kathleen Welch’s Electric Rhetoric, Warnick notes that a rhetorical approach will help us understand the “beliefs, values, and assumptions” (p. 14) written into texts, web pages, and other digital artifacts. Specifically, the next three chapters take a case-based approach, analyzing artifacts from our digital age. In Chapter One, Warnick examines the “new frontier” (her quotations) by examining the “new libertarianism” (p. 23) presented in Wired magazine through its structure, style, motives, and other rhetorical features. Of the many interesting findings in this chapter, Warnick notes that despite all the hype about the Internet and egalitarianism, the magazine’s main model of argument is based on the “young entrepreneur,” a white male under 30 years old (p. 42). In a counting of images, she discovers (is anyone surprised?) that 71% of the people presented in the magazine are white men. This chapter ends with several examples that show that Wired might, just might, be addressing its narrow scope and lack of inclusiveness. Yet in Chapter Two, we see that perhaps this inclusive future, when it comes to gender, might mean nothing more than “masculinizing the feminine” (p. 63). The chapter’s main argument is that invitational rhetoric, that is, rhetoric that invites women to be online, by and large only serves to reinforce traditional male-techno values about what women should do. Through her critique, Warnick argues that mainstream Web sites “constructed an ‘ideal’ type of woman—one who was career oriented, opportunistic, and prepared to take risks and try new things. . . . By praising tech-savvy values and lifestyles and by upbraiding women who had other priorities . . . this invitational",

    "title": "Information determinism: The consequences of the faith in information",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We identify and examine the assumption of information determinism that is commonplace in policy arenas: that mere access to the “right information” will precipitate desired actions. Our analysis focuses on implications of information determinism in three cases: California disaster response plans in the 1980s, an Indian development project in the 1990s, and an education project directed at the Global South in the 2000s. Our analyses shows that planning based on information deterministic assumptions tends to overlook the sociomaterial circumstances of information production and circulation, including how social structures and materiality shape information in practice. Further, they imbue what we call “information” with the agency to bring about change. While we do not deny that “information” can be useful, we argue that policy needs to move away from information deterministic thinking and its singular focus on information access to address the needs of marginalized and vulnerable populations.",

This article provides a brief account of behavior’s twentieth century appearance and journey to a position of centrality in common-sense understandings of who we are. Given that traditional understandings of the right to privacy and self-determination are founded on a liberal humanist understanding of the subject, dominant critiques of online surveillance are seriously compromised by the fact that behavior cannot, strictly speaking, be accommodated within this intellectual framework.",

Our article contributes to this effort by spotlighting novel discursive strategies of right-leaning groups in India that leverage decolonization rhetoric, democratic governance, and other seemingly left-leaning rationales to mobilize right-wing groups against global technology companies, especially Twitter (now X).1 We collected and analyzed publicly accessible data from Koo—an alternative social networking platform populated with discourses of India’s ideological right. We then used critical discourse analysis to identify the discursive strategies of right-leaning users on Koo deployed to challenge the power of global technology companies – calls for data localization, veiled suppression, and paternalism and responsibility.",

    "title": "Tapping User-Driven Innovation: A New Rationale for Universal Service",
    "abstract": "The current transformation of communication policies, as governments turn to the marketplace as the driver of network evolution, requires a redefinition of universal service. The debate so far has focused primarily on the elaboration of new funding mechanisms and the definition of which services should be covered. We argue that a more fundamental, third area demands attention: the articulation of a new rationale for universal service itself. Without articulating a clear justification for universal service, designing its scope and funding mechanisms is problematic at best. Past justifications rested on welfare (make telephony affordable to all) and network externalities (increase the network?s value by widening its reach). Increasingly, these need to be complemented by a new rationale based on the innovative potential of universal service. This article explores how universal service can fuel innovation-driven economic growth.",

    "abstract": "The legal regulatory regimes for communication technologies evolve with technological, economic, and social change. This article asserts that, in the United States, the evolution of the legal regulatory regimes for the communications sector is following a trajectory breathtakingly similar to that already traversed by the transportation sector. As both sectors provide infrastructures essential to the nation and share similar economic attributes of networks, technological evolution within each has generated many of the same core issues. By recognizing this historical reality, we can tap valuable experience in transportation policy to better inform prospective policy change in communications. In this way, future communications policy need not be radical—whether intentionally or unintentionally—nor totally untested, thereby enhancing its potential for sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Without printing technology there would be no need for copyright. Anglo-American copyright has its roots in early booksellers' practices that in 1710 were incorporated into the Statute of Anne. Several decades later in 1735 the provisions of this statute were copied in a new piece of legislation for the protection of engravings. However, “Hogarth's Act” protected only those engravings that involved original designs and thus, implicitly, made a distinction between artists and mere craftsmen. Soon, however, Parliament was persuaded to extend protection to all engravings. The history of Hogarth's Act foreshadowed the logic whereby a century later protection was extended first to special and then to ordinary photographs. Together these instances of copyright extension raise the question of to what degree similar patterns are at work in the continuing expansion of copyright today.",

Yet, more and more nations are developing restrictive information policies to maintain their political, cultural and economic status. The author calls this phenomenon, “information protectionism,” and examines a number of cooperative steps that are being taken to assure the open exchange of ideas and information and to create a policy of global information interdependence. The basic challenge, the article concludes, is to find and maintain a realistic balance between open transborder data flow and national concerns and priorities.",

    "abstract": "Around the year 2000, many IS researchers sought to integrate theories from CSCW and network studies into their empirical studies. Roberta Lamb worked on informational environments (Lamb, Kling, & King, 2003) and social actors (Lamb & Kling, 2003). I called similar things organizational information space (Karsten, 1999) and group cyborgs. We started discussing the respective scopes of these concepts. She wanted me to extend my ideas beyond organizations to networks of organizations. I insisted that the environment was an insufficient metaphor for something that also included many actants, human and nonhuman (Latour, 2003). We both kept coming up with more metaphors and images for what both of us had found in the course of our empirical studies. During the IFIP WG8.2 Working Conference in Aalborg, Denmark, I was the discussant for her and Liz Davidson’s archipelago paper (Lamb & Davidson, 2000). They had found that discrete intranets were getting integrated across organizational boundaries. I presented a paper on constructing interdependencies over time (Karsten, 2000, 2003). My focus was on active enacting of the relationships and information spaces; theirs was on presentation of self on the intranets and the roles taken. We both had read Star and Ruhleder (1996) on collaboratories and agreed that this concept might work for both of us. She wanted me to strengthen the networking aspect of my ideas and I emphasized the role of actants and agency. We realized that we could both benefit from continuous exchange of ideas. She and Harmeet invited me to become an associate editor of The Information Society and we started to plan reciprocal visits. Finally, in 2005, the archipelago metaphor became more than a metaphor, a very concrete experience. I spent January to April in Honolulu, Hawaii, and she came to Turku, Finland, from mid-August to mid-December. In Honolulu, I realized that the relatively small economies of both archipelagoes had resulted in a strong emphasis on",

    "abstract": "The moniker of the digital divide may very well end up having  lled a historical lacuna, like the high-school movement of the 1920s. Debate has steadily shifted from gauging who has access to x technology to understanding what applications will bene t society—and from conversations about use patterns to deeper analyses of the impact and outcomes witnessed from the domestication of information technologies. In this light, The Digital Divide provides an intriguing historical snapshot and some enduring theoretical insights. The book also has historical resonance given the discontinuities apparent in the current economic and political climate. The precipitous economic downturn has undermined the argument of the book’s technological optimists who viewed the 1990s heyday markets as the unassailable vanguard in spreading digital opportunity to all Americans. The nation’s political makeover in 2001, moreover, has also delivered a clean blow to the policies of the past, since the term “digital divide” appears to be persona non grata in the Bush Administration, too heavily laden with the redistributive tenor of the largely Clinton–Gore-endorsed digital divide agenda. The book’s relevance is also tethered to the rapid pace of technological diffusion, particularly the chapters describing the latest statistics and data regarding the state of the technology gap. Given that Internet time and Web years  y by, attempts to capture the freshest market research in book form amounts to a losing proposition . Already, the “Falling through the Net” data from the U.S. Department of Commerce captured in the epilogue have been superseded, and hardly a whisper is heard from contributing authors about leading-edge wireless broadband information and communications vehicles, such as thirdgeneration wireless or Ka-band satellite, both of which afford great opportunitie s as well as posing considerable hurdles to communities that are unable to afford or avail themselves of these new services. Some good debates are sown and interesting theoretical insights are made in the book’s middle. Milton Mueller’s article equating universal service policy with wealth redistribution makes an important contribution , yet his argument regarding the merits of a market-exclusive infrastructure development strategy remains underdeveloped. Mueller’s position that the most effective universal service policies are those that “build an open, competitive economy” (p. 181) eschews two valid empirical points raised by Mark Cooper and Gene Kimmelman in their chapter. First, rapid industry consolidation has quickly trimmed the playing  eld of viable marketplace competitors. Second, of those communications companies that survive, their deployments tend to shy away from lowincome and rural communities. Cooper and Kimmelman raise the critical concern that it is time we “stop pretending that competition is right around the corner” (p. 203). Markets are obviously critical—but so are the roles of regulators and lawmakers to ensure that the public interest is protected. The editor lays his cards on the table at the outset, attempting to exorcise the digital divide before we have turned the  rst page. Benjamin Compaine suggests that the rise of the Internet is akin to the development of other technologies in the 20th century—such as television and radio—and will continue to roll out most ef ciently if the role of government is neatly circumscribed and market forces are unleashed to foster competition. The editor challenges us to be clear about the bene ts of information and communications tools, before we move into headlong acceptance of them as a basic entitlement. This is an important point for researchers, advocates and policymakers who work on this issue to keep in mind. Unfortunately, the editor in particular and the book’s authors in general offer very little analysis of the impact information and communications technologies are having—say, on economic well-being or educational advancement—to allow",

Many accounts take overly restricted views of technical development. For instance, the Internet is often seen simply as the outgrowth of U.S. Defense Department work and popular enthusiasm. Recent interdisciplinary studies of technology present a more complex picture of how innovations are developed. They highlight technical alternatives, contributions of diverse groups, variety in meanings of technologies, and the overall surprising character of technology development. They suggest that the Internet has multiple origins and numerous particular reasons for its spread. Current discussions of the entry of Internet technologies into consumers' homes and the convergence among computing, media, and telecommunications enterprises represent examples of more complex accounts of technology development. Such accounts will likely provide more powerful bases for policy, management, and...",

    "abstract": "In my letter in the second issue of this year I had to regretfully report the passing of Roberta Lamb, Deputy Editor of TIS, in November, 2006, after a brief battle with cancer. In that letter I shared my own reflections and promised a richer portrait later in the year by colleagues who knew her beyond the written word. This issue brings it to you. I would like to thank colleagues who have shared their reflections in \" In Memory of Roberta Lamb \" section of this issue. Each of them has shed light on different facets of Roberta's scholarship and stages in her career. From Elizabeth Davidson, we learn about Roberta's years at the University of Hawaii and also their joint projects; a paper from their project on oceanography and marine biology research communities was published in TIS (Lamb and Davidson, 2005). Helena Karsten nicely blends memories of walks, cooking sessions, and other such shared moments with those of research projects jointly undertaken and work accomplished. She also provides insights into Roberta's days in Finland as a Fulbright scholar. Nilmini Wickramasinghe, Roberta's first doctoral student, takes us to the time when Roberta joined the faculty of Case Western Reserve University as a newly minted Ph.D. We also learn about Roberta as a mentor and collaborator. Steve Sawyer places Roberta's work on the broader canvas of social informatics. His reminiscences on the times their paths crossed provide insights into the evolution of the social informatics research community. By sharing their memories of Roberta, they have helped us place her life and work on the larger intellectual landscape. Furthermore, they have done it in a way that captures their relationships with Roberta in a very human way. I thank them for that. REFERENCE Lamb, R. and Davidson, E. 2005.

We also explore whether these relationships depend on commonly identified characteristics of individual politicians. We collected data for all elected candidates from the 2012 Dutch national elections covering each 15 days prior to the election day (N = 2250). This includes 2736 newspaper articles and 77,597 mentions on Facebook and Twitter. Our results show that the traditional news agenda and social media agenda impact each other, but that the reciprocal influence is not independent of politician characteristics.",

    "title": "Awkwardness of becoming a boundary object: Mangle and materialities of reports, documentation data, and the archaeological work",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Information about an archaeological investigation is documented in an archaeological report, which makes it the boundary object par excellence for archaeological information work across stakeholder communities such as field archaeologists, heritage managers, and land developers. The quality of reports has been a subject of debate, and recently it has been argued that more emphasis should be placed on making primary research data at least similarly available. This study explores the changing materialities and reciprocal formation of documents and their users with the advent of digitization, and how documents form and lose their status as boundary objects in these processes. The study posits that in order to be functional, a boundary object needs to provide a disclosure that makes it accessible to cognate communities. Further, it shows how assumptions about the functioning of the human and nonhuman (material artifacts) influence the ways in which archaeologists conceptualize the preservation and archiving of archaeological information and the role and potential of different types of digital and paper-based documents. This article is based on an interview study of Swedish archaeology professionals (N = 16) with theoretical underpinnings in the notions of boundary objects, mangle of practice, and disclosure.",

    "title": "A Review of “Gender Circuits: Bodies and Identities in a Technological Age”",
    "abstract": "Eve Shapiro’s Gender Circuits is a lucid introduction to the increasingly complex relationship between information and biomedical technologies, gendered bodies, and social identities. It has an exceptionally coherent and clear structure. The preview thoroughly provides the reader with key vocabulary and concepts that are employed frequently in the subsequent parts of the book. The main set of theoretical arguments is enriched throughout the book with textboxes, case studies (on tattooing and masculinity, the 19th-century “Bloomers,” transgender activism, and the treatment of transgender individuals), references to mass culture, film and popular magazines, episodes from the social history of technology and gender, and Shapiro’s own childhood memories, family history, activism, and career. Gender Circuits explores a fundamental question of our times: What role does the new technological order play in shaping and reshaping our selves to our own as well as society’s liking? Drawing on interdisciplinary scholarship from sociology, science, history, gender and sexuality studies, and cultural studies, the book makes a strong case for the centrality of technological advances in defining and narrating who we are. With a specific focus on gender and gender nonconformity, the book demonstrates the extent to which identity categories are intricately shaped by emerging technologies. Shapiro establishes the relationship as follows: Identity categories such as gender are constructed through available social scripts (that is, blueprints for gendered behavior and action). Gender social scripts provide individuals with a particular interpretation of what it means to be a “man” or a “woman.” Moreover, they offer templates for how we define masculinity and femininity, sexual normality, and nonconformity. As a result, we come to embody the knowledge we gain through social scripts. Yet these scripts are never fixed and are always bound to change over time by new social forces and actors. It is at this critical juncture that emerging technologies offer new potentials for reshaping our social understanding and perception of who we are, especially in the area of gender. By mediating this transformation, Shapiro argues, the new information and biomedical technologies enable new scripts and lead to shifts in ideological and cultural paradigms. In this regard, Shapiro shows us the extent to which the practical applications of new technologies are central to theories of gender performativity that conceptualize gender not as an already stable identity category but as constituted by expressive acts and contingent practices in the social sphere (Butler 1999; Butler 2004). It is important to note here that Shapiro carefully stays away from both technological progressivism (the utopian fallacy that technology always makes life better) and technological determinism (the dystopian fallacy that technology has strict control over individual lives). Instead, Shapiro shows that emerging technologies can take hegemonic as well as nonhegemonic forms. The increasing availability of steroids, for instance, imposes a certain hegemonic form of masculinity, whereas, plastic surgery and endocrinology offer new possibilities for counterhegemonic articulations of contemporary transgender identities. Shapiro analyzes the transformative functions of new technologies in two separate chapters. Chapter 2, “Information Technologies and Gendered Identity Work,”",

    "abstract": "Perspectives from the sociology of scientific knowledge are deployed to explore the birth of Internet research, focusing in particular on the development of methodological approaches. For a researcher based in the sociology of scientific knowledge, being an Internet researcher has been a vivid opportunity to experience at firsthand a phenomenon usually studied from the outside. The article begins by assessing some models of the process of scientific change. Characterizing Internet research as new has been a potent resource for enrolling researchers into the field and positioning research responses. The development of virtual methods for doing social research illustrates the process of methodological innovation in social science and the negotiation of methodological adequacy. Methodological discussions have been enlivened by the advent of the Internet as an object of study. Internet research has arguably been a valuable reflexive opportunity for the traditional disciplines that have fed its development.",

    "title": "Weak Ties in Networked Communities",
    "abstract": "Communities with high levels of social capital are likely to have a higher quality of life than communities with low social capital. This is due to the greater ability of such communities to organize and mobilize effectively for collective action because they have high levels of social trust, dense social networks, and well-established norms of mutuality (the major features of social capital). Communities with “bridging” social capital (weak ties across groups) as well as “bonding” social capital (strong ties within groups) are the most effective in organizing for collective action. People who belong to multiple groups act as bridging ties. When people with bridging ties use communication media, such as the Internet, they enhance their capability to educate community members and to organize, as needed, for collective action. This article summarizes evidence from stratified household survey data in Blacksburg, VA, showing that people with weak (bridging) ties across groups have higher levels of community involvement, civic interest, and collective efficacy than people without bridging ties among groups. Moreover, heavy Internet users with bridging ties have higher social engagement, use the Internet for social purposes, and have been attending more local meetings and events since going online than heavy Internet users with no bridging ties. These findings may suggest that the Internet—in the hands of bridging individuals–is a tool for enhancing social relations and information exchange, and for increasing face-to-face interaction, all of which help to build both bonding and bridging social capital in communities.",

    "abstract": "We are heading into an era of uncontrolled and uncontrollable information flow. In the past, the tools of information flow required large investments, and the persons controlling them were easily identifiable. Now, effective long-range communication with large numbers of people can be done using tools that are easily affordable to the average citizen. Moreover, it can be done in ways that make monitoring and control virtually impossible. This is not a worrisome future change that can be averted by prompt action; it is a fait accompli and there is no reversing it. However, this is not necessarily clear to those interested in monitoring and control. Unfortunately, the bulk of electronic communication is still relatively exposed to monitoring and control, and is likely to remain so for a while. The danger is that the authorities, trying to retain a grip on a situation that is irretrievably slipping away, will react to the extremes of the problem in ways that leave ordinary users' privacy unprotected.

    "abstract": "This essay analyzes how the university arrived at its present crisis regarding research and teaching, especially in the sciences. The medieval university began as a teaching institution for training in three professions: law, medicine, and theology, along with a preparatory arts program. In the 19th century, universities in absolutist German states added research in natural and social sciences. However, the cultures of research institutions and teaching schools proved difficult to integrate outside of Germany. Moreover, our present market economy and democratic polity differ dramatically from the cultural contexts that gave rise to earlier models. We therefore need to rethink the future of teaching and research in contemporary universities to determine how the enterprise might be sustainable in any recognizable form. The goal of this historical and critical inquiry is to better understand how contemporary university teaching and research might be supported, given today's very different political and economic circumstances.",

The World Bank is a leader among UN organizations in using innovative communication media. The focus of the research was to understand the technical and organizational issues associated with the implementation and use of new information technologies in an international organization. This article presents the results and recommendations based on the field study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from members of four large‐scale units to generate an accurate and robust picture of the use and impact of electronic mail. Two of the units were primarily responsible for outward facing functions (e.g., advising member countries on investment and development), and two performed inward facing functions that support the Bank.

    "title": "Chinese digital platform companies’ expansion in the Belt and Road countries",
    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of digital platforms is shifting the digital economy toward a platform economy, and Chinese platform-based businesses like Alibaba, Tencent, and JD are increasingly expanding in the Global South. Alongside this, the Chinese government has been promoting digital economy collaboration with emerging markets through high-level engagement under the banner of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its digital economy component the Digital Silk Road (DSR). Despite significant market interest and policy attention, grounded empirical analysis of Chinese digital platforms’ expansion within Belt and Road Initiative countries is scarce. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, drawing on both quantitative data of Chinese platform companies’ overseas foreign direct investment and qualitative data obtained from fieldwork interviews in Southeast Asia and from secondary sources to conduct a case study of Chinese platforms in Indonesia. It finds that Chinese digital platforms largely undertook their overseas expansion based on commercial interests, and Beijing’s high-level policy framework BRI has had a limited direct impact on the expansion of the privately-owned Chinese platforms and their local business operations within host countries. The vagueness of BRI/DSR has also given platform companies investing in Indonesia room to choose how they engage with Chinese BRI/DSR rhetoric depending on the local context. Furthermore, local contextual factors, including Indonesian policy, policy implementation, and labor market, have shaped the platforms’ business expansion. Firms have been pushed to adapt to local policy priorities and socioeconomic context, seek local partners and invest in local capacity building. The findings suggest a more complicated state-firm relationship in Chinese digital platforms’ expansion than that which is often perceived, and the importance of host country contexts in shaping Chinese digital platforms’ local business strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Western authors fear that Chinese exports of surveillance technologies to Global South countries may lead to reproduction of the problematic surveillance practices that the Chinese state practices within its borders. However, much of this literature is not based on empirically-grounded research. To examine such concerns, we investigated two surveillance projects built in Argentina and Ecuador in cooperation with Chinese enterprises—JSeI in Argentina and ECU 911 in Ecuador. Based on empirical evidence, we argue for a more situated and differentiated approach for examining such projects that considers the distributed agency among local and Chinese actors, as well as the economic, social, and political factors that led to their deployment.",

    "title": "China’s digital expansion in the Global South: Systematic literature review and future research agenda",
    "abstract": "Abstract At the intersection of China’s growing global presence and growing digital power lies its digital expansion in the low- and middle-income countries of the Global South. Worth billions of US$ annually in trade and investment, and having a significant impact on these countries’ social and economic development, this phenomenon has been relatively ignored by researchers to date. However, it has nonetheless now been sufficiently studied to warrant a systematic literature review, the results of which are reported in this article. The article has two aims: to identify what is already known about China’s digital expansion in the Global South and, from this, to outline a future research agenda. After characterizing the features, research design, and perspectives within current literature, the article overviews China’s digital expansion. It outlines this expansion’s synergies, tensions, strategies, design and implementation approaches, and evidence about development impact on Global South countries. The article explores two domain-specific issues arising in the literature: whether China is exporting “digital authoritarianism,” and the implications of China’s growing digital presence for digital governance at both global and national levels. The article ends by laying out a six-part research agenda for future investigation of China’s digital expansion in the Global South: more Southern voices, updating the scope of research, moving beyond the “Team China” monolith, steering between Chinese exceptionalism and identicalism, evaluating development impact, and local agency in a “digital Cold War.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Location privacy is a growing challenge in today’s geo-referenced world. This exploratory study investigates the management of location privacy and mitigation of its violations through case studies of six city and county governments in the United States. It focuses on why or why not local governments have instituted location privacy policies, how they incorporate location privacy in their management, and how the managerial processes of location privacy policy formulation and implementation could be conceptualized. It follows an inductive approach, analyzing within-case findings, identifying cross-case commonalities, and inducing propositions. Findings show that there is no consistent definition of location privacy, with each local government developing its own definition and attendant approaches to privacy policymaking, management, and protection. It induces seven propositions and posits a research model centered on the concept of managerial cognition. Practical implications for city and county management are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article considers some of the ways in which the enormous growth of information about religion that has occurred over the last century has influenced both the academic study of religion and human religiousness itself. The modern study of religion is characterized as a discipline still reeling from a sudden explosion of information about its subject matter. The shock waves from that explosion are important factors in the “spiritual crisis” which many claim is a feature of twentieth century life. Specialization is identified as an important factor in the growth of religious (and other) information. However, although such specialization has undoubtedly led to many important advances in knowledge, part of the price paid for such progress lies in the distancing of academic endeavor from immediate individual concerns. Moreover, the information which fuels this distancing process tends to create an increasingly diverse environment in which the range of choices confronting the individual is vastly mu...",

Both public and private entities have assumed action responsibilities in this realm, and are seeking ways to achieve optimum collaborative results.",

    "abstract": "Research evaluation, which is an increasingly pressing issue, invariably relies on citation counts. In this contribution we highlight two concerns that the research community needs to pay attention to. One, in the world of search engine facilitated research, factors such as ease of Web discovery, ease of access, and content relevance, rather than quality, influence what gets read and cited. Two, research evaluation based on citation counts works against many types of high-quality works. We also elaborate on the implications of these points by examining a recent nationwide evaluation of researchers performed in Italy. We focus on our discipline (computer science), but we believe that our observations have relevance for a broad audience.",

Contributing to the dialogue on the influence of information technology on social systems, this article explores (1) the contested role of information in disaster relief efforts, (2) the clash of political and social values emerging from the use of information within the international community's involvement in high-profile crises, such as those in Somalia, Bosnia, and Rwanda, and (3) the resultant rethinking of government's power within national borders, sovereignty. With life-anddeath stakes, international affirmation of a free flow of information during disasters is emerging as a global human rights mandate.",

    "abstract": "While some online newspapers have embellished their online presence with a variety of interactive features, most online newspapers still appear to take on the role of cautious traditionalists, adopting a mostly conservative stance toward the new medium. Correspondingly, most audience members appear to act in a similar way. This article shows how concepts related to structuration theory can be utilized to further our theoretical understanding of the use (and nonuse) of interactive features in the online newspaper context. It employs concepts from the structuration theory to provide another interpretation of the existing empirical research. The paper concludes by suggesting that “nonuse” in this regard can be understood as part of reproducing what might be called a “structure of audiencehood” rather than a “structure of prosumerism.”",

    "abstract": "Products, including assistive and accessible technologies, do not exist in isolation. They are all part of rich product ecosystems; they inhabit specific niches of economics, functionality, and technology, and they interact with other products. The concept of product ecosystem goes beyond technological interoperability. For accessibility to advance, we must understand more about the interactions among products. This article sketches an explanatory approach that may be useful in understanding how accessible technologies thrive, survive, or fail within their ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines unstated, but critical, social assumptions that underlie social analyses of computerization. It focuses on the popular, professional, and scholarly literature that claims to describe the actual nature of computerization, the character of computer use, and the social choices and changes that result from computerization. Many articles and books in this large and diverse literature are written within the conventions of specific genres. The conventions of each of these genres limit the kinds of ideas that authors can explore and communicate effectively. This paper examines five common and important genres: technological utopianism, technological antiutopianism, social realism, social theory, and analytical reduction. Each genre is characterized and illustrated. The strengths and weaknesses of each genre are described. A major theme of this paper is the way that any genre's conventions limits the kinds of ideas that authors can examine and communicate. In the 1990s, there will be a large ma...",

    "abstract": "Various spatial metaphors related to cyberspace suffer from two major deficiencies. First, they do not take into account that cyberspace is not a preexistent territory, but an entity that emerges in the process of its development. Second, cyberspace is not a metric space, so that most of the ready-made constructs, like the topologic spaces, cannot be of much use. An interpretation of Blake's works helps one to understand that cyberspace is not a purely spatial entity; it also involves time, but not in the sense of Einstein's special relativity theory. The cyber space-time continuum is not a void waiting to be filled, but an aggregation of places (sites) that, similarly to Blake's plates, are multimedia architectures resulting from the blend of space and time.",

Utilizing information technology to cut costs and improve decision‐making requires a great deal more knowledge about administrative activities than top management currently possesses.

The rub is you cannot automate what you can't structurally represent. This article explores past conditions leading to this predicament and suggests a conceptual framework for its resolution.",

    "abstract": "In this article we examine contributions to Wikipedia through the prism of two divergent critical theorists: Jürgen Habermas and Mikhail Bakhtin. We show that, in slightly dissimilar ways, these theorists came to consider an “aesthetic for democracy” (Hirschkop 1999) or template for deliberative relationships that privileges relatively free and unconstrained dialogue to which every speaker has equal access and without authoritative closure. We employ Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and Bakhtin's “dialogism” for analyses of contributions on Wikipedia for its entry on stem cells and transhumanism and show that the decision to embrace either unified or pluralistic forms of deliberation is an empirical matter to be judged in sociohistorical context, as opposed to what normative theories insist on. We conclude by stressing the need to be attuned to the complexity and ambiguity of deliberative relations online.",

    "title": "Seoul Searching: How Do Mobile Communication Technologies Alter Urban Mobility?",
    "abstract": "The majority of research on the information revolution in Korea focuses exclusively on the 1990s, disregarding previous historical periods, claiming that decade marked the beginning of an “information society.” This article, on the other hand, adopts a wider, sociohistorical perspective on urban mobility and mobile communication technologies in the Korean context. By doing so, it recontextualizes the shifting relationship between mobile communication technologies and urban mobility and provides insights into how the modern social geography of mobility in Seoul is being constantly made and remade. In particular, the article focuses upon the social space of bang (literally “room” in Korean) as a product of the specific modern spatial rearrangement of the public and the private. It examines how the organizing principles of social spaces are moving from enclosure and containment to connection and distribution.",

    "title": "Phones R Us",
    "abstract": "Mobile phones are everywhere, and researchers of mobile society have not been far behind. Two recent edited collections, Thumb Culture and Mobile Communications, give different views of the state of research on mobile phone use. Like the phones themselves, these articles span the range of modern life. They discuss situations varying from the dramatic (sexual liberation in India, bomb detonation in Madrid, and bomber capture through camera phones in London) to the unbelievably mundane (the daily messages of teenagers). They address questions at the grandest of scales (are mobiles an “antievolutionary” device causing a return to “premodern” patterns of social life?) and at the smallest (what are the word frequencies in Norwegian text messages?). These two books provide a way to take stock of where the research is today. What are seen as the important social and cultural questions about mobile phones? What do we know? And what might we be missing? Thumb Culture has a media studies and communications flavor. The discussions tend to take on more of the larger cultural and structural questions. Hans Geser’s chapter worries that mobile phone users are too focused on maintaining existing social bonds, not leaving themselves open to new relationships and experiences. James Katz wonders whether people can be left alone with their thoughts anymore, now that every idle moment can be filled with conversation, mostly within a close circle of family and friends. Blurring boundaries between private and public life, the joy and stress of being “always on,” and the question of whether companies are getting more work for free are examples of the social and cultural issues under discussion. Jonathan Donner’s chapter on Rwandan entrepreneurs is particularly powerful. The difference that a mobile phone can make for the livelihood of an African baker, hair-braider, or restaurant owner is truly life changing. Thumb Culture also benefits from including industry, as well as academic, perspectives. The industry voices remind us just how dramatic and unexpected the success of the mobile phone has been, particularly text messaging. They attribute the success of mobile phones to not just giving people the freedom to communicate, but also the freedom not to communicate—text messaging and call screening allow people to reassert control over when and how communications take place. With their amazement at success, however, comes a continuing frustration at the industry’s inability to find successful new data services. Paul Golding argues that new third-generation data services are still the future, while Nick Foggin counters that 98% of mobile phone revenues still come from traditional services (voice, voice mail, and text messaging) and that the industry should spend more time on basics like reliability and high quality audio. Mobile Communications offers a computer-supported cooperative work focus, with more emphasis on microinteractions, psychology, and language use. Goffman is the theorist cited frequently here. The idea of human selfpresentation as a theater with a front stage and back stage is used across chapters to understand the detailed practices of mobile phone use in public places. Studies of word counts, grammar changes and abbreviations in text messages, and the use of humorous versus practical “away” messages concentrate on detailed language shifts in mobile phone use. The commercialization section of the book takes on the question of new data services, with one study finding that personal expressiveness was more important than instrumental benefits for explaining the adoption of a new parking payment service.",

The article looks through the experience of the last 7 years of life on RCM—the Milan Community Network—to reflect on the role that the sharing of rules of behavior has on the evolution of social structure in a virtual community. It identifies three phases of development—the design phase, the first growth phase, and the most recent phase—and presents the social structure set up to guarantee governance of the CN. The conclusions show that the third phase is not an actual stable state, as the continuous evolution of the societal and technological context requires continuous redesign of the CN itself in order to meet the renewed demands of a new context.",

    "abstract": "Every information channel within Africa is restricted. Limited budgets cause television stations to produce few shows of their own and to fill airtime with cheap American imports-imports that are often at odds with local cultural values. Book production is complicated by high production costs. The computer database industry is miniscule by U.S. standards. The World Wide Web opens a new forum for information access, but is complicated by high phone charges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The information age is bringing about a change in the world division of labor. Many of the great trading cities that arose during the Industrial Revolution as shipping, railroad, and financial centers are now facing new challenges, challenges brought about by global telecommunications. Information technology and the changing nature of business and government offer new opportunities and threats to these and other cities as they strive to acquire or retain treasured economic activity. Telecommunications and computation capacity are among the tools cities can use as they vie with one another for this commerce. This study describes how U. S. cities are affected by these trends and summarizes some of the key technological and policy issues involved. Several case studies are reported, which show the various strategies used by large cities such as New York and Boston, progressive Midwest cities such as Omaha, and small cities such as Heathrow, Florida. Some preliminary principles of success are adduced.",

    "abstract": "How does an increase in the availability of detailed electronic information about behavior change organizations, and what kinds of choices influence those changes? This paper presents a model of mutual control, derived from studies of detailed information sharing in manufacturing, that describes one set of likely changes. According to the mutual control model, increasing pressures for tighter monitoring and control come from a mutual access to, and dependence on, shared electronic information that can be linked to the behavior of identifiable individuals and groups. That the demands for greater monitoring and control come from all directions in organizations, not simply upper management, is a finding that contrasts sharply with the traditional view of electronic surveillance and its concern with regulating managerial excess. The mutual control model also highlights how current systems design ideals, uncritically followed, contribute to the widespread demand for monitoring and tighter control within organi...",

This article examines the key factors that have contributed to the decline of the U.S. consumer electronics industry. The first section also describes the Japanese and European business strategies used to edge out American manufacturers. The second section briefly reviews the content of congressional bills designed to promote the development of a U.S. HDTV manufacturing industry. Major provisions include tax incentives for research and development, relaxation of antitrust laws, and federal support. The last section recommends a set of policies to revive the entrepreneurial spirit and industrial leadership of U.S. manufacturers in consumer electronics. A multifaceted reform, including educational, economic, and political transformations, is essential to ensure a sound base for American companies’ reentry into the hi...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent interest has been expressed in the potential of information technology to create new kinds of monopolies. This paper looks at production and marketing factors in the information services industry which may increase concentration in the hands of fewer producers, potentially leading to monopoly formation. The research develops an economic model of topic‐specific market concentration and delineates the factors which might cause monopolies to occur in the markets of information data base production firms. The model shows that market concentration rises with inelastic demand, reduced marginal costs and efficient technology, and increased data acquisition costs exacerbated by low rates of data obsolescence. These effects are empirically investigated in the DIALOG group of data bases. The results of the research have implications for corporate information systems and information systems in the public sector.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the knowledge component in cluster literature from its origins to the present. A chronological perspective is deployed in order to shed light on how the concept of clusters has evolved. Given the increasing interest in clusters as knowledge repositories, and the apparent conviction among policymakers of the manageability of clusters, lessons learned from knowledge management (KM) practices in organizations might well be applied to the many policy efforts aimed at governing clusters. We argue that introducing KM initiatives on a regional level should be accompanied by an understanding of the possible downfalls that are associated with KM failures.",

They operate in an environment of explicit (rather than tacit) trust; open badges provide issuers the ability to include specific claims and associate those claims with detailed supporting evidence. Earners are encouraged to share their badges over social networks, e-mail, and websites, and the information they contain is expected to circulate readily in these spaces. Building upon current concepts and theories from the Information Sciences and Learning Sciences, this article shows how the informational affordances of digital badges are transforming education and learning more generally, and more particularly by transcending conventional paradigms of academic credentialing and educational assessment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Higher education institutions have started using big data analytics tools. By gathering information about students as they navigate information systems, learning analytics employs techniques to understand student behaviors and to improve instructional, curricular, and support resources and learning environments. However, learning analytics presents important moral and policy issues surrounding student privacy. We argue that there are five crucial questions about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals.",

    "abstract": "Ethical issues arise at all phases of the research act. However, this article is intended to identify and discuss ethical issues that researchers should consider during the research act at the phase of methodology construction and in the course of data collection. During this phase, researchers must be keenly aware of the experiential dimension of the phenomena they are studying, taking great care not to harm the participants or the context of the research itself. This article explores ethical issues that emerge from the dynamic form of interaction that defines on-line communication. On-line communication is a form of social interaction that is publicly private, anonymous, multiple and simultaneous, and faceless/nonoral. The publicly private nature of on-line interaction necessitates that researchers distinguish between what is ''publicly accessible'' and ''publicly distributed.'' It must be acknowledged that ''private interactions'' persist in spite of ''public accessibility.'' The anonymity of on-line i...",

    "title": "Environment and Policy Factors Shaping Global E-Commerce Diffusion: A Cross-Country Comparison",
    "abstract": "This article examines the key global, environmental and policy factors that act as determinants of e-commerce diffusion. It is based on systematic comparison of case studies from 10 countries--Brazil, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. It finds that B2B e-commerce seems to be driven by global forces, whereas B2C seems to be more of a local phenomenon. A preliminary explanation for this difference is that B2B is driven by global competition and MNCs that \"push\" e-commerce to their global suppliers, customers, and subsidiaries. This in turn creates pressures on local companies to adopt e-commerce to stay competitive. In contrast, B2C is \"pulled\" by consumer markets, which are mainly local and therefore divergent. While all consumers desire convenience and low prices, consumer preferences and values, national culture, and distribution systems differ markedly across countries and define differences in local consumer markets. These findings support the transformation perspective about globalization and its impacts. In terms of policy, the case studies suggest that enabling policies such as trade and telecommunications liberalization are likely to have the biggest impact on e-commerce, by making ICT and Internet access more affordable to firms and consumers, and increasing pressure on firms to adopt e-commerce to compete. Specific e-commerce legislation appears not to have as big an impact, although inadequate protection for both buyers and sellers in some countries suggests that mechanisms need to be developed to ensure greater confidence in doing business online.",

    "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on “The Legacy of Rob Kling: Social Informatics as a Research Discipline”",
    "abstract": "The late Professor Rob Kling was an influential scholar in the field of social informatics (SI). Not only was he a visionary promoting the conceptualization of this new area (Kling, 1999; Kling & Allen, 1996), but a lead researcher as well. As a tribute to this profound, eclectic professor, we present this special issue of The Information Society to honor his contributions to the social informatics community. Unlike a festschrift, where papers are focused on research topics related to a professor’s previous work, this special issue is dedicated to Rob’s impact on the past, current, and future state of the field of SI. The articles in this special issue are a subset of 24 papers presented at the Social Informatics Workshop, held at the University of California, Irvine, March 11–12, 2005 (cf. http://www.crito.uci.edu/si), to honor the contributions of Rob Kling as founder of SI. The workshop was focused on papers and presentations related to SI generally, and to extending his research on computerization movements (CM) in particular. The workshop papers related to CMs are being published in a book (Elliott & Kraemer, in press), whereas the papers in this special issue deal specifically with Rob Kling’s contribution to the genesis of the SI research community in the United States and Europe. We both worked closely with Rob Kling during his tenure at the University of California, Irvine, as did Jonathan Grudin, Suzanne Iacano, and John King who are authors in this issue. Several other authors worked with Rob when he went to Indiana University, including Blaise Cronin, Debora Shaw, Alice Robbins, and Steve Sawyer. As coeditors of this special issue, we wish to enlighten researchers about the richness of SI research and further Rob’s vision",

    "abstract": "The social study of information and communication technology (ICT) does not have a long history, but its history is long enough to warrant a “tradition.” This tradition, which according to the editors of the book goes back to the “Human Choice and Computers” conference of 1974 in Vienna, has gone through three major stages. In the ﬁrst stage (1970s and 1980s), based on the “naive view” that the social effects of computing are a matter of human choice, researchers perceived themselves as expert activists whose role was to contribute to socially palatable designs and projects. In the second stage (1990s), there was a shift toward conceptual frameworks for understanding the complex dynamics of ICT innovations in organizations and society. Finally, in the third stage, the emphasis is on interpretative and phenomenological accounts. This volume comprises a heterogeneous collection of articles that represent the last stage in this development. Aside from its European bias—except for a minor citation, the editors fail to include in their historical summary the body of work that began in the 1970s under the rubric of Social Informatics by researchers such as Rob Kling in the United States—the periodization just described is a useful way of thinking about the history of the ﬁeld, but as the content of the chapters shows, for better or worse, strong elements of the ﬁrst two stages (action research as well as a penchant for “frameworks”) are still present in current studies.",

    "title": "Global and National Factors Affecting E-Commerce Diffusion in Singapore",
    "abstract": "This article provides a broad overview of the likely global/regional contextual factors and unique national characteristics that influence e-commerce diffusion in Singapore. Our analysis suggests that Singapore is likely to be a very fast adopter of e-commerce applications that have relatively proven business models in other advanced countries. In particular, advanced manufacturing clusters in Singapore with strong global supply chain links to advanced countries (especially electronics), logistics and transportation services, and other global market-oriented, business-to-business (B2B) industries are likely to be the most aggressive in adopting e-commerce applications. In contrast, we predict that Singapore will be less likely to innovate new e-commerce technologies or pioneer revolutionary e-commerce applications with radical global impacts, due to the small local market and the inadequate development of an information and communications technologies (ICT) entrepreneurial community with extensive network links to Silicon Valley and other entrepreneurial hot spots. Singapore is also unlikely to be a leader in large-scale business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce applications and mass consumer contents publishing. Our review of government policy initiatives to promote e-commerce suggests that although they are by and large in the right direction, they are unlikely to have significant impact until proven e-commerce models have emerged and competitive pressure start to be felt by companies. A possible exception is \"e-government\" applications. In contrast, we identify a number of areas where government policy initiatives have been a bit slow, notably in liberalizing the telecommunications services sector and in promoting technology entrepreneurship. Our review of the available empirical evidence on recent e-commerce diffusion trend and pattern in Singapore appears to be consistent with this analysis.",

    "abstract": "For the last decade, the concept of a \"digital divide\" has framed people's understanding of technology's relationship to equity and development. This article critiques theoretically the digital divide concept and supports this critique by examining a case study of technology and education in Egypt. The study illustrates the social embeddedness of technology and the intertwining of computer access with broader issues of political power, thus refuting simplistic notions of divides to be overcome through provision of equipment.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a framework by which rival firms' incentives for interconnection in unregulated telecommunications markets may be analyzed and argues that the widespread voluntary interconnection observed among Internet service providers (ISPs) is anomalous when compared with examples of other similar markets from U.S. industrial history. However, the fact that it is anomalous provides an opportunity to test common explanations and to explore new explanations for the remarkable connectivity observed among ISPs through a comparative analysis. The comparative analysis reveals that (1) network effects and competitive forces in telecommunications markets will not necessarily drive firms to interconnect their networks voluntarily as there are other options to them, and (2) government actions played an important role in shaping the interconnection behavior competing firms in telecommunications markets. The article then explores some of the implications of these findings for telecommunications policy, and interconnection regulation in particular.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Data center infrastructures provide a lens for understanding the rise of resilience thinking, for grasping the pragmatism and promise of resilience as approach. Unable to anticipate every threat and lockout every contingency, developers of resilient infrastructure “design in” failure, automate monitoring and maintenance, and build capacity to flexibly adapt to new threats. In enacting resilience in the present, they anticipate possible futures, prototyping forms of future life. In this sense, infrastructures should also be understood as operational imaginaries – as systems that powerfully suggest a set of future possibilities by enacting them concretely in the present.",

    "title": "Multiplicity and temporality of rationality: Constructing information for meningitis surveillance and response in Burkina Faso",
    "abstract": "Abstract Currently, better data is called for around the world to strengthen detection and response to epidemics. Health information systems are envisioned to provide such data in a coherent manner, but different rationalities of those engaged in the collection and use of data, often lead to fragmentation. In this article we present a socio-technical analysis of the multiple flows of information construction for disease surveillance. Our study is based on fieldwork done in Burkina Faso in West Africa during 2015–2017. The case concerns meningitis control in Burkina Faso focusing on two flows in its meningitis surveillance and response system: (1) data flow from health worker’s initial record on the first contact with the patient to the national level statistics compilation office, (2) substance and related data flows from the sample extracted by the health worker to the laboratories and their reporting of the test results. Drawing from the field of sociology of knowledge and technology, we base our analytical framework on four key concepts: circulating reference, multiplicities, rationalities, and temporalities. While circulating reference and multiplicities concern the “how” of information construction, rationalities and temporalities focus the attention on the “why”, reflecting the positions of different actors. Our findings show that viewed over time, fragmentation also gives rise to coherence in the information system. Providing “good” data follows a “temporality of rationality”, where data which are considered useful are highly affected by when they are needed, by whom, and for what purpose. Taken together, this framework provides for the development of sociologically grounded research on the how and why of information construction, which is also critical for improving the practice of disease surveillance.",

    "title": "Perceptual Differences in Approaches to Censorship: Information Intermediaries and the Implementation of Law",
    "abstract": "Censorship exists wherever there is preselection of information made available to a particular group of potential users-that is, wherever there is an information intermediary between the information source and the user. Therefore, one cannot ask whether or not there should be censorship. Nor is it realistic to declare that freedom of expression should override censorship. A more useful approach is to ask what checks and balances should be in place to ensure freedom of expression and other basic information rights in the face of the necessity and reality of the information selection process. Two forms of legal intervention have been used to create our current regime. This article first examines delegation of the censoring/selecting power to particular intermediaries in the information cycle. Historically, power to select appropriate information for dissemination was delegated to the ''censors,'' and examples of this approach continue in our law in such areas as access and copyright legislation and in unlegislated areas of the law such as confidential information. Second, the paper examines situations where the law regulates the censoring activity itself. In situations such as libel and obscenity, for example, our law preempts the intermediary by dictating the decision itself. The law, however, does not necessarily mirror actual decisions being made by information intermediaries. Empirical evidence suggests that selection/censorship decisions, which the current law might have been expected to affect, may be being made by other intermediaries and on other criteria than theoretical examination of the law would lead one to expect. These ''extralegal'' forms of censorship can be very effective, but are we content to leave those decisions without legal control? The article concludes that more strategic empirical analysis of our current legal attempts to create effective checks and balances on the censoring decisions made by intermediaries will assist us in further law reform attempts.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the category of \"Woman\" within the metastructure of a system of knowledge organization. We trace the subject scheme used to list books about women in a standard bibliographic guide over the first three-quarters of the twentieth century.Building on the feminist critique of subject representation, our analysis documents how the category was continually constructed over time, providing evidence of multiplication, isolation, and confusion in the process. The outcome is a framework that fails to capture the complex nature of knowledge about women and conceals relationships to the larger body of knowledge. The case of this legacy system exemplifies problems associated with representing the complexity and integration of knowledge and provides a basis for considering the potential residual impacts of current information organization and navigation systems.",

    "abstract": "In the era of social media, the notion of immaterial labor or free labor can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, Hardt and Negri argue, immaterial labor as labor creates immaterial products. On the other hand, free labor can be understood as unpaid labor that is voluntarily given. Fuchs combines the theories of free labor and Hardt and Negri's concept of the multitude with audience commodity theory in an innovative Marxist analysis of the Internet. In this perspective we critique Fuchs's argument for considering social networking sites as the scene of capitalist exploitation of free labor. We argue that Fuchs reduces the user interactions on the Internet to its economic function and so dismisses its democratic implications. In so doing he ignores the human significance of online interaction as a new public sphere.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the impact of electronic commerce in retailing. Four retail formats are examined: in-store, catalog, cable TV, and the World Wide Web. One hundred and twenty products were ''shopped'' across the four formats to identify distinctions between them on key product characteristics including price, product description and display, time to locate, and delivery. The study suggests some fundamental differences between the formats in terms of the degree of interactivity, the level of information supplied about the product, the ability to compare products, and the degree of human intermediation. The results show a significant difference in product description, shopping availability, speed of delivery, and time taken to shop between the four formats. Total cost of the product was not significantly different across the four formats. The development of cyber equivalents was also explored. Cyber equivalents involve the use of electronic means to simulate the shopping experience. These include the ...",

Comparing digital divide indicators with other indicators of social inequality (life expectancy, infant mortality), the analysis shows that high ICT growth rate improved well-being in developing countries and reduced some world inequalities. This methodology enables researchers, policy makers, and business managers how to draw new insights from existing data, including monitoring the attainment of targets.",

    "title": "Universal Service Obligation in the Age of Broadband",
    "abstract": "The saturation of telephony in major urban areas and the political pressures to accelerate broadband facilities into rural areas are leading to the inclusion of rural broadband within the universal service obligation (USO) agenda. There are questions on the extent to which broadband should be included in the USO schema. This article aims to explore the conceptual foundations underpinning the inclusion of broadband within the USO, and thereby to create a framework within which some of these questions can be examined. Two criteria for service inclusion are highlighted: information and communication technology (ICT) as an enabler for development and as a positive externality. In light of these criteria, the importance of building networks aligned to the ability to use of the target population is emphasized. At the same time, the merit of building out fiber-optic networks in advance of absorptive capability is also discussed using the criteria of temporality of build-out and the performance discontinuities of different generations of technologies. This creates a rationale for the build-out of fiber-optic networks using the USO funds. Along with the fiber-optic network, a frugal wireless network is also advocated to immediately stem the digital divide and prepare the population for high-speed connectivity. The telecom infrastructure as per this approach is both commercially and environmentally viable.",

    "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate in community informatics about the need for a stronger conceptual and theoretical base in order to give the field disciplinary cohesion and direction. By investigating the body of reflective thinking in information systems, researchers in community informatics can develop a more rigorous theoretical context for their work. Information systems can be considered as a fragmented adhocracy that allows many intellectual communities to coexist under its umbrella. A sympathetic reading of information systems offers an opportunity to community informatics, in spite of its different orientation, to address both social and technological issues in its theoretical framework. This framework would be based on a common language that expresses a shared ontology and epistemology with information systems. Such a framework then allows community informatics to fully address its information systems problem-solving agenda as well as its community problem-solving activities. Strengthening this dual agenda will allow community informatics to work effectively with both the technical and social design and implementation problems. But it also provides community informatics with an opportunity to contribute to a discourse within information systems in order to broaden the traditional information systems concept of organization and social action.",

    "abstract": "Technical systems of copyright protection are increasingly perceived as a supplement to the law against piracy of electronic publications. Legislative reforms have been introduced to prohibit tampering with these systems. This article analyzes the methods of protection employed by a sample of UK electronic publishers, and examines their views on technological protection and the increasing prospect of digital piracy. The study finds a divergent range of instruments of protection, and technological protection is not a preferred method. It also finds that the concern with piracy is of secondary importance when compared to the need to improve the 'time of market' of their products. In conclusion, the article concludes that the adoption of technological protection systems is just a business practice.",

    "abstract": "What explains the resurgence of U.S. international competitiveness in the 1990s? The previous decade can be characterized as one of intense U.S. concern about its declining international competitiveness. In this article, we argue that U.S. industry adopted a new industrial paradigm called \"Wintelism\" in response to competitive pressures from western Europe and East Asia. The essence of Wintelism is a reliance on open but owned technical standards and extensive outsourcing of component production to enable industrial structures to become less vertically and more horizontally integrated. Countries like the United States that pursued a modified regulatory state approach to structuring state-societal relationships found it easier to adopt this new paradigm than countries that pursued the developmental state approach.",

    "title": "Increase in Telecommunications Expenditure and the Migration of Consumption Online: The Case of South Korea",
    "abstract": "Using longitudinal time-series data, this article analyzes the causes of the recent sharp increase in household expenditure on telecommunications in South Korea with an almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model. The analysis shows that the Korean household demand for telecommunications has become highly price elastic following structural changes associated with the rapid diffusion of mobile phones and the Internet during 1998–2008. Following these structural changes, telecommunications services have become complements for transportation, books and printed matter, and culture and recreation services, but substitutes for culture and recreation durable goods. Consequently, one important reason for the increase in the expenditure on telecommunications in Korea is the migration of many services from offline to online by means of telecommunications.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social informatics research offers insights into the relationship between information technologies and social contexts. However, the material roles of information technologies, and their interplay with the agentic work of social actors, have not been addressed. Drawing on a field study of 37 mobile knowledge workers, we examine the dual material roles (enabling and constraining) played by information technologies in their work practices. We also investigate how these workers exert agency by fashioning multiple information technologies into a functioning digital assemblage. Although information technologies provide consequential affordances that enable mobilization of work across spaces and times, they simultaneously present design-driven, local, organizational, and temporal technological constraints that require mobile knowledge workers to engage in “configuration work” to make information technologies function effectively. Building on a sociomaterial perspective, we further discuss the interplay of information technologies and work practices enacted by mobile knowledge workers, in which both human and technological agency are materialized.",

    "title": "The Software Piracy Decision-Making Process of Chinese Computer Users",
    "abstract": "Drawing on Jones's ethical model and Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, this study proposes and tests an integrative model for the decision-making process underlying software piracy. Survey data collected from computer users in Guangzhou, China, in accordance with two software piracy scenarios under study—end user piracy and software counterfeiting—provide general support for the model. Consistent with major propositions of the theory of planned behavior, the findings show that Chinese computer users’ perceived moral intensity of software piracy significantly affects their corresponding moral recognition, judgment, and intention in both scenarios. Moreover, a direct influence of moral judgment on attitude toward software piracy is found in both scenarios. With regard to end-user piracy specifically, the findings further echo the theory of planned behavior by demonstrating a direct influence of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control on intention to pirate. As in the case of software counterfeiting, the findings, however, show that only attitude and subjective norm but not perceived behavioral control significantly influence this intention. Implications derived from this study suggest the potential to synthesize ethical and general social psychological concepts to explain software piracy behavior, and also furnish insights on how to deter software piracy in China.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Along with other cultural organizations, newspapers, through waves of digital disruption, have become subject to a dominant narrative of crisis. But newspapers have long participated in change. A constructivist approach, qualified by consideration of media materiality, draws attention to diverse but essential processes of innovation around them. We see a contraflow of migration from digital to print, opening up a shared media space; bonding strategies are bringing multimedia to ink on paper, while bridging via boundary objects such as QR (Quick Response) codes are connecting the two. Among other initiatives, development of automation of news production and experiments with transparency are further evidence of an active embrace of change by newspapers that calls into question the discourse on their demise. This analysis inductively develops a nuanced account of the role of the newspaper as an object and as an institution. It suggests a hybrid, multifaceted, enduring presence of print in the complex media ecology of the future.",

This article examines the 408 articles titled “Should I Stay or Should I Go?” and asks why there are so many articles with the same title. The academic culture of publication pressure can lead to researchers choosing creative titles, including popular song titles, to stand out from the crowd. Furthermore, risk assessment leads researchers to choose the same songs as others, because well-known, easy-to-understand cultural references are better rewarded than more obscure references. The collective outcome of this, many researchers choosing the same title for their articles, reflects the mass production of cultural products, wherein creativity is standardized and panders to the largest possible audience.",

    "abstract": "One foundational element of Rob Kling's research and writing is his critical perspective on the nature, role, and dynamics of computerization. His main argument was that one should view as dubious any statements that are not grounded in empirical evidence or theoretical analysis. Rob's work was replete with critical refutation, in which he challenged assumptions or statements about computerization and provided alternative interpretations. Much of his work delivered indictments against hyperbolic statements that claimed either utopian or dystopian outcomes from computerization. However, some of his own writings on emerging technologies tended to be dismissive and marginalizing, revealing in his own work some of the weaknesses he pointed out in others' rhetoric and writing. This article identifies intellectual traps inherent in critical perspectives that can catch even the most acute practitioners. The objective is to help elucidate and stabilize the epistemological foundations for Rob's critical perspective on the role of computerization.",

The longitudinal study adapts qualitative methods to understand community welfare and to foster participation in the design of communication systems. By exploring the perspectives of welfare practitioners and families, the importance of situated and mediated conversations in community care is identified. The facilitative conversation approach of the study then brings these community perspectives, as well as ICT perspectives, into design processes of e-enabled services.",

The strength of Taiwan's industry lies in its low-cost manufacturing capabilities, which in recent years have been undermined by rising wages.

The initiative aims at enhancing the flexibility of production and speeding up responses to the market through concerted actions by brand marketers, parts suppliers, and assemblers.

    "abstract": "Nicholas Carr has a problem and I think I have it, too. You might have it as well even if you don’t know it yet. How many times, sitting down in front of the computer to do some piece of significant writing, have you caught yourself drifting off into meaningless Web surfing, chatting with random friends just because they were online, or answering e-mails that could wait until later? Carr believes that these symptoms betray more than a mere lack of good primary-school education. He is convinced that this is a cultural illness. If we are to extrapolate, it marks a civilizational turning point equal in consequences to the calf worshipping that sent the Jewish people on their historical wanderings. Since it is related to the adoption of a new tool and of new practices associated with it, it is probably more appropriate to say that it is as eventful as the invention of the printing press, only in the reverse. What Gutenberg giveth, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, taketh away. The main claim of the book, illustrated with many and at times speculative warrants, is that the Web unravels ancient reading and writing practices. The intellectual journey is fascinating. Carr’s capacious, curious mind is wont to poach on many intellectual territories. This is a privilege to which he feels entitled by his digerati status sponsored by several previous best sellers. It can, however, be an invitation to sweeping generalizations, especially when Carr claims that the Internet is in the process of changing the most intimate mechanisms of our brains. This claim is part of a very broad proposition, not unlike that depicted in a central episode of Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In it, Frollo, the Defender of Faith and old order, pointing a bony, accusatory finger at one of the first printed books, while gazing in nostalgic silence at the Notre Dame Cathedral, utters the memorable words: “This will kill, that. The book will kill the edifice.” In other words, democratizing access to knowledge through printing replaced churches and cathedrals both as institutions of knowledge and as direct communicative channels. All that was dispensed by the clergy in carefully choreographed mass services, declaimed in sermons, or illustrated in the stained windows became in time the object of leaflets, booklets, and books that came in all sizes, bindings, and prices. Carr believes that it is now the turn of print media to be sacrificed by networked computers and hyperlinked content on the altar of change. An act equivalent to the killing of a god, the ritual immolation of old media by the new one is laden with three unintended, negative consequences. The first is that as we adopt always on media of communication, books become obsolete containers for knowledge, both physically and, more importantly, as a genre. Why publish a book, when you can disseminate your ideas online, on a blog, on Facebook, or on Wikipedia? This leads to the second consequence, the disappearance of an old set of intellectual practices. As we cease writing or using books for learning, we cease reading or writing in a sustained, focused, introspective manner. We turn our very own selves from personalities with a clear and subtle inner architecture, finely crafted through formal education, to “pancake people—spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button,” in the words of the essayist and playwright Richard Foreman (quoted on p. 196). The third consequence, which is the most risqué and speculative, is that in abandoning books and embracing new intellectual “grazing” practices, our brains become conditioned only to accept and consume information in small, disjointed bits and eventually would be able to process anything else.

    "abstract": "While social robots are the creation of human beings, it is not obvious what kinds of conversation people desire to have with computer-based devices. Progressive improvements in speech recognition, natural language parsing, and physical embodiment are making it technologically possible for social robots to engage with humans in essentially the full range of conversational modes that we do with one another. However, when we examine the variety of possible (human) linguistic functions, we discover reasons people may not wish for total verisimilitude when interacting linguistically with robots. Informational and empathetic functions are likely to be more welcomed than those involving social control or critique.",

    "abstract": "Web-based and theoretical studies often claim that Internet use can mobilize political participation, while survey-based studies generally conclude that Internet use will normalize political participation. This article aims to offer some reflections on the discrepancies between these mobilization and normalization theses. The authors argue that mobilization claims tend to focus on manifestations online in specific cases, whereas normalization theses are normally built on assessments of general Internet use patterns. Consequently, more specific surveys must be employed to evaluate the nature of political Internet use. Based on such a specific survey (n= 819), the authors investigate the use of two online vote advice applications (VAAs) during the 2006 Dutch parliamentary elections. VAAs are increasingly popular in democracies worldwide, especially among a group that is often considered “apathetic” about electoral politics: youth. With structural equation modeling, however, the authors find that the use of the Dutch VAAs fits the mobilization thesis among youth and the normalization thesis among older people.",

First, it considers the change in the perceived source of value of the music commodity going from tangible to intangible formats. Then, it tracks the trade-offs made by music consumers who exchange purchasing recordings for subscribing to music download and streaming services, and notes the imbalances in favor of the intellectual property rights owners. Then, it analyzes the features that appeal to the collector's psyche enough to capture the collector into a “digital enclosure.” It concludes with an analysis of the incommensurability between the activities of the music collector and those of the music service user.",

    "title": "The Contemporary Appeal of Artificial Companions: Social Robots as Vehicles to Cultural Worlds of Experience",
    "abstract": "  “Universal projection” is the term Thomas Luckmann uses to denote man's innate capacity to project his own “living body” onto everything he encounters in the world, and Luckmann lists a number of qualities that cancel the projection. For example, the lack of perceptible transformations on the outside of an object is perceived as an indication of the absence of a responsive inside. This list can serve as a how-not-to guide to building that piece of advanced technology known nowadays as an “artificial companion.” Drawing the border of the social world alongside that of the human world—which is typical of Western modernity—is not an ontological given but rather an evolutionary outcome, that is, a result of social construction. The de-socialization of large parts of the life-world leads to its de-animation, which is closely linked to the emergence and organization of a separate religious symbolic reality. The tendency to endow objects with qualities reminiscent of living subjects contrasts markedly with this. The possibility of programming advanced machines in accordance with one's own wishes, and machines' “ability to learn,” appear to play an important role in the ascription process. Social scientists recognize one of the origins of this development in the meta-process of individualization. From a psychoanalytical perspective, modern Westerners are suffering from relationship fatigue. This fatigue prompts us to endeavor to substitute human relationships with relationships with “nonhumans.” Mediatized communication practices are seen to have a supportive effect in this regard. The article discusses some of these interpretations and contrasts them with an alternative hypothesis on the appeal of artificial companions.",

    "title": "Toward a Longitudinal Model of e-Commerce: Environmental, Technological, and Organizational Drivers of B2C Adoption",
    "abstract": "Despite the important benefits for firms of commercial initiatives on the Internet, e-commerce is still an emerging distribution channel, even in developed countries. Thus, more needs to be known about the mechanisms affecting its development. A large number of works have studied firms' e-commerce adoption from technological, intraorganizational, institutional, or other specific perspectives, but there is a need for adequately tested integrative frameworks. Hence, this work proposes and tests a model of firms' business-to-consumer (called B2C) e-commerce adoption that is founded on a holistic vision of the phenomenon. With this integrative approach, the authors analyze the joint influence of environmental, technological, and organizational factors; moreover, they evaluate this effect over time. Using various representative Spanish data sets covering the period 1996–2005, the findings demonstrate the suitability of the holistic framework. Likewise, some lessons are learned from the analysis of the key building blocks. In particular, the current study provides evidence for the debate about the effect of competitive pressure, since the findings show that competitive pressure disincentivizes e-commerce adoption in the long term. The results also show that the development or enrichment of the consumers' consumption patterns, the technological readiness of the market forces, the firm's global scope, and its competences in innovation continuously favor e-commerce adoption.",

Electronic international banking networks now provide the economic infrastructure for the ''global village'' as millions of financial transactions are processed daily. This article describes the world system based on the financial transactions of an international credit card network. Using transaction data from the third quarter of 1995, a network analysis produced structural findings similar to those found for the international telecommunications and trade networks. These results indicate that the world's monetary flow system is composed of a single group with the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Canada at the core and the former members of the Eastern Block and less developed countries at the periphery. Additionally, a number of nations are marginal in the network with only a single link to a core member of the network.",

As we have seen with other domains such as intellectual property and trade, policies that influence privacy and civil liberties are increasingly resulting from international policy dynamics. This article presents a number of these policy mechanisms used to take advantage of international dimensions of our current environment. These mechanisms include policy laundering, modeling, and forum shifting. Using these mechanisms, policies are being developed outside of national deliberative forums and then adopted locally in the interests of national governments. A number of policy instances are presented, tracing the influence of national and international actors, and the implications for national discourse. The article concludes with discussion of some implications for an open society.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the rhetorical notion of ethos, or a believable character, in the context both of classification schemes, or means of organizing documents, and of the resource collections that make use of those schemes. Ethos, the article contends, explains how a particular audience is more or less likely to accept the interpretive frame that classification or collection inscribes on its contents. Two case studies, one of a classification and one of a resource collection that incorporates a classification, show how these communicative artifacts can generate ethos despite their lack of typical textual mechanisms, such as linear narrative. The article concludes by suggesting that properties of collections—their synthesis of multiple, often independent parts, their continuous versioning—stretch the basic idea of ethos itself, and the notion of synthetic ethos is proposed to better encompass these properties.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Inclusion of open resources that employ a peer-generated approach is changing who learns what, from whom, and via what means. With these changes, there is a shift in responsibilities from the course designer to motivated and self-directed learner-participants. While much research on e-learning has addressed challenges of creating and sustaining participatory environments, the development of massive open online courses calls for new approaches that go beyond the existing research on participatory environments in institutionally defined classes. We decenter institutionally defined classes and broaden the discussion to the literature on the creation of open virtual communities and the operation of open online crowds. We draw on literatures on online organizing, learning science, and emerging educational practice to discuss how collaboration and peer production shape learning and enable “crowdsourcing the curriculum.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract At present, the politics of digital tools are predominantly discussed in terms of the data they collect, analyze, and circulate. Through my analysis of electronic ankle monitors’ visual characteristics, I widen the scope of investigation to consider how the visuality of digital tools’ form factor – the size and shape of computing hardware – also contributes to their politics. I discuss five major impacts the visuality of electronic ankle monitors’ physical form has upon their wearers’ lives: (1) lack of differentiation in the aesthetics of monitors across different types of wearers (spanning from criminal justice to immigration detention) leads wearers to be considered “dangerous criminals,” by default; (2) monitors limit wearers’ ability to “pass” in society; (3) monitors expand the set of surveillors beyond government officials to also include the public; (4) monitors compromise wearers’ privacy; (5) monitors associate wearers with older practices of visually marking people normative society has labeled dangerous. Based on this analysis, I argue two points. First, that the visuality of electronic ankle monitors’ form factor expands the harms wearers experience beyond those engendered by the device’s primary use as a remote geo-temporal tracking tool used by government organizations. Second, the case study of electronic ankle monitors evidences the need to develop laws and policies that seek to regulate the visual properties of digital tools as well as the data they generate.",

Telecommunications policy and practice is changing significantly in many countries and at the international level. Tensions and conflict are identified as taking place on four levels: conflict over underlying values, conflict between and among different industry groups, political conflict among nations, and an emerging trade politics related to the application of services trade principles and rules to telecommunications and information services. These levels of tension/conflict should not be treated as distinct and mutually exclusive, but rather as overlapping and interactive, emphasizing the complex and increasingly serious nature of this important issue.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of frameworks within which Internet users can contribute nontextual information constitutes a serious obstacle to government attempts to accurately censor and monitor Internet traffic. This development, as seen in the explosive growth of frameworks such as Second Life, YouTube, and Wikipedia, could lead to a transfer of regulatory power away from heavily regulated Internet Service Providers in nondemocratic regimes, into the hands of intermediaries that are more likely to uphold freedom of expression. Thereby, a development toward increasingly enframed and nontextual information can promote freedom of expression even in traditionally nondemocratic regimes. I analyze this development with regard to its possible implications for freedom of expression, online crime, and the role of private companies in international politics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article we empirically test stage models of e-government development. We use Lee's classification to make a distinction between four stages of e-government: informational, requests, personal, and e-democracy. We draw on a comprehensive data set on the adoption and development of e-government activities in 510 Dutch municipalities over the period 2004–2009. Our results show that progression through stages of e-government is mostly linear. However, it seems that a single dimension is insufficient to explain e-government development at the level of more specific features of e-government. Our analysis demonstrates that municipalities sometimes adopt certain e-government features at a later stage even if features of an earlier stage are not adopted at all. These findings suggest that municipalities can—at the level of e-government features—immediately proceed to later stages without having to pass through earlier stages. We conclude that stage models may have some value for benchmarking municipalities at the level of stages, but are inadequate in explaining or predicting the development of features at the different e-government stages.",

Much of the argumentation aims to negotiate the ethical conflicts that often emerge between these goals. Bakhtin argues that one can only strive for a bottom-up ethical wisdom built upon concrete examples, and disputes the possibility that rigid top-down application of universal rules constitutes ethical action. His perspective has key implications for ethical research practices. I illustrate this perspective at work through my recent fieldwork and writing practices in a virtual community. Research ethics for cyberspace are like research ethics for any other site. They should be situated, dialogic agreements that develop over time between researchers and the participants of the research study. It is unlikely that ...",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study employs a qualitative approach to examine whether and why some societal groups are disadvantaged more by their Internet use than others do. Due to the quantitative nature of most digital divide studies, thorough explanations for why different outcomes exist are lacking. Interviews were conducted with 48 Dutch families selected on the basis of educational level (high or low) and household characteristics (children and marital status). A distinction was made between the types of negative outcomes that families are confronted with and how they cope with those outcomes. The results show that the confrontation with negative outcomes of Internet use in itself seems similar for both educational groups. However, the way Internet users cope with negative outcomes differs between the two educational groups. Members of highly educated groups mostly try to take control themselves when faced with a negative outcome, while members of less educated groups often just experience negative outcomes and do not remedial actions.",

    "abstract": "Developing countries are home to more than 80% of the world's population, and are the site for growing use of e-commerce. There are theoretical claims that e-commerce could bring significant benefits to firms in developing countries, but we know very little empirically about the actual outcomes of e-commerce implementation. Our article addresses this gap in knowledge through a survey of 92 businesses in South Africa, all of which have moved beyond the basic stage of e-commerce. The findings indicate that e-commerce benefits are, by and large, limited to improvements in intra- and interorganizational communications. More strategic benefits relating to market access, customer/supplier linkages or cost savings were not found in the majority (more than 80%) of organizations surveyed. This therefore limits the likelihood of broader benefits such as incorporation into global supply chains, disintermediation, and improved competitiveness. Turning this somewhat disappointing e-commerce picture around requires a multiprong strategy aimed at building the resources and capabilities of businesses, developing electronic-mediated business routines with partners and customers, and addressing national e-readiness and global trade regulation issues.",

    "abstract": "One interesting problem arising from Kling and Iacono's pioneering work on computerization movements (CMs) is the question of empirically determining a movement's success or failure. This article questions the question and argues that it is based on two assumptions that upon closer examination seem problematic. The first is that Kling and Iaconco's concept of a CM is sufficient to cover the range of CMs. Their approach to CMs is explicated, pointing out three ways in which it is limited, concluding that it should be reconceptualized. The second is that CMs are similar enough so that a single set of criteria is sufficient to judge the success or failure of any given CM. Using a heuristic analysis to examine a set of 41 CMs, a typology is introduced demonstrating that there are important differences among CMs. The article concludes that since a single set of criteria is no longer appropriate, different sets of criteria are needed to evaluate the success or failure of different types of CMs.",

This study analyzes determinants of technology availability and utilization in China's 31 administrative units using data on technology adoption and socioeconomic factors. It examines the extent of spatial autocorrelation on technology levels and regression residuals, and provides exploratory spatial cluster analysis of technology attributes interpreted by four regional policy approaches. An exploratory conceptual model is established, based on diffusion of innovations theory and prior digital divide research. Regression findings indicate the most significant determinant of technology availability and utilization is export commodities value. This is followed by published books, tertiary employment, non-state-owned employment, and innovation funds of enterprises. The conceptual model is discussed in light of these findings and suggestions are offered for China's technology policy.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of technology policy to economic and industrial development has become a subject of debate between those who argue that market forces should determine how technology is produced and used and those who believe that government has a role in supporting investment in technology use and the development of high‐technology industries.

It also analyzes the relationship between various environmental factors and computer production and looks at the interaction between environment and policy. It finds three types of environmental factors associated with level of computer production: human resources, in the form of scientists and engineers; the presence of complementary industries, particularly electronics production; and expenditures on research and development. It also finds that hardware production is higher in countries with nati...",

    "abstract": "The notion of “critical making” suggests a new form of design, through which the political qualities of an issue are materialized by participatory means. In this essay I trace and describe this process through the Growbot Garden project—a design project directed at reimagining agricultural technologies to support small-scale agriculture. Through a discussion of this project I draw out the ways that politics were actively projected onto and through artifacts by the participants. In effect, these artifacts were a material expression of their desires and commitments. By creating these artifacts, the participants enacted a novel mode of “doing” political design as a collaborative and public endeavor of articulation.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses how political factors influence the outcome of improvisations. Improvisations are unexpected actions rooted on intuition and aimed at solving particular crisis. It is argued that the effectiveness of an act of improvisation is greatly influenced by political factors. Those performing the improvisation require being in a position of power,and the discourse that follows the improvisation has political connotations. The argument is developed through the discussion of concepts of power and improvisation and through the analysis of a case study. The case study concerns the outsourcing of the administrative information systems of the two largest hospitals of a Latin American country. The contributions of the article are twofold: (1) It identifies the relationship between power and improvisations and (2) it draws practical lessons on how to manage outsourcing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article we consider the notion of digital global public good and articulate our understanding of it. Against this conceptual foil, we examine the development of DHIS2, a global health platform inspired by public goods, focusing on the paradoxes that arise in the scaling process. We find that the scaling dynamics played out differently at the macro and micro levels, giving rise to the following paradoxes: addition of new functionalities to cater to the universe of users across the world (macro level) works counter to the needs of users in particular locations (micro level); responsiveness to the requests of the donors with a global view (macro level) distorts the production process, as the voices of users, situated in remote locations in developing countries, are not adequately heard; the system needs to be simultaneously relevant across the global (macro level) and the local (micro level), when the former calls for decontextualization and the later (re)contextualization. We then discuss challenges these paradoxes create with regard to attaining non-rivalry and non-exclusion, the defining characteristics of a public good.",

    "title": "An Information-Based Model of NGO Mediation for the Empowerment of Slum Dwellers in Bangalore",
    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in population coupled with the seemingly irreversible flow of people from rural to urban areas, cities in the developing world are acquiring unplanned and uncontrolled squatter settlements at their peripheries. The provision of urban services and infrastructure in these cities is hampered by the failure of formal bureaucratic government institutions to collect appropriate information for planning, especially in areas that fall outside the remit of the formal networks. A growing number of grass-roots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have sought to rectify the situation by acting as intermediaries between urban slum dwellers and the government. In this article, we review the literature on forms of intermediation by NGOs and other organizations working for citizen groups. We then present a case study of Jana Sahayog, an NGO operating in the slums of Bangalore, which employs an information-based model of NGO-mediated intervention. The article describes the various information-based initiatives that Jana Sahayog has undertaken to open up channels of communication between citizens and the government. Jana Sahayog's experience offers valuable lessons for NGOs operating in other parts of the world.",

    "abstract": "The role of online communities in empowerment has received only limited attention in theory-based empirical research, with the focus predominantly on individual empowerment of people in online support groups. This article proposes that to analyze the empowering opportunities of online communities, both individual and collective dimensions of empowerment need to be taken into account, considering the suggestion that the relationship between the two can be an opposing one. The empowerment theory developed in community psychology allows the analysis of empowerment outcomes in the realm of online communities on the psychological level; however, to understand the conditions of congruency between individual and collective empowerment, we introduce the mechanism of communicative interaction. Hypotheses deduced from empowerment theory are contested with the hypotheses of our complementary approach and tested on a convenience sample of online community members. Results indicate that the psychosocial understanding of empowerment processes in the field of community psychology might get new insights by considering a communication perspective for such processes.",

    "abstract": "The main premise of this article is that in information societies generally, and in virtual social contexts particularly, a distinctive style of interaction to facilitate the communication of difference, heterotopic communication , has emerged. It rests on two cultural foundations: an ideological belief in the positive, socially integrating power of communication, and a prevailing ethic of instrumental rationality, subjective individualism, and strategically practiced self-interest. The former is demonstrated by the use of simulation and spectacle as sources of information; exhibitionism/voyeurism as a communicative style; and the awareness of surveillance. The latter is seen in the competitive use of knowledge as a commodity; a surface globalism masking deep parochialism; lateral as well as vertical information inequity; and the use of public versus private as strategies for engagement rather than as spaces. Those who engage in heterotopic communication resort to their ''own devices'' both in the sense o...",

    "abstract": "A considerable body of literature has demonstrated-- empirically as well as analytically--that information systems need to be situated to the local context of use. Yet for infrastructural information systems that span numerous contexts spread out globally, this is literally prohibitive. For these systems to work, it is necessary to strike a balance between sensitiveness to local contexts and a need to standardize across contexts. We analyze a key element in this, namely, spelling out the (largely invisible) \"costs\" that the different actors pay to achieve working solutions. Empirically, we draw from an ongoing case study. We analyze the attempts of a maritime classification company with 5500 employees located in 300 sites in 100 countries to develop an infrastructural information system to support the surveying of ships globally. We elaborate design implications and concepts relevant to developing information infrastructures that also apply to the context of developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Are new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet and the World Wide Web a boon to poor countries and poor people around the globe, enabling them to leapfrog their underdevelopment and become equal partners in an emerging global order? Or, have the new technologies , introduced into an asymmetric global system, already become an engine of greater social inequality? There are few questions more important to the evolution of the global system, and few questions on which there is less agreement. Yes, the new ICTs are unequivocally an engine of inequality, according to the highly respected UN Development Program’s (UNDP) annual publication, “The Human Development Report.” The UNDP  nds that, “The Internet is contributing to an ever-widening gap between rich and poor which has now reached ‘grotesque’ proportions” (UNDP Press Release, 12 July 1999, p. 1). But according to the highly respected annual “World Development Report” (WDR) of the World Bank the new ICTs are quite positive and have tremendous equalizing potential. The WDR points to dozens of stories showing that telemedicine, distance education, and falling ICT costs are having positive and dramatic impacts on the growth prospects of poor people and poor countries (Knowledge for Development, World Development Report, 1998/99). It seems that for the World Bank, the glass is more than half-full. For the UNDP, it is less than half-empty. If one thing is clear, it is that highly contested questions have bubbled to the surface regarding the impacts of the new ICTs on the poor. It is precisely at such moments that research and scholarship can make a valuable global contribution . For example, researchers can rephrase the World Bank-UNDP dispute as follows: “What will it take for countries and international organizations to achieve the positive outcomes described by the Bank and avoid the negative consequences described by the UNDP?” And,",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT About a decade ago, intellectual property started getting systematically treated as a national security threat to the United States. The scope of the threat is broadly conceived to include hacking, trade secret theft, file sharing, and even foreign students enrolling in American universities. In each case, the national security of the United States is claimed to be at risk, not just its economic competitiveness. This article traces the U.S. government's efforts to establish and articulate intellectual property theft as a national security issue. It traces the discourse on intellectual property as a security threat and its place within the larger security dialogue of cyberwar and cybersecurity. It argues that the focus on the theft of intellectual property as a security issue helps justify enhanced surveillance and control over the Internet and its future development. Such a framing of intellectual property has consequences for how we understand information exchange on the Internet and for the future of U.S. diplomatic relations around the globe.",

    "title": "Critique of Information, by S. Lash. London: Sage Publications, 2002. xii + 234 pp. $37.95. ISBN 0-7619-5269-1",
    "abstract": "Critique of Information is an important book of social theory that deserves a wide audience among students of media and society, although its dense conceptual structure and style of argument may challenge readers. It will certainly send them reaching for their copies of earlier work by McLuhan, Bell, Habermas, Giddens, Luhmann, Deleuze and Guattari, Lefebvre, Latour, Haraway, Poster, Luke, and a half dozen more; here, Scott Lash has attempted a major feat of theoretical synthesis, and to a great extent succeeds. Unlike more skeptical observers such as Frank Webster, Lash takes the phrase “information society” seriously, even literally. He identifies what he considers to be the key characteristics of information in a technologically-saturated media environment (embeddedness, nonlinearity, flow, space/time compression, real-time circulation and use) and then argues that because contemporary society itself is intrinsically informational, it too has these same characteristics. Crucially, information is not in society or related to society; information is society, and vice versa. This development has been facilitated by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs), so that all aspects of social life are, to echo Bruno Latour, sociotechnical, with social action and technical infrastructure inextricably tied in codetermining networks of people and things. The centerpiece of Lash’s argument is his departure from critical theory of both the “German dialectic[s] and French post-structural aporetic[s]” schools (p. 8) to contend that today there is no longer any transcendental, objective, or privileged position from which critique or social analysis can be undertaken. If society is intrinsically informational, and the analyst is inescapably part of the society, so too must the analyst and the analysis be informational, as tied up with and characterized by the nature of information as every other social entity or phenomenon. As Lash repeatedly insists, “The critique of information is in the information itself” (p. 220); “Information critique must be critique without transcendentals” (p. 9). By the same token, fundamental social phenomena like power, capital, sociality, and so on are also essentially informational and share the same character. Lash makes the case that in such an environment power is exercised not so much as exploitation of certain classes, groups or regions by others, but (following Castells) by exclusion from the flows and means of communication: “Previously exploited, semi-skilled and ethnic minority working classes become increasingly irrelevant to informationalaccumulation, which now takes place not on their backs but behind their backs” (p. 5). Therefore, Lash believes, the resistance or response to power must be informational too—real-time, nonlinear, a matter of navigation through networks and flows. Overall, Lash draws from an extraordinary range of contemporary social theories to contend that there must be a new form and practice of social analysis and critique. Due to the sheer velocity, constant flow, and succession of information (bits, images, text, sounds, etc.), social critics and analysts no longer have the luxury of holding variables constant, of suspending action in principle in order to make abstract comparisons, of focusing narrowly on a single phenomenon or relationship at a time. Conventional causal models must be replaced by “additive” models or theories where “and” is the central operator rather than “because.” (This would also imply that subtractivity is a corollary; if the propelling dynamic of networks and flows is cumulative, there would also seem to be a counterdynamic of breakdown and loss that permits further accumulation to occur. Lash doesn’t state this explicitly, but it is suggested by his claims about power exercised as exclusion; social groups have “spaces to dis-identify as well as re-identify” [p. 5].) The intriguing possibility he suggests is a move away from conventional forms of social analysis and critique and toward conceptual art as the new critical practice, or perhaps a merger of art and critique. Given the recent fixation of contemporary artists on new media forms and production techniques, and the centrality of social criticism",

    "abstract": "I conduct a textual analysis of a digital memorial to understand the ways in which the digital sphere has disrupted or altered material and aesthetic displays of death and the associated genre of discourses surrounding death. I first use Morris's history of traditional gravescapes to situate digital memorials within their broader historical context. I then draw on the functional genre of eulogies, in particular Jamieson and Campbell's systematic description of eulogies, as a textual analytic to understand Facebook's unique memorializing discourse. My analysis suggests that the affordances of the Internet allow for a peculiar dynamic wherein the bereaved engage in communication with the deceased instead of with each other and yet strengthen the communal experience, as their personal communications are visible to the entire community. While the digital memorials lack the permanence of traditional gravescapes, the ongoing conversation they foster sublimates death into the process of communication.",

The legal resolution of the anonymity issue also is closely bound up with other difficult and important legal issues: campaign finance laws, economic regulation, freedom of speech on the Internet generally, the protection of intellectual property, and general approaches to privacy and data protection law. The legal constraints on anonymous communication, and the constitutional constraints on those who would regulate it further, thus should be considered in tandem with the policies animating regulation and also their side effects.",

    "abstract": "This essay compares two proposals (Cavazos, 1994; King, this issue) relating to whether and how CMC researches should cite electronic messages used as data. Although the proposals prescribe opposite solutions, both contain similiar assumptions about the nature of CMC (e.g., that it is homogeneous, that members of a \"virtual community\" have shared agendas) and about the nature of research (e.g., that it is content focused; that it is ideally consensual; that it should not affect the researched in any way). These assumptions are argued to reflect discipline-specifc biases that exclude other legitimate forms of CMC research. Two examples are discussed of research paradigms that are excluded by the guidelines: linguistic analysis in the positivist tradition, and critical analysis in the social realist tradition. The critical paradigm in particular raises a number of additional ethical considerations not addressed by the proposed guidelines. It is suggested that the existing ethical guidelines within each disc...",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, I argue that a key problem for understanding the social ramifications of software is an implicit separation of software programs into two separate elements: expressive aspects, which are seen as socially driven and affectual, and functional aspects, understood as scientific and rational. In order to overcome this binary, I develop an alternative framework that examines the ways software expresses best practices, correct behaviors, and social organization. A key element of this framework is an understanding of software programs as simultaneously rhetorical and tangible objects. Given that Western society is dependent on sociotechnical systems in which software plays a crucial role, understanding the complex ways software expresses normative tasks, practices, and social orders is increasingly important.",

    "abstract": "Since its inception in the early 1990s, e-commerce has grown swiftly in Mexico, making inroads into some of the most dynamic sectors of the Mexican economy. The actual extent of e-commerce use, however, is still very limited, as diffusion is hindered by both the low income levels of most Mexican households and the fact that the overwhelming majority of business establishments are very small, lacking the resources to invest in computers and the business culture to go online. This article examines the emergence of e-commerce in Mexico arguing that the main drivers of the process have been the initiatives of large private firms and the work of specialized organizations. It concludes that this is not just a passing boom but a concrete step toward the rise of an Internet-based economy in Mexico along the lines of the New Economy that took shape in the United States in the 1990s and is assumed to spread into developing nations.",

    "abstract": "The term community is widely and often uncritically used to characterize groupings of people who meet in electronic forums (e-forums). The research reported here shows how the casual use of the term community to characterize these groups can actually undermine their transformation into forms of social organization that are justifiably characterized as communities. This article examines how transforming a group into a community is a major accomplishment that requires special processes and practices. Primary data come from a particular project, the Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), that aimed to develop \"communities of practice\" (CoPs) among high school science and mathematics teachers through an elaborate dedicated web site. We examine participants' behaviors in some of the differently structured forums within the ILF web site. While the project's developers expected CoPs to develop autonomously, there was no evidence of CoP formation in open public online forums. The article contrasts two approaches to building online communities that differ sharply: \"IT-led community development\" and \"IT-supported community development.\" The experience of the ILF project shows that IT-led strategies community development strategies are much more difficult to make workable than are the \"IT-supported\" strategies.",

This article examines how and why certain assumptions about Napster have gained greater currency while others have not. Our analytical approach involves an examination of discourse about Napster in several arenas—legal, economic, social, and cultural—and is informed by a conceptualization of Napster as an ongoing encounter between, rather than the accomplishment of, inventor(s), institution(s), and interest(s). While we recognize the value of empirical examinations of Napster's impact on firms and markets, as well as the proscriptive advice which it supports, we opt here for providing a contextualized understanding of the technology that complements rather than substitutes for empirical analyses of it.",

    "abstract": "While much has been written about marginalization as a structural phenomenon, there is little understanding of how the dynamics of marginalization unfold at the micro level in urban contexts. We seek to understand these micro-level marginalization processes via a comparative study of Bangalore, India, and Ronneby, Sweden. Our analysis highlights the important role that “mediators” such as governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international agencies play in ensuring the success of initiatives launched by national governments and international agencies for drawing disadvantaged groups into the information society.",

    "title": "Governing online platforms: From contested to cooperative responsibility",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Online platforms, from Facebook to Twitter, and from Coursera to Uber, have become deeply involved in a wide range of public activities, including journalism, civic engagement, education, and transport. As such, they have started to play a vital role in the realization of important public values and policy objectives associated with these activities. Based on insights from theories about risk sharing and the problem of many hands, this article develops a conceptual framework for the governance of the public role of platforms, and elaborates on the concept of cooperative responsibility for the realization of critical public policy objectives in Europe. It argues that the realization of public values in platform-based public activities cannot be adequately achieved by allocating responsibility to one central actor (as is currently common practice), but should be the result of dynamic interaction between platforms, users, and public institutions.",

    "title": "Creative Industries after the First Decade of Debate",
    "abstract": "It has now been over a decade since the concept of creative industries was first put into the public domain by the Blair Labour government's Creative Industries Mapping Documents in Britain. The concept has gained traction globally, but it has also been understood and developed in different ways in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North America, as well as through international bodies such as UNCTAD and UNESCO. A review of the policy literature reveals that although questions and issues remain around definitional coherence, there is some degree of consensus emerging about the size, scope, and significance of the sectors in question in both advanced and developing economies. At the same time, debate about the concept remains highly animated in media, communication, and cultural studies, with its critics dismissing the concept outright as a harbinger of neoliberal ideology in the cultural sphere. This article couches such critiques in light of recent debates surrounding the intellectual coherence of the concept of neoliberalism, arguing that this term itself possesses problems when taken outside of the Anglo-American context in which it originated. It is argued that issues surrounding the nature of participatory media culture, the relationship between cultural production and economic innovation, and the future role of public cultural institutions can be developed from within a creative industries framework and that writing off such arguments as a priori ideological and flawed does little to advance debates about twentieth-century information and media culture.",

    "abstract": "In November 2007, Dutch secondary school students revolted against a requirement known as the “1040-hour norm.” New Web technologies, like instant messaging, YouTube, and social networking sites, played an important role in the mobilization effort. In this article, the authors argue that these technologies facilitate a shift toward micromobilization by individuals and small groups. In this “1040-hour norm” case study, the authors analyze how the course of the political agenda-setting process is being transformed through the interplay between processes of meso- and micromobilization, and through new micro-to-mass media crossover effects. When supported by micromedia, the effects of micromobilization can create strategic surprises for traditional intermediary organizations and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "This special issue poses questions concerning death, afterlife and immortality in the age of the Internet. It extends previous work by examining current and emerging practices of grieving and memorializing supported by new media. It suggests that people's lives today are extended, prolonged, and ultimately transformed through the new circulations, repetitions, and recontextualizations on the Internet and other platforms. It also shows that publics are being formed and connected with in new ways, and new practices and rituals are emerging, as the traditional notions of the body are being challenged. We argue that these developments have implications for how people will be discovered and conceived of in the future. We consider possible extensions to the research presented here in terms of people, practices, and data. First, some sections of the population, in particular those who are the dying and populations in developing countries and the Global South, have largely been neglected to date. Second, practices such as (online) suicide and sacrilegious or profane behaviors remain largely uninvestigated. Third, the discussion of the management of the digital self after death has only begun. We conclude by posing further questions concerning the prospect of emerging cities of the dead.",

A review is presented of the context of evaluation of the value of information, with anecdotal evidence concerning its role.

The discussion of data covers the sources, the nature, and the structure of the data sets and provides a detailed listing of the data itself.

    "abstract": "The cadastre is an infrastructure of institutions, humans, and nonhumans. Its role in governance is the provision of a systematic organization of land ownership, rights, and responsibilities. The cadastral infrastructure's information needs to correspond to actual uses of land if it is to be of continued use in governance. In effect, as an important governmental information space, it needs to also correspond to geographic and social spaces. For many reasons the boundary objects making up the cadastral infrastructure can be unstable—delays in processing changes and conflicting competencies are commonplace. Larger instabilities including civil unrest, war, and persistent corruption produce profound asymmetries and distortions. Following centuries of disruption, ongoing attempts to augment cadastral infrastructures in post-socialist Central and Eastern Europe offer opportunities to probe and analyze the stabilization of cadastral infrastructures. Poland, which never saw complete collectivization and retained a cadastral infrastructure, offers an exemplary cadastral infrastructure for study, with its uniqueness bringing out many tensions still nascent in neighboring countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study assessed the construct and criterion validity of the short version of the Internet Skills Scale and examined whether its four dimensions – Operational, Information Navigation, Social, and Creative skills – are influenced by a higher-order dimension of general internet skills as one second-order factor. In 2018, a face-to-face survey comprising of the 20-item Internet Skills Scale and 22 other items related to digital inclusion was conducted in a sample of 814 internet users in Slovenia. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as other multivariate methods, showed that the Internet Skills Scale is characterized by high to adequate convergent and divergent validity. Acceptable criterion validity was observed for Operational and Information Navigation skills. In terms of measurement invariance, the data supported configural and metric invariance, whereas the scalar invariance was not fully confirmed, suggesting that older adults’ lower scores on the Creative skills items were not related to lower levels of internet skills in the same way as they were among younger individuals. Last, the results provided original evidence of the Internet Skills Scale as a second-order construct, meaning that a single summative Internet Skills Scale score could be created as an adequate measure of an individual’s internet skills.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this Perspective paper we propose a rethink on how we should approach digital and analog news. Although there are literatures that continue to focus on the many and varied characteristics of digital and analog news, we should not consider these as separate, opposing entities. In fact, the intertwining between the digital and the analog of news makes it difficult, if not impossible, to define separately what they are, even if this often is the practice in scholarly debate on news and journalism in new media. What we argue in this paper is that today, in opposition to binary definitions, it would be much more revealing, and also connected to actual media practices, to try to understand how much digital there is in the analog news and, vice versa, how much analog there is in digital news. This approach recognizes three dimensions in media platforms: digital, analog, and, between them, a cross-evolved, digitalized analog present in television, radio, and online newspapers. Recognizing these three dimensions enables us to explore more clearly the implications that the hybridization of digital and analog news has on the overall media system and on the state of news itself.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article uses online advertisements to gain retroactive insights into the use and disuse of wearable self-tracking technologies in everyday life. This is achieved by examining over 2700 listings for devices from manufacturers like Apple, Fitbit, and Garmin. These listings are sourced from an online secondhand marketplace—Gumtree Australia. In this exchange space, sellers often draw on existing retail product descriptions and aim to encourage prospective buyers with positive descriptions. Despite the “sale imperative” of these advertisements, item descriptions often feature disclosures about health goals, bodily capacities, and social expectations. This article identifies a system of for “values”—activity, social, financial, exchange—that inform advertisements for wearable self-tracking devices. Wearable devices are highly transient in the secondhand space. Yet, the apparent importance of undertaking personal self-tracking projects is constantly espoused, even as devices are passed on to new users.",

It focuses on the evaluations that were conducted with older adults in an assisted living studio in the United Kingdom (which was arranged as an open plan studio apartment), a UK residential care home, and an older couple's own home in the Netherlands over 2 days. It examines emergent adaptive human behaviour in human-robot interaction (HRI) to consider whether we are approaching the embodiment and functionality of service robots correctly. It discusses possible improvements that could be made at the systems level that better exploit people's natural ability to adapt and find workarounds to technologies and their limitations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stories about what living well means are critical both to the maintenance of existing ways of living and to the possibility of envisioning and transitioning toward fairer and more sustainable futures. The implications of the stories told on social media for the possibility of such futures have yet to be explored. In this article we explore how the use of hashtags on Instagram shapes the visibility and recognizability of understandings of the good life in the discursive field created by #goodlife on the platform. Using network analysis, we map the co-occurrence of hashtags in 793 posts tagged #goodlife to explore the formation of hashtag-based narrative and hyperlink patterns. The visibility and recognizability of narrative patterns within this discursive space are shaped by interactional conventions and by algorithmic infrastructure, favoring corporate interests over sustainable and fair livelihoods. However, we also identify themes that could support fairer and more sustainable understandings of living well and reassert their ongoing importance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research into hyperlink interaction patterns has been particularly interested in whether they integrate the online space or segregate it into “echo chambers.” Concentrating on contentious politics in national settings, the existing studies have mainly examined the relationships between domestic actors, mostly bloggers. This study seeks to expand the focus by including several actor types, allowing their connective actions to reach beyond national borders, and employing a comparative approach that contrasts high- with low-contentious contexts. Analyzing climate change hyperlink networks originating in the US and Switzerland, the results show that their transnational dimension plays a crucial role in polarizing the discourse, regardless of the specific political context. We find similar patterns that segregate climate advocates from skeptics and lead to distinct transnational relationships within the camps. The results demonstrate that countermovement actors in particular are able to forge strong transnational alliances.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aula is a mandatory public school platform in Denmark with more than two million users. The idea behind Aula was to provide a shared space for communication and cooperation around children, both within the school/municipality setting and between teachers and parents, while adhering to the requirements of EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. In this article we examine the incorporation of Aula in the daily practices of teachers, especially as they relate to children’s privacy and data protection. Based on qualitative interviews with nine teachers and four experts, and drawing on practice theory, platform theory, and theories on children’s privacy, we find that Aula – despite the intentions behind it – fails to support the complex nature of teachers’ work practices and, therefore, to provide a solid data protection framework for the children. As such, the teachers mainly view the platform as being conducive to their non-sensitive communication with parents and deploy a range of other digital tools to support, for instance, cooperation with colleagues. Consequently, gaps in children’s privacy and data protection arise.",

This study seeks to test whether individuals might be more open to political persuasion in this context, especially if they are exposed to political disagreement or discuss politics in a civil manner. Relying on survey data from the UK, results based on a moderated moderation model show that (a) social media news use predicts political persuasion on social media (direct effects) and, (b) discussion disagreement and civil reasoning moderate this relationship in two-way and three-way interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Networked social influence and strategic information manipulation are two social mechanisms fueling misinformation spread in online communities. However, it is unclear how these two mechanisms differ in their impacts. We conducted social network analyses on two online communities sharing misinformation concerning refugees in 2016 and COVID-19 in 2020. The results robustly showed that online misinformation spread is transitive and positively associated with members’ embedded authority (i.e., the extent to which members’ information is exclusively shared within the focal community). At the same time, strategic misinformation sharing by members of high community loyalty (i.e., targeted information sharing within the community) is less likely to gain momentum. The impact of bots on misinformation is contingent. Findings suggest that networked social influence is a more powerful driver of misinformation spread than strategic information manipulation.",

By analyzing a set of constitutive documents for the Wikipedian universe, including discussion about NPOV, the authors conclude that ambiguity is at the heart of the policy process on Wikipedia. The overarching conclusion is that ambiguity on Wikipedia is not extraneous, but a central ingredient of this wiki project's policymaking. Ambiguity naturally develops from the pluralist and nonhierarchic values of the culture that brought Wikipedia to life, and this conclusion requires that we reconsider the nature of “neutrality” practiced on Wikipedia.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article explores the specific textual strategies employed by Marvel Studios to construct insider and outsider audiences of the interlinked film series comprising the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It argues that Marvel Studios is borrowing storytelling strategies developed by Marvel Comics in the 1960s as a means of growing audiences for film franchises in a modular fashion. These strategies include the use of anticipatory postcredit sequences that serve as advertising teases for future releases; “Easter eggs,” or semi-hidden onscreen elements intended to be noticed only by certain viewers; crossovers, or the use of characters from one franchise in the film or television program of other characters; linked repercussions, narrative consequences that play out across multiple media properties; and modular story development, a development strategy intended to reduce economic risk. It is noted, ironically, that the strategies that have led to the current fascination with superhero films are the same ones that caused the collapse of interest in superhero comic books.",

    "title": "The information practices and politics of migrant-aid work in the US-Mexico borderlands",
    "abstract": "Abstract Numerous organizations work to provide humanitarian aid to undocumented migrants along the US-Mexico border—from running shelters in Mexico to placing water on migratory trails. Resistance to information-sharing between organizations (and to the public), especially through technologically mediated means, is common. However, some organizers and volunteers work across organizational boundaries and share information informally. Information secrecy is often justified by concerns that law enforcement authorities or anti-immigration activists might gain access to information, allowing them to harm, detain or remove migrants, or interfere with humanitarian work. The choices made about the collection and (non)disclosure of information are manifestations of what we call “liminal” information practices: such behaviors are unique to humanitarian volunteers working in the gray, ethical area between law enforcement and humanitarian values and action, and they are guided by the information politics at play within this context.",

    "abstract": "The dominant understanding of Internet censorship posits that blocking access to foreign-based websites creates isolated communities of Internet users. We question this discourse for its assumption that if given access people would use all websites. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates access blockage with social structures to explain Web users’ choices, and argue that users visit websites they find culturally proximate and that access blockage matters only when such sites are blocked. We examine the case of China, where online blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese Web usage patterns with those elsewhere. Analyzing audience traffic among the 1000 most visited websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography. Chinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such geolinguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and its degree of isolation. Our sociological investigation reveals a greater role of cultural proximity than access blockage in explaining online behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have examined the relationship between social network sites (SNSs) and the development of social capital. However, most studies to date have only considered college and adult populations. This study examines the patterns of SNS use in an urban, teenage sample in the United States. It tests the hypothesis that use of SNSs is related to higher levels of social capital. The results show that youth who use Facebook and Myspace report higher social capital in both their school and online relationships. In addition, the analysis suggests that distinct modes of SNS experiences are differentially related to bridging and bonding social capital. Time spent in SNSs is related to bridging capital, while positive or negative experiences are related to bonding capital. The study offers new insights into how youth experience SNSs and the relationship of that experience with their connection to the world.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the age of big data we need to think differently about privacy. We need to shift our thinking from definitions of privacy (characteristics of privacy) to models of privacy (how privacy works). Moreover, in addition to the existing models of privacy—the surveillance model and capture model—we need to also consider a new model: the datafication model presented in this article, wherein new personal information is deduced by employing predictive analytics on already-gathered data. These three models of privacy supplement each other; they are not competing understandings of privacy. This broadened approach will take our thinking beyond current preoccupation with whether or not individuals’ consent was secured for data collection to privacy issues arising from the development of new information on individuals' likely behavior through analysis of already collected data—this new information can violate privacy but does not call for consent.",

Five analytical criteria, i.e., technological, economic, occupational, spatial, and cultural, are used to define either information or information societies. Most definitions are concerned with quantitative measures, which fail to consider important qualitative dimensions of the criteria, though ironically, there is the widespread presumption that quantitative changes in information herald a new type of society, one qualitatively different from predecessors. Further, proponents of an information society operate with nonsemantic conceptions of information. Against this, when information is approached in common sense terms, that is, in terms of its meanings, then the prospects for an approa...",

    "abstract": "In “Shaping the Web: Why the Politics of Search Engines Matters,” Introna and Nissenbaum (2000) introduced scholars to the political, as well as technical, issues central to the development of online search engines. Since that time, scholars have critically evaluated the role that search engines play in structuring the scope of online information access for the rest of society, with an emphasis on the implications for a democratic and diverse Web. This article describes the thought behind search engine regulation, online diversity, and information bias, and it places these issues within the context of the technical and societal changes that have occurred in the online search industry. The author assesses which of the initial concerns expressed about online search engines remain relevant today and discusses how technical changes demand a new approach to measuring online diversity and democracy. The author concludes with a proposal to direct the research and thought in online search going forward.",

    "abstract": "Community of practice theory is inherently a social theory. As such it is distinct from more individualist accounts of human behavior, such as mainstream economics. Consequently, community of practice theory and economics favor different accounts of knowledge. Taking a community of practice perspective, this article challenges economists' attempts to reduce knowledge to information held by individuals and to reject tacit knowledge as mere uncodified explicit knowledge. The essay argues that Polanyi's notion of a tacit dimension affected numerous disciplines (including economics) because it addressed aspects of learning and identity that conventional social sciences overlooked. The article situates knowledge, identity, and learning within communities and points to ethical and epistemic entailments of community practice. In so doing it attempts to limit, rather than expand, the scope of community of practice analysis and to stress the difference, rather than the commonalities, between this and other apparently congenial forms of social analysis.",

This paper explores the relationships between offline and online modes of associational life and also analyzes offline and online interactions with local governments in the US context. Based on our empirical analyses of 1,203 respondents, we show that online participation is not simply an extension of offline participation, but can be distinguished in important ways. First, we find that political and community-oriented engagements cluster separately from more private-regarding engagements. Second, participants of online democratic engagement are not characterized by the SES markers associated with offline democratic engagement who are older, have higher incomes, and have lived in the community longer. Finally, we find significant links between democratic engagement with the political system and involvement with political associations (but not social and community-oriented associations).",

We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web's functioning in society, run counter to the basic architecture of the Web as well as to the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support for its growth and development.

    "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that the use of personal information in business and government puts individual privacy at risk. However, little is known about these risks-for instance, whether and how they can be measured, and how they vary across social groups and the sectors in which personal data are used. Unless we can gain a purchase on such issues, our knowledge of the societal effects of information technology and systems will remain deficient, and the ability to make and implement better policies for privacy protection, and perhaps for a more equitable distribution of risk and protection, will remain impaired. The article explores this topic, examining conventional paradigms in data protection, including the one-dimensional view of the ''data subject,'' that inhibit better conceptualizations and practices. It looks at some comparative survey evidence that casts light on the question of the distribution of privacy risks and concerns. It examines theoretical issues in the literature on risk, raising questi...",

    "abstract": "Stylistic practices in e-mail reflect an amalgam of social presuppositions about usage conventions and individual strategies for handling a new language medium. To understand how contemporary e-mail patterns have been forged and where they might be heading, this study examines the ways in which newly enfranchised language users in the past have balanced externally generated prescriptions for linguistic style with user-generated coping strategies in constructing spoken and written messages. Popular letter writing, the early telegraph, and early telephone behavior offer useful precedents for thinking about both e-mail messages themselves and the potential effects of language technology on broader language change.",

    "abstract": "The authors examine the determinants of information and communications technology (ICT) usage among low-income people in three developing countries: Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Using two composite indicators, they focus on cross-country differences and similarities in ICT usage across gender, age, education, and income levels. The authors’ analysis indicates that the single most important factor limiting the digitalization of low-income people in all three countries was lack of education. The impact of income itself was low although positive. Their findings also suggest that comprehensive measures that mix standard ICTs with very advanced ones can be misleading.",

    "abstract": "Internet Inquiry is not a step-by-step guide for performing online qualitative research; it is rather an invitation to reflect and discuss upon methods. It creates a conversation internally by the scholars and also motivates readers to think over their own research questions. This anthology is a collection developed around six chapters in which scholars discuss fundamental issues about the methodology and epistemology associated with conducting qualitative internet1 research. In each chapter the editors address a key question, which is answered by an experienced qualitative scholar and followed by responses from typically two other scholars, who address the first response and widen the range of theoretical and methodological perspectives. The answers are based on the scholars’ experiences and decisions made when performing research in areas such as collecting data, privacy, ethics, framing the research problem, effects on structures and process, and time and space considerations. Finally, each chapter lists several readings recommended by the scholars. The book contributes to new understandings of qualitative research in general. At the same time, throughout its text, the scholars keep a focus on the uniqueness of online environments. In the first chapter, Christine Hine, Lori Kendall, and danah boyd attempt to answer the question “How can qualitative internet researchers define the boundaries of their projects?” (1). The scholars emphasize that doing qualitative internet research challenges researchers in terms of setting boundaries for their projects, like deciding what to study and what to exclude, as well as deciding what will count as being data. The ethnographic approach in an online environment must be distinctly stipulated by the research question. The fundamental issue is that researchers must specify what responses are considered adequate and fit the research question. Defining the method and subject well also helps researchers make judgments about appropriate boundaries. The research question should stay clear of such boundaries due to the possibility of the ethnographic research taking different trajectories. Yet the boundaries of a research project evolve and change throughout the investigation process. In the second chapter, Shani Orgad, Maria Bakardijeva, and Radhika Gajjala address the question “How can researchers make sense of the issues involved in collecting and interpreting online and offline data?” (33). The scholars use constructivist and narrative approaches to the analysis of data present online and offline, with the responses analyzing how internet users browse the internet in different social contexts. Data from online and offline sources actually blend together, as in studies that analyze the integration of the internet in the everyday lives of users. Researchers must be aware and take a multimodal approach in which the online domain is contextualized based on the users’ lives. Yet scholars need to highlight the certain gap between the online traces left by internet users and their actual selves. In the third chapter, Malin Sveningsson Elm, Elizabeth A. Buchanan, and Susannah R. Stern discuss “How do various notions of privacy influence decisions in qualitative internet research?” (69). This issue brings up various questions about theoretical and ethical aspects such as protecting the privacy of participants. Since the internet may blur the boundaries between private and public spaces, the sense of privacy that is experienced through the internet may be closer to illusion than reality. Although that may be the case, users in general, from teenagers to seniors, are indeed concerned with privacy issues (e.g., boyd and Hargittai 2010; Webster 2006). Elm emphasizes that",

    "abstract": "Our lives are increasingly conducted in conjunction with software interactions, whether in developed or developing countries. From the pervasive cell phone to the programmable microwave or electronic thermometer, the march of software-driven interaction appears inevitable and unavoidable. Accordingto the authors of Code/Space , current research on software effects is quite limited because it is largely limited to studies of the production of software, rather than the study of software as a social–technical “thing” that affects and is affected by the situations in which it is placed. Kitchin and Dodge call for a change of focus to one that looks at software as a means of social–material production in profound and challenging ways. This moves the discussion into the realm of sociology and related ﬁelds such as cultural studies or design. This book, bringing together their research and that of other scholars, is intended to provide an introduction to this way of thinking, suited to graduate students and above. If the reader is unfamiliar with the theoretical turf, I suggest looking at the more empirical chapters ﬁrst, before trying to absorb some of the more abstract and difﬁcult, though necessary, arguments such as those found in Chapter 4.

    "abstract": "This article combines cost proxy model estimates of the cost of the public switched telephone network in Colorado with U.S. Census Bureau data on household income in Colorado to examine the possibility of paying for universal telephone service in a competitively neutral manner, without an explicit high-cost fund. Cost proxy models can provide the cost of providing telephone service by census block group, and Census Bureau data allow the calculation of mean household income by census block group. Based on these two types of data, this article shows that if telephone service were priced as a tax, and if each household in Colorado paid between 0.6% and 0.75% of their annual household income for telephone service, there would be no \"high-cost deficit.\" This article also shows that there is no correlation between household income and cost of telephone service. Thus, it is not the case that all high-cost areas are, for example, wealthy mountain communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Outsourcing, selectively turning over some junctions of information systems and processing services to a subcontractor, has recently captured the imagination of both information systems and corporate executives. With increasing cost‐reduction pressures, management sees outsourcing as an important option, which allows them to better leverage resources, contain costs, and focus on strategic and value‐added activities. Several countries have large pools of information systems professionals and clerical staff who are well‐trained and whose salary expectations are significantly less than those of their U.S. counterparts. The pricing advantage held by these countries and the advances in information technology have made global outsourcing a small but rapidly growing sector of the overall outsourcing market. Adopting the viewpoint of a business from a developed country such as the United States, the article analyzes the opportunities and challenges of global outsourcing, develops managerial guidelines fo...",

    "abstract": "Abstract The efforts of other nations to develop comprehensive approaches to the development and application of information technology have given rise to concern in many quarters about the adequacy of the U.S. government's response to information issues. A bill, H.R. 3137, was introduced in the House of Representatives in April 1981 by Congressman George E. Brown, Jr., in an attempt to stimulate movement toward a coordinated development of U.S. information policies. Hearings on this legislation elicited a wide variety of opinion concerning how best to proceed toward this development. This paper surveys the testimony presented at the hearings and some recent actions taken by Congress and by the Reagan Administration on information issues.",

    "abstract": "Electronic data interchange (EDI) provides means for interorganizational communication, creates network externalities, requires an advanced information technology (IT) infrastructure, and relies on standards. In the diffusion of such innovations, institutional involvement is imperative. Such institutions contain governmental agencies, national and global standardization organizations, local government, and nonprofit private organizations like industry associations. The last type of organizations we call intermediating institutions. They intermediate or coordinate (\"inscribe\") the activities of a group of would-be adopters. Unfortunately, little is known of how these organizations shape the EDI diffusion trajectory. In this article we examine one specific type of intermediating organizations?industry associations?and how they advanced the EDI diffusion process in the grocery sectors of Hong Kong, Denmark and Finland. We identify six institutional measures, placed into a matrix formed by the mode of involvement (influence vs. regulation) and the type of diffusion force (supply push vs. demand pull), that can be mobilized to further the EDI diffusion. Industry associations were found to be active users of all these measures to varying degrees. Their role was critical especially in knowledge building, knowledge deployment, and standard setting. Furthermore, institutional involvement varied due to policy and cultural contingencies and power dependencies.",

    "abstract": "We are on the cusp of a new social reality. The changes brought on by the information age are as far reaching as those of the industrial age. In such times of profound change, taken-for-granted assumptions from the previous age are no longer appropriate, and the opportunity surfaces for a society—previously on the periphery—to emerge. One element of Nietzsche's philosophy is the exaltation of the free man, the “New Barbarian,” who rejects the morality of the herd. We propose that a “New Barbarian” spirit is alive in India. While the West struggles to understand the information age using its outmoded ways of thinking, a subclass in India is defining this new era. However, the future will be contentious. Future conflicts will emerge that can be conceptualized as a clash between Old and New Barbarians.",

    "abstract": "The World Bank has been the largest multilateral source of rural telecommunications financing in developing countries since the mid-1960s. This article analyzes World Bank-sponsored studies of rural telecommunications initiatives in Chile, Peru, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Malaysia to identify which lessons the bank draws from them and recommends for other countries. The World Bank's preference for a “best practice” approach in its research leads it to attribute successes and failures to a narrow scope of factors that tend to agree with its economic policy priorities. Instead, rural telecommunications practices should be analyzed within their broader socio-institutional and cultural contexts in order to enable cross-situational applications, and a broad array of stakeholders should be involved in shaping the lessons learned.",

This perspective proposes an alternative conceptual approach, arguing that the main value of user involvement in content production is the constitution of individuals as social subjects. To this end, a critique of the traditional Marxist political economy is presented to provide insights into the complex changes in contemporary societies that underlie the growth of user-generated content. The concept of the social media dispositive is introduced as an analytic for studying material practices as well as economic and social aspects of social media.",

We argue that the carnival is a fruitful metaphor for understanding emerging information infrastructures, as the information age is also the age of the carnival. We distinguish between the ubiquitous or distal carnival and its particular manifestations – the proximate carnival – both of which are characterized by play, anarchy, dissimulation, vulgar language, and excessive consumption. The article focuses on Bitcoin, which we see as a nascent information infrastructure and an exemplary instance of a proximate carnival. It also considers how the carnival metaphor might help us reimagine our study of the information age.",

    "abstract": "A national survey of over 1500 American households was analyzed to identify demographic variables that can predict subscription to unlisted telephone service. The survey was conducted face-to-face among a stratified random sample of households. The demographic variables we identified that contribute to subscribership are (in order of importance) being an African-American, not owning a home, metropolitan residence, multifamily dwelling, lower education, and income. Characteristics commonly thought to be important, such as being young, female, having kids, or being a professional or manager, were not statistically significant variables when considered with the others. Our findings suggest that unlisted service may not only be valued by subscribers as a way to cut problem calls, but also to reduce general accessibility by outsiders. Based on this analysis, we advance new service concepts that might still provide value of reduced accessibility but also allow customers to enjoy benefits of selective interactio...",

The Household Information Systems project was devised to investigate whether or not discourses of convergence accompanying the development of new ICT services and products had any resonance in the lives of \"ordinary\" consumers. This article presents an overview of the research and a more general series of observations about research into the domestic consumption of new media technology. The article advocates an approach to studying new media technology that analyzes the \"full life cycle\" of technology. In practice, this means utilizing theories from a range of disciplines focusing on a number of different points in the \"cultural circuit\" within which all technology is located.",

Some of the history of this movement is recounted in regard to the question of value in capital and, importantly, beyond capital. The issues of value that are raised in this perspective by posing questions of value in domestic labor against those in digital labor are not only the analogical and even the metonymical relations of domestic sphere production to digital labor and the critical discourse on it, but the historical and the foundational quality of the former to the latter, as well. In these models the larger social and cultural traditions within which labor is literally begotten remain, and so does capital's use of them.",

    "title": "A Review of “Play Redux: The Form of Computer Games”",
    "abstract": "With a book title that suggests the restoration of the concept of play in the very form of computer games, Play Redux: The Form of Computer Games proposes an exciting and challenging adventure. To define play, David Myers proposes to move away from what he considers the cultural approach of classic studies of play by Huizinga (1950), Caillois (1961), and Sutton-Smith (2001). Instead, he intends to take a formalist approach. In the first chapter, Myers asserts that game playing is about playing by the rules of the game. Free and uninhibited play is selfish and punished as bad play or antiplay. This does not quite provide a formal definition of play, but it does sketch a distinction between playing in general and game playing as rule-based play. Rather than build on this initial position, the eleven chapters that follow are an eclectic collection of articles and conference papers on computer games that do not come together as a coherent ensemble to illuminate the book’s ambitious title. Myers continues to propose an opposition between play as a self-reflective activity and game playing as abiding by rules. The book’s final paragraph summarizes this position: “A virtual world that traps, regulates, and purposefully distorts the overtly selfish behavior of individuals—including, prominently, play—appears to be a well-built bottle for one of our most destructive and most useful genies” (162). The conclusion is that computer games are thin on play. This paradoxical conclusion is a consequence of a narrow view of play as an anarchic activity with little patience for rules. The book glosses over richer views of play that can enhance our conception of game playing, rather than view it as entrapment of playing. One of those views comes from genetic epistemologist Jean Piaget. He describes play as pure assimilation of what is being played with, whereas pure accommodation is imitation (Piaget 1962). This definition of play is far more comprehensive. It is also more illuminating for computer games. Piaget’s developmental model of playful behavior derives from children, but it does extend to adult play quite effectively and crosses disciplinary boundaries. Piaget’s view even includes Myers’s definition as a special case, since assimilation of the external world to one’s wishes can be seen as a self-reflective behavior. The most basic definitions of play describe it as happening in an open space within boundaries or structures, as in the play of a hinge or even playing a role in a theater work where the text allows leeway for interpretations. Piaget stresses the pleasure of play, of pure assimilation. In computer games, the bottom line remains the same: fun. Another view of play that harmonizes with Piaget’s appears in Raph Koster’s A Theory of Fun (Koster 2010). Myers mentions Koster but does not elaborate on his view that the fun of computer games comes from finding patterns. Koster notes that people are amazing at pattern making, to the point that we may even see patterns where there are none. In Piaget’s terms, this is an example of assimilation where something out there in the world is transformed by the assimilating player according to wishes and preferences. Koster notes that when playing a game, we play it until we master the pattern. Once mastered, the game becomes boring. He believes that basically all games educate as well as entertain. Using this simple view, Koster is able to embrace all genres of computer games. Koster proposes that the fun of computer games comes from discovering",

    "abstract": "This introduction outlines the problematic that has served as the basis for this special issue. Interaction weaves the fabric of social life in the form of events that are usually embedded in a series of particulars, variously referred to as contexts or situations. At the same time, actors, and the contexts in which they are embedded, are constituted by social rules, role systems, and normative frameworks that transcend situated encounters. Furthermore, most interactive events involve a range of resources and technological capabilities that recur across contexts and situations. This special issue deals with how the multivalent involvement of information and communication technologies in social practice alters this basic problematic. It entails six research articles that investigate particular social practices and the ways each of these practices are refigured by the deepening involvement of information and communication technologies. This special issue also features an invited perspective piece by distinguished philosopher Albert Borgmann.",

The database use chain, together with statistics showing dramatic growth, provides a framework for the discussion of policy issues, problems, and future requirements of the database industry. The various stages of the database use chain are considered in terms of added value, added production cost, compensation, push and pull mechanisms, proprietorship of data, control of data, and use agreements. The framework for considering policy issues includes the characteristics of the public and private sectors, their products and services, the appropriateness of government involvement in certain subject areas of information and the benefits to society.

    "abstract": "Abstract In 2019, Professor Emeritus Brenda Dervin agreed to participate in a series of interviews to discuss her life and work. Two sessions were conducted with Dervin that covered scholarly and biographical topics. The interviews reveal aspects of Dervin’s personal journey as a researcher, and a teacher, and provide insight into how she saw the related fields of information science and communication developing shared interests and shared perspectives in social research. Dervin candidly shares how her life experiences, both inside and outside of academia, have influenced the development of her theoretical approach. Readers will find here discussion of a range of issues associated with the Sense-Making Methodology as well as Dervin’s thoughts on how information and communication domains intersect within the context of modern digital environments. With reference to her own experiences, Dervin outlines how important it is to ensure that leadership within complex online environments is fostered in the areas of public information provision, and in civic dialogue, and how managing the information frameworks within which critical inquiry can thrive requires increasing commitment to, and understanding of, the human-centered considerations surrounding interpretation and identity. Further information on Dervin can be found at Bonnie Cheuk’s site: www.sense-making.org.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerous environmental forces exist today that contribute to changing industry and market segments. The least studied of these is the impact of information systems which transcend traditional company boundaries. One of the subtle impacts of contemporary developments in information systems technology is the redefinition of traditional organizational and industrial boundaries. Examples of these interorganizational systems (referred to as IOS), reviewed by the author, imply that a wide range of organizations may have an opportunity to use these systems to improve their operations, services to their customers, and their competitive position. Some of these systems raise public policy issues that are not well understood, nor are they being addressed in a comprehensive manner. This article is designed to provide a conceptual framework for thinking about these systems.",

    "title": "Failures and Successes: Notes on the Development of Electronic Cash",
    "abstract": "Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a \"showcase.\" However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), this article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. Implementing a new technology is seen as a long process in which social and technological actors are required to adapt to one another. In the Mondex case, such adaptation did not happen sufficiently to stabilize the sociotechnical network as a whole. However, in some limited areas mutual adaptation did occur, and there the Mondex experiment produced some surprising successes. In this perspective, the story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure.",

    "abstract": "The strength of Lewis, Eysenbach, Kukafka, Stavri, and Jimison’s (2005) Consumer Informatics: Informing Consumers and Improving Health Care lies in the editors’ efforts to provide a comprehensive collection of short readings in the general, and underresearched, area of health informatics. Toward this end they include chapters on designing and evaluating health informatics information delivery methods; the impact on a variety of user groups of these online sources of health information; ethical and security issues involved in health informatics; and descriptions of a number of health informatics projects. While such a collection would be useful, there are a number of problems with this particular volume: chiefly, a general lack of critical analysis of the topics pursued within it. In the preface, Lewis paints the Internet as a dangerous source of health information in order to promote what the editors assert is the need for experts, most often health care professionals, to guide the user in sorting “good” health information from “bad.” While it is surely a truism that not all health information found online is equally valid or reliable, the suggestion that only medical experts can properly interpret online health information is ironic, as Chapter 2 of this book is devoted to a discussion of how health informatics “empowers” lay people in their healthseeking behavior. In Chapter 1, Lewis et al. address the issue of defining health informatics, and a useful part of this chapter is where the authors distinguish between health informatics and medical informatics. They also list a variety of definitions from medical, nursing, and government literature; however, they provide no evaluative analysis justifying the use of one definition over another. Notwithstanding an unanalyzed biographical statement from a user of health informatics, no new research is presented in this chapter. Rather, the authors provide a summary of existing research, much of which is descriptive rather than explanatory. Particularly problematic in this chapter is the use of dehumanizing computer science jargon where, for example, the person using health informatics in dealing with a health problem is conceptualized as an output of a system. In Chapter 2, “Empowered Consumers,” Brennan and Safran argue that through the use of computer health informatics, health problems become more person-centered than health industry-centered. However, their discussion is largely about what should be rather than what is. For instance, they greatly overstate access to computer technology in the United States. Moreover, their construction of the individual with a health problem as a “consumer” and the doctor/patient relationship as one of “equal partnership” is problematic. The lay person seeking health care is not buying a car, and doctors and other health care practitioners remain the gatekeepers of health care services: points that are cogently and critically addressed in Chapter 13, “Social Informatics and Consumer Health,” by Sawyer. Also concerned with empowering the lay person are Chapter 8, one of three chapters by second editor Eysenbach, which focuses on the possibilities for community proved by Internet health support groups, and Chapter 11 by Appleyard, where he discusses the potential of consumer health informatics in disability activism and support. Chapter 3, “Tailored Health Care,” by Kukafka, begins by making the important point that while health promotion information has reached large numbers of people, such initiatives have not been as successful in changing health related behavior as interpersonal initiatives.

These conceptual framings help in understanding the discursive, technological, and social forces that are at play in Web 2.0 architectures. Based on research during a two-year period, the second part of this article applies these lenses to the case of the Human Rights Portal, a Web portal designed to leverage the participatory knowledge production ethos of Web 2.0 for human rights organizations. This section discusses the design process and the ways in which the discourse of Web 2.0 as parsed through the three lenses described informed this process.",

The writing is lively, the material is timely, and the conceptual and empirical issues are central to the collective interests of those who read The Information Society. I’m not aware of similar general anthologies on the social shaping of technology (though Bijker’s 1995 book has some overlap). Within the broad community of scholars studying the roles of ICT, Kling’s (1996) anthology, Dutton’s (1999) book, and Coakes, Willis, and Lloyd-Jones’s (2000) edited volume link nicely to the material in this second edition. MacKenzie and Wajcman’s collection reminds me that our work is part of a broader dialogue on the social shaping of technology, one that is being carried across several other research domains. Seeing the literature that I know tied to examples of the social shaping of different technologies provides me an important new perspective on the role, place, and worth of research into ICT. The book’s 30 chapters are grouped into four sections: general issues, technology of production, reproductive technology, and military technology. Beyond the useful collection of articles in the  rst section, I don’t  nd these overlygeneralized groupings to be of much use. However, I found the book’s overview and the summaries at the start of each section to be excellent syntheses of the research issues that frame the social shaping of technology. Two chapters in the  rst section help make clear the emphasis on shaping instead of impact. Thomas Hughes’s chapter on Edison’s efforts to make an electrical distribution system is the  rst of these. Beyond the captivating view of history presented, this excerpt provides insight into Hughes’s theory of technological systems. This theory highlights the relationship between context, components and collections of technologies , the importance of reverse salients, and the social setting in which all this occurs. Hughes’s conceptualization of technological systems is very useful to contemporary scholars of ICT-based networks, some of Hughes’s principles  nd their way into actor–network theory, and we would be wise to revisit this work. The second chapter that helps me best understand the shaping (versus impact) of technology perspective is Ronald Kline’s and Trevor Pinch’s overview of the social construction of technology (SCOT)approach. In this chapter they both outline SCOT and respond to recent criticisms about the meaning of relevant social group and interpretive  exibility. Of the many  ne chapters in the other three sections of the book, four seem most relevant for ICT researchers. Both Paul Ceruzzi’s chapter on inventing personal computing and Linda Abbate’s chapter on packet switching networks provide vivid depictions of the social milieu in which computing takes place. Fleck’s chapter on implementing manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems predates and also frames most of the  ndings arising from current work on enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations. Fourth, and for me the most illuminating , is Anne-Jorunn Berg’s dissection of the technology- rst design  aws embodied in the of “house-of-the-future” concept homes. Her analysis illustrates the context of design and showcases how naive models of use can become embedded into large-scale artifacts. Certainly the theories and concepts contained in this book can inform and help shape research into ICT. However, there is very little material included in this edition",

    "abstract": "Four hundred environmental organizations in ten countries (Canada, Australia, France, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, U.K., and U.S.) were surveyed regarding the impacts of the Internet upon them; whether or not it has politicized these marginalized groups. A bilingual questionnaire was distributed through two channels (e-mail and postal mail). The study measured the organizations' information interchange through the Internet specifically and other media in general. Evidence indicates a distinction between online and offline groups, suggesting that the online groups are more politicized. Some specific findings include growth in a variety of measures, degree of penetration of the Internet in this population, types of information exchanged, differences between online and offline groups and ambiguous results regarding the extent the Internet informed an organization's policy. This population, as a whole is aware of the political utility of the Internet but as yet only a minority are consciously exploiting this capability.",

    "title": "<i>The Ethics of Information</i>, by Luciano Floridi",
    "abstract": "Due to the unprecedented revolutions and evolutions affected by technological, digital, and informational advancements, every aspect of our lives—whether economic, ecological, political, educational, cultural, or social—alongside people, organizations, and even governmental activity, has been tirelessly faced with an unyielding overtaking. As Kalantzis-Cope emphasizes, “We need to think more critically about the properties of new technologies, the cultural content that flows through them, and the social forms new technologies both reproduce and disrupt” (2011, 8). Floridi answers this call, noting that “our technological tree has been growing its far-reaching branches much more widely, rapidly, and chaotically than its conceptual, ethical, and cultural roots” (xiii). Therefore, we should be wary of this imbalance, alleviate it, and diminish this undeniable theoretical gap in the literature by creating a philosophical foundation or platform entitled information ethics (IE), which concerns itself with a comprehensive scholarly investigation into the (un)ethical considerations of information age consequences. In this vein, dealing mainly with meta-theoretical, introductory, and constructive goals, met in the form of 16 chapters, The Ethics of Information aims to provide a better philosophical understanding of the conceptual foundations of IE. To meet its meta-theoretical goal, chapters 1 to 5 provide readers with some theoretical foundations and conceptual connotations. Serving as a “problem statement” section, chapter 1 is an attempt to give a picture of ethics after the information revolution as a determinant driver that is turning information into our ecosystem. Posing the question “What is information ethics?,” chapter 2 discusses four stages of IE, including “IE as an ethics of informational resources,” “IE as an ethics of informational products,” “IE as an ethics of the informational environment,” and “IE as a macroethics.” To clarify the idea “IE as a macroethics,” Floridi proposes, in chapter 3, “the method of abstraction” by which a change in our view of the world can be possible. In chapter 4, Floridi uses the term “e-nvironmental ethics” (synthetic ethics or ethics of infosphere) to delineate an individual interpretation of IE. Confirming the foundationalist debate regarding what IE and CE (computer ethics) are, chapter 5 defines IE as the philosophical foundational counterpart of CE. In relation to the introductory goal of the book, chapters 6 to 11 collectively examine the main pillars or players of the infosphere in terms of value and evil. Accordingly, the intrinsic value of the infosphere itself, the morality of artificial agents as interactive autonomous systems, and the constructionist values of homo poieticus (demiurge) are considered in chapters 6 to 8, respectively. On the other hand, some issues like artificial evil (a mistake perpetrated by artificial agents) and the tragedy of Good Will are explored. The last chapter of this second section of the work, chapter 11, tries to respond to the question “Who are we online, or in the infosphere?” by taking an informational approach to the nature of personal identity (selves). Finally, chapters 12 to 16 are in line with meeting the constructive goal of the volume. Due to a tangible shift from human ecology to multifaceted global informational ecology—fired, fueled, and affected by the transformative engine of information and communication technologies (ICTs)—informational privacy, distributed morality, information business ethics, and global information ethics are among the major topics debated. In the last chapter, entitled “In defence of information ethics,” Floridi’s goal seems to be to remove some ambiguities, defuse possible sources of confusion, and correct mistaken objections that might prevent the proper evaluation of IE in its various interpretations, so that disagreement can become more constructive. In this conclusion, the author highlights that “there is a unique ethical duty that follows from humanity’s unique semanticizing role. The epistemic responsibility involved in the design of a meaningful reality is not just an epistemological task, placed on our shoulders as individual epistemic agents. It is also, and probably more importantly, a social and ethical obligation that we have towards each other” (332). Structurally, regardless of the coherence, interconnectedness, and robustness tangible in the entire book, each chapter can be treated as a stand-alone ethics-related article. Furthermore, at the end, Floridi provides an abundant bibliography, which can help readers easily sort through and find many related works. In its content, along with reminding readers of the predicaments brought by ICTs (as well as artificial and human agents), the book deals epistemologically, philosophically, and conceptually with the ethics of THE INFORMATION SOCIETY 2016, VOL. 32, NO. 1, 74–75 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2016.1107360",

    "title": "A Review of “Tactical Media (Electronic Mediations)”",
    "abstract": "Immense research has focused on the impact of new media as agents of collaboration and participation (e.g., Shirky 2008; Tapscott and Williams 2006). Nowhere is this focus more evident than in how social networking Web sites, for example, have increased and facilitated people’s visibility and participation in the political process. Rita Raley’s Tactical Media (Electronic Mediations) (2009) does not add to this type of new media literature but instead employs a wider theoretical framework and arguments in how new media are part of today’s neoliberal globalization and information economy, as well as how they are tactical. Although some of the examples in the book are about collaboration and participation, Tactical Media does not refute how liberating new media can be. It looks at the tactical part of new media as a political, economic, or social activity that supplements the network society in its politicoaesthetic engagement such as refusal, cyberactivism, hacktivism, and destructivity. Among the primary themes to demonstrate Raley’s arguments are immigration politics, war, and capital. Tactical media is a mediated disturbance to the conventional discourse of the network society. It signifies intervention and disruption and operates both direct actions and symbolic performances. These projects are operated in the field of symbolic powers in the postindustrial society. For example, gwbush.com is not a Web site to impose a countermessage to the Bush administration, but to provoke and reveal. The founders of gwbush.com did not intend to become another CNN or Yahoo, but rather, its activity of disturbance and intervention offers the online community members a new way of understanding the system they live within and the way information is manipulated therein (7). It is important to note that tactical media does not have a fixed definition to fully understand it theoretically and know its components. Tactical media is fluid, whether considered as an independent category or not. It is part of new media, it is participatory and collaborative (Shirky 2009), it can be used by amateur technologists, it is oppositional and disruptive (Boler 2008), it is supplementary to corporate gains and military purposes, and it is a hybrid type of media that can integrate all of the preceding at once. However, tactical media requires collectivism: Cyberactivists, hackers, and destructivists are all operating within and among themselves, where they are both users and producers, and outside of the normal hierarchies of power and knowledge (Raley 2009, 16). The author uses case studies to illustrate how tactical media is disrupting today’s international system of globalized capitalism. In the three chapters of the book, the American-Mexican borders, virtual war, and Black Shoals (a Web site including an animated night sky that displays a live representation of the world’s stock market) are used to illustrate Raley’s thesis. The first chapter discusses how the U.S. efforts to secure its borders with Mexico are symbolic rather than actual. That is, by using signs and Web sites for the security of the United States, the American efforts are symbolic rather than real security. The second chapter illustrates how the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have turned to virtual weaponry, where military planes are pilotless and flying in Afghanistan while controlled from the United States. These virtual wars have become part of the entertainment industries where games in PlayStation and Xbox are imitating the military tactics in the virtual wars (68). The last chapter discusses",

The findings of the meta-review of 20 years of Chinese Internet research, as gleaned from quantitative and qualitative analysis of the collected body of publications, are presented and discussed in this report. It engages with the conclusions drawn by previous meta-studies, and seeks to shed a critical, self-reflexive light onto the main discursive formations of their research field.

    "abstract": "This article reports on a series of in-depth interviews with UK consumers about shopping, which served to investigate their views on the collection and use of consumers' personal information by commercial organizations. The interviews were used to analyze consumers' constructions of privacy infringement. No single type of information was found to count as personal in all situations. Rather, privacy infringement was constructed as a situated account. This ''situated privacy'' depended upon the visibility of a mediating technology; the perceived legitimacy of information requests; the representation of intrusion or disruption of legitimate activity; perceived imbalances of power and control; and representations of the social context. By focusing on the daily activity of shopping instead of asking direct questions about privacy, we found that privacy concerns were rarely independently raised by interviewees as an important feature in making decisions about purchasing. However, almost all of those interviewed...",

    "title": "Putting to (information) work: A Stengersian perspective on how information technologies and people influence information practices",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Instead of merely subscribing to an unspecific inseparability in the co-constitution or mangle of information technologies and human-actors, there is a need for conceptual tools to describe and explicate the mechanics of how the enmeshment of technologies and human-beings is occurring in information contexts: how information technologies are both setting standards of the social conduct of information practices, and how people are using information technologies to regulate the social process. Building on an empirical study of human-technology relations in the context of archaeological information work, this article discusses how the imaginary of putting Stengers to work can make a contribution to such an end. Stengers describes an ideal system of human-actors and technology working seamlessly —World-as-Clock—that is unattainable but can serve as a benchmark and a lens for understanding frictions and discrepancies in the cohesion of the two.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article looks at the attitudes of UK academics toward new media, utilizing organizational and sociocultural understandings of fields of scholarly enquiry. It focuses on four traditionally distinct disciplines—art and design, computer science, health science, and politics and international relations—representative of the range of approaches in higher education. Agreement was found among respondents across disciplinary communities about what new media represent and how they support their work. Analysis of semantic differential charts identified two dimensions underlying attitudes—“flexibility” and “fitness for scholarly purposes.” Rather than being anchored by epistemological divisions, new media are assessed by practical viewpoints relating to the activity types they allow, and by traditional measures of reliability. In response to questions about other characteristics of their disciplines (such as reputation and audience diversity), distinctions are in evidence, although in some cases these are not traditional ones.",

    "abstract": "Market liberalization has been embraced by developing countries around the world since the 1980s, in the hope of achieving economic growth and development through participation in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Developing countries who once feared economic dependency on the industrialized world now fear being left out of the dynamic process of economic globalization . A key question after a decade or more of liberalization experiments is whether the expected bene ts are being realized, and at what cost. The information technology (IT) industry is an especially good industry sector to study this question. It is one of the most global of industry sectors, particularly since the ascendance of the personal computer, whose horizontal industry structure has replaced the vertically integrated structure of the mainframe computer industry (Grove, 1996).While the mainframe industry was more nationally oriented, the personal computer (PC) industry has been organized around a global production network, with particular countries—mostly in East Asia—specializing in activities such as PC assembly and production of components and peripherals (Wong, 1995; Ernst, 1994; Borrus, 1997; Dedrick & Kraemer, 1998). Motivated in part by the success of these countries, newcomers such as China, India, Mexico, and several eastern European states have liberalized their computer sectors in hopes of joining the global production network and gaining access to technology and capital. The emergence of the Internet has created new pressures for liberalization. The Internet represents a global",

    "abstract": "Rob Kling’s editorship of The Information Society (TIS) from 1995 to his sudden passing on May 15, 2003 was a unique moment in the life of TIS or for that matter any research journal. He operated above paradigms and methodologies, and his editorial instincts were receptive to research from all traditions. Our tendency is to ease into intellectual cubbyholes where fellow researchers conveniently use the same vocabulary, employ familiar methodologies, and see the world in similar ways. There is a certain comfort in parochialism. Rob, on the other hand, generated a creative tension by juxtaposing papers drawn from disparate research traditions on the pages of TIS. The synapses these juxtapositions fired opened our minds to surprising connections across research traditions. We were prompted to think beyond the confines of our own cubbyholes. His broad and ever expanding interests, startling depth of mind, and refreshing openness to ideas of all hues will be greatly missed. We cannot recreate Rob. But we have his legacy. It will be unfortunate if after Rob’s passing we let 1995–2003 recede into history as the proverbial “golden age,” a passing moment in history. We need to keep his legacy alive. There is no simple answer for how this can be done. Yet, we know that every time we work against our parochial tendencies we tug with Rob and prolong the precious moment of openness he generated for us.",

    "abstract": "In response to the increasingly quotidian, even banal character of surveillant practices in postindustrial societies, this article explores the possibility of a theoretical and methodological re-alignment in surveillance studies. This re-alignment entails a move from broadly Foucauldian, macro-level, structural or poststructural analyses, to the existential–phenomenological study of subjective consciousness and experience. This piece illustrates such an experiential study by taking part of Sartre's famous description of “the look,” and comparing it to a similarly experientially based description of an everyday context of surveillance—specifically, a bank machine or ATM transaction. Through the analysis of these descriptions, the piece shows how the study of the lived experience of surveillance highlights the role of the body, of social convention, and also of individual agency in surveillant practices that can be overlooked in other analyses.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, universal service developed within a public-service-oriented institutional framework. The historical conflicts that produced these institutional arrangements are still important for national policymaking. Furthermore, the level of technological development and integration in the European Union forms the context in which decisions concerning universal service are made. Our analysis of telecommunications policies in three small European countries - Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway - shows that business actors are well networked and press for a minimal definition of universal services, whereas those actors promoting an extended definition seem to be less coordinated and therefore less successful. Hence it is unlikely that universal services will be defined more extensively in the future.",

The newsgroup facilitated political and personal support for some gay, lesbian, or bisexual men and women. The primary threat to the group was the increasing number of newcomers who were oblivious to established norms, who tended to view access to the group as a commodity, and who attempted to impose ''outside'' paradigms on the operations of the group. Defensive strategies involved calling on rhetorical devices (such as flaming or ostracism) or structural resources (such as employers, network operators, or lawsuits). All strategies had the potential to backfire, but rhetorical strategies were less risky, more available, and more community affirming than strategies requiring access to structural resources.

    "abstract": "Abstract How are new media, such as electronic mail, voice mail, and fax, used when people have access to several of them simultaneously? This paper reports findings from a field study of media use in four sizable subunits within two large organizations where most employees had access to email, vmail, and fax. Respondents tended to use multiple electronic media rather than relying on one. However, they also showed a tendency to prefer one medium for asynchronous communication and to use the others for occasional, specialized purposes. Further, there were considerable differences across subunits in typical media use patterns. Although respondents expressed strong desires for multimedia integration, this study suggests that technological integration may not necessarily result in seamless, collaborative work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper summarizes some of the principal findings of a multiyear research effort examining Brazilian Informatics Policy, its rationale, its implementation, and its effects on users of information and telecommunications technologies. The “Brazilian model” of national informatics development is based on the “market reserve system\"—a unique and highly protectionist policy which severely limits the importation of foreign information technology and systematically encourages more domestic value‐added by Brazilian‐owned manufacturers. This study measures expenditures on Brazilian‐made and foreign computer equipment, examines what type of applications are being used, and looks at the attitudes of managers of computer systems installations regarding the effects of the Brazilian policy on their day‐to‐day operations. Examination is also made of how the policy applied to protection of software produced a crisis in bilateral relations between the U. S. and Brazil. The study concludes that the Brazilian po...",

This paper sets forth the concept of a “University of the World” in which students use computers, radio, and television to take courses in their chosen discipline and, in return, receive course credit and even academic degrees. The author describes the concept, its educational goals and objectives, the availability of courseware, the impact of global instructional technology, and questions of cost and technological capability. The organization, governance, funding, and operation of the University of the World are also described, including remarks on the benefits of membership and the functional value as seen from the student's perspective.",

A revised and expanded version of PI and IE emerges here, one that brings to the foreground PI's status as a philosophical naturalism—one with both current application and important potential in the specific domains of privacy and information law. Further, the pluralism already articulated by Floridi in his PI is now more explicitly coupled with an ethical pluralism in IE that will be enhanced through IE's further incorporation of discourse ethics. In this form, PI and IE emerge as still more robust frameworks for a global ICE; in this form, however, they also profoundly challenge modern Western assumptions regarding reality, the self, and our ethical obligations.",

    "title": "What Is the Content of the World's Technologically Mediated Information and Communication Capacity: How Much Text, Image, Audio, and Video?",
    "abstract": "This article asks whether the global process of digitization has led to noteworthy changes in the shares of the amount of text, images, audio, and video in worldwide technologically stored and communicated information content. We empirically quantify the amount of information that is globally broadcast, telecommunicated, and stored (1986–2007) and assess the evolution of the respective content shares. Somewhat unexpectedly, it turns out that the transfer from analog to digital has not led to toward increasing shares of media-rich audio and video content, despite vastly increased bandwidth. First, there is a certain inertia in the evolution of content, which seems to stick to stable proportions independent of its technological medium (be it analog vinyl and VHS tapes, or digital CDs and hard disks). Second, the relative share of text and still images actually captures a larger portion of the total amount than before the digital age. Text merely represented 0.3% of the (optimally compressed) bits that flowed through global information channels in 1986 but grew to almost 30% in 2007. On another level, we are seeing an increasing transition of text and images from one-way information diffusion networks (like newspapers) to digital storage and two-way telecommunications networks, where they are more socially embedded. Both tendencies are good news for big-data analysts who extract intelligence from easily analyzable text and image data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasingly, information and communication technology (ICT) uses are transforming professional activities and interactions in ways that challenge traditional assumptions about professional identity. In this article, we consider the ways in which the professional identities of research scientists in oceanography and marine biology are shaped by the use of ICTs. We draw empirical data from an ongoing study of scientific research collaborations that examines uses of basic communication technologies, as well as scientific technologies with embedded ICT components. Our analysis suggests that development and use of ICT-enabled scientific technologies are identity enhancing for many scientists, facilitating their development of unique areas of scientific knowledge. ICT-related changes in data collection, collaborative coordination, and scientific interaction also challenge traditional definitions of expertise and professional identity. An examination of these challenges directs attention to the project identities that form around ICT-enabled scientific technologies and the ways that those project identities are enacted through ICTs.",

    "abstract": "This article initiates exploratory empirical research on how civil society collective action has reacted to and affected communication–information policy (CIP), a policy domain that has been reshaped by technological and industrial change. It reviews the relevant theory on social movements, citizens groups, and interest groups from political science. Data are gathered on two dimensions of the research question: (1) We quantify the number of public interest advocacy groups focused on CIP in the United States from 1961 to the present, using organizational ecology methods. (2) We track the number of U.S. Congressional hearings held each year on CIP issues. The results show that CIP now exceeds other social movement issues (women, civil rights, the environment, human rights) as a major concern of Congressional activity, that the issues are becoming more interdependent, and that modes of citizens advocacy have undergone drastic changes in recent years.",

Later, with further development of the Internet, Massimo Torre (2002) highlighted its enormous potentiality as a tool for ideometry. With the appearance of an online corpora of books, such as Google Books, this vision may have moved closer to reality. In the author's previous article, “Searching for the Great Chain of Being Using Google Print,” published in The Information Society (Ophir 2007), he laid the initial design for a potential implementation for the field of the history of ideas. In this short article, the author describes the implementation and initial results for the specific case of German Idealism.",

    "title": "Consumer Benefits of Public Services Over FTTH in Japan: Comparative Analysis of Provincial and Urban Areas by Using Discrete Choice Experiment",
    "abstract": "As the rapid development of broadband Internet access services continues, particularly fiber to the home (FTTH) services, the digital divide between provincial and urban areas is becoming a big social issue in Japan. We classify the issue into two problems: access to high-speed Internet, and service utilization of high-speed Internet access. We focus on the latter problem by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating whether a digital divide problem exists based on Internet service utilization. Consequently, we discover that willingness to pay (WTP) for public services over FTTH is almost identical between provincial and urban areas. Furthermore, territorial digital broadcasting over FTTH accounts for a large part of WTP in provincial areas, while tele-working and tele-education are also important as public services over FTTH in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rural America has historically been plagued with a disproportionate shortage of health, education, and other public services. However, the application of rapidly changing telecommunications technologies can alleviate many of the problems associated with these isolated and “technologically undernourished” areas. Technologies such as low‐power television, direct broadcast satellites, and satellite‐fed cable services offer the opportunity for building a rural telecommunications network and thus improving services and the quality of life. However, in order for this goal to be realized, the economic constraints presented by insufficient consumer demand and unprofitable markets must be overcome. Direct government subsidization or increased support of projects may be necessary to encourage the private sector to increase investment in telecommunications facilities in rural communities.",

    "title": "Controlling petty corruption in public administrations of developing countries through digitalization: An opportunity theory informed study of Ghana customs",
    "abstract": "Abstract Despite myriad anti-corruption interventions, including digitalization-based efforts, petty corruption in public administrations of developing countries persists, undermining socioeconomic development. Extant research that links corruption to social and economic conditions has yielded inconclusive findings on whether digitalization can reduce corruption. Informed by opportunity theory from the field of criminology, which suggests that opportunities – rather than motives or systemic factors – beget crimes, we explore an alternative approach in this study: how digitalization could reduce the opportunities for petty corruption. We draw on a case study of the 30-year digitalization effort at Ghana’s customs administration based on fieldwork, including 91 in-depth interviews with current and former customs officials, importers, clearing agents, banks, regulators, and other stakeholders. Our findings suggest that information technology enables corruption control over time by reducing corruption opportunities through sociotechnical reconfiguration of work practices and organizational arrangements.",

    "title": "Transformation to Virtual Societies: Forces and Issues",
    "abstract": "This article presents a conceptual research framework for investigating virtual societies. As this subject area is relatively new to the research world, this paper presents a framework for studying virtual societies. To date, much of the relevant research has been in the area of telecommuting or teleworking. But the changes to people's lives that may be a result of the movement to virtual societies encompass far more than alterations to the way we perform work in the future. The framework portrays the driving forces and the issues related to the study of this ensuing societal form. A review of the driving forces and issues of the virtual society stimulated the development of the research framework. It identifies technology as the enabler that is paving the way for society to be transformed into virtual communities, but does not dwell solely on the technology. Our endeavors focus on identifying the critical forces and issues within a global context in order to provide a foundation for future research.",

    "abstract": "A future with an increasing number of elderly citizens, which increases the pressure on the health care system, is a returning political horror scenario in the Western world today. If anyone has a good idea as how to replace professional personal care with technology, or to foster better communication between hospitals, general practitioners, and local caregivers, that person is instantly heard by the local politicians. Information technology (IT) therefore develops rapidly in both institutionalized care and home care. This book gives an introduction to the subject and experiences from different fields in the area. First, based on the British experience, it offers an overview of both the historical and the political trends in the use of IT in the care of elderly people. The introductory chapter has an interesting discussion of the impact of neoliberal policies in the implementation of these technologies, which alter the role of the citizen from being a part of the community to becoming a customer in a public welfare system. Information sharing between the individual actors in the health sectors is discussed with a critical look at the professional and authoritarian domains that influence the implementation of information technology. Interestingly, patient management via shared information technology often provokes resistance from the professionals. In order to understand resistance, it is, as the book describes, important to look at the dialectics between management-driven and user-driven implementation. Second, the book discusses the tension between the autonomy-enhancing capacity of technology, which offers the weak or ill elderly the possibility to stay at home, and its capability to increase social, biological, and spatial control. With increased autonomy, the feelings of being a burden on the family are decreased or eliminated. On the other hand, as raised in the book, technology intensifies the risk for control of where you are and how you are, and in that way reduces autonomy. For the patient, there is therefore a trade-off between the benefits and disadvantages of bringing advanced IT technology into the home. Through a number of research studies, the book demonstrates that individuals with poor health experience a sense of security when monitored by digital technology, especially the capacity of the technology to convey critical information for immediate professional action. In general, close monitoring can lead to a decline in hospital admissions. Digital technology also empowers patients by providing them with information about their health and need for care. Thus, digital technology may move responsibility for health and health care from the institutional systems to the patient. Finally, the book discusses the importance of the Internet for the elderly. The modern patient is often well informed by the Internet of diagnosis and treatment options. Future generations of elderly patients will be more and more Web savvy, and thereby generate information pressure on the health system. As the book describes, patients nowadays get access to large amounts of text and images in their medical records. One of the issues for future research may be the question of how the patients interpret this quantity of professional information back at home.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Information technology offers limited benefits to less developed countries not simply because of technological (or even financial) difficulties, but because basic social, educational, political, and structural problems remain unsolved. While electronic publishing and delivery may be logical developments within capital intensive economies, the required investment and volume of use do not match current capacities of less developed countries. The imposition of modern information technology carries with it the danger of polarizing development activities within a few outward‐looking “centers of excellence,” with a possibility of retarding, rather than encouraging, the growth of indigenous resources. Moreover, it cannot be assumed that the relevance and coverage of data bases available through the channels of the industrialized world are appropriate to, and adequate for, the needs of developing countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Organizations struggle to comply with legal requirements as well as customers’ calls for better data protection. On the implementation level, incorporation of privacy protections in products and services depends on the commitment of the engineers who design them. We interviewed six senior engineers, who work for globally leading IT corporations and research institutions, to investigate their motivation and ability to comply with privacy regulations. Our findings point to a lack of perceived responsibility, control, autonomy, and frustrations with interactions with the legal world. While we increasingly call on engineers to go beyond functional requirements and be responsive to human values in our increasingly technological society, we may be facing the dilemma of asking engineers to live up to a challenge they are currently not ready to embrace.",

    "title": "Putting mobile application privacy in context: An empirical study of user privacy expectations for mobile devices",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Users increasingly use mobile devices to engage in social activity and commerce, enabling new forms of data collection by firms and marketers. User privacy expectations for these new forms of data collection remain unclear. A particularly difficult challenge is meeting expectations for contextual integrity, as user privacy expectations vary depending upon data type collected and context of use. This article illustrates how fine-grained, contextual privacy expectations can be measured. It presents findings from a factorial vignette survey that measured the impact of diverse real-world contexts (e.g., medical, navigation, music), data types, and data uses on user privacy expectations. Results demonstrate that individuals’ general privacy preferences are of limited significance for predicting their privacy judgments in specific scenarios. Instead, the results present a nuanced portrait of the relative importance of particular contextual factors and information uses, and demonstrate how those contextual factors can be found and measured. The results also suggest that current common activities of mobile application companies, such as harvesting and reusing location data, images, and contact lists, do not meet users’ privacy expectations. Understanding how user privacy expectations vary according to context, data types, and data uses highlights areas requiring stricter privacy protections by governments and industry.",

To address this question, we collected data on the related artist networks of 22 musicians constructed by Spotify’s Fans Also Like feature and conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with each musician. We used the Qualitative Structural Analysis method for data analysis. Our findings provide insight into what musicians think Fans Also Like is and is for, and reveals how cultural creators understand and experience their algorithmic networks. More broadly, they provide insights into how social actors perceive, understand, and experience their algorithmically constructed peer networks.",

Designers have much at stake in the use of their software, while users are greatly influenced by the design of the software that they use. In this article, I explore the complex relationships built up between the designers and users of human anatomy simulations, including processes of cooperation and conflict. I develop and apply a three-step process for studying the design and use of a software product in its social context. First, it is important to focus on the social worlds of designers and users that influence the development of the technology. Next, the emphasis shifts to the technology itself, which can be viewed as a boundary object emerging from the intersection of the contributing social worlds. Finally, the technology exhibits agency by reshaping the relationships and interactions among the contributing social worlds.",

    "abstract": "This article compares two extended interactions that took place recently on the Internet, one from a recreational Internet Relay Chat (IRC)channel, and the other from an academic listserv discussion group. The two interactions exhibit similar gender dynamics, which can be characterized as harassment of female by male participants. This harassment takes different forms, in keeping with the possibilities inherent in the two modes of computer-mediated communication. Whereas female participants on IRC are kicked off the channel, in the discussion group harassers must rely exclusively on language to intimidate and silence. This \"rhetoric of harassment\" crucially invokes libertarian principles of freedom of expression, constructing women's resistance as \"censorship.\" A rhetorical analysis of the two harassment episodes thus sheds light on the means used to construct and maintain asymmetrical gender and power dynamics in different modes of CMC.",

But the research on information and communication technology (ICT) and reading has been conducted mainly in western countries. This paper explores the potential of ICT-based interventions for fostering a reading habit among university students in Uganda. A cross-sectional survey design was employed and data were collected using a self-designed instrument from eight universities in Uganda. Structural equation analysis using Partial Least Squares was used for statistical analysis of the data. Major findings from 337 valid responses indicate that ICT usage, home culture, school culture, and disposable income significantly impact the reading habits of university students in Uganda.",

In a task switching study, with intermittent tasks appearing once a minute or once every three minutes, we examined attention allocation and the effect of switching on the quantity and novelty of work. Self-reported estimates matched attention allocation obtained from eye fixations, indicating awareness and volitional control of attention. Arousal, quantity, and novelty of work were higher in the switching conditions in comparison to the single task condition. The findings point to the possibility of a quickening effect induced by switching that may be beneficial for work under specific task conditions.",

    "title": "Letter from Rob Kling, Editor-in-Chief and Guest Editors Kenneth L. Kraemer and Jason Dedrick",
    "abstract": "This special issue of The Information Society on Globalization and E-Commerce edited by Professor Kenneth L. Kraemer, Director of the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO) at the University of California, Irvine, and CRITO Research Fellows, Jennifer Gibbs and Jason Dedrick contains case studies of globalization and e-commerce in Brazil, Denmark, France, Korea, Mexico, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as a comparative study of those and other countries (China, Germany, Japan, United States). The issue ends with two book reviews. One of the most significant economic trends of the past decade is the growing use of the Internet for conducting business—now commonly referred to as Internet-based e-commerce. According to enthusiasts, the constraints of time and distance are no longer barriers to businesses and consumers. As people around the world access the Internet, physical borders and time zones become increasingly irrelevant. Anyone with access to the Internet may, for instance, buy groceries, clothes, cars, and real estate, bid at on-line auctions, or manage banking affairs—on any day of the week, at any time of the day or night. Globalization of electronic commerce is supposedly bringing people, products, information, and capital together faster than traditional methods of the past. However, the studies in this special issue indicate that e-commerce is occurring much more slowly and with less profound impacts than predicted by the enthusiasts. The articles in this special issue look at the relative influence of global forces, national environment and national policy factors in shaping the evolution of e-commerce in each country. It concludes that while there are common influences, the paths taken by individual countries are in large part a response to unique national environment and policy conditions. The first article,Environment and Policy Factors Shaping Global E-commerce Diffusion: A CrossCountry Comparison, is based on systematic comparison of case studies from 10 countries: Brazil, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States (six of these countries are also highlighted in individual articles in this issue). Jennifer Gibbs, Kenneth L. Kraemer and Jason Dedrick examine the key global, environmental and policy factors that act as determinants of e-commerce diffusion. The authors find that there are different drivers and enablers, and barriers and inhibitors for business-to-business (B2B) and business-toconsumer (B2C) e-commerce. Drivers and enablers motivating B2B e-commerce include international competitive pressure, the need for cost reduction, trade and market liberalization, and government procurement and promotion. Barriers and inhibitors for B2B stem primarily from lack of IT resources and skills, especially among small firms, as well as engrained business and national cultures that are resistant to change and innovation. Business-to-consumer e-commerce is growing, but more slowly than B2B. The studies show that consumers— particularly younger ones—desire the convenience and greater product or service selection available through e-commerce, while businesses are driven by the desire to xpand or protect markets. Other key enablers are Internet diffusion and government promotion of IT literacy. On the other hand, consumer distrust of online purchases due to security and privacy concerns, lack of valuable local content, inequality in socioeconomic levels, competition from established retail networks, consumer shopping habits, and cultural or language differences act as barriers or inhibitors to consumers doing business on-line. Further, the article finds that enabling policies such as increasing trade and telecommunications liberalization have the biggest impact on the adoption of e-commerce, by making Internet access more affordable to businesses and consumers and increasing competitive pressure on firms to dopt e-commerce. Specific e-commerce legislation does ot appear to have big impact. Protection for both buyers and sellers, however, needs to be developed to ensure greater confidence in doing business on-line. Global and National Factors Affecting E-Commerce Diffusion in Singapore, by Wong Poh-Kam, at the National University of Singapore, suggests that Singapore is likely to be a fast follower, adopting e-commerce applications that have proven successful in other advanced countries. Manufacturing clusters (for example, electronics) in Singapore with strong global supply chain links to advanced countries are likely to be the most aggressive in adopting such applications for B2B e-commerce. Singapore will probably be less likely to pioneer radically new e-commerce technologies or applications for",

    "abstract": "The second-level digital divide, which focuses on skills and usage, calls for a rethink of conventional indices developed for measuring access to technology. We propose a superefficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework to investigate Internet users’ online activity at an individual level by considering their access to information and communication technology (ICT), Internet literacy, and level of usage, and we offer a standard basis for measuring and comparing ICT users. We apply an ordinary least squares regression to explore the factors that influence users’ online activities. Our results show that Internet users who are female, older, less educated, not in white-collar positions, earning a higher monthly income, and living in nonurban areas are more active online when all online activities are considered at the same time. However, the factors that influence individual online activities are different.",

    "abstract": "Information and communication technologies are blurring the boundaries between work and play. We present the first empirical investigation of gender gaps in virtual game economies. Analyzing big data sets from two major game economies, we find that player gender and character gender influence virtual wealth in different ways in different games. We conclude that this can be explained by different returns on female- and male-dominated play activities, that is, virtual pink- and blue-collar occupations. As the line between work and play increasingly blurs, researchers should track which occupations get to keep their conventional economic rewards, and which end up being remunerated in play money.",

ICANN also lays the foundations for governance, creating capabilities for promulgating and enforcing global regulations on Internet use. ICANN leverages the capabilities in the Internet domain name system (DNS) to implement four mechanisms of governance: authority, law, sanctions, and jurisdictions. These governance-related features are embodied in seemingly technical features of ICANN's institutional design. Recognition of ICANN's governance mechanisms allows us to better understand the Internet's emerging regulatory regime.",

State and federal regulators, legislators, scholars, and the courts have examined and responded to the privacy issue from a policy perspective, but perhaps without a complete understanding of the meaning of privacy in the context of the debate. What types of privacy are involved, how significant are these interests, and how might privacy needs compare and be balanced? This article explores privacy in the context of the Caller ID debate from a social science perspective. It examines motives for seeking and preserving privacy and explores the dynamic relationship between the caller and called party positions. It then provides an analysis of current and proposed Caller ID features and policies with a view toward understanding how these proposals balance competing privacy needs. This article establishes an analytic framework and a foundation for further study of caller and called party privacy that should ...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Like other technical changes, the new information technologies have inspired hopes and fears. The optimists celebrate the “technologies of freedom” and their potential for growth and autonomy, the enhancement of skills and culture, the elimination of unpleasant and boring tasks (Pool 1984). On the other hand, the pessimists fear dehumanized work, growing unemployment, and bureaucracy, with unavoidable threats to privacy (Mosco 1987; Robins and Webster 1983). In the communication and development debate, similar polarized attitudes are to be found. The technological optimists of the so‐called “modernization paradigm” claim that the transfer of information technologies to the developing world will spectacularly enhance the process of development. Commentators arguing from within this paradigm point out that the transfer of appropriate information technology can contribute to the creation of new social structures that will adequately respond to the needs of the developing world. At the other extreme,...",

    "abstract": "This study argues that language difference is an important, though often neglected, element in contemporary flows of audiovisual media and organizations' efforts to influence them through policy. Because linguistic issues overlap a number of policy areas, including trade, culture, language, and communication, this study advocates for increased attention to language-related concerns within and across those areas by policymakers and researchers alike. Various developments associated with globalization have contributed to the significance of the transnational media trade, and are discussed in light of language difference. Special emphasis is given the handling of language in media by the European Union and North American Free Trade Agreement, two trade regimes that have treated language difference distinctly. The probable expansion of both trade regimes is likely to increase the salience of linguistic diversity among participant societies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Within the context of the telecommunications policy environment in the United States during the 1990s, the Department of Commerce's Falling Through the Net reports can be read as a 7-year ideological project to legitimize U.S. government's deregulatory policies. This article analyzes the “digital divide” as rhetorical trope in a neoliberal ideology, which placed responsibility for social and economic success in the emerging global information economy at the level of the individual and not the system, effectively foreclosing on any class-based analyses of the problems associated with the transition from a Keynesian welfare state and industrial economy to a neoliberal and globalized information economy. Unpacking the discursive significance of the “digital divide,” with special focus on public libraries and projects of the Gates Foundation, illuminates how it foreclosed on the possibility of alternative problem definitions by making the problem a technical and administrative one rather than an issue of historic class struggle. The article draws on open-source projects in developing countries to offer an alternate frame for formulating policies for equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).",

The proposition cuts against the epistemological grain of social sciences, such as psychology and sociology, which have ontological commitments to a particular level of analysis. The position advanced here suggests theories where processes operate at one level and generate effects that emerge at a higher level. Further, it is argued that the best place to begin looking at the process of interaction is at the level of the neural circuit, a realm far below discussions that center at the interpersonal or cultural levels.",

In this article, we explore the potential of the Net, a vast, loosely coupled system of electronic forums, for facilitating and hindering democratic participation. In so doing, we identify five assumptions that undergird the claim that the Net will enhance democratic participation and suggest that increased democratic participation rests on three fundamental characteristics: access, voice, and dialogue. In order for this network of electronic forums to facilitate democratic participation, educational, economic, and cultural barriers to access, voice, and dialogue must be overcome. The final part of this article raises additional challenges to realizing democracy via the Net.",

In this essay the emergence of a digital culture as amplified and accelerated by the popularity of networked computers, multiple-user software, and Internet is investigated in terms of its principal components. A digital culture as an underdetermined praxis is conceptualized as consisting of participation, remediation, and bricolage. Using the literature on presumably “typical” Internet phenomena such as the worldwide proliferation of independent media centers (indymedia) linked with (radical) online journalism practices and the popularity of (individual and group) weblogging, the various meanings and implications of this particular understanding of digital culture are explored. In the context of this essay, digital culture can be seen as an emerging set of values, practices, and expectations regarding the way people (should) act and interact within the contemporary network society. This digital culture has emergent properties with roots in both online and offline phenomena, with links to trends and developments predating the World Wide Web, yet having an immediate impact and particularly changing the ways in which we use and give meaning to living in an increasingly interconnected, always on(line) environment.",

    "abstract": "Noting that interactivity is often defined but seldom theorized in the literature, this article provides some pointers for developing theories about effects of interactivity, particularly as it applies to Web-based mass communication. It first makes the case that interactivity is an attribute of the technology and not that of the user. It exposes the tautology of studying the effects of perceived interactivity and calls for the consideration of ontological aspects that constitute interactivity while specifying its social and psychological effects. Theoretical explorations may be categorized in terms of three classes of outcome measures—behavioral, attitudinal, and cognitive—as we investigate the role played by interactivity in initiating action, changing attitudes, and altering the nature of information processing. These would result in theories about technology rather than psychology in that they help us specify direct and combination effects of interactivity, modality, navigability, and other technological attributes of the Web medium.",

    "title": "Remapping the Digital Divide",
    "abstract": "A phrase with great urgency a few years ago, “the digital divide” now is on the sidelines. As the federal government renewed its commitment to marketplace solutions in telecommunications and information technology issues under the Bush administration, the idea of a digital divide faced criticism from FCC Chairman Powell for being an ill-advised version of the “Mercedes divide” in the United States: Some people can afford expensive luxury cars, others cannot, but that is the American way. The notion of a severe divide also was challenged by an array of studies documenting the rising pace of computer and Internet use and connectivity: The statistics seem to be moving in the right direction, so why worry? Numerous programs founded in the late 1990s by the federal government (NTIA’s Technology Opportunity Program, the Department of Education’s Community Technology Centers programs, Housing and Urban Development’s Neighborhood Networks Program) have been slashed. They were intended to aid technology deployment to disadvantaged populations or remote regions and to spread the reach of the Internet to more publicly available locations in order to serve people who do not have home equipment of their own, or who could not afford an Internet connection. The phrase “digital opportunity” replaced the divide, putting a blandly positive spin on all things computer related. As the very idea of inequity is eliminated from the social policy vocabulary in favor of marketplace reasoning, the concept of a divide being played out on the latest technology front may slip away from public scrutiny. This issue of The Information Society is an effort to reassert some of the new definitions of the digital divide, and to explore its shape and operations in more nuanced ways. The brief history of the digital divide illustrates symbolic, practical, and opportunistic responses to the confusing prospect presented by mass use of computers and the Internet. The confusion relies on the ready acceptance that the computer is the gateway to membership in the Information Society and the workforce of the future, and that it also renders society more democratic, even in the face of no substantial change to our existing social structure attributable to computerization.

    "abstract": "Abstract The rise of large online communities in China has gone hand-in-hand with heavy regulation by the Chinese party-state. Caught between the party-state and demanding users, how do online platforms govern online communities to please both, and stay competitive against rivals? Drawing on public documents, interviews, and ethnographic observations, we study Bilibili, a leading online participatory platform for Generation Z. We argue that Bilibili has adopted a “bidirectional mediation” approach to actively mediate between users and the party-state. In this approach, the key to online governance is finding, or even cultivating, common grounds between users and the party-state and proactively facilitating communications between the two sides. We illustrate Bilibili’s bidirectional mediation through its Disciplinary Committee, an organization that enables users to participate in regulating online content on the Bilibili platform. The Bilibili case provides important insights into the evolution of online communities and state-society relations in China.",

However, the government has played a bigger role in the economy than is often recognized, responding to market failures, social problems, and the needs of the business community. Information technology (IT) policy in Hong Kong has mirrored the colony's laissez‐faire economic strategy, with little government effort to promote the production or use of IT products and services. Hong Kong has become an advanced user of IT in several economic sectors and an assembly site for personal computer hardware. However, like much of the manufacturing sector, the computer industry is moving much of its production to China, causing concern about the future of Hong Kong's economy. While some people feel that Hong Kong can flourish as a financial and business services center, others feel that this role will be diminished as the Chinese economy liberalizes and other centers ...",

This program, called the Xerox project, helped hundreds of public institutions acquire photocopy machines. Under the suppressive Hungarian regime of the 1980s the appearance of photocopy machines as a new means of copying texts had serious political consequences. By means of historical research and expert interviews, this article analyzes the nature of these consequences and examines how certain meanings and uses of photocopy machines evolved in the latter half of the 1980s.",

    "title": "Regimes of Information: Land Use, Management, and Policy",
    "abstract": "Socio-ecological systems are inherently complex. One source of complexity is the uncertainties involved in the decisions and behaviors of human actors that determine how landholdings are managed. Land management decisions are often influenced by diverse factors and considerations. Particularly significant among these are (1) the sources of information land managers utilize with their perceived quality, reliability, and accessibility; (2) the social networks of the decision maker with their pertinent history, appeal, and authority; and (3) the interests, resources, and prior experiences of individual decision makers. This degree of diversity and uncertainty gives rise to behaviors that cannot be entirely explained in terms of rational choice or any variation thereof. How can we best understand and explain these behaviors, as spatial but also social and informational, in land-use decision making? This article presents the case of land management in a county in the Midwest United States to develop a conceptual model of decision making of environmental resources in socio-ecological systems. This model conceives environmental decision making as a multivalent process that operates on the basis of different “regimes of worth,” incorporating not only the economic value of outcomes but also other personal and social values within different worlds or polities. These worlds, in turn, incorporate particular “regimes of information” based on particular higher principles that they uphold. The article examines these regimes, provides examples of what constitutes information in each regimes, and explores the management and policy implications of this framework.",

    "abstract": "Political theorists like Alexis de Tocqueville have long recognized the importance of citizen associations for the practice of democracy. Through participation in associations, citizens both receive an education in public affairs and create centers of political power independent of the state. Essential to participation in an association is participation in a forum, a communication space that allows for many-to-many communication in which citizens can \"treat of public affairs in public\" (Tocqueville, 1945, p. 109). Participation in forums suffers from numerous barriers, however, such as the need to meet in one common place, the need to meet at one common time, and the potentially high costs of participation. Online forums on the Internet avoid many of these barriers, and thus they hold the promise of facilitating the formation and operation of citizen associations. This was confirmed in 1995 by the experiences of a Boston-based citizen association, the Telecommunication Policy Roundtable-Northeast (TPR-NE)...",

In response, companies started to develop products and services related to open source software. Subsequently, they also tried to come to terms with the processes that are characteristic of open source software development. This article examines the efforts made by companies to use open source principles and practices for corporate purposes. The study shows that over time the open source-inspired networks developed by these companies gradually come to resemble classical corporate networks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While much attention has been paid to how China’s rise as a digital superpower could threaten US hegemony over cyberspace, much less has been written on what the Digital Silk Road, or the presence of Chinese tech firms in developing countries more broadly, means for technological upgrading and development. This article contributes to filling this gap by investigating the technology spillovers emanating from two Chinese tech giants – Huawei and ZTE – in Algeria and Egypt. Using a political economy framework that combines insights from structuralist economic development and techno-politics and drawing on over 70 semi-structured interviews and field-observations, it argues that despite localizing activities that bear the promise of generating significant linkages, the two Chinese tech firms created no meaningful learning opportunities for domestic entities that contribute to technological upgrading. What could at first seem like developmental connections that promote technology transfers are found to be linkages diffusing Chinese infrastructures, hardware, software, processes, and standards that shape distinct digital systems. Without pro-active policies from host governments, the Digital Silk Road risks creating new technological dependencies; locking local ICT actors into activities and relationships captured and defined by Chinese tech giants.",

    "title": "Digital Museums and Diverse Cultural Knowledges: Moving Past the Traditional Catalog",
    "abstract": "Web 2.0 technologies have introduced increasingly participatory practices to creating content, and museums are becoming interested in the potentials of “Museum 2.0” for reaching and engaging with new audiences. As technological advances are opening up the ways in which museums share information about the objects in their collections, the means by which museums create, handle, process, and transmit knowledge has become more transparent. For this to be done effectively, however, some underlying contradictions must be resolved between museum practices, which privilege the account of the “expert,” and distributed social technology practices, whose strengths lie in allowing for many, sometimes contradictory, perspectives. This article presents a theoretical position and framework for the adaptation of Web 2.0 technologies within the traditional work of the museum, in ways that support the generation and representation of knowledge in, by, and for diverse communities. We then expand on this theoretical perspective by discussing several case studies of exploratory work in this area, and close the article by presenting a few tactical, bottom-up initiatives that museums and distributed communities can take to facilitate the diffusion of this new conceptual framework. Though the subject of this article is online museums, the issues are relevant to all online collections, in particular portals, online public access catalogs (OPAC), and content management systems.",

The analysis is based on traffic data gathered from Norway using approximately 24 million calls and texts made by private individuals. Previous research has shown that our temporal and spatial movement is highly predictable and that the majority of calls and text messages are sent to only four to six different persons. This article extends this research by examining both tie strength and the distance between the interlocutors in urban and rural settings. The findings show that even as information and communication technologies (ICTs) potentially put the world at our fingertips, the mobile phone is an instrument of a more limited geographical and social sphere. Approximately two-thirds of our calls/texts go to strong ties that are within a 25-km radius.",

By analyzing historic and current penetration levels of the radio, television, and telephone, it suggests that most information technology gaps are amalgamations of smaller socioeconomic trends and can be discerned and reduced only with careful historical analysis of both technology choices and living patterns. It proposes localized universal service strategies, since the penetration gaps are affected by a complex array of factors more particular to localities than to the country as a whole and as such must be investigated with rigor and caution if progress toward the elimination of penetration gaps is to occur.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the industrially advanced societies of the West, economic development has invariably been accompanied by a structural shift of labor from the primary and secondary production Sectors to the tertiary or service sector. A systematic analysis of the service sector would show that the “commodity” on which this sector acts is “information.” The increasing importance of “information” for control and management in an “advancing” society is the primary reason for the structural shift of labor to the service sector. In this paper the critical importance of the service sector to development is emphasized and it is argued that information technology that underpins activity in this sector is an appropriate technology for speeding‐up socioeconomic development in the third world countries.",

Based on our case study on the BBC's Digital Media Initiative, we further explore these changes in the domain of video craft editing for television broadcast brought about by the digitization of the video production process. As craft editing is mediated by digital images, its contextual embeddedness is transformed by context-independent standards of computation and metadata resulting in the erosion of the contextual boundaries of the practice. Given our findings, we argue that in the digital domain, the embeddedness of practices needs to be reconsidered in favor of concepts that account for the peculiarities of digitality and its unprecedented degree of context autonomy.",

The lower startup costs and the easier overall accessibility of mobile phones relative to personal computers suggest that the mobile phone may be a possible alternative for overcoming unequal access to information communication technology in Japan and elsewhere. Using microdata from 2001, we compare and contrast the determinants of mobile versus computer-based Internet in Japan. Our findings show that mobile Internet access, as compared to computer access, is determined less by demographics, socioeconomic status, and technological readiness, suggesting that barriers to Internet access are lower for mobile phones than is the case for computers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The research on online news comments has been dominated by a normative approach and has centered on media engagement. Normativity and media dominance have also featured big in the theoretical discussions on the public sphere. This article presents a case study of online news comments, combining a novel methodological testing of social network hypotheses to examine user–user interactions in online comments with a conceptual discussion of the potential connections between social network research and theories of the public. The social network analysis in this study indicated that users (online commentators) do not constitute highly dense networks, although their relations can be studied as social networks. However, this analysis can only explore limited features of this online phenomenon and requires complementary methods.

In this article, the concept of SDI is understood as a myth, a mobilizing and at the same time seductive tale that inspires actors to enact reality. This article first shows what myths underlie the notion of SDI in the American discourse, and then examines how the notion of SDI was reinterpreted and domesticated in the African SDI discourse. Thereafter it reflects on domestication of SDI in Africa using Rottenburg's theory of iterating processes of consensus and knowledge differentiation.",

Can those who browse the Web protect their privacy? And does it matter if they cannot? I offer answers to these questions from the American legal tradition. The American legal tradition focuses on a right to privacy, rather than a need for data protection. To answer these questions I begin by delineating the differences among privacy, security, and anonymity. I then discuss what information is transferred during Web browsing. I describe some of the available technology for privacy protection, including public and private key cryptography and Web proxies. I then describe the American tradition of privacy in common, statutory, and constitutional law. With the support of this tradition, I close by arguing that although privacy in Web browsing has no current legal protection in the United States, the right to privacy in the analogue equivalents has...",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article explores the efforts of one network of afterschool programs to leverage new media technologies to promote out-of-school learning among high school students from nondominant backgrounds and connect this learning to their school contexts. The study entailed in-depth interviews and focus groups with 40 youth and adults involved in the afterschool programming, as well as 12 observations of afterschool sessions and school-based classes. A thematic analysis of the transcripts and field notes revealed a notable discrepancy in youth's learning experiences in school and afterschool settings. Out-of-school learning experiences were more likely to be peer supported, interest powered, and production centered. They were also more likely to engage youth and adults around a shared purpose and to take advantage of openly networked infrastructures. Two theoretical frameworks from the field of information behavior are used to explore the distinct successes and challenges associated with promoting rich learning experiences in each setting.",

    "abstract": "Those responsible for the technical decision making that created the Internet found they had to think through a number of social policy issues, from privacy and intellectual property rights through the definition of common carriage and environmental problems, along the way. Such issues were framed by conceptualizations of the nature of the network, goals to be served by the network, users and uses of the network, and the design criteria that served as policy principles developed during the early years of the design process. This article examines such policy fundamentals as they developed through the technical document series that records the Internet design process, the Internet Requests for Comments (RFCs) during the first decade of that process, 1969–1979.",

    "abstract": "Individuals try to guard their right to privacy by exercising their right to informational self-determination. They thereby hope to retain control over their identity, which they construct over time by interpreting how their past relates to their present. In a similar vein, historians try to make sense of the past by way of interpreting past events. The theory of narrative identity helps to understand these processes. By an explorative discussion of narrative techniques, historiographical methods including the art of (auto)biography, and the role they play in identity construction, this article aims to give fresh insights into the theory of informational self-determination. An analysis is presented of three types of attempts by individuals to gain control of their digital double, in an effort to maintain their personal dignity. With the lessons learned, an indication is given of the viability of the principle of informational self-determination in the Internet era.",

    "abstract": "The mobile Internet (MI) has been hyped as the next big thing by telecom operators, handset manufacturers, and content providers. However, recent studies indicate that the usage of Internet via mobile phones has remained quite flat. The authors inquire into this discrepancy by focusing on actual usage of the MI and the motivating factors behind its use. Based on focus-group interviews in Norway and Hungary, they argue that MI usage is interrelated with and is an extension of the personal computer (PC)–based Internet. The key motivation behind MI use is to attain information in situations in which the PC is out of reach. In effect, MI has not led to the development of new usages. The expectation that the development of new killer applications will lead to an explosion of new usage is therefore misguided. MI usage is and will perhaps continue to be a mere extension of PC-based Internet usage—and such use activities are the very nature of MI.",

    "title": "Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy, by Lawrence Lessig. New York: Penguin, 2008. 327 pp. $25.95 cloth. ISBN 978-1594201721 (cloth)",
    "abstract": "Famed Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig offers readers a highly provocative book on the state of affairs regarding digital media and its relationship to copyright. His book, Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy, dives deep into what Lessig calls the current copyright war. But the book is not simply about the future of copyright and the detrimental effects of an outdated legal code on creativity and innovation; it is about the choices we make, and will make in the future, that criminalize or decriminalize an entire class of computer users, notably younger file-sharers. Lessig requests rational government intervention that follows “sense” rather than dollars, and is built around the “creative opportunity of hybrids and remix creativity”— an intervention that “decriminalizes the offense of being a teen” (294). Structurally, Remix is divided into three parts. Part I, “Cultures,” provides the reader with an overview of two types of culture, the fluid and malleable Read/Write (RW), and the rigidly structured, top-down Read Only (RO). Of particular note are Lessig’s detailed distinctions and comparisons made in chapter 5 between RW and RO culture pertaining to value (fiscal, use, and legal). Also notable is Lessig’s ability to juxtapose two seemingly contradictory cultures against one another without establishing a value hierarchy. Lessig does not encourage us to choose one culture over the other but instead to operate between both cultures, using each according to its relative applicability to our needs. Part II, “Economies,” explores the economic implications of a future that operates with both a RW and RO culture. The book’s second part distinguishes between two forms of economy—commercial and sharing— to conclude that a successful future rests with a hybrid of the two. Lessig reminds us that hybrid economies are nothing new on the Internet, offering the paradigm of free software, or shareware. Other examples outlined are community spaces such as craigslist, YouTube, and Flickr; collaboration spaces like Slashdot, Last.fm, and Wikia; and communities like Second Life. One cannot complain about a lack of examples in Lessig’s book, as he goes to great length to find both contemporary and, although to a limited degree, historical examples that support his claims. Lessig closes part II acknowledging that although market incentives are critical to the success of the hybrid economy, policy changes and reform are also needed. Part III, “Enabling the Future,” argues that for the hybrid economy to root itself, we must make substantial changes not only to policy but also in the way we think about producers of digital work. Lessig offers readers a provocative alternative to our current—what he considers to be outmoded—copyright laws. His suggested reforms distinguish between the professional and the amateur, as well as copies and remixes. Although copies make the work more accessible, remixes transform the work. Different combinations should yield different copyright regulations, he argues, advocating copyright protections for professional copies, while completely deregulating amateur remixes. In brief, Lessig asserts that his system fosters “amateur creativity” without penalty (254). Lessig’s arguments about enabling the future, however, are somewhat opaque, perhaps owing to a hazy distinction between amateur and professional. I found myself wondering where one might draw the line between the two. In suggesting this distinction, Lessig’s work reinvigorates the issue of hierarchy. We might ask, does digital new media collapse the distance and distinctions",

    "title": "National Identity and the Informational Welfare State: Turkey and Malaysia Compared",
    "abstract": "Researchers have found a number of economic, technological, and political factors to be associated with the diffusion of information technology in developing countries. But cultural factors generally, and national identity in particular, have almost never been viewed as consequential. Castells and Himanen's 2002 study of the information society in Finland, in which the authors identify Finnish national culture as an impetus to the development of the country's informational welfare state, is the most prominent exception to this pattern. This article provides a critical overview of Castells and Himanen's research and revises their conceptual framework to focus on the specific choices states make in constructing their national identities and the effects of these choices on information policy and information technology diffusion. It demonstrates the value of this revised framework through a comparison of the historical trajectories of Turkey and Malaysia's nation-building projects, the incentives these projects have created for the two countries’ social and political elites, and the public information policies and programs that have resulted.",

It examines the effect that the political system—features of the ruling party, interparty competition, voters, and interest groups—has on the development of e–participatory government. The authors' analysis indicates that given that politicians have the most say in the development of e–participatory government, and at the same time they are the ones most averse to its development, except for those with a conservative ideology, the style of administration and the pressure exerted by interest groups are the key factors for the development of e–participatory government.",

In this study we examine two innovation hubs situated in starkly different locations: London and Lusaka. We examine them from a social production of space perspective to understand how, despite similar self-defined framing as hubs, they differently enact the day-to-day physical and social spaces. Our study shows the need to recognize “multiplicity of spaces” and a sensitivity to the politics of lived differences between the celebrated imaginary and the performed local practices of innovation hubs, as part of a global phenomenon.",

But this assumption is not supported by the available evidence. Using four waves of longitudinal data from Britain we show that Internet use has a positive effect on social class mobility, while controlling for age, gender, education, health, and previous social class membership between 1997 and 2013. In doing so, we contribute to a wider discussion of the relationships between social and digital inequalities and highlight the challenges and potential of this methodological approach for future research.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the authors describe the development of a digital training project aimed at groups at risk of social exclusion in the community of Cantabria, Spain. This project is in keeping with national and international policies—especially those designed by the European Union—that seek to develop an information society accessible for all citizens. They describe the results of two-and-one-half years of training activities that aim to bring certain social groups into closer contact with information and communication technology (ICT). Although the training program is based on the notion that access to technologies, as well as certain uses that can be made of them, is linked to digital and social inclusion, the authors try to avoid what some have called myths and mistaken beliefs surrounding ICT, especially the idea that more and better technology necessarily produces a society that is more in touch, more socially committed, more just, and more democratic. They believe that the ideas and dilemmas that have arisen as a result of the design, development, and assessment of the digital training project can cast light on the meaning of teaching “with,” “from,” and “based on” ICT.",

    "abstract": "While the philosophical foundations of information security have been unexamined, there is an implicit philosophy of what protection of information is. This philosophy is based on the notion of containment, taken from analogies with things that offer physical security (e.g., buildings, safes, fences). I argue that this implicit philosophy is unsatisfactory in the current age of increased connectivity, and provide an alternative foundation. I do so from a constructionist point of view, where the coevolution of social and technical mechanisms is seen as the source of the security of an information system, rather than rational design choices only. I employ the concept of causal insulation from system theory in order to give an account of the fundamental characteristics of information security research. This generates definitions that can be used for philosophically informed discussions on the protection of information in new systems.",

The sample consists of 170 Italian and Spanish municipalities that used Facebook in 2014. The findings show that posting a lot of information on municipal Facebook pages does not increase the engagement of citizens. Also, frequent posting of information per se does not engage public engagement. However, if the posts are published when public can pay attention to them (e.g., off days), the likelihood of public engagement increases. Furthermore, the citizens’ engagement on municipal Facebook page depends on the level of citizens’ income – there is a negative relationship between citizens’ income and the level of participation.",

This article uses the case of Bangladesh as a vehicle for examining the transferability of the universal service concept to developing countries. The analysis suggests that liberalization and privatization of the telecommunications sector policies pushed by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, and other international agencies, will not by themselves create universal access in countries with rudimentary urban-centric networks. The policymakers need to incorporate build-out obligations when licensing operators and also develop cross-subsidy mechanisms even though they are now out of fashion in the industrialized world.",

    "title": "Mobilising Poverty?: Mobile Phone Use and Everyday Spatial Mobility Among Low-Income Families in Santiago, Chile",
    "abstract": "In the last few decades physical mobility has become one of the key elements of contemporary societies. This centrality of mobility also means the development of a new kind of social exclusion caused by the problems of living in a social context in which one has to be increasingly “on the move” to access goods and services. In this article, based on fieldwork conducted with 20 low-income family inhabitants of the city of Santiago, Chile, we study the role that mobile phone usage has in relation to physical mobility in the everyday lives of these individuals. Through an analysis of the pattern of usage and mobility of these devices, we arrive at the conclusion that rather than giving rise to an experience of constant mobility and “anytime–anywhere” availability, the individuals studied face limitations and exclusions that profoundly constrict the potential “mobility” afforded by these devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While there has been much anticipation that open government data (OGD) would increase the inclusion of marginalized groups in government decision-making processes, researchers have found little evidence of it. Such findings or lack of findings of social impact have led researchers to call for critical review of present notions of OGD’s impact and also for better theoretical frameworks. In response to these calls, we develop a theoretical framework based on an ethnographic study of civic use of OGD in Hong Kong. We argue that constrained by the deliberative democracy models that focus on existing mechanisms of political participation, researchers have tended to overlook the use of OGD for protests, contestation, and other expressions of adversarial politics, which also produce a use of OGD for social impacts.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT While macro theorists of informational capitalism have tended to consider intellectual property in a vague and general way, intellectual property researchers have tended to focus on extremely specific issues. What gets missed is an understanding of intellectual property as a system and its relationship with the totality of capitalism. Starting from a cognitive materialist approach, this article offers a systematic account of the recent expansion of intellectual property rights. Thereafter, it situates the data on the expansion of intellectual property vis-à-vis the transition from industrial to informational capitalism and relates that expansion specifically to informational productive processes. It concludes with a general proposition about the relationship between the changes of stage in capitalism and the institutions of intellectual property.",

    "abstract": "Privacy has largely been equated with every individual's right to privacy. Accordingly, current efforts to protect privacy on the Internet have sought anonymity by breaking, where possible, links with personally identifiable information (PII)—all uses of aggregated data stripped of PII are considered legitimate. This article argues that we need to use a broader concept, general or group identifying information (GII), because even aggregated data stripped of PII violate privacy at the community level. The search engine companies, or anyone else with access to their log files, can use these data to generate a moment-by-moment view of what is on the collective mind. Such a view can be used in a variety of ways, some with deep economic and even political impact. In order to frame this discussion, it is necessary to examine some of the realities of the search engine-mediated associative interface to the World Wide Web. While this interface has enormous benefits for the networked world, it also fundamentally changes a number of issues underlying various current debates about Internet governance.",

    "abstract": "In the sociology of childhood and youth, children have been conceptualized as passive subjects on hold, still in the process of becoming—rather than in an effective state of being. In effect, children have been conceptualized as the subjects rather than the objects of the research process. This influence got carried over to digital divide research. The latest thinking in the field has started to define and understand children and young people as heterogeneous, nonpassive, autonomous, diverse, and versatile agents actively appropriating the Internet in meaningful contexts of their everyday lives. This article seeks to move the discourse forward via four parallel binary logistic regressions that assess diverse and socially mediated opportunities needed to learn basic digital skills from a representative sample of 6,602 primary and secondary students from 350 schools and high schools in Catalonia, Spain. Our research shows that the school appears to be playing a secondary role, as compared with children and young people's social practice in heterogenic contexts of everyday life, not only for Internet training but also for providing opportunities to develop and master basic digital skills.",

    "abstract": "The connections between the development of creative industries and the growth of cities was noted by several sources in the first decade of the twenty-first century, but explanations relating to the nature of the link have thus far proven to be insufficient. The two dominant “scripts” were those of “creative clusters” and “creative/cities/creative class” theories, but both have significant limitations arising from how they privilege amenities-led, supply-driven accounts of urban development and how they fail to adequately situate cities in wider global circuits of culture and economic production. The author proposes that the emergent field of cultural economic geography provides some insights that redress these lacunae, particularly in the possibilities for an original synthesis of cultural and economic geography, cultural studies, and new strands of economic theory.",

    "title": "Realizing the benefits of open government data: Journalists’ coverage of the NHS winter crisis, 2016–17",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the current literature on open government data (OGD) ecosystems, academics have paid little attention to the way data journalists realize the benefits of publicly-available data. To address this, in this study I use content analysis (n  = 65), thematic analysis, and interviews with journalists (n  = 5) to examine how the news media used data in their reporting during the NHS (National Health Service, UK) winter crisis of 2016–2017. The findings show that journalists to some extent realized the benefits of the OGD through the adoption of the population problem data-frame to criticize the government. But they were limited in their use of more informative and critical data-frames, even though they accessed the available data and had the relevant data skills. This was a product of the reification and naturalization of certain health data that rendered other data-informed news stories very hard to articulate. These findings suggest that data themselves – rather than just the motives of data producers – can limit the benefits that can be realized by data users.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Connectivity, enabled by mobile devices and mobile e-mail access in particular, plays an increasingly important role at work. While there is a growing body of literature on employees who experience great levels of connectivity, little is known about those who have low levels of connectivity because they have not been provided with mobile devices for work. When highly connected individuals collaborate with less technologically equipped employees, the latter have to negotiate their work practices in a demanding space of expectations and technological constraints and affordances. This article examines these dynamics via mixed-methods case studies of two public-sector organizations in Germany.",

    "abstract": "Traditional typologies of consumer privacy concern suggest that consumers fall into three distinct groups: One-fourth of consumers are not concerned about privacy, one-fourth are highly concerned, and half are pragmatic, in that their concerns about privacy depend on the situation presented. This study examines online users to determine whether types of privacy concern online mirror the offline environment. An e-mail survey of online users examined perceived privacy concerns of 15 different situations involving collection and usage of personally identifiable information. Results indicate that the vast majority of online users are pragmatic when it comes to privacy. Further analysis of the data suggested that online users can be segmented into four distinct groups, representing differing levels of privacy concern. Distinct demographic differences were seen. Persons with higher levels of education are more concerned about their privacy online than persons with less education. Additionally, persons over the age of 45 years tended to be either not at all concerned about privacy or highly concerned about privacy. Younger persons tended to be more pragmatic. Content and policy implications are provided.",

    "title": "Privacy and smart speakers: A multi-dimensional approach",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last few years, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have become increasingly present within British households. Yet, privacy remains a prominent concern in the public discourse about smart speakers, as well as in the nascent academic literature. We argue that privacy in the context of smart speakers is more complex than in other settings due to smart speakers’ specific technological affordances and also the axial relationships between users, the device, device manufacturers, application developers, and other third parties such as moderation contractors and data brokers. With survey data from Amazon Echo and Google Home users in the UK, we explore users’ privacy concerns and privacy protection behaviors related to smart speakers. We rely on a contextual understanding of privacy, assessing the prevalence of seven distinct privacy concern types as well as three privacy protection behaviors. The results indicate that concerns about third parties, such as contractors listening to smart speaker recordings, are most pronounced. Privacy protection behaviors are uncommon but partly affected by privacy concerns and motives such as social presence and utilitarian benefits. Taken together, our research paints a picture of privacy pragmatism or privacy cynicism among smart speaker users.",

We examine the factors that motivated hundreds of people to donate their time, expertise, and in-game resources to people they had never met. These factors included specific affordances of the many technologies relied upon, the emotional weight and urgency of the initial post, both trusted and well-connected actors in the network, and a sense of belonging to the greater community by many of those who helped. Furthering our knowledge on how rituals surrounding death and mourning work in digital networks can provide insights into the continued health of online communities in general.",

    "abstract": "Information and communication technology (ICT) development initiatives have begun to acknowledge the power and importance of cultural and community-focused belief systems. Yet the vast majority of such initiatives tend to preidentify developmental goals that communities hold. Paulo Freire's writings have influenced development initiatives by introducing the possibility of working with communities to orient projects. While these “participatory” initiatives have involved soliciting community feedback relative to a research project whose goals were formulated in the university or development institution, they do not go far enough to harness actual visions held by communities. It is important to conceptualize a model and methodology of engaging communities to develop and articulate their own goals of information access and ultimately, an indigenous approach toward cultural, political, and economic aspects of development. This approach holds promise to sustain communities within a return on the investment and efforts of the researcher or institution. This article closes by describing a current initiative in Southern India that reflects the described methodology.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, many different types of e-government projects have been implemented across the developing world. One important application area, especially following the Millennium Development Goals, is the introduction of health information systems to improve the management of health care for development. Despite significant investments in these projects, experience reveals a disjuncture between macro-level policy priorities and micro-level implementation of these programmes. We use a broad conceptualization of evaluation to synthesize priorities at different levels during the implementation of an e-government project—the Health Information Systems Project (HISP) in Andhra Pradesh, India. This enables us to identify important enabling processes and conditions which serve to connect policy and implementation priorities. Our findings suggest that evaluation does help us to understand the disjuncture between policy at the macro level and implementation at the micro level and to identify linkages between the two. Finally, we discuss some of the key institutional issues that need to be addressed to translate the learning derived from the field into policy actions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we draw on a survey conducted with elite upcoming lawyers from all around the world to shed new light on the ethical acceptability of file sharing practices. Although file sharing is typically illegal, our findings show that lawyers overwhelmingly perceive it as an acceptable social practice. The main criterion used by lawyers to decide on the ethical acceptability of file sharing is whether or not the infringer derives any monetary benefits from it. Further, our findings show that lawyers in the public sector (including judiciary and academia) are even more tolerant of online copyright infringement than those in the private sector. Interestingly, our data suggests that this is largely the result of self-selection: lawyers who lean more on the side of broad disclosure and social sharing tend to orient themselves toward the public sector. Implications for the current state of the debate on the reform of copyright law are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Participation is often used as a blanket term that is uncritically celebrated; this is particularly true in the case of youth digital participation. In this article, we propose a youth-focused analytical framework, applicable to a wide variety of youth digital participation projects, which can help facilitate a more nuanced understanding of these participatory practices. This framework analyzes the aims envisioned for youth participation, the actors and contexts of these activities, and the variable levels of participatory intensity, in order to more accurately assess the forms and outcomes of youth digital participation. We demonstrate the value of this framework by applying it to two contemporary cases of digital youth participation: an informal online community (Nerdfighters) and a formalized educational initiative (CyberPatriot). Such analyses facilitate normative assessments of youth digital participation, which enable us to better assess what participation is good for, and for whom.",

In both text-based and graphical virtual worlds, users are represented in the world by discursive or visual avatars. Because the manner in which users in a synchronous shared environment are represented affects how they are able to communicate, the design of an avatar affects the communicative possibilities within a virtual world. This essay examines the development of GVRs in order to question how representations of selves in these newer versions of cyberspace relate to on-linecommunication. The focus here is particularly on how bodies in GVRs are gendered, and how differing modes of gender inscription might affect online interaction. Ultimately, GVRs raise the issue of how the visual affects the verbal when both are mediated by technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Job seekers can utilize social media platforms to actively search for job opportunities and also receive unsolicited job offers from recruiters and employers. Using data from a representative sample of Finnish social media users, this article studies both aspects of social media job attainment by analyzing how much individuals successfully apply for jobs and get recruited to positions through social media. Results show that the prevalence of successfully applying to jobs through social media does not differ statistically between socio-economic groups, but the prevalence of getting recruited to jobs through social media is greater within higher socio-economic groups. LinkedIn users are more likely to get recruited to a job, while strategic networking and posting of professional content increase the chances of both successfully applying and getting recruited to a job through social media. The findings demonstrate that in social media-mediated job market, job seekers’ online behavior affects one’s exposure to job leads and career opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Through this article we theorize on the nature and effects of articulation work relative to the take-up and use of information and communications technologies (ICT). Articulation work is “work that enables other work”: that which links people, processes, and technologies within organizations. Articulation work in organizations is both common and too often invisible from a managerial or budgetary perspective. Drawing on data from a study of the introduction and implementation of mobile computing technologies into criminal justice organizations, we highlight two findings: (1) There exist ongoing but unmet articulation needs present in any organization or work system. (2) Articulation is cumulative. We find, that as work becomes more complex (such as adding new work tasks and using new technologies), there is more articulation needed. These findings raise issues with assessing the costs of articulation on individuals, and making arrangements to accommodate explicit and implicit articulation in organizational work, particularly around the take-up and ongoing use of ICT-based systems.",

    "abstract": "In this investigation, a multifaceted model of Internet appropriation that encompasses four types of access—motivational, material, skills, and usage—is tested with a representative sample of the Dutch population. The analysis indicates that while the digital divide policies' focus has moved to skills and usage access, motivational and material access remain relevant since they are necessary through the entire process of Internet appropriation. Moreover, each type of access has its own ground of determination and they interact together to shape digital inequalities. Therefore, digital divide policies should address material, skills, and usage access simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "In development literature, information and communications technology (ICT) has been characterized as having the potential to enable national development. However, ICT has been conceptualized mostly as a monolithic and homogeneous entity. To a great extent, the ambiguous findings and diverse opinions on the role of ICT in national development can be attributed to this limited focus. In order to better understand the role ICT can play in national development, we believe that the ICT artifact needs to be examined in finer detail. We propose that ICT needs to be conceptualized in its many facets, perceptions, and in its manifold impact in societies. We use recent concepts from the IT literature to propose an integrative framework to study the role of ICT in development. Policymakers and donor agencies may find this framework useful in evaluating the potential impact of development interventions using ICT.",

Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education. The usage gap is related to the evolution of the information and network society. Finally, policy perspectives are discussed.",

Through a case study of a controversial public-private partnership between Royal Free Trust, a National Health Service hospital system in the United Kingdom, and Alphabet’s AI venture DeepMind Health, we investigate how forms of data governance were adapted, as PHI data flowed into new use contexts, to address concerns of contextual integrity, which is violated when personal information collected in one use context moves to another use context with different norms of appropriateness.",

It is a useful and even necessary concept for developing an understanding of the behavior of the new, networked world. This paper introduces the model, traces its origins, and provides examples of its application. It is suggested that an understanding of many aspects of network behavior will be enabled or enhanced by applying this concept. The digital persona is also a potentially threatening, demeaning, and perhaps socially dangerous phenomenon. One area in which its more threatening aspects require consideration is in data surveillance, the monitoring of people through their data. Data surveillance provides an economically efficient means of exercising control over the behavior of individuals and societies. The manner in which the digital persona contributes to an understanding of particular dataveillance techniques such as computer matching and profiling is discussed, an...",

In doing so, we focus on the role of the information system in forging collaborative practices across diverse set of actors with varied interests. We show how collaborative practices facilitate village capacity building to make effective use of outside expertise, convert them into locally relevant knowledge, and imbue them with new meaning in their everyday practices. We argue that these capacities are a necessary means by which smallholder farmers can build resilience in the face of the global climate crisis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most discourse about computers in the media and in the information technology (FT) industry is Utopian, yet there is a growing body of literature pointing to the lack of social transformation arising from computerization. This paper reviews the evidence for and against social transformation in terms of (1) lifestyles and (2) the structure of society, comparing past predictions with current reality. I conclude that most forecasts have gone awry because forecasters have ignored the human factor. I then outline some of the social problems, ethical dilemmas, and psychological maladies created by the computer revolution. These new problems were largely unforeseen and almost all involve difficulties in the way people relate to technology. The conclusion exhorts scientists and technologists to take more account of human needs and abilities when designing IT systems. Researchers, administrators, and business people will derive economic benefit from learning this central lesson of the IT revolution.",

    "abstract": "Italy was behind the European average in internet development for many years, but a new trend, which has brought considerable change, emerged at the end of 1998 and showed its effects in 2000 and following years. Now Italy is one of the top ten countries worldwide in internet hostcount and the fourth largest in Europe. Density of internet activity on Italy in proportion to population is still below the average in the European Union, but growing faster than Germany, the UK and France--and faster than the world-wide or European average. From the point of view of media control there are several problems. Italy has democratic institutions and freedom of speech, but there is an alarming concentration in the control of mainstream media (especially broadcast). There are no officially declared restrictions in the use of the internet, but several legal and regulatory decisions reveal a desire to limit freedom of opinion and dialogue--and-or gain centralized control of the net.",

    "abstract": "Consumers can be disadvantaged and suffer detriment when information is withheld, when there is deception in the information provided, or when information is too difficult for consumers to obtain or evaluate. While information provision is often favored as a policy/regulatory tool to address “market failure,” it can have its own failings and drawbacks. For instance, the volume of information presented can contain its effectiveness. While the demand-side analysis indicates that actual consumer behavior exhibits systematic departures from the “rational” behavior assumed by conventional (neoclassical) economics, behavioral economics goes further in questioning whether additional information is always useful. It challenges some of the presumptions of conventional economics that consumers make their choices coherently and rationally. This article incorporates such considerations in proposing measures (including regulatory initiatives) that could improve the information made available to telecommunications consumers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we undertake a stakeholder analysis of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Digital Platforms Inquiry to understand the nature and influence of different forms of public input. Our findings show that nation-state regulation of digital platforms is now very much on the policy agenda worldwide, with a focus upon the competition policy dimensions of platform regulation. The second key finding is that the regulatory activism of the ACCC have ensured that the Inquiry and its findings have had maximum public impact. Finally, we argue that the key dynamic shaping the Inquiry was the competing demands of the traditional news media publishers and digital platforms, and that civil society input was relatively limited and secondary to the final recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Domestication is a productive concept for analyzing the sense-making processes behind the integration of media technologies into everyday life. However, researchers have yet to take advantage of the full heuristic potential of this metaphor. So far, most studies have focused on single devices and employed qualitative methods, mainly case studies, to generate insights into the process of domestication. The authors suggest broadening of perspective to the overall domestic ecology within which media cohabitate and compete. Toward this goal, they conducted a large-scale multimethod study involving observations and interviews in 100 households, thereby analyzing not only the “birth” of individual media devices into households, but also examined how these devices reside in certain “mediatopes” (media environments), how they compete as different media “species,” and how they change their social and spatial positions during their lifecycle. More generally, the study demonstrates how to apply domestication research to the topography of a domestic media environment that is complementary to the ethnographical descriptions that have dominated the literature thus far.",

    "abstract": "This book is an overview of society in the information age using some examples from Ireland as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. It is presented as a polemic against uncritical and utopian technological determinism. The 10 chapters of the book are clustered around 5 themes. In Chapter 1, Komito presents his thesis: The “information society” is neither monolithic (which he equates with following the path of the United States) nor an inevitable result of the digital revolution. The next two chapters introduce the basic concepts of information processing and computing by taking the reader on a journey through information processing in animals and humans, nonverbal communication, writing, printing, and various precomputer information technologies leading to the history of computing and an introduction to the concept of technological determinism. The third theme of the book appears in Chapters 4 and 5, in which Komito analyzes the concepts of “information economy” and “postindustrial society” and questions the existence of an “information society.” The next theme of the book appears in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. In these chapters Komito discusses regulation, politics, and policy. He links new information and communication technology (ICT) to e-government, freedom of information, censorship, data protection, political participation, information-age work practices, and the digital divide. The final theme of the book, in Chapters 9 and 10, acknowledges that an “information society” does exist and considers the implications for individuals, communities, and cultures. This book strives to address a very broad audience, from the technological neophyte to the sophisticated technological critic. On the one hand, the in-depth discussion of the history of information and ICT in Chapters 2 and 3 suggests that the audience is the university student or general reader. On the other hand, the absence of detailed explanation and documentation of the technological deterministic stance suggests that the reader is assumed to be one who is already familiar with this intellectual debate. On balance, I think the best audience for this book is the 21st-century university student who uncritically assumes a single, inevitable path of technological evolution. Thus, this book could be required reading in a social study of technology course. However, I wish Komito had painted the picture of the “deterministic enemy” in finer detail. The book contains many contestable statements that are not defended by either evidence or logical development. The challenge of an overview book is always how to manage the absence of detail on any one topic. But for a book such as this, ensuring sufficient evidence to support the arguments is particularly challenging. Komoto makes strong statements against technological determinism. I would have preferred that he present the technological determinist view and its apologists before mounting his own attack. For example, I would have liked to have seen the citations to those scholars who believe that information and communications technology (ICT) linked with the information society is a force external to society and beyond its control. Ireland is used as a setting to exemplify information society issues, but so are the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. As one who has been following—since the 1980s—the sociocultural factors that both motivated and were changed by the creation of an information economy in Ireland (Trauth, 2000), I think this country could have been a fascinating setting for Komito to use in developing his arguments in Chapters 4 and 5. On the face of it, one could draw the conclusion that the transformation of Irish society and economy in the latter half of the 20th century was a direct and inevitable result of the introduction of ICT (in the forms of first electronics manufacturing and offshore data processing, and then software development work). There is concrete evidence",

    "title": "Revisiting Marx's Value Theory: A Critical Response to Analyses of Digital Prosumption",
    "abstract": "In their assessment of value creation through prosumption and other activities related to the use of digital technologies, despite significant differences, Fuchs (2010) and Arvidsson and Colleoni (2012) misinterpret Marx's value theory. Through their analyses, a totalizing or new form of capitalism is said to have emerged, but these, I argue, entail demonstrably idealist theorizations. The end result is that these authors occlude more than they clarify in their debates concerning value, exploitation, and the role played by digital technologies. However, once we understand the precision needed to apply Marx's complex theory—including his conceptualization of “labor power” and the distinction he makes between “productive” and “unproductive” labor—it becomes apparent that a more careful reading of Marx is a priority.",

    "title": "Leveraging Sunken Investments in Communications Infrastructure: A Policy Perspective From the United States",
    "abstract": "Bridging the digital divide between information and technology haves and have-nots has waned from the top of the national policy agenda in the United States during a time in which the sunken investments of the 1990s need to be leveraged. A national information network now exists yet this infrastructure--largely hardware--needs to be continually modernized and parlayed with commitments to building human capacity, developing relevant content, and scaling socially beneficial technology applications, such as telemedicine, in order to optimize these initial multi-billion-dollar outlays. This article makes the case that sidestepping public-private initiatives aimed at accelerating digital opportunity is imprudent, given the mounting empirical evidence highlighting the payoffs of information and communications technologies, when properly integrated and applied, especially in enhancing the life chances of underserved Americans. Policy next steps should advance the goals of expanding universal service initiatives, including hastening broadband deployment to homes and learning institutions, and deepening programs which leverage the utility of the existing infrastructure, such as expanding human-capital development, producing relevant content, and innovating socially beneficial technology applications.",

The Indian telecommunications reform falls in between these two general regional trends.

This article identifies and highlights the likely implications of the Indian reform on key economic and social issues, such as the cost of services, cross-subsidies, network interconnection, private investments, universal services, employment, and the possible rise of an information-intensive economy.

    "title": "A Review of “Online Interviewing”",
    "abstract": "Online Interviewing fills a critical gap in research methods literature. Researchers are increasingly conducting qualitative research through online communications. Although there is an ongoing dialog focused on adapting ethnographic methods to online environments (Hine 2000; Kozinets 2009), there remains little work that focuses more broadly on adapting methods for conducting interviews online. Much of the work that has engaged with broader discussions of online qualitative research methods has been confined to methodology journals. Online Interviewing codifies those ongoing discussions into a single volume. The book is grounded in the authors’ practical needs and considerations in their own adaptations of interviewbased research methods for online environments. Largely due to the geographic distance between Nalita James and her research participants, she conducted her 1998 doctoral research on academics’ workplace learning and communities of practice through e-mail interviews. The book addresses the practical concerns that arose through developing and designing that project. In the initial chapters, James and her coauthor, Hugh Busher, articulate an argument about the epistemological issues involved in conducting qualitative research online. Researchers will find the first chapter to provide an excellent overview of some of the existing work on conducting qualitative research online. In accord with much qualitative methodological work, the authors focus on largely constructivist stances, including phenomenology hermeneutics and symbolic interactionism. In relying on Crotty (1998) for this orientation, James and Busher do not discuss equally valid epistemic foundations for qualitative research, like critical realism (Bhaskar, Archer, Collier, Lawson, & Norrie 1998; Sayer 2000; Fairclough 2003) and pragmatism (Sayer 2000; Putnam 1995). Although the book stands as a critical introduction to methodological discussions about interviewing online, the epistemology section would have been stronger if it directly engaged with the potential for these epistemological stances as well. The first chapter concludes with an excellent table comparing and contrasting online and face-to-face interviews in relation to eight factors for consideration in research design. This includes cost, access, temporal dimension, nature and speed of response, time venue and participation, quality of data, and identity and confidentiality. This chart alone warrants the price of the volume. It distills an important set of considerations for thinking through the practical value and validity of conducting a study through face-to-face or online interviews. The book is at its strongest when it is working through practical considerations for conducting research. Each chapter ends with a series of practical tips for online researchers and a series of suggestions for further reading. For example, the chapter on engaging with participants online considers the value of synchronous and asynchronous methods of conducting interviews online. James and Busher do an excellent job of situating the practical differences between these modes of communication in existing literature and offer a cogent argument for the strengths of each for different goals. In this case, the asynchronous e-mail interviews can generate longer form, rich reflective discourse, while synchronous modes of communication offer performative, dynamic interactions that can be examined more explicitly through methods for examining oral face-to-face interviews. Depending on the practical needs and goals of a given research project, each",

To provide insight about bulletin boards as an information source, this study characterizes information retrieval in terms of (1) whether the retrieval process is active or passive, and (2) how verifiable the information is. Electronic bulletin boards are characterized as requiring active information retrieval. Verifiability is problematic on electronic bulletin boards, especially when bulletin board newsgroups are unmoderated. This study predicts, therefore, that time‐conscious users will consider their search costs in retrieving information when contemplating whether to adopt a given bulletin board and CMC service, and that professional users will prefer moderated bulletin boards because of their higher signal‐to‐noise ratio and higher verifiability.

    "title": "An Interview With Michael Goodchild: GIScience and Social Reordering in the New Millennium",
    "abstract": "Professor Michael Goodchild is perhaps the best known GIScientist in the world. Indeed, he coined the term in a landmark 1991 paper in which he argued that geographic information systems (GIS) was a term that poorly described the spatial theory and commensurate analysis that had flourished with the development of computational cartography (Goodchild, 1992). Geographic information science, by contrast, implicitly recognized that researchers in GIS are fundamentally curious about conceptual models of space, unique characteristics of spatial data, and problems related to their analysis. Indeed, Goodchild suggested that the discipline needed to develop unique conceptual models of space, explore the sphericity of spatial data, and develop models to calculate error propagation (Goodchild, 1992). The purview of this research agenda was more closely related to geographic information science than systems. The past 17 years have seen exponential growth in these inquiries and the parallel establishment of GIScience as a critical forum in the information society. In the new millennium, however, we are faced with a rapidly evolving information society—one profoundly affected by geographic issues. Ten years ago, I interviewed Goodchild about a completely different set of issues (Schuurman, 1999). At the time, terse epistemological dissent was brewing between human geographers critical of the implications of GIS and those who were active in its development (Schuurman, 2000). The epistemological battles have mellowed considerably—if not disappeared. Importantly, however, the con",

    "abstract": "We argue that the World Wide Web, network communities, and computer-supported cooperative work have transformed the context for community networks, occasioning a reconstruction of the concept. We analyze features of proximate communities and use these as a basis for examining the design rationale for current implementations of community networks. In particular, we highlight multiple roles and relationships, social and material reciprocity, personal and institutional visibility and accountability, personal and collective efficacy, community-based institutions, and place. We use the analysis to identify directions for further study and development of community networking.",

    "abstract": "We examine three possible explanations for differences in Internet privacy concerns revealed by national regulation: (1) These differences reflect and are related to differences in cultural values described by other research; (2) these differences reflect differences in Internet experience; or (3) they reflect differences in the desires of political institutions without reflecting underlying differences in privacy preferences. Using a sample of Internet users from 38 countries matched against the Internet population of the United States, we find support for (1) and (2), suggesting the need for localized privacy policies. Privacy concerns decline with Internet experience. Controlling for experience, cultural values were associated with differences in privacy concerns. These cultural differences are mediated by regulatory differences, although new cultural differences emerge when differences in regulation are harmonized. Differences in regulation reflect but also shape country differences. Consumers in countries with sectoral regulation have less desire for more privacy regulation.",

    "abstract": "This article deals with the contribution made by domestication research to our understanding of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in everyday life, especially in the home. It first provides a sense of the diversity of research in this tradition and how this is evolving. The article then reflects upon and illustrates different elements of research in this tradition, providing examples of how these help to explain patterns of ICT experience, the way people evaluate that experience, and what bearing it has on their lives. To contextualize domestication research further, it considers overlaps with other traditions of research before moving on to the core, and the range of methodologies that have been employed. Finally, the article examines some of the general insights from domestication research, as well as more specific applications to the commercial and policy fields.",

Included are discussions of advantages and disadvantages of group decision making, GDSS features that overcome disadvantages of conventional group decision making, operation and composition of GDSS technology, and stage of GDSS use and development. The main topic of consideration is factors that are important to the success and, therefore, eventual widespread acceptance of GDSS in the organizational setting. The focus of future research in this area is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A Korean version of broadcast-type mobile TV service called digital mobile/multimedia broadcasting (DMB) that started in 2005 is now considered a failure. Existing studies approach DMB's failure in commercial terms. This study discusses DMB in the sociocultural context of the new media environment into which it was inserted, where it struggled and eventually declined. With the rapid spread of smartphones and social media, the media environment was reshaped toward interactive and decentralized communication practices that were radically different than those of broadcasting-centric times. DMB with a centralized mass communication structure did not fit in well with this environment. This study shows that the success or failure of new media services may well depend on how they fit in within the larger media environment. More broadly, it shows that a contextual approach to analyzing new media technologies that employs the concept of fitness formation can be very useful.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is a common assumption that digital technology stores and retrieves text differently than physical libraries do. Websites and digitized text uploaded on them are retrieved via algorithms, tied together by links, and so on, whereas physical libraries are structured by classification schemes, catalogs, and indexes. Nevertheless, looking further back in history, it can be argued that digital technology in fact makes us store and retrieve text as humanity did to begin with—before the invention of the printing press. This article argues how.",

Three generations of public information systems are identified in close correspondence to the three generations of commercial information systems.

Examples are given both of the traditional and the automated public information systems and the social problems they attack.",

The formative period is over, however, and the future will see increased attention given to the development of computer and communications tools for the individual scientist. The availability of new technology, particularly emerging national and international broadband communication systems, will enable scientists to reach out more broadly beyond the traditional boundaries of science, in order to apply scientific knowledge and expertise more directly to the solution of social problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study makes a systematic effort to connect digital communication research with comparative political analysis. It explores the concurrence of global influence and national resilience in digital spheres, integrating the homogenizing tendencies of networked connectedness and globalization with heterogeneous configurations of national political communication spaces, which are strongly influenced by enduring social contexts. Drawing on the process-oriented actor-connector-interlocutor model, this study uses three sets of indicators to classify national political communication spaces. It conceptualizes three distinctive types of political communication spaces – “symmetrical and fully-fledged,” “vigorous but censored,” and “infertile and unresponsive” – and identifies their characteristics, internal logics, and their linkages to other communication spaces. It offers a systematic and applicable framework that may be used in future studies on cross-national comparisons of political communication processes in digital spheres.",

    "title": "Inscribing place in Singapore: Instagram depictions of hauntedness",
    "abstract": "Abstract In this article we examine the construction and circulation of images of a purportedly haunted house in Singapore’s folklore, Istana Woodneuk, through Instagram. Analyzing a corpus of 960 Instagram images, we first identify 14 tropes and then two overarching themes – haunted-place making and subversive imaging. We make three main points in this article. Firstly, we argue that the creation of Istana Woodneuk Instagram posts can be understood only against the backdrop of national anxieties about the constraint and control of land and history. Secondly, and relatedly, we posit that the bottom-up creation and collective sharing of these posts is an assertion of young Singaporean identity against a larger state narrative. Istana Woodneuk, in its ambiguity and hauntedness, along with Instagram’s affordances, gives young Singaporeans a unique unregulated space for escape from “reality” and control. Thirdly, we argue that these Instagram posts blend frivolity and thoughtlessness with resistance and self-expression, where personal stories weave into a larger communal narrative that offers bottom-up alternatives to the state sponsored “Singapore Story.” This intersection between Istana Woodneuk as a space, in contrast to other state-defined delineated places of death, and the infrastructural properties of Instagram are crucial to the construction of this larger narrative.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article addresses some of the most important legal and ethical issues posed by robot companions. Firstly, we clarify that robots are to be deemed objects and more precisely products. This on the one hand excludes the legitimacy of all such considerations involving robots as bearers of own rights and obligations, and forces a functional approach in the analysis. Secondly, pursuant to these methodological considerations we address the most relevant ethical and legal concerns, ranging from the risk of dehumanization and isolation of the user, to privacy and liability concerns, as well as financing of the diffusion of this—still expensive—technology. Solutions are briefly sketched, in order to provide the reader with sufficient indications on what strategies could and should be implemented, already in the design phase, as well as what kind of intervention ought to be favored and expected by national and European legislators. The recent Report with Recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics of January 24, 2017 by the European Parliament is specifically taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Abstract All national information activities are increasingly interfaced through telecommunications. Today's users stand as witnesses to the formative stages of a totally networked society in the 21st century. Telecommunications technology lies at the root of formal concepts such as Inter‐Information Subjects Networks (IISNs) and National Information Systems (NISs), developed in the last few years. The term teleport refers to the new types of nodes that will form an overall integrated information traffic system. The challenge to all nations in the coming years is to provide or open these teleports to all types of national and social groups. Such teleports will give democracy a finished quality and otherwise bolster freedom by supporting the availability of all types of information.",

    "abstract": "Although the Internet is largely decentralized in its communication and social patterns, its technical and regulatory apparatuses are highly centralized and hierarchical. Consequently, digital communications are vulnerable to a degree of surveillance and censorship that would be unthinkable in traditional social arenas, threatening “Internet freedom” and cyberliberties in both democratic and politically repressed societies. We believe a new architecture is required in order to protect the continuance of civil liberties in networked society. In this article, we propose 10 “social specifications” describing the requirements of such a network, and outline an architecture called MondoNet that meets these specifications using ad hoc, wireless mesh networking technologies. We also address the legal and technical challenges facing the MondoNet project, and anticipate future developments in this field.",

    "title": "Information Thinness: Saudi Arabia",
    "abstract": "This article investigates the possibility that many users of the mobile phone communication apps communicate with one another but do not necessarily convey or receive any information, that is, anything that informs. A qualitative and quantitative investigation was carried out in Saudi Arabia, looking at how informative the messages were that Saudi society exchanged over mobile phone communication apps. The main finding was that a large number of the messages exchanged among Saudi users conveyed no actual information or only trivial information. In other words, with the increasing ease of digital communication, users may overuse technology merely to communicate for the sake of communication, with no interest in actually being informed by anything, thus suffering from “information thinness.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Session replay scripts record a user’s actions while visiting a website or using a computer application. These recordings are typically sent to third party companies whose stated purpose is to analyze the recordings to help correct bottlenecks and illuminate problems that are difficult for users to navigate. We examine how session replay scripts are being marketed and how they are used by application developers. The extent of gathered data is intrusive, often going beyond the stated objectives, and often collected without users’ knowledge. Using Nissenbaum’s privacy as contextual integrity framework, we demonstrate how replay scripts violate the norms of both appropriateness and distribution, and hence the privacy of the user. We examine two scenarios: one where the session replay data are sent back to the application developer, and another where captured data are sent to third party companies. We compare the scenarios to two analogous situations: surveys taken at a museum and video surveillance in a brick-and-mortar store. We analyze in detail the case of FullStory, a vendor of session replay scripts. In conclusion, we offer suggestions on how to preserve private information in both scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we seek to understand the considerations of young adults who chose to continue their active engagement with Facebook even after Cambridge Analytica scandal laid bare the mechanics of economic surveillance. We base our analysis on two sets of in-depth face-to-face interviews we conducted with young adults in Israel—26 before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which we had already conducted for a study on privacy, and 24 after the scandal erupted. To analyze our respondent’s rationales, we employ Boltanski and Thévenot’s regimes of justification framework. Before the scandal, our respondents largely saw privacy as a commodity, a tradeoff made by the individual—information disclosure in exchange for free personalized digital services. However, there were some respondents who rejected the notion of privacy as a commodity and advanced an alternative perspective that considers it to be a human right. After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there was a marked shift away from understanding of privacy as a right, which our respondents neither saw an unconditional right nor something enforceable by regulators. Instead, they largely saw economic surveillance as something inherent to the digital world, which one needs to accept if one wants to participate in it.",

    "abstract": "Gaming is not a niche activity any more. Play is ubiquitous. Games, gaming, and game development are a component part of contemporary culture. To ignore their embeddedness is intellectual folly. To this end, this review essay links together three recent scholarly books in the digital humanities on games, gaming, and game development, namely, Consalvo and Begy (2015) Players and Their Pets, Anable’s (2018) Playing with Feelings, and Ruberg’s (2020) The Queer Games Avant-Garde. As we shall see, each of these cutting-edge books extends the scholarly literature in new agenda-setting directions. This essay first positions them in a broader discussion in economic sociology and cultural sociology on the notion of “cultural embeddedness,” and then specifically considers the cultural embeddedness of scholarly books on video games published by academic presses. After reviewing the books, the authors of this review essay are forced to acknowledge and, ultimately, embrace the reflexive realization that if we are to critically evaluate or assess the publication of scholarly books about games, gaming, and game development, then what, in point of fact, does it mean for us to pen a scholarly review essay for a peer reviewed academic journal on the same topic? The essay authors conclude by exploring this awkward realization about the circulation of conspicuously academic ideas regarding contemporary gaming and play.",

    "abstract": "Abstract : Recent political events, in particular the historic international political changes of 1989-1991, suggest that modern information systems and capabilities -- as manifested in television, video cameras, facsimile machines, and satellites links -- have been major factors in what many take as positive changes in the world. Could they be made even more effective instruments for peace if they were deliberately exploited through institutions specifically designed for the purpose? In the summer of 1990, a RAND-sponsored research project entitled \"Transnational Institutions to Promote International Peace\" (INFOPAX) considered this question and its ramifications. This Note describes the trends that motivate the question, identifies a rich landscape of plausible initiatives that institutions might reasonably undertake in hopes of making a positive difference, and suggests needed research. The INFOPAX study was a preliminary survey, and the final answer to this question remains unknown. However, the insights documented here suggest that the future may hold both significant opportunities and novel dangers. Thus, this Note should be of interest to anyone interested in the effect of information upon society and in the feasibility of transnational institutions intended to exploit the power of modern information systems and capabilities for the avoidance and suppression of international conflicts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While economic systems have become increasingly information‐intensive, economic modeling has yet to incorporate a balanced view of information as a resource. A common substitute, the assumption that more information is better than less, has dangerous consequences because it usually lacks a typology of information, assumes that expected productivity increases are realized, and neglects both equity aspects and the need to search for more appropriate forms of organization. UNESCO's UNISIST program is reviewed to illustrate these consequences and to argue the relevance of the emerging information economics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper uses an econometric analysis to explore the technology associated with the use of information services in manufacturing industries. A study of the 1972 data for 51 manufacturing industries indicates that the assumption of constant unitary elasticity of substitution between capital and information is probably not appropriate. This causes one to doubt the appropriateness of the Cobb‐Douglas production function to model the relationship between inputs and value added in these industries. Using production functions more general than the Cobb‐Douglas, estimates of the elasticities of substitution between information and other inputs and of the marginal product of information are obtained. The estimates of the marginal product of information range from 2.3 to 3.7, and are consistent with the Hayes and Erickson conclusion that the firms in these industries underinvest in purchased information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The majority of research on organizational information processing has been based in stable organization contexts. This paper, however, examines information processing behaviors within a Fortune 500 organization that experienced a substantial downsizing, namely, a drastic reduction in both financial and human resources. Addressed in this predownsizing and postdownsizing context were the following research questions: To what extent does the fit between an individual's information processing activities and task work predict not being laid off during an organizational downsizing?, and, Will the information processing behaviors of the individuals constrict in response to the downsizing? Results indicate that individuals in the predownsizing context who exhibited a better fit between their information processing behaviors and their task environment were more likely to have both retained their jobs and constricted their information processing behaviors after the downsizing episode. However, even with th...",

    "abstract": "The working assumption of this research is that the utilization of information technology (IT) and IT-based practices in any part of the world currently is taking place within the globalization trends. In recent times, studies in information systems (IS) are beginning to examine whether the globalization process portends homogeneity for developing countries' organizations or whether these organizations can utilize IT and IT-based management techniques according to the sociocultural requirements of their contexts. These studies show the importance of the local context and, more specifically, the importance of adapting global IT-based practices when implementing them in developing countries. However, the precise nature of these adaptations and the factors that shape them are still poorly understood--leaving this a fruitful area for research. In line with this view, this article explores how a Nigerian bank implemented and adapted a global IT-based technique, the factors that influence such adaptations, and what results are achieved.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the development of individual social capital in a distributed learning community. Feld's theory of focused choice predicts that the formation of network ties is constrained by contextual factors that function as foci of activities. In our research, we examined how group assignment and location could function as such foci to influence the development of individual social capital in a distributed learning community. Given that networks with different content flows may possess different properties, we examined two different types of networks—task-related instrumental networks and non-task-related expressive networks. A longitudinal research design was used to evaluate the evolution of networks over time. Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 32 students enrolled in a distributed learning class. The results show strong support for Feld's theory. While serving as foci of activities to organize social interactions, both group assignment and geographic separation can also function to fragment a learning community.",

    "abstract": "In June 2006, the Danish parliament passed a resolution introducing open standards for software in the public sector. Open standards ensure interoperability in software. The introduction of open standards facilitates the spread of alternative software solutions, such as open source software, into environments (e.g., the public sector) that have hitherto been dominated by software produced by the proprietary software industry. In this article, the authors analyze the political process that led to the passing of the resolution, arguing that the concepts of risk and governmentality associated with Ulrich Beck (1992b) and Mitchell Dean (1999) allows one to theorize about this process. In so doing, they draw attention to the significance of the notion of risk in the context of public-sector software.",

Information management will be improved by technology, analysis techniques will be refined by new disciplines, and intelligence warnings will be more pointed by improved communication modes and by providing them to a wider public. Intelligence in the information age will become a public function, not merely a secret service.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The confluence of computers and telecommunications, in the telematics sector, is being enforced by common hardware and software developments. Despite this joint use of modern information technology, there is still a gulf separating the two professional cultures of data processing and public telecommunications. The former is more flexible and capability‐oriented; the latter is oriented at higher reliability, equal access, and standardized performance. The author examines the critical professional issues behind these differences and argues that broader education and systems engineering have roles to play in our preparation for the information society.",

    "abstract": "Networks are both imagined and directly experienced. While most people have trouble concretely explaining what networks are and how they structure our world, very few doubt their prominence in an increasingly globalized world where information moves at a dizzying pace. Networks speak to the link between the local and global—linking an event in a small village in Tunisia to the evening news in London. Yet they bind peoples and ideas not only across distance, but also in proximity. How are such networks imagined by peoples across dimensions of class, religion, gender, and generation in the dynamic environment that is revolutionary Egypt today? This article presents initial findings from initial ethnographic and interview-focused fieldwork conducted with Egyptians across a range of demographics. It presents insights around how technological, institutional, and human networks coordinate to present convergent and divergent actions, insights that shape an ever-changing Egyptian political reality.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes that integrated services digital networks (ISDNs) can be used to educate groups of people by means of dialogue featuring an interactive exchange of textual, voice, graphic, and pictorial information. Participants need not meet in the same place at the same time. Instead, they may be remote and dispersed, and they can exchange information asynchronously if necessary. Benefits secured from using this approach include an increased flexibility in the delivery of educational services, reductions in travel and other costs and, importantly, the ability to engage a large number of people with different backgrounds in a knowledge-gaining conversation without the necessity of their coming to campus. The article depicts a model seminar to illustrate the ways in which an ISDN conversation might be conducted",

    "title": "Electronic Records Management and Public Accountability: Beyond an Instrumental Approach",
    "abstract": "In evaluating government actions, accountability fora depend on public records. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can−depending on how they are used−positively or negatively affect the availability of records for accountability. Dominant trends in the effect of ICTs on records management are (1) the mixing of \"on the record\" and \"off the record\" communication, (2) the shift of control over information to the individual, (3) the focus on present rather than on historic information, (4) the interlinking of information managed by several organizations, and (5) the integration of procedures into computer systems. These trends indicate that the introduction of ICTs challenges the existing balance between organizational values (e.g., formality and informality, central control and individual autonomy). Electronic records management is therefore about finding an organizational design that balances values to fit the organization's accountability situation.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the impact of information technologies, particularly an on‐line data bank for Greek textual materials, on one domain of knowledge work, classical scholarship. It discusses these impacts within a framework derived from Bateson's theory of learning, characterizing these impacts at three levels of conceptual complexity. The first level affects individual work practices and resource requirements; the second requires local renegotiation of resource allocation and other forms of policy setting. The third level affects the discipline as a whole, reconfiguring traditional boundaries and challenging assumptions. Problems at this level—and the political nature of their solution—hold key lessons for other applications of information systems developed to support broad bases of knowledge workers, as well as broader initiatives such as the U.S. National Information Infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study uses an experimental design to examine whether and under what circumstances Americans support the so-called “right to be forgotten”—a legal right that allows citizens to petition to have information about them taken down from the Internet. Findings indicate people are most concerned about who will be in charge of executing such a right. Framing effects are also found for opinions regarding age of information and whether the law should apply only to minors. The results offer insights to help scholars, national policymakers, and international relations organizations to understand public attitudes in a dynamic sociotechnical policy landscape.",

    "title": "A Review of “Kids Online: Opportunities and Risks for Children”",
    "abstract": "My six-year-old nephew was visiting recently, along with his younger sister. It was my turn to entertain them. When my nephew saw my iPod he asked if there were any games on it. I said, “No, we are going to play with blocks.” “What kind of game is that?” he asked. He had apparently not heard of a computer game or iPod app by that name. I then produced the basket of real wood blocks—the blocks his dad had played with as a child. He and his sister then proceeded to construct a beautiful basketball court to hold a handmade wooden hoop and ball on a string. Are there risks, as well as opportunities, in playing with blocks? Sure. There can be some sibling disagreements about placement. They might pile too high and fall on a hand or foot. But they also enable the creative spirit to flow where the mind leads, tells the hand to place something where the eye has envisioned it, and so on. A great sense of pride and accomplishment—or possibly frustration and hurt—may follow. Much of the discussion about children’s use of the Internet, at least in the United States, has focused on the risks involved, and the decline of opportunities for creative handson entertainment and learning available through tools as simple as wooden blocks (Lenhart 2005; Becker 2004; Ybarra and Mitchell 2008; Polly Klass Foundation 2005). But three decades or so down the road since the beginning of home use of the Internet, as opposed to just scholarly, commercial, and government use, the discourse, at least in this volume, has begun to shift. Risks are still a primary interest of researchers and of donor organizations that fund research on children’s Internet use. In fact, such risk-driven research is on the rise. Yet the European editors and authors of Kids Online: Opportunities and Risks for Children call for a more nuanced approach with a greater sense of balance between risks and opportunities (23, figure 2.4). The multiple authors in this volume draw much of their data from almost 400 separate studies conducted across Europe. The network of research teams in twenty-one countries was called the EU Kids Online Project. It gathered data from 2006 to 2009. Indicative of the driving concern about risks, the study was funded by the European Commission’s Safer Internet Plus Programme. It was commissioned to identify and analyze studies concerning the intersection of children under age 18 years and their families, online technologies, and Europe-based empirical research on risk and safety. For those interested in examining the entire database of the 400 studies, it is available online at http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/EUKidsOnline/. The collection policy for the study is detailed at http://www.eukidsonline.net/. Some 46 percent of the mainly quantitative studies examined for this report include at least one aspect related to risks. Some of the leading risk concerns in the studies are: exposure to harmful or offensive content (25 percent); contact with strangers (25 percent); encountering sexual, racist, or hateful material (22 percent); revealing personal information (22 percent); and cyberbullying (15 percent), (24, table 2.1). Approaches to these and other risks and dangers associated with the Internet are compared across countries and analyzed in the context of varying cultural values.",

    "title": "Canaries in the Data Mine: Understanding the Proprietary Design of Youth Environments",
    "abstract": "Canaries in the Data Mine is a thoughtful, provocative, and pressing analysis of the ways young people are serving as an early warning system (canaries) for the rest of society for the ways social media companies and other members of the “data mine” (Google, for example) are developing increasing control over our public and private lives. It is clear from the outset that the approach of the study it describes acts as a counteraction to this “proprietary design;” the study is, in fact, based on a type of participatory design, in which Donovan and his co-researchers (young people) engage in conversation about, analysis of, and resistance to the data mine. The book is structured as a walk-through of their study, helping the reader understand the context of the study, how it was approached, and what it accomplished (a word I use intentionally, as they took “action” rather than simply report results). While the reader might worry this format would be boring, it isn’t – Donovan’s thorough efforts to walk his readers through this project itself is illustrative of how he approached his participatory research and design work with his co-researchers – he helps the reader gain critical understandings necessary to participate in an informed conversation. This is a book worth reading from cover to cover – Donovan’s analysis of “proprietary design” is keen and timely, but just as (or, in my opinion perhaps even more) useful is his intimate description of the process of participatory action research (PAR) and participatory design (PD). For Donovan (and for me too, as a youth worker invested in PAR, PD, and other vehicles for supporting youth leadership on critical issues), these approaches represent a resistance to the power of “proprietary design.” However, in my experience, they are too often poorly described, leaving many researchers who want supposedly conduct PAR and PD without much of a sense of how to do it well. As Donovan writes, “I reveal how involving young people in designing their digital surroundings fosters critical capacities for reworking and resisting the conditions of a rising rentier society” (3). In my thirteen years of experience with this work, I’ve rarely found a more meaningful and informative description of the process and practice of PAR/PD and I think readers of Canaries in the Data Mine should take this approach to heart as readily as they utilize its “results.” Donovan begins the book by talking about “proprietary ecology” and “proprietary developments” to describe the ever more thorough corporate control of the environments in which youth grow up. He provides the example of smart cribs, but we can just as readily look at all the smart devices in the household, the ways tablet video games are designed to capture attention and display advertisements, and so on. “Proprietary developments” capture the ways in which the mundane, everyday, lived experiences of youth, as well as our cultural ideas of youth, are shaped by the “proprietary ecologies” (for example, as described later in the book, young people are shaped as Internet users). Donovan describes this well,",

    "abstract": "In the 1990s, knowledge management originated as a post-Fordist, information society, discourse that stressed the sociotechnical “capture” and distribution of knowledge as a sharable, information resource. Following a postindustrial model, the information/knowledge economy was seen as the leading productive sector. Today's networked systems mix information processing and retrieval and communication technologies in new ways. While such systems demand new tools for capturing, organizing, searching, ranking, and visualizing knowledge, such systems also offer new opportunities for education and for better, shared, research. This article reviews the status of computational technologies in university education in, and since, Jean-François Lyotard's The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge and then offers recommendations on bridging the divide between networked and critical thinking through the reorganization of the university and some of its functions.",

We assign each case a “signature” representing the degree of presence/absence of seven dimensions of participation and then cluster these signatures to look for patterns of the most common ways of “doing participation” today. Two main clusters become apparent: 1) a “radical-direct” mode that emphasizes direct individual autonomy and influence, commitment to having a voice and setting goals, and individual or collective control over resources thereby produced; and 2) an “experiential-affective” mode that emphasizes the experience of being or becoming part of a collective, and the affective, communicational, and educational features of that experience.",

We specifically address different power relations between household members in regard to their use of IoT devices. Using interview data collected through five visits to 30 households in 15 months, we use abductive analysis to develop our framework that has three dimensions: materiality, accessibility, and harmony. We find that acceptance of the IoT’s materiality by all household members is key, but household rules are also crucial to how well the IoT can operate. Parents can more precisely moderate their children, and data and privacy also require more moderation. In addition, the IoT can help complex household choreographies, but household choreographies that are too complex can hinder IoT use. Finally, we note that traditional gender roles remain prevalent in smart homes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article develops a conceptual model of users’ and designers’ knowledge roles in the information and communication technology design process. The “ideal” center at the intersection of the axes for division of knowledge work and privileging of knowledges represents a balanced distribution of knowledge work between users and designers and an avoidance of privileging either group over the other. The article then applies this model to analyses of the design process for six video games wherein the knowledges of Indigenous peoples in North America were mobilized. It concludes by discussing implications for research and design practice, particularly for broadening the participation and self-articulation of marginalized groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study we investigate the implications of different aspects of algorithmic coordination and algorithmic quantification for perceived work conditions and the meaningfulness of crowdwork. Using survey data obtained from 412 crowdworkers, our analysis shows that work conditions and the meaningfulness of work are impacted differently by algorithmic coordination and the feeling of being quantified by an algorithm. Specifically, it shows that algorithmic coordination has either a positive or null impact on perceived work conditions and meaningfulness of work. However, negative associations between algorithmic quantification and perceived work conditions, suggest that the algorithmic quantification seems particularly problematic for crowdworkers’ experienced work conditions. Furthermore, algorithmic coordination is positively associated with the meaningfulness of work, while algorithmic quantification is negatively associated with the perceived meaningfulness of work. Using work design theory, the findings also provide insights into the mechanisms explaining these relationships.",

    "abstract": "Abstract News outlets have responded to platforms disrupting audience engagement and revenue models by pursuing more stable revenue through paywall subscriptions and membership programs. However, many outlets continue to struggle, and scholars have suggested that outlets experiment with data monetization strategies by asking readers to “pay” with their data – in other words, by implementing a “datawall.” We conducted an exploratory landscape analysis of digital news websites and interviewed digital news professionals to evaluate the extent to which datawalls actually exist in the field and to investigate the roles of platformization and datafication. We found that datawalls exist on a spectrum with a complicated relationship to paywalls and that platforms play an important role in the emergence of datawalls that calls for extending the existing conceptual model of platformization. We argue that datawalls represent attempts to adopt platform logics by accumulating audience data; thus, platforms serve as templates for digital news outlets. We discuss the implications of these findings for conceptualizing platformization and datafication.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT To better understand if and how the mechanics of the process Tinder imposes on its users (i.e., swiping, matching, and starting conversations) influences the resulting sexual or romantic interactions, we collected data from 1038 Belgian Tinder users. Our findings show that a user's swiping quantity does not guarantee a higher number of Tinder matches, women have generally more matches than men and men usually have to start a conversation on Tinder. Moreover, while conversations were positively associated with reported offline Tinder encounters, less than half of our sample reported having had an offline meeting with another Tinder user. Whereas more than one third of these offline encounters led to casual sex, more than a quarter resulted in the formation of a committed relationship. Such findings indicate that Tinder is not “just a hookup app”, as often assumed in public discourse. We argue it is plausible that sexual encounters will eventually lead to committed relationships in a society where initiation of relationship formation with dating has been replaced by hooking up.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a milieu marked by increasing quantification of social life, many digital devices have emerged under the promise of a revolutionary change in areas such as urban planning and governance of Smart City projects. Starting from a pragmatist approach based on Boltanski and Thévenot’s “orders of worth” framework, we argue that the promoters of digital devices must justify their worth by developing “technologies of justification” that go beyond data. In this article, we use a multi-case study of three digital devices—RUBI, Kappo, and Bikelite—for urban cycling created in Santiago de Chile to analyze the material, narrative, and economic technologies of justification mobilized to establish the worth of the data that these devices extract, analyze, and visualize for urban governance. This comparative analysis helps us problematize the homogeneous, neutral, and efficiency-focused valuations that are typically ascribed to these devices by laying out the wide range of operations that are used to justify and secure the embedding of these digital devices in societies. We conclude by offering a series of analytical clues to what may be a new order of worth, or what we conceptualize as the “datafied world.”",

We employ activity theory as the analytical lens and interpretive case study as the methodology. Our findings show that the effectiveness of biometric technology to provide reliable identification does not depend solely on its technical qualities but also on real-time connectivity between registration centres and an electronic national register. Furthermore, the electoral officials need to be trained intensively to operate the machines and given guidance on how to handle situations when breakdowns occur. While biometric technology does introduce powerful capabilities, it is just one piece of a complex human activity system.",

    "abstract": "Before considering the arguments of this intriguing and ambitious volume, some background history is in order. Baroque is a historical term used to describe the art of the seventeenth century. Art at that time was not called Baroque. Baroque art, however, has a connection to the Catholic Church and is usually traced back to the Council of Trent, where, between 1545 and 1563, a doctrine on sacred images was developed (Council of Trent 1848). Part of the doctrine that developed in these meetings had a significant impact on art and music. It is usually remarked that the Trent decrees served as a propagandistic mechanism created by the church for the control of religious images, and hence the control of subjects. At the dawn of the printmaking era, the church wanted restrictions on the use of holy images and the representation of sacred figures in popular media. Paintings, prints, relics, and other art works were valued as objects containing information and identified for instruction and the “habit of remembering” (ibid.). In a time of low literacy, the Catholic Church understood the power of image-based media to a largely illiterate population. The church also understood how images function in signification as referents to prototypes and that control over visual signs was critical to centralizing power and discouraging paganism, the worship of idols, or other beliefs that would undermine the church’s authority. The decrees stated:",

    "title": "Spreading the<i>Glee</i>: Targeting a youth audience in the multimedia, digital age",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The television series Glee premiered on FOX in 2009, a time when broadcast television networks were struggling to remain relevant to a new generation of youth who seemed to prefer the interactivity and creativity of the digital media interface to the passivity of the traditional televisual experience. Amid these conditions, Glee emerged as a (multi)media text/product that found some success. This article argues that much of this success lay in FOX and Glee's harnessing of digital technology, especially social media. Audiences were encouraged to search for “the biggest [self-professed] Gleek,” spread Glee clips and even fan-created content to their friends on social media, and interact with stars, among other things. This investigation considers how the contemporary digital age has reshaped the state of network television, and the complex interactions between traditional and “new” media, by examining the Glee phenomenon between 2009 and 2015.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of values to technology is an important topic in the fields of information studies, human–computer interaction, media studies, and science and technology studies, but definitions and attributes of values differ within and among these fields. We suggest that researchers currently conflate multiple categories when they discuss values. Some of these categories are attributes of the source of values (i.e., people, systems, and hybrid assemblages), and others are attributes of the values themselves. This article disambiguates values in sociotechnical systems by providing a framework to describe where and how values are negotiated and enacted by people, institutions, and technology. The framework includes three dimensions that pertain to the source of values (agency, unit, and assemblage) and three dimensions that pertain to attributes of values (salience, intention, and enactment) to enable precision and comparison across this research trajectory. We illustrate each dimension with examples from the values and design literature.",

    "abstract": "This article critically assesses the policy orientation, social impacts, and linkages of telecommunications in the United States within a government deregulated policy environment and an increasingly globalized economy. Deregulation has been driven by both ideological and technological demands, stemming from several political and economic transformations in the world economy, the collapse of state socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and greater oligopolistic competition among transnational corporations. An expanded infrastructure of new digital information and communications technology (ICT) is the foundation of a worldwide political economic regime of accumulation. ICT increases command and control capabilities of large corporations, together with the mobility and liquidity of capital, making it essential to the restructuring of the world economy, the new international division of labor, and the creation of global \"information city\" networks. At the same time, government deregulation and rapid technological change are associated with a number of spatial, economic, and social dualisms.",

    "abstract": "The Danish e-commerce strategy is a highly ambitious effort to become the world's leading IT nation. Instead of a production-led approach aimed at stimulating domestic hardware and software production, Denmark has pursued a demand-oriented approach focused on promoting the widespread adoption of e-commerce in the Danish society. The Danish government has developed a number of e-commerce initiatives via public-private sector partnerships--an approach we refer to as \"governance.\" So far, it appears that Denmark has been successful in promoting business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, with a number of Danish companies being global leaders in the use of B2B applications. On the other hand, Denmark has had less success in achieving widespread use of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. This article analyzes the Danish national environment for e-commerce, discusses four sets of governance initiatives aimed at the development of e-commerce, and analyzes the reasons for its success in B2B and relative failure in B2C adoption.",

    "abstract": "In discussions about electronic and virtual communities, community can variously refer to a moral community, a normative community, a community of practice, an intentional community, or a proximate community. The concept of ''community'' is, itself, deemed unproblematic, and often is used in either a reductivist or ethnocentric manner. An exploration of nonindustrial foraging societies is used to illustrate the wide variation in types and definitions of communities that exists. Social groups in foraging societies exhibit characteristics similar to those observed in technologically mediated social groups, and these similarities illustrate the deficiencies of typological or ideal-type definitions of ''community,'' as well as the artificial nature of a division between ''real'' and ''electronic'' communities. Groups that depend on computer-mediated communication among members can, and should, be examined using the same social science concepts and methods used to examine any other social groups.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study draws on theories of collective action and organizational ecology to investigate a particular type of voluntary association: mixed-mode groups. Mixed-mode groups are created and organized online to meet physically in geographically defined ways. An online survey was conducted with 171 randomly sampled groups on Meetup.com—a website that facilitates the creation and coordination of mixed-mode groups. Analysis shows that even when a mixed-mode group implements strategies focused on internal group processes, it benefits from tapping into its external networks to obtain resources for group operation. Also, the differential impacts of internal and external strategies indicate that in the case of environment-prone mixed-mode groups, implementation of internal strategies alone, with or without solicited external networking resources, is helpful for generating positive group outcomes. Together, these results establish that boundary spanning represents not only a type of strategic action to obtain resources and produce positive outcomes but also an inherent and defining mechanism of contemporary voluntary groups for engaging in collective action.",

    "abstract": "Telecommunications policy issues rarely make news, much less mobilize thousands of people. Yet this has been occurring in the United States around efforts to introduce “Net neutrality” regulation. A similar grassroots mobilization has not developed in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe. We develop a comparative analysis of U.S. and UK Net neutrality debates with an eye toward identifying the arguments for and against regulation, how those arguments differ between the countries, and what the implications of those differences are for the Internet. Drawing on mass media, advocacy, and regulatory discourses, we find that local regulatory precedents as well as cultural factors contribute to both agenda setting and framing of Net neutrality. The differences between national discourses provide a way to understand both the structural differences between regulatory cultures and the substantive differences between policy interpretations, both of which must be reconciled for the Internet to continue to thrive as a global medium.",

    "title": "Paradoxical Empowerment: Immaterial Labor Translated in a Web of Affective Connections",
    "abstract": "This perspective explores the production of user-generated content by contrasting two analyses that are convergent in some respects, divergent in others. In our first line of analysis we use the work of Negri (1996) and Moulier-Boutang (2007) on “cognitive capitalism” to extend some elements explored by Fuchs (2010; 2012) and Arvidsson and Colleoni (2012) on labor and value. This approach foregrounds the adaptability of capitalism and suggests that workers are endowed with “an inventive subjective power” that simultaneously influences and reproduces the mode of production. Our second line of analysis explores the later work of André Gorz (1997; 2003), who invites us to imagine a society in which social relationships would no longer be determined by the laws of the market, a postmarket utopia. This approach points to the importance of collective organization and relational value production of user-generated content and suggests recentering the debate not around individuals and their labor, but on the web of affective connections between them.",

    "abstract": "Linking most universities and many companies around the world is a vast computer network called Internet. More than 7 million people, at 1.2 million attached hosts, in 117 countries are able to receive and send messages to about 4,000 newsgroups, representing the diverse interests of its users, as they are usually called. Some of these newsgroups deal with technical computer issues, some are frivolous, and some carry obscene or pornographic material. For purposes of this essay, it will be assumed that by most standards the postings of concern consisting of stories with themes of bestiality, bondage, and incest and encrypted pictures with scenes of nude women and men, and even children, are pornographic and offensive to many people. The issue under discussion is what to do about such offensive material. Issues of free speech, censorship, and sexual harassment arise. These as well as many others are explored and recommendations are made.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have noticed that contemporary digitally-mediated activism is hybridized in terms of organizational structures, action-repertoires, and underlying movement logics. However, to what extent such hybridization takes place in contentious politics and whether or not the process benefits the goal of movement mobilization remain uncertain. This study scrutinizes the mechanism of online activism in an analysis of 2 million Telegram Channel messages collected during the 2019 Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement. It highlights the logic of cross-boundary action – a mixture of action actors, organizational structures, repertoires, network positions for empowerment – through which self-organized activists played overwhelmingly vital roles in the movement but were critically supported by small numbers of organizational and news media actors in some essential functioning. The study also establishes a relationship between the online audience’s attention to the call-for-action messages and the subsequent protest turnout, indicating a private-to-public shift via networked media, in which most of the diversely connected self-organized activists captured most of the attention. It finally summarizes the multidimensional nature of digital activism in defining the way social media affordance shapes the landscape of contemporary political participation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Just as the introduction of advanced information technologies—computers, telecommunications, microform systems, video and audio devices—into the realms of business, agriculture, education, various social services, and science has had a decided impact on those vital activities, so are these “tools” and their related methodologies having an effect on emergency management. The growing complexity of our society is necessitating changes in many institutions and processes, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. One approach to enhancing governmental preparedness, both at the federal and state‐local levels, is through the selective utilization of devices and networks which facilitate and improve the collection, storage, processing, and dissemination of information vital to those who must anticipate and cope with a range of disasters.",

    "abstract": "In the United States an intense debate has taken place between those wishing to minimize the digital divide and others who are skeptical of this view. In regard to the global digital divide, by contrast, although a similar type of complacency can be found, it has not yet been seriously debated. This article, accordingly, hopes to initiate such a discussion. It attacks the notions that information technology can be easily compared with the earlier diffusion of consumer durable goods, that the divide can be made to disappear by redefining the issue, and that the global divide can be analyzed without the help of basic knowledge from fields such as innovation studies, technology and development, and the diffusion of process innovations.",

Such argument maps use icons and arrows to represent the structure of a series of related viewpoints, reducing the amount of text necessary to convey the ideas, thereby clarifying the issue under consideration. Argument maps have the potential to provide a readily accessible medium by which citizens can follow and join in public debates on policy issues. In this article we describe our approach and the type of maps we have chosen to use and then demonstrate the potential of a collection of maps to form a “policy memory” to support policy development. Our case study is the development of the “smoking in public places” policy in the Scottish Parliament. Our overall aim is to engage citizens in democratic decision making, leading to better policymaking and a more engaged citizenry.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify factors that have led to the emergence of information activities in the global labor force. An analysis of the predominant theoretical perspectives on the development of the information society indicates that a comparison of the development of the information work force in countries that have experienced industrialization under different socioeconomic systems is needed. Finland and Poland are selected as the representatives of a market economy and a centrally planned economy. The results indicate that the information work forces of Finland and Poland have experienced similar patterns of growth over the time period examined. However, the distribution of the work force across different economic sectors differs by socioeconomic system. It is concluded that factors relating to industrialization have played the primary role in the emergence of the information work force and that this emergence may take multiple paths in developing.",

    "title": "The Internet Backbone and the American Metropolis",
    "abstract": "Despite the rapid growth of advanced telecommunications services, there is a lack of knowledge about the geographic diffusion of these new technologies. The Internet presents an important challenge to communications researchers, as it threatens to redefine the production and delivery of vital services including finance, retailing, and education. This article seeks to address the gap in the current literature by analyzing the development of Internet backbone networks in the United States between 1997 and 1999. We focus upon the intermetropolitan links that have provided transcontinental data transport services since the demise of the federally subsidized networks deployed in the 1970s and 1980s. We find that a select group of seven highly interconnected metropolitan areas consistently dominated the geography of national data networks, despite massive investment in this infrastructure over the study period. Furthermore, while prosperous and internationally oriented American cities lead the nation in adopting and deploying Internet technologies, interior regions and economically distressed cities have failed to keep up. As information-based industries and services account for an increasing share of economic activity, this evidence suggests that the Internet may aggravate the economic disparities among regions, rather than level them. Although the capacity of the backbone system has slowly diffused throughout the metropolitan system, the geographic structure of interconnecting links has changed little. Finally, the continued persistence of the metropolis as the center for telecommunications networks illustrates the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the interaction between societies and technological innovations.",

    "abstract": "From 1998 through 2001, South Korea witnessed a remarkable diffusion in broadband Internet connections. Using published and other data, this paper explores the actions and factors contributing to this diffusion from three viewpoints: government, private sector, and social. We suggest that the matching of demand and supply is the most important factor in the fast diffusion of broadband in Korea. In particular, fierce infrastructure competition led to quality services at a low fixed price. Online gaming exhibits some of the characteristics of a \"killer application\"; there are also some social and cultural drivers of demand. We then consider the impact that this rapid diffusion has had on electronic commerce. We produce conclusions of value to policymakers.",

    "abstract": "This article attempts to clarify the murky conceptual water of “interactivity,” arguing that the term refers to two distinct phenomena: interactivity between people and interactivity between people and computers or networks. The former orients research on the process of interactivity. The latter orients research on the product of interactivity. That two distinct phenomena have been labeled with the same term causes problems when one wants to move from theorizing about interactivity in the abstract to investigating what effects interactivity has and then to operationalizing measurement terms. Studying interactivity-as-process entails a research focus on human interaction. Studying interactivity-as-product entails a research focus on user interactions with technology. In wading into the murky waters of what interactivity is, we must not lose sight of why it matters. In research focused on the opportunities and constraints for citizen participation in the political process afforded by communication technology, for example, interactivity is a variable of importance.",

    "abstract": "The potential of the Internet to enhance civic participation has been examined in numerous theoretical and empirical studies. This article concentrates specifically on the role the medium plays in affording and supporting new forms of making sense of public issues and getting involved in civic activities that evolve at the level of everyday life. Characteristically, these forms do not square neatly with elevated notions of political and civic participation. Their significance easily escapes recognition. Building on existing conceptualizations such as those of “life politics” (Giddens, 1991),“sub-politics” (Beck, 1997) and “the political” Mouffe (2005), and “democratic rationalization” (Feenberg, 1999), the concept of subactivism is proposed with the objective to expand received notions of what does and should count as civic engagement.",

It is presented through interrelated empirical case studies whose number and variety are truly enormous–the bibliography alone fills 120 pages–and threatens to overwhelm the reader at times. Nevertheless, the trilogy is prodigious and sets a new standard against which all future meta-accounts of the Information Society will be measured. It will be indispensable reading for anyone interested in a grand narrative of the present.",

    "abstract": "Kelty's “recursive public” is defined as a binary: whether or not ownership of intellectual property is legally in the public domain. We propose a broader continuum of recursive depth, which spans the range from shallow constrained generative spaces (e.g., photo memes) to the deeply open collaborations of “critical making” communities. Recursive depth is assessed by the capacity for transformation across three distinct continuums: public/proprietary, virtual/material, and high/low social power. Transformations across all three continuums is not always necessary for deep recursion (as Kelty and others note for many cases of open source), but we argue that paying attention to all three, and treating them as continuums rather than binaries, allows a better evaluation of the capacity for democratizing the technosocial landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Internet and media use can provide accessible, diverse, and timely opportunities for civic engagement. However, to use media and the internet to interact and collaborate, citizens need to be equipped with particular skills and knowledge. This study draws on a national survey of Australian adults (N = 3,510) to examine how media abilities and online interaction activities are related to their civic engagement. The findings suggest that the more active people are online, interacting with content or other people, the more likely they are to be engaged in civic activities. The data also shows that those with a higher level of confidence in their media abilities are more likely to engage in more civic activities. A broader understanding of the multidimensional characteristics of media literacy is needed to consider the role online interaction activities and media literacy abilities play in contributing to civic engagement. At the same time, the research suggests that equipping citizens with media literacy as well as enabling them to use the interactive functions of digital media can increase citizens’ civic engagement.",

    "abstract": "Although health information is widely available, information acquisition patterns may vary according to where one lives. Using Lievrouw's (2001) information environments (IE) theory, this mixed methods study compares three regional HIV/AIDS information environments in rural Canada. In accordance with IE theory, findings showed regional variation in institutional aspects of HIV/AIDS information environments: health institution service models; resource munificence and technology use; and some measures of social engagement and source availability. Differences were also present in the personal/relational aspects of environments: information network characteristics and levels of interpersonal interaction. However, in divergence from IE theory, regional success rates for answering HIV/AIDS-related questions were similar (86.26–89.34 percent). Furthermore, individual-level factors were more important than network position in predicting participants’ success rates. Yet, in line with IE theory, there were regional differences in the barriers that people affected by HIV/AIDS faced when seeking answers to their questions. These unaddressed barriers suggest that further development of IE theory requires incorporation of institutional capacity: provider knowledge, responsiveness, and service availability.",

    "abstract": "This perspective intervenes in the discussion of value generation on social networking sites by focusing on the role played by the collection and use of personal data. It argues, with Fuchs (2012), that the paradigm of user labor remains a useful way for approaching the issue of user generated content. In response to Arvidsson and Colleoni (2012), it suggests that the value of “data troves” better explains the discrepancy between valuation and revenue than the hypothesis of the direct transformation of users’ affective investment into financial rent. Finally, it advances the discussion by considering the challenge posed by new forms of data processing and collection for arguments regarding labor's ability to appropriate forms of socialized knowledge.",

    "abstract": "When researchers study technology diffusion in a global and comparative manner, they often find that economic productivity explains differences in the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs). But when researchers study technology diffusion in a regional, national, or subnational context, they often find that politics and culture explains different diffusion rates. How do we make use of different kinds of conclusions drawn from different levels of analysis? Just knowing the ways in which wealth explains technology diffusion can obscure the ways in which politics and culture also explain patterns in technology diffusion. In this article, we offer a new perspective on weighting technology diffusion data by economic wealth to set into sharp relief the ways in which other factors—such as politics and culture—influence how well a country metabolizes new technologies. A simple but useful computation is offered, examples are assessed, and implications for public policy, industry, and research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article develops and tests a model examining the relationship between firm globalization, scope of e-commerce use, and firm performance, using data from a large-scale cross-country survey of firms from three industries. We find that globalization leads to both greater scope of e-commerce use and improved performance, measured as efficiency, coordination, and market impacts. Scope of e-commerce use also leads to greater firm performance of all three types. Globalization has differential effects on B2B and B2C e-commerce, however, such that highly global firms are more likely to do B2B but less likely to do B2C. Our findings provide support for Porter's (1986) thesis that upstream business activities (namely, B2B) are more global while downstream business activities (B2C) are more local or multidomestic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies on disconnection from social media and related technologies tend to focus on the user’s disconnection from one specific technology, and consequently provide an incomplete view. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 57 older adults ages 59+, we find that replacement is more common than complete disconnection, which suggests that research should consider people’s larger digital media repertoire rather than focus on a single technology. Motivations for disconnection include social influences, lack of interest, convenience, time availability and overuse, privacy concerns, and technical barriers. We find that older adults’ motivations for disconnection often mirror those of younger users reported in the literature, but some motivations are unique to older adults. Further, some disconnection motivations of younger users reported in the literature were not found in the responses of our sample of older adults. Overall, our study offers a nuanced view on experiences of ICT disconnection in the age of digital media ubiquity.",

We characterize China’s strategy by its primary focus on fostering innovation and a more recent emphasis on “common prosperity,” and the EU’s on promoting ethical outcomes through protecting fundamental rights. Building on this comparative analysis, we consider the areas where the EU and China could learn from and improve upon each other’s approaches to AI governance to promote more ethical outcomes. We outline policy recommendations for both European and Chinese policymakers that would support them in achieving this aim.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the gendered discourse of social-based computer-mediated contexts. Specifically, the critical ethnography explicates the patterns of discourse of both a sports-related (masculine-dominated) chatroom and a female-based (feminine-dominated) chatroom. Through the participant observations, the researcher discovered that traditionally masculine and feminine forms of discourse dominate the chatrooms. Furthermore, the groups constructed and maintained normative forms of behavior. Masculine participants were aggressive, argumentative, and power oriented. While feminine participants sought relationships and intimacy, they were often dominated and overpowered by the aggressive discourse of the masculine members. The findings have significant implications for the construction of gender in cyberspace, the normative behavior of computer-mediated communication, and power and gender in the use of technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The literature on social media analytics typically focuses on the social processes within the social media group that is being studied. On the other hand, the subjective views of the social media analysts have received less attention. Here, we demonstrate that the subjectivity of the analyst can have a bearing on both qualitative and quantitative social network analytics. We provide a methodology to analyze the analysts’ subjective frames of reference and their impact on the way they interpret the social group under study and also the social context within their organization that prompted the inquiry in the first place. We offer a methodology for analyzing the types of resources, characteristics, and knowledge held by key influencers in a social media group, and then use the findings to better understand the frames of reference of its members at large. We propose that social media analytics should be carried out by groups of analysts who discuss their individual viewpoints and bring about a “fusion of horizons,” in contrast to the prevalent practice of analysts conducting the analysis alone. We test our methodology with a study of #Blogchat, the largest live chat group on Twitter.",

    "abstract": "The net neutrality debate is one of several sites of struggles to adapt and redefine rights and obligations of stakeholders in the Internet-centric communications system. Its outcomes will shape the future of the Internet and influence the level and distribution of its benefits. We identify key values that drive the net neutrality discussion and examine the governance mechanisms proposed to achieve these objectives. We find that there is no single policy instrument that allows realization of the range of valued political and economic objectives simultaneously. Contrary to some of the claims advanced in the current debate, safeguarding multiple goals requires a combination of instruments that will likely involve government and nongovernment measures. Furthermore, promoting goals such as the freedom of speech, political participation, investment, and innovation calls for complementary policies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates contemporary cultural policy reforms enabled by paid digital media distribution services, taking the case of the integration of Spotify into the Swedish public media system. Specifically, it reflects on the conflicts arising over the prioritization of digital distribution over cultural preservation, during the gradual substitution of the Spotify digital services for the services provided by the traditional material media archive, the Grammofonarkivet. It considers the factors influencing changes in the Swedish cultural policy environment and the nature of the complaints and human rights claims made by employees of the Grammofonarkivet to UNESCO regarding its structural transformation. It also postulates a “Spotification” model of public service media emerging in Sweden but potentially affecting other countries with public media systems served by traditional media archives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The potential impact of managing large organizations, enterprises, and government departments through the universal adoption of computer‐based techniques is analyzed. Current soft and hardware architecture tends to support a centralizing power strategy. Also, the economics of that architecture tend to support centralized rather than distributed and decentralized organizations. This trend may be further supported by dominant Reinforcement Politics. As one byproduct, centralization decreases the possibility of forming a more broadly based consensus. Opportunities for democratic organizational processes are diminished when computerized procedures deny members or citizens the ability to define their way of organizational life by constraining actions that are largely voluntary. Democratic styles may be further constricted when access to information and to foci of decisions is made more difficult. It is not yet clear just how managing single‐issue adherents by means of special lists and letters as part...",

Yet they occupy opposite ends of the spectrum with respect to planning for the development of the information infrastructure—the central nervous system of a democratic society. While the Japanese expend great resources on centralized planning and monitoring the impact of the information society, United States officials are engaged in a mammoth deregulation exercise intended to dismantle government involvement in the competitive marketplace. While this policy may be appropriate for a period of technological innovation, it may be less efficacious in the period of consolidation, merger, and acquisition which usually follows.",

This essay fields a concept— cyberocracy—to discuss how the development of, and demand for access to, the future electronic information and communications infrastructures (i.e., cyberspace) may alter the nature of the bureaucracy. Although it is too early to say precisely what a cyberocracy may look like, the outcomes may include new forms of democratic, totalitarian, and hybrid governments. Optimism about the information revolution should be tempered by a constant, anticipatory awareness of its potential dark side.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article reviews sources of uncertainty in broadband provision data from Federal Communications Commission’s Form 477 database, which is the largest publicly available broadband database for the United States. This uncertainty analysis reveals that reporting thresholds result in understating of broadband in rural areas serviced by smaller providers in the 1999–2004 ZIP code area dataset. In this same time series, the routine used to aggregate data to larger spatial units (i.e., counties) produces variations in the amount of autocorrelation detected by diagnostic spatial statistics. The amount of autocorrelation in the data also varies with the strategy implemented for interpolating suppressed data. This investigation also highlights the value of a spatial approach to visualizing and analyzing the impact of uncertainty on broadband availability.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we explore the meanings of objectual practice that are revealed by examining embedded information structures and performativity. We conceptualize a network of practice as a nexus of interconnected practice, formed around materially mediated interdependencies across communities of practice. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork of archaeology research, conducted across multiple research disciplines and communities of practice, we identify the material components of embedded information and explicate the processes by which objectual and social practices shape the adoption of theories across the network, creating knowledge-in-practice. We conceptualize knowledge construction as a product of the constant tension between contextualization and decontextualization (embeddedness and disembeddedness).

    "abstract": "This article examines whether Section 255 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act achieves accessibility for people with disabilities. Taking the interest group approach, it shows that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) implemented Section 255 in a way that is favorable to the telecommunications industry and not to people with disabilities. The FCC's regulations only encourage the telecommunication industry to consider accessibility issues for people with disabilities. This proindustry regulatory bias is in keeping with the established pattern of policymaking in other areas concerning people with disabilities. The paper argues that if the FCC continues to rely on the voluntary efforts of the industry, people with disabilities will not enjoy benefits of access to telecommunications systems.",

However, if we look at the problem more fundamentally, we see that uncertainty, the variable responsible for information demand, itself can be reduced. Thus, we should not get fixated on information generation (the supply-side approach) but should also consider ways of reducing needs for information flows (the demand-side approach). This article provides an overview of a Dutch sociotechnical approach that focuses on reduction of complexity so as to reduce uncertainty and thereby organizational information flows.",

    "title": "Questioning the “Crime” in Cybercrime",
    "abstract": "The term “cybercrime” treats cyberspace as a kind of space, subject to the same laws as physical space. However, the nature of cyberspace as space is, in fact, still very much open to discussion, and to apply indiscriminately property laws dragged directly from the “real world” confirms and encourages the spread of this vision of cyberspace. Further, the risk in even using the term “cybercrime” is to grant it a certain indisputable quality. Assuming that all actions labeled as criminal that happen through and in cyberspace are really criminal because they produce economic damage is a problematic overstatement—and risky too. The books that I discuss here acknowledge this risk. With different gradations and intensity, they assume an interlocutory position, sometimes criticizing, sometimes proposing, and sometimes refusing solutions taken or proposed in the real world. These various works are only partially different in aims and arguments. While all three discuss cybercrime, the approaches and the foci of the research are quite different. Wall treats cybercrime by seeking a solution in terms of control and policing cyberspace, and he asserts that it is addressed to advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Yar gives a plain (but critical) account of the origin of hacking to the worst declination of it in cybercrime, and it is addressed to undergraduate students. Pitasi’s collection, conversely, opens the diaphragm shutter to other aspects, such as e-democracy and cybervictimology; it is addressed to researchers and scholars. Hence, more than a comparative review, this is a tale about a journey in cyberspace from different perspective and audiences. I begin with Yar, then continue with Wall, and I conclude with Pitasi’s book. Yar’s Cybercrime and Society is a clear, well-organized, but nevertheless critical cybercrime manual. Designed for undergraduate students, it provides a clear conceptual grid and a useful taxonomy of cybercrimes. However, it never yields to the temptation of a univocal point of view. Elsewhere, Yar has written about piracy as a social construction, so he is aware of the risks of indiscriminate criminalization. Thus, in the core of the book, he critically analyzes hackers’ identity (chapter 2, sections 2.4 and 2.5) and the issue of piracy (chapter 4, sections 4.7 and 4.8). Moreover, he dedicates an entire chapter to a detailed analysis of political hacking and so called “hacktivism” (chapter 3). It is an important chapter, because it points out how fragile and manipulable is our opinion in the information society. After an analysis of well-known types of cybercrime (“Cyberfrauds, Scam and Cons” in chapter 5; “Illegal, Harmful and Offensive Content Online: From Hate Speech to Child Pornography” in chapter 6; “The Victimization of Individuals Online: Cyberstalking",

For example, the Foreign Agricultural Service has begun testing the release of agricultural trade leads through the University of Nebraska's AGNET computer‐based network. The Agricultural Marketing Service disseminates updated market data on more than 150 farm commodities over its leased wire market news network; the system has 140 terminals linked by some 14,500 miles of leased wires.

    "abstract": "Long-standing conflict between domain name registrants and trademark holders prompted the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to create a global, mandatory arbitration procedure known as the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). The UDRP has been used in 2166 cases involving 3938 domain names as of 1 November 2000. The policy gives the initiator of a complaint, generally a trademark holder, the right to choose which ICANN-accredited dispute resolution service provider (RSP) will handle the case. During the preparation of the UDRP,some feared that complainant selection would lead to \"forum shopping\" that might bias the results. This article performs a statistical assessment of the forum-shopping thesis and finds support for it. There are statistically significant differences in the various RSPs' propensity to take away names from defendants; there are also major differences in the number of cases brought to each RSP. RSPs who take away names have the larger share of cases. The study examines other variables that might explain differences in market share, such as price, the plaintiff's nationality, or the time taken to decide a case. It finds that nationality and time also are correlated with market share. The study concludes that shopping for a favorable outcome is an important factor in the UDRP.",

    "abstract": "When we recognize the development and use of information technologies as an emerging global public good, we can move away from the stark dualisms of profit versus human rights, market share versus accessibility, and competition versus inclusion, to an understanding of how both public and private interests are at play in the development of this global public good. Governments, industry, and disability advocacy organizations are all involved in the construction of this public good in a complex three-way dance. We argue that in the context of this three-way dance it is possible to create a common ground between disability advocacy organizations and the IT industry by developing tools that address the tensions that arise from their differing motivating forces. Specifically, we argue that three sets of tools—regulation, developing ease of use products and standards, and using education to increase the market strength of people with disabilities as consumers—can change the relationships between these two communities of interest in ways that will benefit each.",

    "abstract": "Research exploring the means by which new media technologies can shape development within marginalized communities worldwide has began to move away from discussion limited to technical and infrastructural, to consider the interactions, beliefs, and values of local communities. Yet most projects continue to focus on enabling communities to access external information, rather than on the possibility of using media to catalyze community reflection and thereby developmental activity from within. This article shows how this promise can be actualized by providing an overview of an experimental project that made available a set of video cameras to a carefully selected group of community members in a ritualized, largely nonliterate village in Andhra Pradesh, India. It concludes that policymakers, researchers, and practitioners would benefit from considering the possibilities that reflective media hold to generate collective action and consensus building, and that these possibilities can synergize with the need to develop scalable projects.",

A key component of the interview process was a “mental mapping” exercise whereby interviewees drew sketches, revealing important sites and linkages between people and places. A GIS linked responses to real-world locations, collating and displaying them in meaningful ways. Responses uncovered Darwin's unique geography of creative inspiration—a geography that preferences Darwin's natural environment over sites of urban creative milieu.",

We examine the Akshaya project, a franchise of computer-service kiosks in Kerala, India, which strives simultaneously for social development through access to computers and financial viability through cost recovery and entrepreneurship. We show that tensions within the state and among entrepreneurs and perceptions of public versus private among consumers make it challenging to meet the twin goals of commercial profitability and social development.",

    "abstract": "A reconnaissance of the potential for memorializing people through online avatars was carried out by participant observation, running ancestor veneration avatars (AVAs) based on deceased members of the author's own family. First, the AVA concept is introduced in the context of the changing social status of religion in postmodern society. Then the range of possibilities is sketched through four avatars, exploring how: (1) a priest character in World of Warcraft can represent an actual deceased priest; (2) an ambivalent character in EverQuest II can represent an abstract issue about the value of religion; (3) an historically accurate gameworld like Pirates of the Burning Sea can be a good environment for commemorating a person whose life is largely unknown but took place during its historical period; and (4) a fantasy world like Lord of the Rings Online can represent a person who in life had a direct connection to that fantasy. Memorialization of one person in multiple environments illustrates that avatar-like manifestations may be created in (1) solo-player games like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, (2) multiplayer games like Star Wars: The Old Republic, (3) a nongame virtual world like Second Life, and (4) a variety of other online environments where one is represented by something like an avatar, including Wikipedia.",

We explore main contributors, disciplines, and topics of focus, as well as knowledge gaps, and lines of communication within this interdisciplinary field. Our aim is to explore knowledge production and knowledge exchange across disciplines and research employing different methods. Our findings reveal two clusters of publications: an interdisciplinary cluster, and a cluster dominated by organizational psychology, organizational science, and human resource management. Furthermore, our findings show that despite overlapping topics, qualitative and quantitative studies primary rely on two different bodies of literature. We argue that more communication across research employing different methods and a greater variety of disciplines is needed to advance the research on boundary-crossing ICT use.",

    "abstract": "Current interest in the electronic highway is the latest expression of a technotopia that is about to resolutely tilt Western contemporary society into postmodernity, or at least into virtual modernity. The enthusiasm for the electronic highway is already having numerous ''power effects'' (Burchell et al., 1991). One of these effects is to radically intensify modern forms of power in a new regime we call electronic governmentality. This article examines these effects by drawing on examples from the Internet, and demonstrates how this communication and information infrastructure challenges some of our most tightly held beliefs about progress, technology, and power.",

We first critically discuss and empirically examine how online technologies are employed for religious community building in novel and diverse ways. Then we investigate the role religious leaders play through their mental representations of the spatial practices and scales through which their religious communities are imagined and practiced online. We show how churches use the multimodality of the Internet to assemble multiple forms of visible data and maps to extend geographic sensibilities of sacred space and create new social practices of communication.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the initial period (1994-2001) of an ongoing action research project to develop health information systems to support district management in South Africa. The reconstruction of the health sector in postapartheid South Africa striving for equity in health service delivery and building of a decentralized structure based on health districts. In terms of information systems (IS) development, this reform process translates into standardization of health data in ways that inscribe the goals of the new South Africa by enhancing local control and integration of information handling. We describe our approach to action research and use concepts from actor-network and structuration theories in analyzing the case material. In the detailed description and analysis of the process of IS development provided, we focus on the need to balance standardization and local flexibility (localization); standardization is thus seen as bottom-up alignment of an array of heterogeneous actors. Building on a social system model of information systems, we conceptualize the IS design strategy developed and used as the cultivation of processes whereby these actors are translating and aligning their interests. We develop a modular hierarchy of global and local datasets as a framework within which the tensions between standardization and localization may be understood and addressed. Finally, we discuss the possible relevance of the results of the research in other countries.",

    "title": "Domesticating Computers and the Internet",
    "abstract": "The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people, mostly men, in technical professions used computers for work, but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing, and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. This paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women, children, and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men. In addition, the widespread diffusion of the PC and the Internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rural areas throughout Europe are facing extreme pressures of decline, unemployment, poverty, and peripherality. The European Community has embarked on a series of measures to combat these phenomena, notably through programs such as STAR and Telematique, which involve the promotion and use of advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services; and ORA, which aims specifically at the development of telematics in rural areas. The experience of such programs in Northern Ireland is employed to assess the relevance of information and telecommunications technologies (ITT) for rural areas in general. Examples are given of the application of ITT in other parts of Europe, particularly with the development of teleworking. The most obvious conclusion is that neither European Community intervention nor the application of ITT is sufficient to address the problems of rural areas, without adherence to the principles of integrated rural development.",

This is an ironical reversal of the historical social patterning of asymmetrical, centralizing communicating technologies that have molded all of the social relations of modern society. The problematic for this distributed communication capability will be manifest in struggles around the legitimacy of self-expression, assembly, and privacy, in all of their forms. However, unlike the mass mediated discourse where, as the ''audience'' object, we observed these externalized struggles by a narrow other, encounters with distributed media are palpable and subjective, and will be increasingly played out on the common terrain of local community. In initiating unconditional public access to the Net, community networks, or FreeNets, began the long process of blurring the distinction between the public and priv...",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to explore questions of human agency and democratic process in the technical sphere through the example of \"virtual community.\" The formation of relatively stable long-term group associations--community in the broad sense of the term--is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs. As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time, the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism, we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology.We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate--Is community possible on computer networks?--generalize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking. We conclude that research should focus instead on how to design computer networks to better support community activities and values.",

Although Wales has support comparable to Catalonia from government, individuals, and organizations, subtle differences in how dotCYM (the web site of Wales's campaign) promotes .cym's role in the Welsh online community may hinder the bid. Comparative discourse analysis suggests that dotCYM believes .cym will help define a potential Welsh online community, rather than one currently existing, and reveals confusion about who should be in this community. Finally, dotCYM is inconsistent in its use of the community metaphor, stating that .cym will help create “Welsh without frontiers,” a notion contradictory to some scholars' understanding of community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We analyze how the size and composition of social media repertoires is associated with key sociodemographic variables: age, gender, socioeconomic status, education, and occupation. Specifically, we ask what is the association between these variables and: (a) social media use as a whole, (b) the number of platforms people include in their social media repertoires, (c) the platforms included in such repertoires, and (d) the most prevalent repertoires? To answer these questions, we analyze data from an in-person survey (N = 700) about use of media and communication technologies conducted in 2016 in Argentina by a polling firm. Our findings indicate that: (a) the odds of using social media are higher among younger people, women, those with higher socioeconomic and educational levels, and those employed; (b) whereas an increase in age is associated with a decrease in the size of the repertoire, higher educational attainment is associated with an increase in the number of platforms included in the repertoire; (c) age, gender, education, and occupation are significantly associated with the inclusion of different platforms in the repertoire; and (d) some of these variables are significant for the uptake of different repertoires, but not others. We interpret these findings drawing upon scholarship about digital inequalities and social media repertoires, and we assess and reflect on their implications for research on the digital divide.",

    "abstract": "An interdisciplinary introduction to postevolutionary performance artist Stelarc and aspects of some human-technology hybrid tropes in which he works: Obsolete Body Suspensions with hooks in the skin; an expanding, beeping, Stomach Sculpture, which he ingested and filmed; the “Ping Body” event during which his limbs (arm, leg) were controlled with electric stimulation by an Internet audience, while simultaneously Stelarc controlled a prosthetic robotic “Third Hand” with repurposed muscles in his abdomen and leg; and a tissue-culture installment under the skin of his forearm—his Third Ear—which is meant to contain a microphone and relay audio to an online audience. The article reviews critical contexts such as cyberpunk literature, biological and data networks, embodiment, scientific practices, electric body manipulation, and aesthetic and interpretive concerns. It closes with an account of the author's personal encounter with Stelarc at a dinner party, and the role of emotions, such as fear, in postevolution.",

These virtual discourses reflect the sociocultural importance of social media policies in everyday life that is increasingly a blend of online and offline interaction. The analysis reveals themes of contested ownership of online identities, resistance to unilateral institutional policies, and social media site users’ complex relationship to the preservation of virtual content. As a still-evolving phenomenon, virtual grief elucidates wider cultural trends at work in the construction of identity and community online.",

    "abstract": "Page layout is dominant in many genres of physical documents, but it is frequently overlooked in academic analyses of texts and in digitized versions. Its presence is largely determined by available technologies and skills: If no provision is made for creating, preserving, or describing layout, then it tends not to be created, preserved or described. However, I argue, the significance and utility of layout for readers is such that it will survive or reemerge. I review how layout has been treated in the literature of graphic design and linguistics, and consider its role as a memory tool. I distinguish between fixed, flowed, fluid, and fugitive layouts, determined not only by authorial intent, but by technical constraints. Finally, I describe graphic literacy as a component of functional literacy and suggest that corresponding graphic literacies are needed not only by readers, but by creators of documents and by the information management technologies that produce, deliver, and store them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital self-tracking technologies, such as mobile applications and wearables have become commonplace, mediating users’ fitness and health management efforts by providing performance recommendations. While digital self-tracking technologies have been welcomed by some as useful tools in users’ pursuit of healthier and happier lives, they have also drawn criticisms, especially regarding body surveillance and control stemming from their embedded performance standards. In this article, we present our study of the experiences of users who regularly but casually engage with digital self-tracking technologies in order to identify factors that affect compliance with performance standards. Based on these data we propose a conceptual framework that brings together domain involvement, domain expertise, data literacy, and the tendency to anthropomorphize technology with performance standards and discuss possible relationships between these factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Informed by the signaling theory, we argue that the use of social media by both politicians and potential voters may mitigate the information asymmetry between them. A politician normally strives to construct an idealized image of herself, and is therefore eager to convey to the public reliable information regarding her unobservable personal qualities that are conducive to this purpose. Voters, for their part, are interested in obtaining information about candidates’ qualities to make their voting decisions. Based on semi-structured interviews with 12 Israeli female politicians and a qualitative analysis of their posts on Facebook, we identify the tactics participants use to publicize their salient qualities. The signaling model for SNS political communication developed for the analysis here could be used to study information asymmetry in online interactions in other social settings.",

    "abstract": "A quick search on almost any database will show that over the past 5 years or so there has been a surge of book, not to mention journal article, publications related to ecommerce. These publications range widely in their emphases, from technology and supply-chain management to modeling strategies and e-business applications. In browsing these titles it is actually encouraging to see the expansion of published work related to the impact of e-commerce on and in the developing and transitional economies, specific industry sectors, and sizes of business, for example, small and medium-sized industries. There are several older book length treatments of this theme (e.g., Leinbach & Brunn, 2001; Schiller, 1999; Westland & Clark, 1999). Perhaps the volume most comparable to the one under review is that by Westland and Clark (1999), where the authors provide a balance of theoretical perspectives and case studies from seven countries. The basic theme that is emphasized is the shift in wealth creation and redistribution as brought about by information technology and e-commerce. In this book, global e-commerce is discussed within the context of four major issues: electronic channels, technology infrastructure, electronic markets, and e-commerce business process supporting functions. The value of this 1999 volume lies in the attempt to provide new knowledge and experiences on and about e-commerce while the tool was still in its infancy. The theoretical perspectives, while interesting, do not offer dramatically new insights. This newest Global E-Commerce volume by Kraemer et al. attempts “a systematic analysis of the impact of the Internet and e-commerce across firms, industries, and economies.” Moreover, the editors suggest that the volume “provides an understanding of the topographical [sic?] patterns of e-commerce across diverse economies and industries in order to assess the evolution of e-commerce (transformational versus incremental change) and examines the extent of U.S. hegemony and the degree to which globalization diminishes the power of nations, shapes local economies and re-aligns national cultures.” Needless to say, this is an impressive set of objectives. The research from which the book is derived, the Globalization and E-Commerce (GEC) Project, was largely supported by funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Information Technology and Digital Science and Technologies (DST) Programs. It is indeed good news and not widely known that the Directorate for Computer Information and Science (CISE) at NSF does support social science research. In addition, the European Information Society Technologies programs of the European Commission committed funding to the project. Basically, the research program focused on eight economies (United States, France, Germany, Japan, China, Taiwan, Brazil, and Mexico), where three industry sectors (manufacturing, distribution and finance) in each were examined through data gathered on both large and small firms. The research program was driven by several “value propositions,” and these were to provide systematic understanding of the relationships between national policy environments and the use and impact of e-commerce. In addition, the goal was to provide insights for firms, industries, and global e-commerce markets. The remaining two goals suggest that the study will serve as a benchmark for future studies and as well “provide a snapshot in time to preserve the early facts of the e-commerce and Internet revolution.” The research approach developed and used a common survey instrument that applied to diverse economies; in addition, comparable secondary data were collected, and finally a set of case studies was used to provide national details. As the editors note, various partnerships with organizations were established to aid in this mammoth undertaking. The",

Drawing from recent work in sociology and history of technology, organization studies, social informatics, and computer-supported cooperative work, this article suggests that the shaping and diffusion of media artifacts are so intimately tied that they should be seen as the two sides of the same innovation coin. Using examples from the history of videotex newspapers in the United States, the analysis shows that actors simultaneously pursued interdependent technological and social transformations, that this was an ongoing process in which partial outcomes in the technological domain influenced social events at a later phase—and vice versa—and that such process was influenced by historical developments.",

    "abstract": "New technologies typically go through significant improvements during their early diffusion. Literature suggests that these modifications follow from learning-by-using. However, the micro-level processes by which learning-by-using is actually achieved remain understudied. This article examines these processes through an in-depth case study of the design and use of a new health-care device. It identifies several learning processes and preconditions for learning that constituted learning-by-using. The results question the dominant image of learning-by-using as a harmonious flow of user feedback.",

    "abstract": "Research on the Internet's role in politics has struggled to transcend technological determinism--the assumption, often inadvertent, that the technology simply imprints its own logic on social relationships. An alternative approach traces the ways, often numerous, in which an institution's participants appropriate the technology in the service of goals, strategies, and relationships that the institution has already organized. This amplification model can be applied in analyzing the Internet's role in politics. After critically surveying a list of widely held views on the matter, this article illustrates how the amplification model might be applied to concrete problems. These include the development of social networks and ways that technology is used to bind people together into a polity.",

    "abstract": "This research tracked web sites posting or linking to software known as DeCSS over a 26-month period coinciding with a U.S. lawsuit that found posting and linking to the DeCSS software to be illegal. Results showed a decrease in the number of web pages posting the DeCSS software, and a decrease in the number of web pages linking to DeCSS. Seven web sites retained their DeCSS posting for the entire 26-month study period. An increasing number of sites posted nonexecutable forms of DeCSS, and results show a large percentage of web sites contained political speech. The persistence of DeCSS linking and posting was surprising given the prohibition on linking and posting within the United States and given the obsolescence of DeCSS as a DVD decrypter. We suggest that DeCSS linking and posting persists primarily as a political symbol of protest.",

    "abstract": "Deliberation is important for strengthening democracies and enhancing the legitimacy of public policy. However, deliberation has been constrained by limits of time, space, and human capacities for listening and processing information. In this article, the authors discuss a new technology-based tool and show how it can help to partially remove these constraints. Although the Internet already provides the means to deliberate without the need to meet at the same place and time, its conjunction with data mining solves the “large numbers deliberation dilemma” that arises when large amounts of data have to be processed. The author's proposal adapts particular data-mining techniques, which simulate the learning process of a human brain with almost infinite relational capacities. The methodology was applied in a real-world case of Chilean education reform and demonstrated its potential effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The term “digital divide” has been used for almost a decade and typically relates to sociodemographic differences in the use of information and communication technology. However, the corresponding measurement is still relatively imprecise. Very often it is simply reduced to comparisons of Internet penetration rates. This article extends the measurements above the usual bivariate comparisons. Within this context, three essential approaches are presented and critically evaluated. First, loglinear modeling is used to address the interactions among the factors affecting the digital divide. Second, compound measures (i.e., the Digital Divide Index) that integrate a number of variables into a single indicator are discussed. Third, time-distance methodology is applied to analyze changes in the digital divide. The article argues that these approaches often yield entirely different conclusions compared to simple bivariate analysis. The examples are presented as a general warning against an oversimplified methodological approach to digital divide studies.",

    "abstract": "There is strong pressure to achieve greater uniformity, standardization and application of best practices in the service professions, a sector that is growing in presence and importance. At the same time, there is a conflicting demand for the delivery of high-quality (or high-priced or “knowledge-intensive”) specialized or localized services. Our article analyzes information systems-enabled standardizing of service work through an in-depth interpretative study of an ongoing standardization initiative within the field of nursing. Nursing provides a graphic illustration of the dilemmas involved in the standardization of service work. In nursing, standardization is commonly a feature of projects to improve both efficiency and quality in health care. In contrast to the dominant conception of standardization as a largely top-down, imposed process, we offer a view of standardization as incomplete, co-constructed with users, and with significant unintended consequences. The article contributes by (a) developing a theoretical perspective for the standardization of information-system-embedded service work and (2) providing operational and practical implications for system design and health care management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Political representation lies at the heart of representative democracy. In order to signal their connection to the people they are representing, politicians often refer to “the people.” In this study, we focus on how politicians refer to the people and how this varies across three main platforms of communication differing in access and formality: news media, social media, and the parliament. Through an in-depth content analysis of news articles, politicians’ social media posts and parliamentary speeches (N = 1668), we examine how Dutch politicians address the people in terms of “advocacy” for the people and in “opposition” to other actors; which politicians most commonly refer to the people; which communication platforms are predominantly used for this, and whether these references to the people vary across time. We find that references to the people did not differ between election and non-election years. Yet, parties and communication platform both play important roles: references to the people manifest themselves more frequently in social media and in communication from politicians from parties on the left as well as those scoring higher on the populism scale. We also find that there is little variation in advocative references to the people, while communication that includes oppositional references is more prominent among populist actors and those positioned on the political left.",

    "abstract": "The philosophy of information is concerned with the nature, management, and use of information. Thus, it should be able to help us make better decisions about how to manage information (e.g., decisions about intellectual property laws, collection development policies, and Internet evaluation techniques). These decisions have knowledge acquisition as one of their principal goals. Thus, one way to improve these decisions is to clarify our epistemic values. In this article, we combine epistemology and decision analysis in an attempt to assist people in this important task.",

Drawing on experience in what I name the hyperdeveloped world of industrial research and development in the United States, I outline a series of concerns, organized under the themes of information flows, local improvisations and work practices. I then offer a set of alternative understandings of change and innovation that underwrite a practice-based design approach. These include a view of innovation as indigenous to technologiesin-use, an emphasis on the investments needed to create sustainable change, and an orientation to artful integration as an objective for information systems design.",

    "abstract": "We engage with recent applications of the Marxist “labor theory of value” to online prosumer practices, and offer an alternative framework for theorizing value creation in such practices. We argue that the labor theory of value is difficult to apply to online prosumer practices for two reasons. One, value creation in such practices is poorly related to time. Two, the realization of the value accumulated by social media companies generally occurs in financial markets, rather than in direct commodity exchange. In an alternative framework, we offer an understanding of value creation as based primarily on the capacity to initiate and sustain webs of affective relations, and value realization as linked to a reputation based financial economy. We argue that this model describes the process of value creation and appropriation in the context of online prosumer platforms better than an approach based on the Marxist labor theory of value. We also suggest that our approach can cast new light on value creation within informational capitalism in general.",

This perspective has significant implications for the design, management, and success of an organization. A knowledge‐based organization is seen as a society of knowledge workers who are interconnected by a computerized infrastructure. Their work with various distinct types of knowledge is supported in a coordinated, cooperative fashion by the computerized infrastructure. This article identifies the various knowledge types and the building blocks for an infrastructure. It suggests ways in which the blocks can be combined to enhance worker productivity and ways in which the traditional functional areas of management can contribute to the realization of viable knowledge‐based organizations.",

Furthermore, information overload gets in the way of informed consent by the patient. To better protect American patients in an increasingly digital world, the U.S. Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This article examines the adequacy of HIPAA vis-à-vis issues raised by wearable technologies in the Internet of Things environment and identifies policy gaps and factors that drive health data exposure. It presents a 2 × 2 Partnership-Identity Exposure Matrix, illustrates implications in four different contexts, and provides recommendations for improving privacy protection.",

The authors argue that the creative industries required specific kinds of economic development agencies that would be able to act as “intermediaries” between the distinct languages of policymakers and “creatives.” They discuss the tensions inherent in such an approach and how CIDS attempted to manage them and suggest that the main reason for the demise of the CIDS was the domination of the “economic” over the “cultural” logic, both of which are present within the creative industries policy discourse.",

It focuses on factors associated with mobile health app use, and identifies which factors explain the use of different types of health apps. Data from a large representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 1,079) show that mobile health app users were generally younger, higher educated, and had higher levels of e-health literacy skills than non-users. Interestingly, different usage patterns were found for specific types of health apps. Theory and policy implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a critical comparative analysis of mobile versus personal computer (PC)-based forms of Internet access. Drawing from an interdisciplinary body of literature, it illustrates a wide range of ways in which mobile Internet access offers lower levels of functionality and content availability; operates on less open and flexible platforms; and contributes to diminished levels of user engagement, content creation, and information seeking. At a time when a growing proportion of the online population is “mobile only,” these disparities have created what is termed here a mobile Internet underclass. The implications of this argument for digital divide policymaking and, more broadly, for the evolutionary trajectory of the Internet and the dynamics of Internet usage are discussed.",

An argument is made that all elements of the system should be defined from a human centric viewpoint. The article reconceptualizes humans as evolved, embedded, embodied brains (EEEBs). Media are reconceptualized as brain-like creatures (BLCs). Communication is defined as the interaction of one or more EEEBs with other EEEBs or with BLCs. Medium of carriage and encoding system are reconceptualized along continua ranging from evolved to man-made. Examples of hypotheses arising from DHCCST are presented and some theories and effects are reinterpreted using this new perspective.",

From a series of focus groups with adults from around the United States we find three dominant themes: (1) Most feel empowered and enthusiastic, not overloaded; (2) evolving forms of social networking represent a new manifestation of the two-step flow of communication; and (3) although critical of partisan “yellers” in the media, individuals do not report cocooning with the like-minded or avoiding the voices of those with whom they disagree. We also find that skills in using digital media matter when it comes to people's attitudes and uses of the new opportunities afforded by them.",

    "title": "Progress in Communication Sciences, Volume XV: Advances in Telecommunications",
    "abstract": "The latest volume in the Progress in Communication Sciences series is a welcome reminder that telephone technology—the backbone of the contemporary new media infrastructure—deserves far more attention in media research.1 In the introduction, editors Harmeet Sawhney and George Barnett lay out the ambitious goal of creating a sequel to Ithiel Pool’s seminal 1977 collection, The Social Impact of the Telephone, which has been the best work to date on the social uses and cultural context of the telephone. Chapters in the present volume are meant to overcome what the editors argue has been an overemphasis in telecommunications research on telephone regulation and pricing. The editors aim for a balance among macro-scale studies of national and international systems and institutions (such as legal systems, markets or international regimes and treaties), and micro-scale studies of telephone uses and behavior. Several chapters are particularly useful overviews of the research to date. Robert LaRose’s comprehensive and very readable account of research on personal telephone use and the chapter by the late Robert Hopper on studies of telephone conversation should both be required readings in any course on the social aspects of information and communication technologies. Harmeet Sawhney’s chapter is a theoretical discussion of sociotechnical infrastructure as embodied in telephone systems. Aharon Kellerman’s contribution, which is largely an updated synopsis of his book Telecommunications and Geography (Wiley, 1993), introduces the invaluable perspective of human geography to analyzing the spatial reach of telephone systems. This volume raises an interesting question, that is, why telecommunications generally and telephony particularly continue to be relatively neglected objects of social research, especially within the discipline of communication. Put differently, why aren’t we studying and teaching the telephone? The question is particularly puzzling given today’s popular fascination with all aspects of new media, and the inclusion of the term telecommunications in the names of a growing number of communication programs in the United States and abroad. One answer may be that telephone systems, with their uses and cultural signi cance, do not neatly  t the production–consumption framework of most traditional research on media institutions and systems. Indeed, the relatively larger body of work on telephone economics, markets, and regulation (very ably represented here in chapters by Ruby Dholakia, Robin Mansell and Edward Steinmueller, Jorge Schement, and Steven Wildman) focuses mainly on the telephone as a service to be produced and consumed, rather than as a context for complex social interactions or in terms of the meanings attributed to the telephone in everyday life and interpersonal relations. Despite recent claims to the contrary, media research still often conceals a linear model of communication at its core that is not always appropriate for studying social networks. And telecommunications surely resembles the contingent, complex topography of social networks more closely than it does the conventional model of channels piping messages to wide audiences. It is unsurprising, therefore, that a number of leading telecommunications researchers— including George Barnett and James Danowski, who have chapters in the present volume—are specialists in social network analysis. Overall, this volume is an important and wide-ranging addition to the unfortunately small library of social research in telecommunications. It may in fact help us to teach the telephone, and it deserves a wide audience.",

    "abstract": "Research in science and technology studies has devoted significant attention to technological controversies and the mechanisms that actors employ to resolve them. This article contributes to this literature by developing the notion of co-optation as a dynamic of closure. Co-optation is conceptualized as the incorporation of an actor or group into the organizational structure of another group in order to avert threat or adapt to a context of change. Drawing on the history of the Internet in Costa Rica from 1990 to 2005, this study examines a controversy between two distinct models for the development of computing networks in this country: the academic, sociotechnical network and the state-sponsored, commercial project. The analysis shows that the dispute between these groups ended when the Costa Rican government co-opted leading figures of the academic network into its structure. The notion of co-optation helps us theorize shifts in the configuration of relations between groups that lead to the partial resolution of conflicts and have important consequences for the development of technological infrastructures.",

It then identifies new dimensions of personal privacy and illustrates them with electronic mail. It notes the intricacy of policy issues arising from large‐scale use of computers and communications for systems that provide a variety of services, many of them oriented toward the individual. The legislative awkwardness of providing protection to the individual and the role of the federal government in the entire issue is described. Other systems that will create new privacy issues are touched on. The “privacy future” is discussed in terms of access‐without‐action, information representation, information protection, exploitation of information such as computer matching, the large‐scale availability of personal information to many people, and the widespread appearance of systems that deal with information about people but for other than record‐keeping purposes.

    "abstract": "The emerging Information Superhighway is starting to induce visions of dystopia within the medical profession. In several countries, doctors have opposed plans for the establishment of national health data networks. In the most recent example, the Council of the British Medical Association threatened to boycott the government's national data strategy. This action followed the lead of Australian doctors, many of whom have consistently opposed a national wide-area network for health data. In common is the fear that this data linkage will erode medical independence, increase the power of government health authorities, and eliminate the confidentiality of medical information. Doctors have a duty of care to patients to protect confidentiality, and they say the emerging national networks compromise this responsibility. Here, I argue that the emerging health superhighways should either conform to strict privacy standards or they should be demolished.",

    "title": "A Review of: “Governance and Information Technology”",
    "abstract": "Electronic government or mobile government facilitated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) is one of the most significant features of network society. It concerns governments and their information, communication, and transaction with the private sector, civil society, and citizens. Briefly, ubiquity, speed, and the low cost of ICTs are helping governments to provide better access to official information, online public services, and interaction with stakeholders. E-government not only makes the government work more efficiently but it is also raises expectations for better democracy with online participation and consultation tools offered to citizens. Depending on infrastructure, skills, finances, and mentality, e-government models vary from government to government. Yang and Rho, when they discuss the promises and challenges of e-government, refer to the United Nations (UN) and the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) identification of different e-government stages. These organizations suggest five stages: “1. emerging, which offer static information to citizens, 2. enhanced, which offer dynamic information to citizens and provides them with more options for accessing information, 3. interactive, which makes available exchanges between citizens and governments, such as form downloading and online application submission, 4. transactional, which enables such transactions as paying taxes and application fees, 5. networked or fully integrated which offers completely integrated online public service delivery” (Yang & Rho, 2007, p. 1198). There is growing research on e-government among academics and researchers of international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, and the United Nations. However, as Bekkers and Homburg point out, most of the e-government research done, in the first place, emphasized customer-oriented online public service delivery. In their effort to extend this emphasis, Bekkers and Homburg suggest redesigning of the back office of agencies next to that of the front offices (service delivery) and adding interaction with concerned citizens next to service delivery (Bekkers & Homburg, 2007). The editors of Governance and Information Technology From Electronic Government to Information Government present a new term: “information government.” This term is proposed neither as an alternative definition nor as a new stage of e-government. I see that this term is rather suggested as an effort to understand the changes in governance that occur due to ICTs, and the term, in a way, also contributes to the discussion of Bekkers and Homburg on extending the view on e-government. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and David Lazer find that there is too much research and dicussion on the new technologies part of e-government. Therefore, in this book, they aim at understanding the importance of information flows within government as well as between government, business, and citizens. They believe that the important thing is the information flow. Seeing on the pages images of Sumerian tax records of 2028 B.C. next to U.S. tax records of today explains the authors’ point that all governments need information, regardless of the means. Even though they believe that ICTs are facilitating communication of information, they argue that that information flow (facilitated by ICTs) is able to make government work and the use of new technologies more efficient. They state: “Understanding of the informational dimension, we hope, will in turn inform the implementation of technologies and policies to structure information flows that simultaneously increase the efficiency of government and the deliberative capacity of our institutions and citizens” (p. 12). This volume is divided into three parts that each consist of independent articles and case illustrations. The first",

Medford, NJ: Information Today, 2005. 240 pp. $39.50 (cloth). ISBN 1-57387-228-8.",
    "abstract": "Students in various disciplines have been studying information and communication technologies (ICTs) from a variety of perspectives. Nonetheless, the human and organizational contexts of these technologies have not been systematically studied. Rob Kling, Howard Rosenbaum, and Steve Sawyer address the pressing need for understanding and communicating social informatics and offer insightful recommendations for incorporating it in our research and teaching. The book opens with an introduction to social informatics. The authors point out that while ICT systems continue to fail because of social factors, research on ICTs continues to have a strong technology-centric orientation. The authors stress the need for a more balanced view. They go on to define social informatics and identify its core tenet—“ICTs do not exist in social or technological isolation.” Chapter 2 examines the “consequences of ICTs for organizations and social life.” The authors analyze three different implications of ICTs, namely, “the social nature of ICTs,” “the technical nature of ICTs,” and “the institutional nature of ICTs.” They emphasize the complexity of ICTs in their social and organizational context and highlight problems that arise with “technological determinism” and a romantic view of ICTs. The authors discuss not only the benefits of ICTs but also the constraints and challenges that come with them. What does social informatics mean to designers, developers, and implementers of ICT systems? Chapter 3 answers this question by showing how people in the field view ICTs, and identifying principles for a successful social design, which is social context sensitive. Based on a review of research, the authors discuss two major challenges in altering the technology-centric designer-focused approaches. The first challenge, which the authors call “the configurational nature of ICT-based systems,” is that we should not view ICTs as static machines but as constantly changing systems that are interacting with human activities. The second challenge is that we need to go beyond usability, which is widely seen as the solution for problems of designer-focused approaches. The authors argue that usability testing does not fully incorporate user needs and experiences into the design of ICTs. In the discussion on the principles for social design, the authors compare social design with designer-focused approaches. They believe that social design better addresses the complexity and heterogeneity of uses and contexts. ICT design should be seen as a continuous process that is not independent of users but instead situated in the social context within which the technology is used. In Chapter 4, the authors examine the contributions of social informatics to ICT policy analysis. Kling and his colleagues emphasize that understanding the various facets of the interaction between ICTs and society is critical for transforming ICT policy analysis. Using U.S. and Europe’s ICT policy as representative cases, the authors explain the value of social informatics in contemporary and historical policy issues in both public and private sectors. In Chapter 5, the authors provide several reasons for teaching social informatics. They feel that the students should be able to understand the social effects of ICTs and",

    "title": "Dying on Airbnb: Digital infrastructures and deadly spaces",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper uses two deaths on the accommodation platform Airbnb to consider how the spatial understandings of digital infrastructures can have consequences for mortality. The platform internalizes each home or room as a Listing, a template of variables minimally describing space as a unit of accommodation. This universal schema facilitates both compatibility and scalability. But this generic understanding ignores both the unpredictable agency of matter and the significance of a space’s sociocultural past. Thus, while acknowledging the force exerted by digital infrastructures in reconfiguring the political economies of space at a global level, this Perspective paper argues that space is not adequately apprehended unless its material and historical aspects are accounted for. The paper concludes by returning to mortality in a broad sense, questioning whether digital infrastructures support or inhibit our capacities for living.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have attempted to link e-mail use to power and politics. The purpose of this article is to offer some initial evidence and analysis of e-mail's role in organizational power and politics. To frame the discussion, the article reviews the relevant writings on power and politics. The review is concluded with a theoretical critique that suggests that contextual and, particularly, temporal aspects should be incorporated into research on power and politics in organizations. To demonstrate how an analysis based on temporal aspects can be undertaken, a case study that outlines the use of e-mail for power and politics in a university is presented. The discussion and conclusions sections synthesize the analysis by demonstrating that what was interpreted by many organization members at the early stages of the conflict as a ''battle of the sexes'' can be seen (and, indeed, was interpreted by many organization members at the later stages of the conflict) as an elaborate exercise in misinformation created by...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Indications are that it is the videocassette recorder (VCR), rather than cable, subscription or multi‐point distribution TV, which is being watched in addition to network television in American homes. In Australia a saturation point for VCR ownership seems imminent at around two‐thirds of TV households. New VCR owners tend to watch twice as much displaced network TV as pre‐recorded cassettes, and that ratio widens in favor of network TV with time. The differences between broadcast and VCR technologies, which are highlighted by means of dichotomies, have important implications for information society concepts. It is argued that VCR technology shifts the psychological locus of control from the external broadcaster to within the internal ambit of the viewer. Similarly, it is proposed that such technology has the potential to break the audiovisual nexus between producer and consumer. VCRs are ideally suited to minority interests and also with camera attachments permit sight of the viewer on the TV sc...",

    "title": "A Review of “Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge: Concept Maps as Facilitative Tools in Schools and Corporation”",
    "abstract": "The U.S. education system faces a crisis at all levels. A study by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that, when compared to students from 70 countries, 15-year-olds from the United States averaged 15th in reading skills, 17th in science, and 25th, or below average, in mathematics (OECD 2010). The same report also shows the United States falling behind in student enrollment and graduation (Zeitvogel 2010). On the subject of higher education, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa’s Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses (2011) has garnered significant attention for arguing that most college students make little progress in higher order learning during their four-plus years in school. Many fear that America’s youth are not being adequately prepared for the needs of the new global economy and that they will be unable to compete with the innovations coming from China, India, and other foreign markets. Fingers have been pointed at many different factors in attempts to assign responsibility for these educational difficulties: a lack of funding from federal and state governments; mismanagement by school administrations; No Child Left Behind and high-stakes testing; ill-trained or entrenched teachers and teachers’ unions; the influence of new technology on student attitudes and learning abilities; a consumer mentality that views education as a commodity; a loss of traditional values in education; and the list goes on. According to long-time science educator and educational researcher Joseph D. Novak, the root of the problem is the lack of a unified theory of learning that serves as the basis for systematic reform of educational methodology. In this revised edition of his 1998 Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge, Novak marshals a significant body of practical and theoretical research to support his concept of “meaningful learning” as a unified theory of education that can radically improve learning on all levels, from early childhood to corporate development. The improvements he seeks are not merely quantitative gains in test scores but qualitative changes in the ways humans construct, integrate, and apply knowledge in academic and business settings. While recognizing the challenges to widespread change, Novak is ultimately optimistic about the possibilities for a full-fledged revolution in learning that will empower individuals and companies to harness human creativity and improve the human condition. Novak bases his ideas on David Ausubel’s “Assimilation Learning” Theory, which holds that meaningful learning occurs when the learner negotiates between knowledge previously gained and newly acquired. This active engagement on the part of the learner results not in the rote memorization of facts but the construction and reconstruction of complex cognitive frameworks. By integrating information into a hierarchical structure that demonstrates the relationship between concepts, the learner develops a deeper understanding of knowledge; the process of learning accelerates as he or she can adapt these cognitive frames to incorporate additional information and new levels of complexity. In turn, the learner can apply his or her knowledge in more effective and more creative ways. For Novak, Ausubel’s theory provides a powerful foundation upon which to build a comprehensive theory of education. He expands Ausubel’s primarily cognitive focus to include",

    "title": "The Myth of Media Globalization, by Kai Hafez (trans. Alex Skinner). Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007. 232 pp. $24.95 (paper). ISBN 978–0745639093",
    "abstract": "As an explanatory concept, globalization is of relatively recent vintage. Even though the word “global” is more than 400 years old, the use of the term “globalization” in a processual sense only emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. However, despite its recent conceptual lineage as well as a lack of concensus about its definition, the notion of globalization perceived both within empirical trends, such as the heightened interconnectedness of commodities, capital, people, places, ideas, and images over time and the intensified subjective consciousness of these trends, has gathered considerable currency in both academic and popular discourse. Crucially implicated in analyses of this process are media and communication technologies, which are perceived as either drivers or exemplars of the forces of globalization. In fact, a significant thrust of the globalization debate within the field of media studies has centered on the global transformation of media landscapes and the implications of this transformation for societies and cultures across the world. On one side of this debate are those who tend to view the phenomenon negatively, as just another form of Western domination that produces a flow of cultural products to developing nations, resulting in the growth of cultural uniformity and the homogenization of local cultures. On the other side are those who, while acknowledging the global presence of Western media and cultural products, question the notion that global media flows represent either a form of domination or even a type of one-way traffic, arguing that there exists a contra flow of cultural production from the periphery to the center as well as between geocultural markets, especially in the area of television and film production. Kai Hafez’s work, The Myth of Media Globalization, however, situates itself outside of this terrain in that Hafez does not focus on the impact of media globalization but on the more basic question of whether the process can actually be said to be occurring. Thus, in contrast to the majority of globalization theorists who, while espousing varied views on the implications of the phenomenon, do not actually question its existence, Hafez adopts the role of global skeptic, arguing that despite the hype, there is little empirical evidence to indicate that a global media system is actually emerging. As he puts it: “It was for long assumed that global interactions are increasing. In many fields of cross-border communication this is in fact less true than previously imagined” (2). To make this case, he analyzes the state of current crossborder communications at the global level, using a three-dimensional model derived from systems theory. The model seeks to evaluate system connectivity, system change, and system interdependence—a trifecta of conditions whose achievement he seems to identify as the hallmark of globalization. In the first part of the book, Hafez is critical of the tendency to study globalization effects primarily in terms of the Internet and so-called new media. He proceeds to examine a broad spectrum of issues related to international media, ranging from international reporting, broadcasting, and satellite television to film and television program imports and the impact of the Internet. Although he analyzes varied aspects of international media developments, his basic contention regarding each of them remains the same: none of the so-called exemplars of media globalization actually engenders connectivity (defined as the extent, speed, and intensity of international exchange of information), system change (media-driven change within the political, economic, and cultural systems of nation states), or system interdependence (the transformation of autonomous",

However, there is no grand design for the Information Society. Its general shape, speed, and direction are being shaped by a wide variety of forces, only some of which are technological. However, an argument can be made that the lack of a coherent strategy for the evolution of the Information Society may prove dysfunctional in the long run, because it results in ambiguity, confusion, waste, and lost opportunity in both the public and private sectors. In fact, there are many strategic choices that could be taken today which would help shape the future Information Society so as to improve the prospects for overall societal benefits. Five strategic choices in the public sector and five in the private sector are offered as examples of the kinds of actions that would appear to be appropriate today to lay the groundwork for the successful evolution of the Information Soc...",

    "abstract": "As federal agencies move toward more sophisticated e-govern- ment offerings, they must consider both policy and operational requirements for electronic authentication (e-authentication). One important consideration in designing and deploying e-authentica- tion solutions is the balance between access, security, authentication, and privacy. Public law and government-wide policy encourage e-government and e-authentication simultaneously with privacy protection, creating policy and operational tensions for e-government efforts. A review of the relevant laws and policies and analyses of the privacy implications of authentication technologies indicates that federal agencies have at least two analytic frameworks for balancing privacy concerns with e-authentication. A framework offered in the 2003 National Research Council report Who Goes There? and the privacy impact analysis requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 provide e-government projects with the tools for navigating the path between privacy and openness, required by both e-government law and policy.",

It involved engaging students of an urban high school in critiquing the hero myths of popular culture while also inviting them to tell and retell their own stories of participatory politics. The students' activities were followed over a period of an academic year as they worked through different ways of thinking about stories of heroic action and also created their own messages, reflecting their views, to motivate others to engage in action. Over that period, the stories they told deepened and developed. Ultimately, the political action in which the students chose to engage was frustrated, which provided an opportunity to explore the limits of the participatory politics framework.",

In addition to general consumer uses, farm households in the United States utilize microcomputers for such small business applications as record keeping, word‐processing, payroll handling, etc. A special application of microprocessor technology occurred in 1980–1981 when 200 Kentucky farmers participated in a trial of the Green Thumb Box, a video‐text system providing market, weather, and technological information. The nature of the information needs of U.S. farm people seems to fit well with the new information technologies built around the microprocessor, although little of this potential has yet been realized. Since that experiment, videotex has shown itself to have doubtful value as a channel for the distribution of agricultural information, leaving open the question of what might be the best technological vehicle for this audience. Research is needed...",

    "abstract": "Abstract A set of broad questions is offered, as well as some brief and tentative answers, in the hope that this initial inventory will stimulate a better list, continuously updated and addressed in greater depth. Will we live in an Information Society? Not necessarily, as realities, perceptions, or fashions change. Will we experience a communications revolution? Probably, but we have yet to fully consider the multiple impacts of a revolution that has yet to run its course. Will we communicate better? Little attention has been given to this question; overall improvements seem likely in work, commerce, health, and entertainment, but potential benefits seem problematic in education, in politics, between groups, and within families. Will our lives be better? Again quite uncertain, although there will surely be winners and losers. Who has to learn what? A new standard of literacy will probably be demanded for our underdeveloped Information Society. Who will address these questions? Everyone and no one, as ind...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rural communities face a multitude of hazardous conditions—from blizzards, floods, droughts, and insect infestations caused by nature to hazardous material spills, transportation accidents, and dam failures that result from human activities. Information technology offers to rural emergency managers potentially important tools with which to better plan, alert, and respond to disasters. Three case studies are presented about uses of different technologies. Each technology is currently in place, but not in widespread use. The first case is the use of a microcomputer in a rural Minnesota county to manage emergency resources, aid planning, and other important tasks. The second case uses cable television as a two‐way alerting link to fire, emergency medical, and police systems. The third case involves the use of satellites to form a statewide communication system among emergency service offices. Each use of information technology clearly contributes to improved emergency management, but widespread appl...",

    "abstract": "This article presents a field study of the procurement, implementation, and use of a local area network devoted to running computer‐supported cooperative work (CSCW) related applications in a U.K. central government organization. In this particular case, the network ran into a number of difficulties, was resisted by its potential users for a variety of reasons, was faced with being withdrawn from service on a number of occasions, and remains only partly used. The study points to the kinds of problems that a project to introduce computer support for cooperative work to an actual organization is likely to face, and a series of concepts is offered to help manage the complexity of these problems. In so doing, this article adds to and extends previous studies of CSCW tools in action but also argues that experience form the field should be used to reorganize the research agenda of CSCW.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper defines electronic data interchange (EDI) in terms of its derivation from the wider group of strategic, interorganizational information systems. It discusses the topic from two viewpoints: the nature and derivation of EDI systems and the issues involved in integrating EDI systems into existing organizations, at both the technical and structural levels. The paper approaches the problem with an introduction to the concept of strategic information systems and then discusses the particular importance of interorganizational information systems (IOS). The literature pertaining to EDI is introduced, together with a discussion of EDI's historical development and the benefits it offers to implementing organizations. As an interorganizational information system, EDI is differentiated on the basis of its essentially cooperative role and EDI system integration issues are divided into the technical and organizational.",

    "abstract": "In an effort to enhance the odds of “organized spontaneity,” this article advances analytics for selection of participants, format of interaction, and milieu within which the interaction occurs. The analysis proceeds in a two-part process. First, three creative environments far removed from the present-day academic forums—18th-century French salons, the 18th-century London coffeehouses, and Mensa—are examined to generate analytical distance from our current practices. Second, with these three locales in the background, current practices are analyzed and the following thoughts are offered for deliberation: (1) Low threshold to entry is not necessarily a bad thing. (2) Creative environments require an artful mix of homogeneity and heterogeneity. (3) Sociality, which is essential for a creative environment, limits the extent to which a disagreement can be pushed. (4) The selection–format–milieu interaction greatly shapes the character of what gets produced in a creative environment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the last 20 years or so, new forms of media have resulted in new forms of engagement with media in general. The production and distribution of older forms of media have also undergone a transformation. Sales of the superhero genre of comic books have waned considerably even as advances in computer-generated imagery (CGI) have helped carry the spectacular imaginative events from their worlds to the screen. In this environment tee shirts have become an important medium through which audiences engage with superheroes. This article offers a historical account of that process.",

    "abstract": "In Indonesia mobile technology has come at the end of 35 years of the Suharto regime, and in its aftermath an era of new openness. Not surprisingly mobile phones are by many Indonesians associated with the new freedoms of this post-1998 period, facilitating newly emergent youth cultures, a hip mobile lifestyle as well as experiments with novel sexual identities. In a country characterized by stark contrasts—between center and periphery, city and countryside, and the rich and the poor—this has at the same time resulted in an uneven spread of technology, and thus in the coexistence of very diverse cellular markets. Through deliberating the pros and cons of mobile technology, new possibilities the phone seems to offer, and the often creative solutions people find in gaining access to mobility, it is shown how Indonesians try coming to terms with the otherwise abstract notion of (post)modernity.",

    "title": "Barriers to Interorganizational Information Sharing in e-Government: A Stakeholder Analysis",
    "abstract": "Government agencies often face trade-offs in developing initiatives that address a public good given competing concerns of various constituent groups. Efforts to construct data warehouses that enable data mining of citizens’ personal information obtained from other organizations (including sister agencies) create a complex challenge, since privacy concerns may vary across constituent groups whose priorities diverge from agencies’ e-government goals. In addition to privacy concerns, participating government agencies’ priorities related to the use of the information may also be in conflict. This article reports on a case study of the Integrated Non-Filer Compliance System used by the California Franchise Tax Board for which data are collected from federal, state, and municipal agencies and other organizations in a data mining application that aims to identify residents who under-report income or fail to file tax returns. This system pitted the public good (ensuring owed taxes are paid) against citizen concerns about privacy. Drawing on stakeholder theory, the authors propose a typology of four stakeholder groups (data controllers, data subjects, data providers, and secondary stakeholders) to address privacy concerns and argue that by ensuring procedural fairness for the data subjects, agencies can reduce some barriers that impede the successful adoption of e-government applications and policies. The article concludes that data controllers can reduce adoption and implementation barriers when e-government data mining applications rely on data shared across organizational boundaries: identify legitimate stakeholders and their concerns prior to implementation; enact procedures to ensure procedural fairness when data are captured, shared, and used; explain to each constituency how the data mining application helps to ensure distributive fairness; and continue to gauge stakeholders’ responses and ongoing concerns as long as the application is in use.",

    "abstract": "In poor countries, information and communication technologies (ICTs) are expected to play a key developmental role. Many see in these technologies the potential for turning around uncompetitive industries and dysfunctional public administration , and for providing unprecedented opportunitie s for the information-intensiv e social services, such as health and education. Nevertheless, it is well known that such developmental bene ts have been dif cult to achieve for a variety of complex reasons. There are two interrelated problems here. First, many organizations have dif culties in nurturing and cultivating complex technology projects over the long periods of time that are typically required. Second, the resulting ICT-based systems may have little impact on the organizational weakness they were intended to alleviate. A series of theoretical explanations have been proposed to these problems, often accompanied by policy programs and professional “good practice.” Dif culties in achieving successful technology innovation were  rst associated with the broader literature on “technology transfer,” which attempted to emphasize the gap between the assumptions inscribed in the technologies developed in the context of industrialized countries and the prevailing way and state of organizational life in the countries to which the technologies were being transferred. The academic discourse of the 1990s reinforced the argument on the signi cance of the association of information systems development with or-",

It also explains some of the new technological supports for anonymous communication on the Internet. The openness, decentralization, and transnational character of the Internet challenge the efficacy of traditional control mechanisms and have raised issues related to accountability, law enforcement, security and privacy, governmental empowerment, and e-commerce. Yet, to ban or restrict all anonymous communication ...",

Although many have predicted this U.S. dominance will wane, particularly as a result of competitive threats from Japan, and more recently from low-wage, developing nations, erosion has yet to be significant. The United States benefits from nine factors that sustain its advantage in this industry: skilled labor, favorable capital conditions, sophisticated customers, close association with hardware vendors, a competitive marketplace, geographic concentrations, first-mover advantage, a strong intellectual property regime, and English as the software lingua franca. Industry-specific strengths and weaknesses vis-a-vis Europe, Japan, and other nations are also discussed. In addition to these nine better known U.S. competitive advantages, two culturally linked assertions are presented that have received scant attention vis-a-vis competitive analysis. First, the industrial evolution of software development is at an immature...",

    "abstract": "In the United States, Congress has had a long-standing interest in consumer privacy and the extent to which company practices are based on fair information practices. Previously, public policy was largely informed by anecdotal evidence about the effectiveness of industry self-regulatory programs. However, the Internet has made it possible to unobtrusively sample web sites and their privacy disclosures in a way that is not feasible in the offline world. Beginning in 1998, the Federal Trade Commission relied upon a series of three surveys of web sites to assess whether organizations post online privacy disclosures and whether these disclosures represent the U.S. definition of fair information practices. While each year's survey has provided an important snapshot of U.S. web-site practices, there has been no longitudinal analysis of the multiyear trends. This study compares a subset of equivalent individual-level web-site data for the 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 web surveys. Implications for using this type of research to inform public policy are discussed.",

By 1995, Taiwan ranked fourth in the world in computer hardware production and exports through its strategy of being a ''fast follower.'' Taiwan's success in the computer industry has been due to a coordinated government strategy to support private entrepreneurship by a large number of small, flexible, innovative companies. Taiwan's computer companies have responded rapidly and effectively to continuing changes in the international market and avoided many of the problems encountered by their counterparts in Japan and South Korea in recent years. They have done so by emphasizing close supplier relationships with multinational computer companies all over the world as a means of promoting exports and keeping apprised of market conditions. They continue to show great adaptability as Taiwan's computer industry moves toward ...",

With the help of content analysis, the entropy method, and consideration of the diffusion aspects of digitalization, 37 reputable information society and digital divide models are analyzed to indentify “core information and communication technology (ICT) indicators.” To overcome the limitation of the nonexistence of data, the information and the knowledge embedded in information society and digital divide models are employed as proxies for experts' opinions for extracting the core ICT indicators. Comparison of the prior indicators and the proposed ones reveals that the former ignore three important dimensions: e-learning, e-government, and networked world enablers.",

    "abstract": "One facet of the Information Revolution in which the nation finds itself involves the utilization of computers, video systems, and a variety of telecommunications capabilities by those who must cope with emergency situations. Such technologies possess a significant potential for performing emergency public education and transmitting key information that is essential for survival. An ''Emergency Public Information Competitive Challenge Grant,'' under the aegis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has sponsored an effort to use computer technology - both large, time-sharing systems and small personal computers - to develop computer games which will help teach techniques of emergency management to the public at large. 24 references.",

As a result of the Quill decision there has been great effort put forth by the Streamlined Sales Tax Project (SSTP) to harmonize the nation's tax codes and lessen the burden on firms from collecting use taxes on remote sales. Current legislation that has resulted from the SSTP's efforts to satisfy the Commerce Clause are also discussed, along with their potential economic impacts.",

    "title": "A Review of “The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of Technical Expertise”",
    "abstract": "“Have you tried turning it off and on again?” This is how Roy, one of the two socially inept characters in the awardwinning British television sitcom The IT Crowd, welcomes his clients on the phone when they ask for PC (personal computer) support (http://www.theitcrowd.co.uk). The ominous “it”—that is the computer as symbol of the corporate information technology (IT) world, which only geeky insiders like him are able to control. The comedy series is an excellent example of popular culture that proves that the conflict of power between those who create programs and those using them has not been resolved. Nathan Ensmenger, technology historian at the University of Pennsylvania, constructs the social history of this conflict between software programmers and the business lines within corporations in his book The Computer Boys Take Over: Computers, Programmers, and the Politics of Technical Expertise. The success of the aforementioned sitcom and of a film like The Social Network (2010) show that this historian has taken up a topic of consistent popularity. Covering the range of the last 50 to 60 years, he depicts the different stages in the attempts of the corporate world to take over control of software development and its enigmatic processes. Software development—according to Ensmenger’s embracing definition—consists of consultants, analysts, programmers, operators, and all other technical people who are involved in the processes of creating, adjusting, and maintaining software. The author demonstrates that corporations have undertaken many steps toward professionalization and standardization of software programming. However, he concludes that the self-perception of programmers has not changed much since the days when programmers were not considered engineers, but compared themselves to “artists and musicians.” Depending on which point of view you take, one could also say that the guild of programmers has successfully resisted being incorporated into the organizational patterns of today’s streamlined companies. Hence, the stereotype of the software programmer can still be characterized as that of a nerd or even prankster who challenges the orders of his managers or clients—just like Roy or his colleague Moss from the sitcom mentioned earlier. According to Ensmenger, the dominance of the masculine gender is one result of professionalization. Getting programming close to engineering made the jobs more attractive to men than to women in most Western countries. The general lack of skilled resources is the other constant Ensmenger points out to characterize the history of programming. He argues that the stereotype of the nerd, who refuses to share his knowledge and power with the other corporate guys, could only evolve due to the mismatch of supply and demand of these resources: The computer boys could hence take over.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous production function studies analysing the use of information inputs in U.S. manufacturing seem to indicate their large underuse and, implicitly, advocate a policy of increased investment in such inputs. In the present study the degree of underuse of information inputs is reassessed by using techniques similar to those applied in the earlier studies and by using more comprehensive and appropriate alternative methods, i.e. estimating translog functions via the systems approach. By expressing all inputs in monetary terms, comparable marginal (value) products for all factors of production are obtained. The results prove to be highly sensitive to the changes in methodology. The degree of underuse of information inputs seems to have been overstated by previous authors. Our results are likely to be more reliable than previous findings because of the reductions in simultaneity and specification bias which the systems approach entails. Finally, we can say little about policy implications. To asse...",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the shift from disciplinary societies (the visible and physical violence of power) to control societies (the modulating and normalizing techniques of power) in South Korea. At the institutional level, during the period of repressive and disciplinary society in Korea (1948–1992), the regulatory control systems of the state were mainly performed by two formidable apparatuses: the national ID system and the National Security Law. On the other hand, the deployment of institutional power since 1993 has been based on the logic of free-floating control, dispersion, normalization, and modulation. This study examines how the techniques of power were gradually transformed from a centralized and hierarchical model into a distributive and dispersed network model, based on flow, speed, and mobility.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes how media have been conceptualized sometimes in accordance with notions of power and other times with those of empowerment. It is time to overcome this inconsistency in explanations of the media–users relationship and look at in a more innovative way. After a brief introduction in which I present the issues regarding the relationship between media and power/empowerment and the related research questions, in the next section I take stock of the how the debate historically developed in the social sciences on the notion of power, which is one of the most important sociological concepts. In the subsequent section I analyze the more recent notion of empowerment, which is used to explain the presumed role of media in shifting power toward users in beneficial ways. The final discussion demonstrates how classics can help us reconceptualize the role of power and empowerment in a reasonable way that accommodates both notions in the same theoretical framework.",

On another front, Lovejoy argued in 1933 that ideas evolve from each other in a “Chain of Being” and that there is a small number of “unit ideas” that compose all great ideas through history. Since then there has been much debate about the pros and cons of this theory. Ideometry, using Google Print, may provide clarifying insights.",

    "title": "A Review of “Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information”",
    "abstract": "This text offers a cogent introduction to the concepts, history, and future directions of incorporating geographic information into a wide range of topics and disciplines. It offers readers a quick introduction to core geographical concepts in the digital age. Linda Hill is an early pioneer in the translation of traditional geographic artifacts into new digital media formats, and her long-term experience with the topic creates an accessible and timely text. The introduction begins by defining georeferencing as “relating information to geographic location” (p. 1). The reality of implementing this is quite complex and Hill draws on a variety of disciplines to do so, including geography, library sciences, and even psychology. The first step in georeferencing involves differentiating between informal and formal ways of referencing locations. Informal means are commonly used in everyday speech and include the use of place-names such as towns and landmarks. Formal means use spatial referencing systems like longitude and latitude coordinates. The troubled relationship between these two schemes become clear when we attempt to assign coordinates to place-names. Should a town be represented by its central coordinate? If so, what analytical tools should we use to determine this central position? The complications continue in regard to accessing information based on geographic location. This includes retrieving records from databases based on geographic coordinates or placenames. The intersection of these ideas lies at the heart of Hill’s thesis that “the users of information systems are best served through unified georeferencing where both placename and geospatial access works across all types of information resources” (p. 8). In other words, the best practice for delivering georeferenced material is to cast the widest net possible in terms of associating it with spatial coordinate and place-names. The text builds on this assertion and provides the reader with a working historical knowledge of the conversation across disciplines on this problem. The second chapter looks at spatial cognition and information systems by drawing heavily on cognitive psychology to better understand current thinking on how humans perceive and order geographic space. We tend to understand space based on landmarks and less on geographic coordinates or cardinal directions, and such realizations need to inform the structuring of systems to deliver georeferenced content. Hill’s expertise comes through as she presents a detailed discussion of the actual artifacts dealt with in regards to georeferencing library materials. Such materials include maps, digital map layers, and geospatially referenced images (e.g., aerial photography). The majority of these artifacts are typically managed by specialist librarians, and users retrieve them through one of two ways. First is using geographical coordinates to locate places within the geospatial information objects. These artifacts include maps and satellite images. The second uses placenames through a method called indirect georeferencing. Examples include books and museum specimens that are attached to a place-name. The challenge for providers of such content “is to create systems that support the discovery of information resources relevant to particular locations” (p. 62) using one or both of these methods. The difficulty of reconciling place-names and geographic coordinates remains a central theme throughout the book. The need to attach spatial attributes to collection materials is compounded by certain established traditions. For example, many librarians and historical",

Telecommunications companies and trade groups, which anchor the anti-network neutrality coalition, are relatively quiet online.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this research commentary, I develop the notion of hope, and argue for its relevance to inform Information Systems (IS) and ICT for Development (ICT4D) research and practice. Moving beyond lay meanings of hope, as reflecting a future positive orientation, often laced with optimism, I will develop a more theoretically informed understanding of hope based on Arjun Appadurai’s articulation of the \"capacity to aspire\" and Ronald Stade’s Conceptual Map of the Capacity to Aspire, which brings together four concepts: capabilities (Amartya Sen), hope (Ernst Bloch), voice (Albert Hirschman), and culture of poverty (Oscar Lewis). I discuss how it can be made relevant for ICT4D research, based on a theoretical understanding of how information can serve as both a basis and carrier of hope. Drawing from a case study of more than a decade of ongoing research and practice around digitization of public hospital information systems in India, I critically discuss the value of this framework for informing ICT4D research and practice, and how this can be further developed in the future.",

The move of Singapore into high‐technology information equipment production is outlined together with the problems caused by competition from industrialized and developing countries. In contrast, Australia's information equipment industry is very small and it is unlikely to expand significantly without a substantial increase in government funding. Growth of the information services industries is providing a major stimulus for Singapore and Australia to shift into the information economy. In particular, the banking and finance industry is a major component in the services area; Singapore is rapidly emerging as an international financial center. The adoption of information technologies is fundamental to the internationalization of this industry.",

    "abstract": "The far-reaching advances in information and communications technologies (ICTs) in tandem with the globalization of trade, investment, business regulation, production, and consumption have signaled the rise of “informational capitalism.” This article reflects on the social and economic inequalities of informational capitalism by examining two contradictions of ICTs-led economic development—increasing returns and the digital divide. Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic and reductive.",

    "title": "Introduction to the Special Issue on Geographies of Information Society",
    "abstract": "In 1997 the National Science Foundation launched the Varenius Project with the aim of advancing geographic information science (Goodchild et al., 1999). Varenius incorporated three components: computational, cognitive, and societal. In a review paper titled “Geographies of Information Society,” Sheppard et al. (1999) explored the third (societal) component with the aim of introducing the key research initiatives and also to set “a benchmark by which to assess, a few years from now, the specific contributions of the Varenius project to that increasingly vital research area” (p. 798). This special issue revisits that benchmark and initiative 10 years after its publication. Judging by the diversity of topics and the scope of literature of the last few years, one could safely argue that research on the societal aspects of geographic information science and technology has maintained, and indeed intensified, its vitality. Researchers from geography and neighboring disciplines have since tackled many key and critical issues, specifically around the three initiatives of the societal component of the Varenius Project: (i) place and identity in an age of technologically regulated movement, (ii) measuring and representing accessibility in the information age, and (iii) empowerment, marginalization, and public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS). The growth in recent years of interest in critical PPGIS also contributes to this line of work, posing new questions and offering fresh insights. This has resulted in a healthy exchange of ideas between those who are concerned with the social, cultural, and political implications of modern technologies and practices and those who",

    "title": "Internet Governance in Transition: Who Is the Master of This Domain? by Daniel J. Pare. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2003. 208 pp. $26.95 paper. ISBN 0-74251-846-9",
    "abstract": "It is accepted by many that the Internet world was a relatively closed community until the late 1980s, composed principally of computer scientists. Stakeholders were highly homogeneous and tightly knit. Their goals were similar: technological superiority and workability. Therefore, interpretative flexibility among stakeholders was very low; it was relatively easy to build consensus in the community. Users and developers tended to respect each other, in large part because they had dialogues continuously via e-mail and mailing list. Many users shared an understanding regarding how the network worked, where the major trade-offs were located, and what were its urgent problems. If this were the end of the story, the matter would be relatively simple: The Internet is an open, flexible network and no formal governance is necessary. However, due to the expansion in scale of the Internet, commercialization, and globalization during the 1990s, the number of stakeholders increased and heterogeneity among stakeholders widened. As a result, it has become much more difficult to reach consensus and enforce rules. The system seems to be losing its coordination capacity. The legal authority of informal governing body is questionable; many commercial interests are taking important seats in the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and other Internet governance organizations. Domain name governance has not been an exception. Daniel Pare’s book Internet Governance in Transition: Who Is the Master of This Domain?, is about governance of the Internet and its institutional restructuring. The book analyzes the history of domain name governance, profiles the numerous social actors, exposes power struggles and behind-the-scene moves, and sheds light on the complex sociopolitical processes of decision making and policy formulation at both domestic and international levels. The purpose of the book, according to the author, is to describe what social actors actually do rather than what they should do. The book has seven chapters, each of which contributes to the revelation of the underlying dynamics of the institutional reconfiguration of domain name governance. After the introduction, which explains highlights the principal line of discussion, Chapter Two effectively brings the lay reader up to speed regarding the historical, technological, and political background of domain name governance. Pare first explains what the domain name system (DNS) is and how it works. Then he examines the underlying values that influenced the development of this hierarchical distributed architecture, and the administrative norms that evolved with it. Chapter Three sets out the theoretical basis for analyzing the Internet governance process. Pare divides previous literature on Internet governance into three approaches: (1) the commons school of thought, which regards “governance” as a means of top-down or hierarchical coordination mechanisms in order to meet regulatory ends; (2) the decentralized school of thought, which tends to espouse “governance” as a device to achieve a networkbased, decentralized coordination mechanism; and (3) the process-based approach, which primarily focuses on “the processes by which architecture may influence regulatory procedures and the types of social orders that may be promulgated” (p. 57). The author claims that all three approaches fail to appreciate the sociopolitical dynamics of governance processes. As an alternative analytical framework, Pare proposes the power-oriented approach, which is explicated as a three-tiered conceptual framework: (1) surface-tier politics, which imply day-to-day politics or negotiations between participants; (2) deep-structure politics, which “are seen to inform collective interpretive frames and the cognitive maps of the participants” (p. 61); and (3) metalevel politics, which are “the internetworking architecture",

    "abstract": "Discussion of the role of the Internet in government and research tends to be “institution-centric” in that e-government and e-research initiatives are both anchored in top-down strategies to provide information resources to citizens or researchers by place-based institutions, including governments and universities. In both institutional arenas, the diffusion of these services has been limited to small albeit growing proportions of their target audiences. In contrast, individuals with access to the Internet have taken bottom-up initiatives to obtain information and services from the space of flows of the Internet in ways that reach beyond the boundaries of both governmental and research institutions, but in ways that could compete with but also enhance existing institutions, such as by making them more accountable to their respective constituencies. Institutional actors in government and research need to more explicitly recognize and strategically adapt to the practices and tools taken up by networked individuals, such as by creating e-infrastructures that—like the Internet—enable rather than constrain bottom-up innovation.",

    "title": "Identifying Best Practices in Financing Next Generation Networks",
    "abstract": "Governments throughout the world have determined that next generation network (NGN) development serves the national interest. The strategies used to achieve progress vary greatly, as does the extent to which governments perceive the need to get actively involved through direct ownership or subsidization of carriers. No government has unlimited funds to invest in new networks, or to subsidize private ventures promising to improve access to essential services at affordable rates. Accordingly, nations must determine whether and how to use limited taxpayer funds to expedite the access to inexpensive and ubiquitous wired and wireless broadband networks. Baseline factors such as geography, income, demographics, and market penetration of existing networks have a significant impact on what works best. However, nations with similar physical and economic characteristics have pursued significantly different strategies. This article identifies best practices in NGN development using both case studies and a review of the current literature assessing government strategies. While it cannot confirm a theoretical basis for achieving success in NGN development, the article provides a toolkit of confirmed best practices.",

    "title": "A Review of “Reticulations: Jean-Luc Nancy and the Networks of the Political”",
    "abstract": "When we think of networks today, our thoughts are almost immediately drawn toward the digital: social media networks, collaborative networks like Google Wave and Wikipedia entries, or even our home networks that we share between linked computers. In The Exploit, media theorists Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker (2007, 28) suggest the following definition of networked systems, digital and otherwise: “Any system of interrelationality, whether biological or informatic, organic or inorganic, technical or natural—with the ultimate goal of undoing the polar restrictiveness of these pairings.” Galloway and Thacker’s theory of the network leads (directly and indirectly) into Philip Armstrong’s work in Reticulations: Jean-Luc Nancy and the Networks of the Political. In Reticulations, Armstrong takes a different stand on networks, leaving aside the digital aspect (on which Galloway and Thacker lean heavily) and focusing more specifically on assemblages of the multitude, rhizome, and other variations of these groupings. Armstrong borrows from a long tradition of work on networks. Political theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have devoted now three texts (Empire [2001], Multitude [2004], and Commonwealth [2009]) to their construction of the multitude, reductively defined as a resistant force composed through events of shared struggle (Hardt and Negri 2000, 61). Others, like French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (1987, 21), borrow the botanical term “rhizome” to illustrate the root-like spreading of connected threads that “is reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. It is not the One that becomes Two or even directly three, four, five, etc.” Armstrong borrows the idea of political (Hardt and Negri 2000), social (Deleuze and Guattari 1987), and technological (Galloway and Thacker 2007, 82) networks to argue that the “essence of technology is the essence of the political” in such a way that the two become “coessential in their contamination.” To establish the network outside of the digital realm, Armstrong mobilizes Jean-Luc Nancy’s concern with the interdependence of parts; rather than being “common,” Nancy focuses on the “in-common”: What do these shared parts actually share? What about association, community, society, or partnership (for which Armstrong borrows the Greek term koinonia) does the “in” of the “in-common” represent? Further, and most importantly, how does what we share “in common” question the essence of the political? At blazing speed, Armstrong ponders these questions by engaging different critical, political, and literary theorists (like those mentioned earlier). His engagement with the sheer breath of research is, in fact, astonishing. For instance, it is not uncommon to see Armstrong pull from Jean-Luc Nancy’s texts while simultaneously comparing and contrasting Nancy’s arguments with Hardt and Negri, French philosopher Jacques Derrida, and German political theorist Hannah Arendt all on the same page, much less the same paragraph. Such varied invocations of these theorists do not necessarily distract from Armstrong’s engagement with Nancy’s works, but do at times overwhelm the reader because of their scope. However, Armstrong’s knowledge is demonstrated and commendable. Armstrong begins to interrogate networks in his first chapter, “The Disposition of the Political,” by exploring the idea of the “political retreat”: How does the pullingback of the political mark new openings through closures? For Nancy (writing with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), totalitarianism marks the “closure of the political”; this closure marks “the retreat of the political” while at the same time it “reopens the question of relation and alterity and the origin of the political event” (15). This reopening through",

    "abstract": "We synthesize social informatics and regional studies literature to frame an examination of the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) uptake and use in the social experience of distance in a rural technology firm. Though distance is much talked about and regarded as a critical dimension in distributed work, the distinct ways that distance is experienced within a rural firm influence collaboration between the rural firm and its more urban customers and are little explored. This case-study town sheds light on how ICT use influences the experience of distance and collaboration in a remote location. In the first part of our results, we provide a descriptive account of the unique geographical, technical, and collaboration practice characteristics of the rural technology firm. In the second part of our results, we identify three experiences of distance: physical, cultural, and informational. We then synthesize our findings to reconstruct the role of distance and our understanding of the social experience of ICT uptake and use, in how workers experience distance. These findings have implications for regional studies scholars, and suggest that understanding how specific firms succeed will increase the effectiveness of public policy directed at regional development. They also provide for the further development of the social informatics approach, and contribute to a new perspective on distance to the literature on collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1962, economist Fritz Machlup predicted that by the year 2000 more people would be employed to manipulate information than matter or energy. Marc Porat calculated in 1977 that the primary task of 46 percent of the U.S. workforce was to manipulate information. In America and much of the rest of the world, information is a major consumer good and an input in the production of all goods and services, it is the flow of knowledge by which energy and matter are made to serve us. The embodiment of information in people, machines, and organizational arrangements accounts for the majority of society's progress. The importance of information stems not only from its central role in the daily functioning and progress of all societies but from the effects its unusual characteristics have on human behavior and institutional structures and arrangements. This paper summarizes the unusual economic properties of information as a commodity and highlights their impact on the exchange of information. A heuristic t...",

    "title": "The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring",
    "abstract": "This interesting volume is the end result of a small conference held at the University of Teesside in April 1995. It contains a combination of essays using social scienti c and literary analysis to “advance the debate about the governance of cyberspace” (p. xii). The introductory essay by the editor of the volume, Brian Loader, de nes cyberspace as “a computer-generated public domain which has no territorial boundaries or physical attributes and is in perpetual use.” While the current form that cyberspace takes is roughly coterminous with the Internet, it need not be so in the future. The key question is how this thing is to be governed. Loader identi es a number of perspectives on what cyberspace is and how it should be governed. He identi es the cyber-libertarians as an important group who oppose any government intervention in cyberspace. An in uential member of this group is John Perry Barlow, former lyricist for the Grateful Dead and now a rancher in Wyoming. Barlow was one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The editor contrasts cyber-libertarians and other cyberenthusiasts with authors like William Gibson, of the science  ction genre called “cyberpunk,” and political philosophers like Jean Baudrillard who stress the dangers of the illusion of reality created by computer technology. The addition of yet another layer of intermediation augments the already extensive alienation of humans from nature and from each other. The nightmare scenario is a future in which no one interacts face to face anymore but pretends to do so while actually sitting in a room hooked up to fancy equipment. While there is no speci c political program associated with this line of thought, nevertheless its warnings about the dangers of new forms of criminal and antisocial behavior are echoed in essays in this volume on policing crime and regulating hate speech on the Internet by Klaus Lenk, Charles Raab, Dorothy Denning, Puay Tang, and Michael Whine. The  ip side of the coin is the rise of virtual communities and the ability of widely geographically dispersed people to organize social movements at very low cost. The Internet is democratic in one very important respect: It reduces transaction and communications costs for everyone who has access to it. In this respect, it is an important facilitating factor in the current tendency toward economic globalization . The editor discusses the parallels between the ideas of postmodernis t theorists and those of observers and commentators on the growth of networks—parallels that are also explored in essays by David Lyon, Simon Baddeley, and Paul Frisson. Postmodernist theorists like JeanFrancois Lyotard have argued that postmodernism can be characterized as the replacement of “grand narratives” with “little narratives” and with a new stress on subjectivity and the need for multiple voices in public discourse. According to postmodernists , these replacements are desirable given the 20th century’s genocidal experiences resulting from the clash of the grand narratives of fascism, communism, and liberalism. The authors in this volume agree with this point of view generally and argue that the Internet reinforces preexisting tendencies in this direction. I am not a fan of this sort of work, but the chapters that deal with this subject in this volume are short, readable, and generally well done. Another topic explored in this volume is that of democracy and the “digital divide”—growing inequalitie s associated with unequal access to the Internet. Dave Carter deals with this in his essay and illustrates his arguments with a case study of experiments in teledemocracy in the city of Manchester in England. The  nal essay in the volume by Michael Whine focuses on the use of the Internet by right wing and neo-fascist groups. It is a very informative essay containing a number",

    "abstract": "Early in Samir Chopra and Scott D. Dexter’s refreshingly and unapologetically ideological, but ultimately also frustrating and problematic Decoding Liberation: The Promise of Free and Open Source Software, the authors make their position clear: Proprietary software is not only deeply unethical but also anathema to the values embraced by even the most stridently capitalist of contemporary societies. It is also, they argue, probably futile to even try to prevent others from accessing and modifying others’ code. To prove this point, the authors compare software—“an easily reproducible and disseminable artifact” (45)—to the output of poets and musicians. “It is difficult to imagine poets and musicians being able to restrict when and how their works and performed,” they write, “particularly if these restrictions infringe on the free speech rights of others” (45). In fact, it is not difficult at all to imagine poets and musicians being able to restrict others’ use of their work: One need only consider songwriters’ resistance to the use of their work by politicians. Some recent examples: In 2008, lawyers for the rock duo Heart advised Sarah Palin to stop using their song “Barracuda” at campaign stops. In the same year, John Mellencamp demanded that John McCain stop using two of his songs, “Little Pink Houses” and “Our Country”; Jackson Browne also told McCain to stop using his “Running on Empty.” Tom Petty has issued at least two cease-and-desist letters, one in 2011 to conservative presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann for using “American Girl” at rallies, and one in 2000 to George W. Bush for using “I Won’t Back Down.” In all cases, the politicians backed down. It does seem, after all, that musicians stand behind their right to determine how their creative work is appropriated by others (Greene 2011); given this, why should we expect software designers—creative types and, if Chopra and Dexter are to be believed, the technoera’s new poets and songwriters—to give up ownership and control over their creative work? Perhaps this comparison is a minor flaw in the authors’ argument and one that should not be worth quibbling over—except that Decoding Liberation is full of similarly problematic assertions. Chopra and Dexter argue that one way to think about FOSS (free and open-source software) licenses is as “de facto constitutions” that both represent and regulate the values of their constituents (62). We can therefore, they argue, consider the virtue of a given constituency by examining its constitution, since",

An analysis of U.S. policy for controlling the reexport of high‐technology goods provides an example of this interdependence. Four primary points are emphasized throughout the paper: (1) there seems to be only limited appreciation of how different issues get entangled in the international arena; (2) the data on which to base policy decisions regarding information technology do not exist in a readily available and usable form; (3) there is little understanding of the technological status and policy support for information technology in other countries; and (4) the people needed to analyze international developments and policies in the information technologies are not being trained.",

    "abstract": "Regional economic communities, which are growing in numbers and size, play an increasingly important role in information and communication technology (ICT) policymaking. As seen through the lens of complex adaptive systems theory, such systems should strive to generate adaptive policies through adaptive policymaking processes that position them to respond to rapid technological change. To date, however, regional policymaking has been overly concerned with policy harmonization as an outcome, possibly to the detriment of other important goals. Despite this bias, upon closer examination, one finds that regional communities do foster adaptivity through their roles in the formation of epistemic communities, capacity building, and resource pooling. These activities contribute to variation, interaction, and selection, all key processes for adaptation. It is this degree of adaptivity, and its required balance between policy harmonization and competition, that should be the basis for analyzing the effectiveness of regional policymaking.",

In contrast to bureaucracy’s monocratic authority structure, authority in blockocracies is centered on four distinct layers. In each layer, there is governance of the code and governance by the code, and in the latter we distinguish between endogenous and exogenous rules. We also compare the “blockocrat” with Weber’s depiction of the bureaucrat.",

This paper explains the development process for the smart feature phone, how this has influenced the nature and extent of adoption, and its use by low-income groups, including their demonstrated preference for uses related to entertainment rather than more traditional “work-related” goals.

Scrap-handlers and ragpickers in four townships of Myanmar were interviewed in three phases of fieldwork, and their mobile phone use was also observed. The findings provide insight into how mobile communication can streamline the day-to-day workings of a sector, and also the disadvantages experienced by those who do not have a mobile phone.",

    "title": "Business as usual? How gamification transforms internal party democracy",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article was motivated by the question whether gamification represents a substantial innovation in internal party democracy, by contributing to change the dynamics of power within parties. To answer this question, we examine the only known case of gamification in the field of internal party voting, launched by the Italian Movimento 5 Stelle. We expected that gamified internal votes would reduce the incumbent advantage and promote party activists. Our data, however, suggest that these decision-making processes follow the same logic as the traditional ones. We thus conclude that digital innovations often end up working as “business as usual”.",

    "abstract": "Universal high-speed Internet access can productively transform a nation's economy. However, many municipalities in the United States have been left behind in terms of Internet penetration. Some municipal governments have tried to address this by launching initiatives that aim at offering citywide, universal broadband access. Unfortunately, most of these initiatives either have been discontinued or have ended in failure. Drawing on actor-network theory, we conducted a 3-year study to investigate the evolution of the Internet TV initiative in LaGrange, Georgia, in the United States. The results reveal distinct interpretations of the initiative by different actor groups (the government, the service providers, socioeconomically advantaged residents, and socioeconomically disadvantaged residents), at different stages of implementation, pointing to tensions among the various groups. These tensions reflect the structural problems embedded in the macro political, economic, and societal context. The findings offer insights for policymakers who intend to achieve universal broadband access.",

I liked the focus of Roberta’s work and how she went about her scholarship. I wrote to ask about a paper of hers: she responded with a flurry of pointers and text, the first of many great interchanges. We began to interact regularly by email. I first met Roberta in person in 1997 when she briefly stopped by for dinner while traveling from one place to another. This meeting is metaphorical: Roberta was a woman constantly on the go and very much on her way someplace important.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We used the folk theory perspective to investigate Internet users’ understanding of algorithms during their Internet use. Empirically, we conducted a mixed-method study. First, we carried out semi-structured in-person interviews with 30 German Internet users. Our analysis of these interviews enabled us to identity five folk theories – economic orientation theory, personal interaction theory, popularity theory, categorization theory, and algorithmic thinking theory. In a second step, we created a standardized survey questionnaire with 19 illustrative statements for these five folk theories, relying on participants’ explanations in the interviews to develop statements that reflected lay users’ ideas as much as possible. Participants (N = 331) were recruited through a commercial online access panel using quota criteria for age, gender, and education level to have a sample representative of the German population. Our survey findings indicate the prevalence of such folk theories among a broader population of Internet users, except for the algorithmic thinking theory, which is likely due to it being based on inaccurate assumptions about algorithms’ capabilities.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the body of research on the use and role of instant messaging (IM) in campus life, and how IM is a key part of university students' communication. IM is a synchronous form of communication, and its speed, availability information, and support for multiple conversations have made it appealing for young people. With university students, in particular, showing a heavy reliance on IM, researchers have shown great interest in how university students use IM and how it is integrated in their social and academic life. While studies are emerging in various disciplines, no attempt has been made to integrate the disparate findings and approaches. This article synthesizes key findings, provides a map of the literature, and discusses conceptual problems inherent in the study of IM and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) that will help researchers identify key areas of study and opportunities for future investigation.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews roughly 200 recent studies of mobile (cellular) phone use in the developing world, and identifies major concentrations of research. It categorizes studies along two dimensions. One dimension distinguishes studies of the determinants of mobile adoption from those that assess the impacts of mobile use, and from those focused on the interrelationships between mobile technologies and users. A secondary dimension identifies a subset of studies with a strong economic development perspective. The discussion considers the implications of the resulting review and typology for future research.",

    "abstract": "This article examines four cases and identifies several issues associated with the concept of communities of practice. These cases describe different forms of communities of practice in various settings including consulting firms and legal firms. After introducing these cases, we address several issues that emerged from these cases and the research literature. First, we caution against the tendency to romanticize the communities of practice construct and especially online communities. The cross-case analysis points to five problems that should be considered before developing an online community of practice. These five problems include: prescriptive versus description distinction; ready-made versus communities in the making; knowledge of possession versus knowing in practice; mid-level social theory versus micro learning theory; and motivated members versus unwilling subjects. In sum, we believe that community of practice is not likely to be forced, but is emerging, and designers need to be aware of the characteristics of existing communities of practice to nurture them.",

It represents a European consensus on a standard for personal privacy and a model for countries without data protection laws. The protracted process for agreement and ratification, however, has produced a document with many derogations and ambiguities, reflecting the wider moves towards ''subsidiarity'' within the European Union. Of concern to North America is the stipulation that transborder data flow may not be permitted unless the receiving country can demonstrate an ''adequate'' level of protection. While the process through which this provision will be interpreted and applied is so far found to be complicated and unclear, nevertheless European authorities will be reluctant to tolerate ''data havens,'' a fact that should concern North American business that relies on the unimpeded flows of personal data from and to Europe.

    "title": "A Review of “The Wireless Spectrum: The Politics, Practice, and Poetics of Mobile Media”",
    "abstract": "It’s out there. You can’t see it, but you are potentially tapped into it right now, and if you aren’t, several of your favorite electronic devices probably are connected to it. The wireless spectrum (perhaps better known as the radiofrequency portion of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum) is the ethereal bridge for radio transmissions and the technologies of wireless communication, including cell phones and other mobile devices. In most developed countries the spectrum is sliced up into small pieces that are allocated for use by various groups, including cell phone providers. These providers in turn sell access to the spectrum to customers who use cell phones and other wireless-enabled devices (like computers and tablets) to make phone calls and access the Internet; they control access for most individuals. The Wireless Spectrum: The Politics, Practices, and Poetics of Mobile Media (edited by Barbara Crow et al. and published by the University of Toronto Press) records a moment in time when mobile devices have become increasingly powerful and important tools not just for communication, but for access to information. The recent debates about Net neutrality and the control of access to digital information via the Internet have increased awareness of the power of the Internet to access information, inform others, and engage in dialogues that are often held primarily in the digital realm. The Wireless Spectrum offers an insight into a concomitant debate that exists regarding mobile technologies used to connect individuals and information. This edited book offers 13 chapters (and an introduction) on the development, application, and future of mobile media as an extension of the evolution of the wireless spectrum. The first section of the book, “Spectral Genealogies,” deals with the evolution of the spectrum through the technological advancement of mobile devices including, but not limited to, the cellular smart phone. This section is a quick look back at the cultural history of the spectrum, and its evolution not only as a technological phenomenon, but as a cultural paradigm shift in which the ether is transformed into “new topologies that emerge through previously unimaginable connections” (Jennifer Gabrys in Crow et al. 2010, p. 49). These atmospheric topographies allow for new connections between people, but also connections between people and the spaces they inhabit, which lead to the second section of the book, “Mobile Practices.” Mobile devices (sometimes referred to as the third screen) not only open connectivity between people; they alter behaviors of how we communicate with each other. The ability for constant, immediate access these devices afford shifts the temporal and spatial constraints placed on how we interact with each other, opening up new behaviors and social mores surrounding mobile communication. “Mobile Practices” includes several case studies that investigate some of these new patterns of behavior and the ways in which individuals and groups use, and agree upon, these tools of communication—including the use of mobile technologies to augment existing reality into “Locative Media”: “a convergence of geographical and data space that comes about as soon as computing becomes mobile or ambient” (Hemment 2006, p. 349). Projects that embrace locative media “also tackle social and political contexts of production by focusing on social networking, access, and participatory media content including story-telling and spatial annotation” (Galloway and Ward 2006).",

    "abstract": "The unobtrusive application of some techniques of research (namely, network analysis and content analysis) permits us to quantitatively identify some aspects of the social ''climate'' and context which govern a particular group of people interacting with each other through computers: the Italian cyber punk computer conference has been analyzed over a period of 19 months, through a succession of crises and moments of renewal. Monthly variations in the network measurements observed (density, reciprocity of links, etc.) may be taken as a ''barometer'' of the social liveliness of the conference. The analysis of the lexicon used in the messages reveals the presence of an underlying ''analogical'' linguistic component and of strategies for the construction of one's own social presence despite the seemingly limited possibilities of expression offered by the net. Used together, both techniques describe the expectations related to the roles of newcomer or leader. Conclusions include: a) a proposed framework to exp...",

Based on this overview, we propose a conceptual framework which is sensitive to the major objectives and assumptions of previous approaches, but which also attempts to expand the criteria for the assessment of information value.",

    "abstract": "Information technology (IT)—computers and related technologies—is the latest technology to enter the household. Like other technologies, gender is a major factor in its adoption and use as well as its perceived usefulness. Unlike prior household technologies, the computer's entry into the household has followed a different pattern. Early statistics revealed a vast gender divide, with men using computers and related technologies much more in the household. More recent statistics show a narrowing of the divide, perhaps even a reversal, particularly in the United States, with women outnumbering men in the access to and use of the Internet. In this article, the role of gender and its relationship with Internet use in the home are reviewed. In addition to overall adoption and access, the review focuses on specific Internet applications and examines the factors that contribute to gender differences in adoption and use of computers and Internet applications in the home.",

    "title": "The regulation of telecommunications networks",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the past several years, the number of sellers from whom customers of telecommunications network services can choose has increased dramatically. Whether it is the provision of domestic long‐distance service, or the offering of international telecommunications, or even the delivery of local communications, where previously service was provided by one firm or by a stable handful of firms that shared a market, users now have a wider range of choice and this increase in the scope of choice is likely to continue into the future. These changes, the result of a combination of developments in technology and regulatory policy, have created new problems for those charged with the regulation of telecommunications. This paper begins by tracing the changes in regulatory policy that have led to the increase in the number of suppliers of domestic long‐distance telecommunications service. Then, it examines a number of principles for pricing telecommunications network services. Next, it identifies a number of e...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Japan is the industrialized country that is most closely identified with an overall industrial policy. It has often been assumed that the success of the Japanese computer industry is attributed to a coherent set of policy measures. The article revisits this assumption by examining the scope and nature of government intervention, and the role of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in particular, in the growth of the computer industry. The analysis shows that industrial policy did not contribute as much as is commonly suggested.",

The data consists of the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish sections of the European Social Survey 2002 ( n = 7539) and 2004 ( n = 7211). The similarities and differences in the Internet use are analyzed using sociodemographic and economic information. Temporal changes in the distribution of use between population groups and between countries are also examined. The findings indicate that there are clear disparities in the Internet use patterns, which have not evened out in the early 21st century.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of social robotics, like other ambitious research programs, depends on the identification of lines of inquiry that are coherent with its visionary goals while satisfying more stringent constraints of feasibility and near-term payoffs. Within these constraints, this article outlines one line of inquiry that seems especially viable: development of a society of robots operating within the physical environments of everyday human life, developing rich robot–robot social exchanges, and yet, refraining from any physical contact with human beings. To pursue this line of inquiry effectively, sustained interactions between specialized research communities in robotics are needed. Notably, suitable robotic hand design and control principles must be adopted to achieve proper robotic manipulation of objects designed for human hands that one finds in human habitats. The Pisa-IIT SoftHand project promises to meet these manipulation needs by a principled combination of sensorimotor synergies and soft robotics actuation, which aims at capturing how the biomechanical structure and neural control strategies of the human hand interact so as to simplify and solve both control and sensing problems.",

    "abstract": "One of the fastest growing forms of downloadable Internet-based data involves digital map layers that contain spatial features suitable for analysis with a geographic information system (GIS). The availability of networked spatial data has fostered tremendous growth in the importance and use of location-based services, and it is now commonplace to find a wide variety of map-based applications and data sets on the Internet for unrestricted download. Despite the rapid growth in spatial data resources, there has been scant attention paid to their currentness, lineage, locational accuracy, completeness, and overall usefulness. This article discusses the quality of Internet spatial data by taking an extreme case to evaluate both the availability and the usefulness of spatial data posted on publicly accessible Web sites. The case study examined is Tibet, which is selected purposively because it lies at or beyond the fringes of the network society. The issue examined concerns the rehabilitation potential of locatable Buddhist monasteries. In undertaking this assessment, the efficacy of the current Internet as a source of useful spatial data is brought into question.",

    "title": "Computing the everyday: Social media as data platforms",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We conceive social media platforms as sociotechnical entities that variously shape user platform involvement and participation. Such shaping develops along three fundamental data operations that we subsume under the terms of encoding, aggregation, and computation. Encoding entails the engineering of user platform participation along narrow and standardized activity types (e.g., tagging, liking, sharing, following). This heavily scripted platform participation serves as the basis for the procurement of discrete and calculable data tokens that are possible to aggregate and, subsequently, compute in a variety of ways. We expose these operations by investigating a social media platform for shopping. We contribute to the current debate on social media and digital platforms by describing social media as posttransactional spaces that are predominantly concerned with charting and profiling the online predispositions, habits, and opinions of their user base. Such an orientation sets social media platforms apart from other forms of mediating online interaction. In social media, we claim, platform participation is driven toward an endless online conversation that delivers the data footprint through which a computed sociality is made the source of value creation and monetization.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The goal of this article is to examine the strategic choices of firms collecting consumer data online and to identify the roles and obligations of the actors within the current network of online tracking. In doing so, the focus shifts from placing the onus on individuals to make an informed choice, to justifying the roles and responsibilities of firms when gathering, aggregating, and using consumers' interests or behavior online. Firms online are uniquely positioned to undercut or to respect privacy expectations within three possible roles: as a member of a supply chain of information traders, within a network of surveillance online, and as an arm of law enforcement. These firms benefit from aggregating and analyzing consumer data and have an associated responsibility to not only minimize the harm to consumers but also to enact change where the firm is in the most knowledgeable and powerful position.",

The article thus in effect addresses an oft-asked question: Can virtual communities be \"real\", have the same basic qualities as f2f communities?

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper draws attention to the geography of economic opportunity in the information society. Canadian evidence is used to shed light on regional issues raised by the information revolution. While Canada's constituent provinces are all emerging as information‐based service economies, regional development is occurring in a virtual policy vacuum. In particular, existing regional policy is predicated on the assumption that Canada is still an industrial economy, as reflected in a continued emphasis on influencing the location of manufacturing production and access to transportation. Initial evidence on “first wave” impacts of economic and technical change suggests that the information revolution is likely to exacerbate current regional disparities. Finally, it is argued that historical patterns of cumulative economic development have provided Canada's most favored regions with a head start in the emerging information society.",

We found that those with greater socioeconomic and digital privilege were more likely to engage in video gatherings, though participation related to lower social connectedness. Social gatherings over video chat may thus be the recourse for those already feeling disconnected when physically distanced; alternately, such gatherings may leave those who participate in them feeling less connected.",

    "title": "Cross-Sectoral Differences in Intellectual Property Enforcement in Developing Countries: The Role of State-Industry Linkages",
    "abstract": "Leading developing countries have recently introduced some reforms in their national intellectual property regimes to harmonize them with international treaties and agreements. However, major differences remain in how these laws are applied to different information industries, and how they are enforced on the ground. While intellectual property law applies to a host of information products ranging from music to computer programs, governments have selectively enforced the law in some information industries, while neglecting to extend the same protection to others. Based on the comparative institutionalist approach, this article identifies two variables--state-industry linkages and level of innovative activity--that may explain the selective enforcement of intellectual property law. Intellectual property rights were expected to be better protected in information industries with strong state-industry linkages and higher levels of domestic innovation. This expectation was tested through a comparative study of four intellectual property industries from the Asian region. The results confirmed the expectation, but also demonstrated that strong state-industry linkages may independently correlate with high levels of intellectual property protection, even in industries where the current levels of innovative activity are low.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Current debates around user-generated content and its role in wealth generation can be understood as attempts to apply or develop a theory of exploitation or, more broadly, a theory of value. This article seeks to provide a theory based on the network asymmetries of late capitalism, which tend to unevenly distribute network resources through a logic of “digital inclusion.” The mechanisms that enable this asymmetric situation are introduced, and the historical displacements that have given rise to those mechanisms are briefly discussed. The conceptual model that emerges from the analysis reveals the salient features of the contemporary connexionist world that transcend, but do not erase, class boundaries.",

This article analyzes the role of international flows of computerized information in the global economy as a way to evaluate debates about the nature of contemporary society. Two kinds of flows that offer distinct advantages to transnational corporations as their major users are identified. Corporate flows between branches of the same firm facilitate existing business activities. Commercial flows sold from one firm to another comprise a new form of trade in digital commodities, produced and exchanged according to the logic of the market. Rather than introducing a qualitatively different type of information society, microelectronics technologies have made it possible to extend the process of commodification into digital forms of production and exchange.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Creating a Patient Centered Information System (PCIS) or Electronic Medical Record System (EMRS)—the former terminology emphasizing the clinical purpose, the latter the missing product—is now viewed by the health care community as necessary to coordinate modern patient care in a manner that can control costs. However, despite 25 years of significant effort, the distance between the information systems available today in health care and what will be needed to fulfill this promise in the future remains very large. Success depends on achieving three goals that are generally in conflict: (1) giving the users the full scope of features and detail needed to create and use electronic clinical records for decision making, (2) providing the speed and reliability necessary for their online use, and (3) preserving system security and patient confidentiality. The vendors of the current generation of Hospital Information Systems (HIS) are being asked to supply these new capabilities before most have fully suc...",

    "abstract": "The digital divide is conventionally measured in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) equipment diffusion, which comes down to counting the number of computers or phones, among other devices. This article fine-tunes these approximations by estimating the amount of digital information that is stored, communicated, and computed by these devices. The installed stock of ICT equipment in the consumer segment is multiplied with its corresponding technological performance, resulting in the “installed technological capacity” for storage (in bits), bandwidth (in bits per second), and computational power (in computations per second). This leads to new insights. Despite the rapidly decreasing digital equipment divide, there is an increasing gap in terms of information-processing capacity. It is shown that in 1996 the average inhabitant of the industrialized countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had a capacity of 49 kibps more than its counterpart from Latin America and the Caribbean. Ten years later, this gap widened to 577 kibps per inhabitant. This innovative approach toward the quantification of the digital divide leads to numerous new challenges for the research agenda.",

    "abstract": "Government, major information and communications technology (ICT) companies, and educational institutions in the United Kingdom currently claim that ICT skills training offers inclusion into the new economy. We focus on a private–public training initiative and its impact on the socially excluded, specifically lone women parents. Narrative data from four United Kingdom educational sites participating in this computer network engineer training program highlight a systemic paradox: that ICT skills development initiatives designed to support lone women parents are simultaneously working in opposition to broader policy goals such as work–life balance and ironically serve to reproduce the participants' classification as socially excluded. The assumptions underpinning the model of social inclusion driving the ICT skills training course are analyzed critically using the concepts of community of practice, classificatory systems, and marginalization. Our findings suggest that ICT training courses and initiatives should be accompanied by changes in pedagogic practice that accommodate the more wide-ranging needs of those targeted for inclusion, as well as changes in employment settings. We conclude by exploring the implications of this for government policy formation, business vendor qualifications, the design of ICT skills training initiatives, and our understanding of the role of ICT skills in overcoming the digital divide.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Research typically focuses on one medium. But in today's digital media environment, people use and are influenced by their experience with multiple systems. Building on media ecology research, we introduce the notion of integrated media effects. We draw on resource dependence and homophily theories to analyze the mechanisms that connect media systems. To test the integrated media effects, we examine the relationships between news media visibility and social media visibility and hyperlinking patterns among 410 nongovernmental organization (NGO) websites in China. NGOs with greater news media visibility and more social media followers receive significantly more hyperlinks. Further, NGOs with a similar number of social media followers prefer to hyperlink to each other. The results suggest that both news media and social media systems are related to the configuration of hyperlink networks, providing support for the integrated media effects described. Implications for the study of hyperlink networks, online behaviors of organizations, and public relations are drawn from the results.",

    "title": "Universal Service Expansion: Two Perspectives",
    "abstract": "It is now widely accepted that universal service will have to be redefined time and again as the technological environment evolves. Accordingly, policymakers have sought to institute a process for a periodic review of the universal service package. In order to \"automate\" the initiation of the review process, they have devised market-indicators-based trigger mechanisms to flag new technologies that should be considered for inclusion in an expanded universal service package. This article interrogates the majoritarian assumptions behind the design of the trigger mechanisms. It shows how the pressures generated by systems to induce adoption of a new technology by citizens/consumers play as important a role as their uncoerced choices in the emergence of new consumption norms. The article calls for balanced thinking that also considers the system perspective.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We explore the link between daily spatial mobility and social mobility, taking changes in the contemporary labor market and family as examples. We propose a new theoretical approach to mobility that is defined as a productive force of social labor. Analyzing the relationship between daily spatial mobility and social mobility, we show that spatial mobility has become a strategy of compensation for the lack of social mobility. Explanations for the increase in daily spatial mobility are also provided. Lastly, we reveal how spatial mobility has the capacity to produce major social change, taking the family as an example.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since 2007–2008, American undergraduates’ media ecology has changed dramatically without an accompanying transformation in how they use media to end relationships. The similarities in people’s breakup practices between 2008 and 2018 reveal that, regardless of what social media is used, American undergraduates turn to media in moments of breakup as ways to manage three complicated aspects of ending a relationship: untangling all the ways in which people signal intertwined lives, deciphering the quotidian unknowable of another person’s mind, and trying to control who knows what when. This paper explores how rapid shifts in media ecologies may change the ways in which conventionalization around social practices emerges, leading to more norms oriented around what all media accomplish, rather than generating norms around the affordances of a specific medium.",

    "title": "Critical Theory of Communication Technology: Introduction to the Special Section",
    "abstract": "The debate over the contribution of new communication technology to democracy is far from settled. Some point to the empowering effects of online discussion and fund-raising on recent electoral campaigns in the United States to argue that the Internet will restore the public sphere. Others claim that the Internet is just a virtual mall, a final extension of capitalist rationalization into every corner of our lives, a trend supported by an ever denser web of surveillance technologies threatening individual autonomy in the advanced societies of the West. This introduction to the special section on critical theory of communication technology argues for the democratic thesis with some qualifications. The most important contribution of new technology to democracy is not necessarily its effects on the conventional political process but rather its ability to assemble a public around technical networks that enroll individuals scattered over wide geographical areas. Communities of medical patients, video game players, musical performers, and many other groups have emerged on the Internet with surprising consequences. New forms of resistance correlate with the rationalizing tendencies of a technologized society.",

    "abstract": "In this essay, contrary to popular belief, it is argued on the basis of transaction cost economics that consumers will become dependent subcontractors in electronic markets. Consumers invest time and effort building up a relationship with a producer, (r)e-tailer, or intermediary—an investment that is idiosyncratic. The intermediary only needs to invest in generic assets that enable him or her to automate the process of collecting and processing customer information needed to differentiate products and discriminate prices. As subcontractors, consumers face high switching costs and are thus dependent on intermediaries. Virtual communities of consumers that organize countervailing power will not mitigate this tendency.",

    "abstract": "This article challenges conventional policy development and evaluation approaches that emphasize the instrumental side of technology. There is a growing gap between conventional planning and evaluation approaches for rural broadband ICTs that seek to demonstrate a direct link between investments and results on the one hand, and on the other, with evidence that the contribution of ICTs to rural economic, social and cultural wellbeing is increasingly difficult to demonstrate beyond short-term measurable indicators. The article proposes an alternative paradigm based on sociotechnical systems, stakeholder engagement, an acknowledgment of the multiple dimensions at play, and the growing evidence of unpredictability of ICTs. The article emphasizes a perspective based on “contribution,” not attribution; policymaking that is both adaptive and inclusive of multiple perspectives; methodological testing of emerging evaluation methodologies; and projects as learning experiments. This alternative theoretical and policymaking paradigm is encapsulated in a metaphor based on the management of natural resources where stakeholders track their own indicators of impact by reading how the system responds to a project intervention.",

    "abstract": "Many organizations develop social media networks with the aim of engaging a wide range of social groups in the production of information that fuels their processes. This effort appears to crucially depend on complex data structures that allow the organization to connect and collect data from a myriad of local contexts and actors. One such organization, PatientsLikeMe, is developing a platform with the aim of connecting patients with one another while collecting self-reported medical data, which it uses for scientific and commercial medical research. Here the question of how technology and the underlying data structures shape the kind of information and medical evidence that can be produced through social media-based arrangements comes powerfully to the fore. In this observational case study, I introduce the concepts of information cultivation and social denomination to explicate how the development of such a data collection architecture requires a continuous exercise of balancing between the conflicting demands of patient engagement, necessary for collecting data in scale, and data semantic context, necessary for effective capture of health phenomena in informative and specific data. The study extends the understanding of the context-embeddedness of information phenomena and discusses some of the social consequences of social media models for knowledge making.",

It takes as its reference point the two chess tournaments (in 1996 and 1997) between the then world champion Gary Kasparov and the IBM dedicated chess computers Deep Blue and Deeper Blue and shows how these games of chess came to be seen as an arena where fundamental issues pertaining to human identity were contested. The article considers the dominant framing of these encounters in terms of a conflict between two opposed categories—“human” and “machine”—and argues the essential role of human agency, the human supplement, in the performances of machine intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Along with the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs), work processes are becoming ever more knowledge intensive. In keeping with this trend, the number of informational (or knowledge) workers in Finland has more than tripled from 12% in 1988 to 39% in 2000. What makes the Finnish case unique and interesting is the exceptional speed with which the information sector of the economy has grown. A few years after facing the most severe economic recession in its history in the early 1990s, Finland is now considered to have an advanced information economy. However, our empirical analysis--based on survey data from 1988, 1994, and 2000--yields a somewhat more critical picture of the Finnish information society than what usually comes across in the mainstream media. The opportunities for social equality offered by the growth of informational work are far more limited than was the case with the transition from agricultural to industrial production.",

    "abstract": "This article considers challenges to getting information systems to recognize “objects” in other information systems. We explore a tension between commitment to standardization and the constitutive and situated social fact requirements of human comprehension and work through an ethnographic study of an information system design team meeting.2 Facilitating interoperability between systems is an important challenge currently facing design teams. Our study elucidates—in the design team's own words—problems that design teams confront with “object” and “concept” certainty, practical “use” and “language”: with defining what they call a “What” when data objects must cross boundaries. The refrain “What is the ‘What’?” punctuates the meeting. Although human use and comprehension frame their concerns, they treat meaning, practical use, and language as “technical” and “philosophical” issues. The social issues they acknowledge are confined to “governance.” Given their reliance on performed social objects, including “role” and “identity”, at key points in their discussion, however, and the importance of “language” and “concepts” to their concerns, we point out social dimensions of their task, suggesting that a broader understanding of the importance of constitutive practices and their situated character in achieving information objects—and social objects more generally—could change the team's perception of their options.",

    "abstract": "Evidence demonstrates that the digital divide is deepening despite strategies mobilized worldwide to reduce it. In disadvantaged communities, beyond training and infrastructural issues, there often lies a range of cultural and historically formed relationships that affect people's adoption of ICTs. This article presents an analysis of local resident's engagement with their council's pilot project to develop a computer facility in their community center. We ask, to what extent can people in poor urban communities, once trained, be expected to volunteer to work on furthering community education and development in ICTs in their local area? Findings indicate four patterns of individual engagement with the computer project: reflexive, utilitarian, distributive, and nonparticipatory. It is argued that local people engaged with the intervention in historically patterned and locally distinctive ways that served immediate personal and pragmatic ends. They did not adopt the long-term strategic goals of the council or university.",

    "abstract": "This article reports the results and conclusions of a mixed-methods research strategy designed to assess the potential of community networking in rural Tamil Nadu, India. The data reported and analyzed in this article include socioeconomic and household spending, agricultural marketing and price search, availability and use of information on agricultural problems, and communication media use. We use these data to define a framework of existing sources of information for various community agents, with a special emphasis on farmers. We analyze the methods and costs at which these agents obtain information, and identify information and communication gaps that information and communication technologies (ICTs) may help alleviate. This study allows us to demonstrate opportunities for socioeconomic development through ICT-enabled information access. The article concludes by stating the importance of basic communication technologies and contextually relevant information services, and suggesting recommendations for future research in this area.",

    "abstract": "The need for quick, timely, and accurate information is critical in emergency events. During mass emergencies, people assemble information from both official and unofficial sources. As digital access expands, people will increasingly incorporate information from digital sources into decision making and assess it against the local circumstances they experience. If we extrapolate what such behavior means for the future, we can see that information management under emergency conditions will need to become increasingly socially distributed. The key question then is how to assess the quality of information: how “good” or “bad” it is; whether it is “misinformation” or “disinformation.” Borrowing from Simon's notion of satisficing, the authors argue that people's assessment of information helpfulness and credibility is a function of the “everyday analytic” skills they employ during mass emergencies. To facilitate the critical work of “everyday analysts,” we outline a research agenda for the development of analytical support tools.",

    "title": "IT Education and Workforce Participation: A New Era for Women in Kenya?",
    "abstract": "While Sub-Saharan African women have historically assumed the roles of both housewives and subsistence farmers, they have had few opportunities to participate in the modern economies of the region. However, this trend is changing with the exponential growth of information and communications technologies (ICT), giving many Sub-Sahara African women access to computers, the Internet, and other related technologies. Based on the work of a four-member research team from Kenya and the United States, this article examines the integration of female college students into the formal ICT work sector in Kenya. We do so by examining major bottlenecks and enablers to such integration from historical and contemporary perspectives. Using an interpretive approach, we conducted 32 interviews with women in an ICT program offered by a university in Kenya. Our findings indicate that women were highly optimistic, embracing ICT as a practical mechanism for achieving entry into the labor market. However, they perceived significant structural barriers, such as public policies that failed to facilitate the development of the ICT sector, gender discrimination by employers, and training that provided them with insufficient technical skills to enable them to effectively perform in the workplace. These findings largely confirm the gendered perspectives found in similar studies conducted in other countries. However, what appear as global perspectives are informed by the local causes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Internet nonuse persists among the most excluded groups of people, particularly among aging and low-educated populations. Proxy internet use (PIU), where nonusers ask internet users to do things online for them, helps nonusers mitigate their exclusion from the digital realm. This study examines the changing factors that shape PIU activation. Specifically, it focuses on the changing role of socio-demographics and family support in internet nonusers’ access to online services by comparing factors engendering active engagement in PIU in 2009 and 2018. The results from multivariate analyses of cross-sectional survey data from two nationwide representative samples collected nine years apart in Slovenia show that both sets of factors have lost their explanatory power over time. At the same time, internet nonusers are increasingly concentrated in the most vulnerable groups of people. Specifically, the decreasing importance of (grand)children as proxy users and the newly emerging importance of spouses or partners represents a shift away from intergenerational support and toward intragenerational support in regards to who nonusers rely on when asking for help with online tasks and services.",

    "abstract": "Information technology is often seen by decision makers as a progressive measure for promoting public-sector financial accountability. One of the key assumptions is that electronic access to information increases transparency and thus, automatically, accountability. This linkage is overly simplified. There is potential conflict between the objectives of providing efficient access on the one hand and supporting accountability on the other.In Sub-Saharan Africa, financial functions were among the first to be automated. More recently, information technology is being used to control and decentralize financial systems. The improvement in financial accountability has yet to materialize. Evidence of this includes instances where corruption and thefts of state assets have gone unchecked. Many efforts to strengthen financial controls fail because the fundamental structures needed to underpin them are often overlooked; this includes record keeping.",

With the help of empirical indicators for each domain, this article uses the case of Estonia to show that there is often more to the information society than what is captured by traditional measures. This article calls for a context-sensitive approach, which takes into consideration social and cultural indicators.

    "abstract": "Abstract The convergence of computer and communication technologies has made it feasible to establish a universal international communications network linking all mankind. The information flowing through this network constitutes an increasingly important element of world trade and a major source of future economic growth. However, governments are hesitant to allow the creation of a fully integrated international information network and tend to restrict at least some information flows for privacy, security, cultural, or economic reasons. This analysis argues that freer flows of information across national borders could help facilitate international economic growth and adjustment. Reasons used to justify policies that inhibit the integration of the world communication network or prevent transborder data flows are examined, and the implications of such restraints are discussed. Strategies for‐halting the proliferation of barriers to trade in communication and information services and for reducing existing ob...",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we explore the transfer of functional music as a social control technology from pre-digital to digital media. Muzak, the closest ancestor of online functional music, was expert-designed to improve worker productivity. Ironically, today users themselves are creating mood playlists to enhance their work performance and to manage their emotional states in everyday life contexts. We examine the motivations and practices of users by analyzing their comments on online forums and the descriptions they attach to the mood playlists they create. Our findings indicate that functional music goes through a significant transformation in online media, which brings forth both an expansion of its social control effects and the emergence of novel uses that have a rather ambiguous relationship with social control. We propose that this double mechanism can be used as a basic model for analyzing the interactions between biopower and new media.",

    "title": "Understanding the Role of ICT Networks in a Biotechnology Cluster: An Exploratory Study of Medicon Valley",
    "abstract": "Based on a wide-ranging literature review, we argue that the information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure has not received adequate attention for its role in the development and maintenance of industrial clusters. This article develops expectations for how firms in an industrial cluster make use of a public, broadband ICT infrastructure, particularly in support of e-commerce applications. We further address the question of whether ICT use, by enabling stronger ties to non-cluster partners, can weaken clusters. A case study of a successful biotechnology cluster in Denmark and Sweden—the Medicon Valley—is used to explore ICT use in a knowledge-intensive cluster context. We conclude that ICT use appears to strengthen rather than weaken the Medicon Valley cluster, and that firms located within a cluster appear to gain some unique advantages from their ICT usage that are not necessarily available to firms outside the cluster.",

I do so by way of a preliminary inquiry that seeks to explore the intersection between the emergence of mobiles in Australia with transformations in that country's sense of its relationship with Asia. First I discuss the history of the mobile phone in Australia, noting some important uses and representations that formed part of its social shaping. Second, I explore mobiles and the paradoxes of multiculturalism, and also how digital technologies became central to political culture and identity debates in Australia in the early to-mid 1990s. Third, I look at some important moments in the social shaping of text messaging, in which questions of cultural difference were decisive. Finally, I offer concluding remarks about future research on mobiles in Australia and how they are tied into Asian identities.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the model of adoption of technology in households (MATH) was developed and tested in the context of household personal computer (PC) adoption. In this study, we apply MATH to predict personal computer (PC) use. We conducted a nationwide survey including 370 households that owned at least one PC. Results indicate that attitudinal beliefs are extremely important in determining use of a PC in the household. In contrast to previous work examining adopters, normative and control beliefs were not significant in predicting use. Furthermore, several determinants of adoption that were important at different stages of the household life cycle were found nonsignificant in predicting use for the same stages of the household life cycle. Overall, the results demonstrate that the belief structure for household PC use is different from that of household PC adoption. Further, the results provide additional evidence regarding the importance of including household life cycle in studies of household technology adoption and use.",

This study aims to identify critical success factors specific to the implementation of traceability systems in China. Twenty-seven critical success factors were identified in the literature. Interviews with managers at four food enterprises in a prestudy helped identify success criteria and five additional critical success factors. These critical success factors were tested through a survey of managers in 83 food companies. This study identifies six dimensions for critical success factors: laws, regulations, and standards; government support; consumer knowledge and support; effective management and communication; top management, company wide, and vendor support; and information and system quality.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some argue that the “co-creative labors” of “prosumers,” who often work for free on social media sites, represent new types of exploitation insofar that they provide novel ways for capitalists to accumulate surplus value. For others, however, prosumers illustrate how capitalism is now dominated by commercial and noncommercial informational networks that build brand value in innovative ways, especially through “immaterial” relations of communication and information. This article argues that each perspective has limitations. By working from an alternative Marxist perspective the article outlines some of these limitations and then argues that co-creative labor and prosumers are best explored as representing unproductive labor that helps transfer, but not produce, already generated surplus value from the productive to unproductive spheres of the global economy. Through their free labor, prosumers thus have the potential to cut costs for new media companies in the unproductive sphere of the economy. The article further suggests that the “unproductive” actions of prosumers are compatible with a financialized form of knowledge capitalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The New International Information Order debate indicates the need for a profound restructuring of communication patterns at the international level and within developing countries. A key step in this process is the formulation of new more equitable patterns of national and international communication. New international policies must build on new national and regional policies being developed in the third world. Some of the priorities for these new policies are discussed, and four major tendencies indicating deep structural changes are considered. These are (1) new ideas of how more adequate communication systems develop; (2) moves to decentralize national communication systems; (3) policies of national self‐reliance and “delinking” from global communication structures; and (4) efforts to improve and extend regional cooperation in the third world.",

This article takes issue with assertions in this literature that Internet communication alters cultural processes by changing the basis of social identity and that it provides alternative realities that displace the socially grounded ones of everyday synchronous discourse. A main theme of the postmodern perspective is that Internet technology liberates the individual from the body and allows the separate existence of multiple aspects of self that otherwise would not be expressed and that can remain discrete rather than having to be resolved or integrated as in ordinary social participation. The concepts under review presume a prior definition of self as a psychological unity, when the term is open to many definitions including the one that the self is a product of varying social contexts and is...",

    "abstract": "The current explosion in mobile computing and telecommunications technologies holds the potential to transform \"everyday\" time and space, as well as changes to the rhythms of social institutions. Sociologists are only just beginning to explore what the notion of \"mobility\" might mean when mediated through computing and communications technologies, and so far, the sociological treatment has been largely theoretical. This article seeks instead to explore how a number of dimensions of time and space are being newly reconstructed through the use of mobile communications technologies in everyday life. The article draws on long-term ethnographic research entitled \"The Socio-Technical Shaping of Mobile Multimedia Personal Communications,\" conducted at the University of Surrey. This research has involved ethnographic fieldwork conducted in a variety of locales and with a number of groups. This research is used here as a resource to explore how mobile communications technologies mediate time in relation to mobile spaces. First the paper offers a review and critique of some of the major sociological approaches to understanding time and space. This review entails a discussion of how social practices and institutions are maintained and/or transformed via mobile technologies. Ethnographic data is used to explore emerging mobile temporalities. Three interconnected domains in mobile time are proposed: rhythms of mobile use, rhythms of mobile use in everyday life, and rhythms of mobility and institutional change. The article argues that while these mobile temporalities are emerging, and offer new ways of acting in and perceiving time and space, the practical construction of mobile time in everyday life remains firmly connected to well-established time-based social practices, whether these be institutional (such as clock time, \"work time\") or subjective (such as \"family time\").",

    "abstract": "The privatization and liberalization of telecommunications services have been debated and pursued with varying speed and success by countries throughout the world. In Turkey, efforts to privatize Tu¨rk Telekom and liberalize the telecommunications regime have not yet been successful. At the same time, the Internet has experienced dramatic growth. While the experience of Turkey illustrates that formal liberalization of basic telecommunications services is not a necessary condition for the growth of a dynamic Internet services provision market, the relationship between the Internet service providers and the provider of basic telecommunications services remains a critical one. Tu¨rk Telekom and policymakers have permitted the creation of a de facto liberal market for Internet services, have supported the creation of Internet infrastructure, and have established a rather level playing field for Internet service providers.",

    "title": "Exploring Multiplexity: Social Network Structures in a Computer-Supported Distance Learning Class",
    "abstract": "A computer-mediated group is a complex entity whose members exchange many types of information via multiple means of communication in pursuit of goals specific to their environment. Over time, they coordinate technical features of media with locally enacted use to achieve a viable working arrangement. To explore this complex interaction, a case study is presented of the social networks of interactions and media use among members of a class of computer-supported distance learners. Results show how group structures associated with project teams dominated who communicated with whom, about what, and via which media over the term, and how media came to occupy their own communication niches: Webboard for diffuse class-wide communication; Internet Relay Chat more to named others but still for general communication across the class; and e-mail primarily for intrateam communication. Face-to-face interaction, occurring only during a short on-campus session, appears to have had a catalytic effect on social and emotional exchanges. Results suggest the need to structure exchanges to balance class-wide sharing of ideas with subgroup interactions that facilitate project completion, and to provide media that support these two modes of interaction.",

    "title": "Alibaba in Mexico: Adapting the digital villages model to Latin America",
    "abstract": "Abstract Based on experiences in China where rural development has reputedly been accelerated through use of its e-commerce platforms to create Taobao Villages, Chinese digital conglomerate Alibaba has sought to export its vision of “inclusive globalisation” to other economies in the Global South. Its initiatives intended to reduce inequality by specifically supporting small enterprises. Some research has already charted its multi-dimensional Electronic World Trade Platform approach. However, its more narrowly-focused Digital Villages approach, currently being implemented in Latin America, has still not been analyzed. Drawing on data from interviews and documentary sources, this article analyses the activities of Atomic88, an Alibaba subsidiary in Mexico, which (initially) focused on digitally-enabled development of small enterprise. It finds that Alibaba’s nascent position in an e-commerce market dominated by US and Latin American platforms led it to follow a quite different path from the Chinese Taobao Village Model. It sought out the action areas – training and consultancy – that would not directly compete with incumbents, and worked as an indirect facilitator of local actors, rather than directly intervening. While short-term inequality-reduction impact of Alibaba’s approach could be called into question, what it has done is build relationships with key digital economy stakeholders in Mexico. These show signs of providing valuable stepping stones toward a larger and more direct presence of Alibaba in the Mexican market.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At the intersection of the attention economy of human vision on social media, the tyranny of machine vision on platform algorithms, and the emergence of hashtag publics as an immediate reaction to various global events, this article takes interest in the phenomenon of “grief hypejacking,” where users bandwagon on high-visibility hashtags and public tributes on Instagram to generate mourning content with the specific intention to misappropriate such temporarily trending public channels of collective grief for self-publicity. Against the backdrop of saturation fatigue and slacktivism through the rhetoric of #ThoughtsAndPrayers on social media, this study traces the behaviors of ordinary Instagram users and highly prolific influencers to understand how they hijack grief-related hashtags on Instagram through a variety of semiotic and textual strategies that problematizes digital mortality and the value of collective mourning. Specifically, the article uncovers an insidious shift from “public grieving” to “publicity grieving,” and brings together theories on micro-celebrity in celebrity studies, brandjacking in business studies, and grief publics in internet studies to examine the commodification of grief on social media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Videogames raise concerns about excessive gaming that lead to neglect of social relationships and obligations. In this article we develop an empirically grounded, sociological explanation for why players engage in excessive gaming. Theorizing that online multiplayer games encourage social capital acquisition, we examine if, how, and why social pressure leads players to engage in excessive gaming. Based on in-depth interviews with 21 players, we identify three forms of social pressure: social persuasion among gaming friends; social obligation in highly organized and hierarchically structured game-groups; and social coercion in highly competitive game-groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A comprehensive review of 1985–2019 trends related to the (English) term social informatics was conducted for scholarly literature, research and educational institutions, conferences, journals, blogs, and presentations at the International Conference on Social Informatics. The bibliographic search yielded 275 scientific documents with the term social informatics in the title, abstract, or keywords; which were coded according to ten characteristics. The analysis showed that corresponding scientific publications peaked in 2005–2009 and then roughly stagnated. At the same time, they increasingly spread worldwide, with most authors still referring to the concept of social informatics developed by Rob Kling. Other activities related to social informatics were mostly stagnant or slightly declining after 2010–2014, except for the number of educational courses. In contrast, the widespread general use of the term social informatics grew rapidly, especially in the context of computational social science. This is most evident in the analysis of 476 papers from the proceedings of International Conference on Social Informatics (2009–2019), which revealed a very weak identification with the notion of social informatics. Considering these findings, the prospects of social informatics are discussed in a broader context.",

This article aims to provide a data-based analysis of the effectiveness of China’s digital divide policy. While China has achieved significant progress in narrowing the interprovincial and urban-rural digital disparities at the national level, the advancement of the penetration rate has lagged behind the expansion of the network. In addition, as this study shows, not all provinces are making progress at the same rate. Laying of more fiber and erection of more towers have diminishing effects on narrowing China’s digital divide. To achieve a harmonious online nation, as sought by the Party, this study recommends that the Chinese regulators make a shift from the top-down infrastructure-centered approach to an end-user-oriented approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines value conflicts engendered by computing developments in two different institutional settings: electronic funds transfer systems and instructional computing in primary and secondary schools. Different values are most critical in each setting and are explicitly identified. In each case, laissez‐faire technical deployment supports one set of values rather than others and hence is not neutral. In both banking and schooling, laissez‐faire computing developments do not support the interests of socially weak groups. Explicit public interventions are required to provide equitable instructional access or to protect personal privacy and consumer sovereignty. These two cases can serve as points of departure for examining the value conflicts which generally accompany different modes of computerization in other institutional arenas.",

    "title": "“We power democracy”: Exploring the promises of the political data analytics industry",
    "abstract": "Abstract Data-driven campaigning has been in the spotlight over several years. Yet, we still have a limited understanding of political data analytics companies: how they envision data analytics and voter targeting, their role in electoral processes and what promises they make to their clients. This article focuses on the way in which such issues are conceived of in the marketing rhetoric of the political data analytics industry. Drawing on a sample of 19 political data analytics companies it systematically explores the ways in which data analytics is envisioned and marketed as a powerful tool in electoral processes, exposing a fundamental disconnect between scholarly discourse on the one hand – often critical of the claims of these companies about the efficacy of their methods – and a highly functionary data imaginary on the other hand, actively fostered by the political data-analytics industry and the media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article reconceptualizes the pharmacological term “off-label use” in the context of platforms and apps. It combines literature on technological appropriation with research on platforms’ sociotechnical arrangements to understand off-label use as platform appropriation. This conceptual work is applied to an investigation of Tinder, involving analysis of the platform, media articles, and interviews. Findings show that off-label use, such as marketing and campaigning, appropriates Tinder’s infrastructure and sociocultural meanings. Tinder also responds to disruptive off-label uses with changes in governance and infrastructure. This analysis shows how off-label use can locate user agency while uncovering shifting relations among users and platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Would technological changes increase the need for human workers or eliminate them altogether? This uncertainty has produced an unresolved tension, from the industrial revolution to the rise of the information society. The data center industry has been largely invisible in public debates about this question. Yet the same tensions exist within the industry itself: Will automation create data center jobs or kill them? In this article, we work inside the “black box” – the data center, to examine uncertainties faced by those who work there. We do so through interviews and observations, first, of data center managers and executives at international trade expos, where anxieties about the shortage of data center workers but also their irrelevance were palpable. Then, we turn to a remote data center in Finland, where security guards and technical operators negotiate employment uncertainties through the biopolitics of their labor. In both sites, the uncertainties about data center employment are manifest and embodied, even if they are expressed and experienced in different ways. On both the top and bottom levels of data center hierarchies, people are discomfited by the possibility of their own redundancy. At the same time, they present the sunnier sides of data center work when they talked about their efforts to resolve ongoing issues of worker shortage, the lack of diversity in data centers, and the routines that could easily slide into boredom or anomie. We situate our findings on the long arc of capitalist transformations and discuss the insights they might provide for today’s data-driven economy in general.",

    "abstract": "While there is no question that the commercial development of the World Wide Web is still in its infancy and growing rapidly, this development faces a serious barrier to ultimate commercialization. In this article we develop the argument that the primary barrier to the successful commercial development of the Web is the current lack of consumer trust in this new commercial medium. This lack of trust is engendered primarily by the industry's documented failure to respond satisfactorily to mounting consumer concerns over information privacy in electronic, networked environments. We examine how such concerns are affecting the growth and development of consumer-oriented commercial activity on the World Wide Web and investigate the implications of these concerns for potential industry response. In the short run, the commercial development of the Web depends on giving consumers the opportunity to be anonymous when engaging in information exchanges and online transactions. Ultimately, however, commercial Web pro...",

    "abstract": "When we talk about surveillance, we usually mean something that the government does, most likely to criminals. As David Lyon (2003) writes, once the word surveillance was reserved for highly specific scrutiny of suspects, for police wiretapping or for foreign intelligence. That is no longer the case, as surveillance—the garnering of personal data for detailed analysis “now occurs routinely, locally and globally, as an unavoidable feature in everyday life” (Lyon 2003, 1). For instance, family members are using surveillance techniques to promote the peace of mind for older extended family members (Mynatt, Rowan, Craighill, and Jacobs 2001) and also to manage young children’s health (Jeong, Park, and Zimmerman 2008). The new book Who’s Watching? Daily Practices of Surveillance Among Contemporary Families edited by Nelson and Garey explores the ways in which family members monitor themselves, other families, and their own border” (p. 1). Situated at the intersection of scholarship on family sociology and surveillance studies, the collection of essays in this book demonstrates that constant monitoring has a deep impact on how individuals do and do not conduct themselves. The editors suggest that “examining family practices through the lens of surveillance complicates and informs our understanding of family life. Similarly, expanding surveillance studies to include the realm of the family complicates and informs our understanding of surveillance” (p. 2). The book is comprised of 15 chapters, including an introductory essay. Very broadly, the authors present four major themes that emerge from the analysis of the family as an arena of surveillance and of surveillance as it practiced in families: (1) the dynamic interplay between care and control; (2) the relevance of technology; (3) the nature of resistance; and (4) the abiding significance of social location. The contributing authors present two compelling motivations that drive practices of monitoring: a desire to care for and protect those who are the subjected to surveillance, and a desire to control and impose social order. One of these considerations—“care”—is usually viewed in a positive light (e.g., parents care for their children). The other—“control”—is often seen in a negative light (e.g., how the state is too intrusive into our private lives). Nevertheless, the supposed dichotomy between care and control overlooks the way in which care itself can operate through the mechanism of control, including practices of inclusion and exclusion. Parents monitor the behavior of other persons, such as of nannies and ex-spouses, in order to protect their children. Similarly, decisions that exclude individuals from a family entail an element of control even when they are motivated by a desire to protect its members. For example, performing an amniocentesis on the fetus or selecting artificial insemination from an unknown donor to minimize legal entanglements with parental kin are both forms of care that operate through mechanisms of control. A second theoretical contribution of this book is the sociotechnical approach adopted by the contributing authors. The authors present the two positions in regard to the role of technology; the technological determinist position that views the technology as having an autonomous role in the production and creation of new types of social relations, and a social determinist position that essentially reduces technological developments to preexisting",

    "abstract": "The essays in this collection come out of a conference hosted by the Dibner Institute in May 1996. Each deals with some aspect of the systems approach to management and engineering, from its origins in the British and American Second World War efforts, through its evolution in early Cold War science and weapons systems, to its application to social and urban policy in the 1960s. While the precise character of systems approaches shifts over time— from the short-term operations research of wartime practitioners, to the systems engineering and analyses adopted by postwar defense planners, to the systems dynamics characteristic of civilian policy-making during the Great Society era—each adopts a relatively holistic approach to the analysis of large-scale systems, with special attention to the interconnections between subsystems and component parts. Crucially, systems analysts seek to understand the interplay of “heterogeneous components, such as mechanical, electrical, and organizational parts, in a single system” ( p. 2 )",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The history of the development of the Internet in Korea has focused on technical breakthroughs, policy initiatives, and court decisions. In their preoccupation with institutional actors and technologies, Korean Internet history studies have overlooked the role of bottom-up activities in the shaping of the Korean Internet. The reality is that in Korea there have been periods in which state control has weakened the right to free speech of online users, and other periods in which control has led to the generation of new strains of counterculture, with capacities for free speech enabled by new technologies. This structure–agency tug-of-war dynamic has shaped the development of the Internet in Korea, and scholars need to pay equal attention to top-down initiatives and bottom-up activities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The developing countries, although not homogeneous, share a growing recognition of the importance of information technology for fostering the development process. Rapid advancements in computer and telecommunications technologies offer new opportunities for improved resource management and for the successful employment of these tools in rural areas. Although developing nations have responded enthusiastically to the advantages of modem information technology, they are equally cognizant of the negative impact that reliance on foreign technology and services may have. As a result, developing countries are taking a number of actions—at the national, regional, and international levels—to ensure their active participation in the emerging Information Age.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The intensification of online disclosure of personal information, coupled with the ability to link personal information to those who disclose it, poses important questions regarding the benefits and risks associated with sharing of personal data. This article examines the manifestation of these concerns in news media. Guided by framing theory, it seeks to ascertain the prevailing frames for personal information sharing and to determine whether such framing facilitates debate on issues related to self-disclosure. Articles published in top Israeli online newspapers were analyzed (n = 609). Findings show that the individual user, the state, and corporations are framed as key actors that shape online self-disclosure practices and their outcomes. Furthermore, the individual user, while portrayed as chief actor, is seen as the weakest player.",

    "abstract": "A combination of geography, public policy, and commercial investment in information infrastructure combines to create geo-policy barriers that in turn structure the ability of rural citizens to access the Internet. A statistical study of 208 rural telephone exchanges in Texas combined with case studies from rural counties explores the impact of distance and policies aimed at enabling rural telephone connection on the presence of Internet service providers. Market territories, including exchange areas and LATAs, and the distance requirements of expanded local calling policy in Texas can both help and hinder Internet access in remote areas.",

    "abstract": "The automatic teller machine (ATM) will be for the foreseeable future the dominant mode of access to cash for those living in industrialized societies. In this article we present the ATM as a political site where a multiplicity of relationships—primarily but not exclusively between the customer and the bank—become configured in ways that serve some interests and not others. The article draws on the work of Winner, Haraway, and Latour in discussing the ongoing translation of ATMs as it occurs in the United Kingdom, with further reference to South Africa and the United States. In order to make some of the politics of the ATM more visible, we illustrate the political struggles through four interconnected narratives: (a) the talking ATM, (b) the insecure ATM, (c) the charging ATM, and (d) the cashless ATM. In each of these descriptive accounts we attempt to show how the ATM becomes (or is) a cybernetic actor that is configured and reconfigured through a multiplicity of political translations resulting in a multiplicity of politically significant cybernetic ATM networks. Finally, we briefly discuss how these narratives interrelate to form the political site of the ATM.",

    "abstract": "We find that combined revenues for 10 major media in the United States have steadily declined as a proportion of overall economic activity or gross domestic product (GDP) from 1999 to at least 2009 (the latest year for which we have complete data). For individual media, we find a generally consistent pattern in which increasing revenues from Internet distribution are exceeded by declines in revenues from established distribution channels, with the exception of television and video games, whose revenues have so far kept pace with GDP. We also report a marked overall shift from advertiser to direct payment support for the media industries over this period. We consider four possible reasons for these revenue trends: shifts in consumer media usage, reduced appropriability due to more difficult copyright protection, inadequate advertising business models, and reduced costs due to more efficient Internet distribution. Our analysis suggests we may be entering an era of a declining size of media industries in terms of conventional measures, but not necessarily a falling supply of media products themselves.",

    "title": "Cycle times of information",
    "abstract": "Abstract During the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing and related commercial activities led to the evolution of “dense cores” of heavily populated areas. Fundamental to the operation of these industrial‐commercial cores was the development of service activities—banking, risk‐bearing, legal services—which depended on rapid exchange of information or quick “cycle times of information” for effective decision making and allocation of resources. As these cores radiate resources away from the central body toward less populated areas, the need for short cycle times of information in rural areas has become apparent. For example, modem agriculture is an enterprise that requires short time cycles of information exchange. The technology for building computer‐based information networks to facilitate the desired rapid transfer of information exists. However, the installation of hardware linked by reliable, cost‐effective communications networks is only in the beginning stages. One computer‐based information network...",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate how the use of robots may impact everyday tasks, twelve participants in our study interacted with a University of Hertfordshire Sunflower robot over a period of 8 weeks in the university's Robot House. Participants performed two constrained tasks, one physical and one cognitive, four times over this period. Participant responses were recorded using a variety of measures including the System Usability Scale and the NASA Task Load Index. The use of the robot had an impact on the experienced workload of the participants diﬀerently for the two tasks, and this eﬀect changed over time. In the physical task, there was evidence of adaptation to the robot's behavior. For the cognitive task, the use of the robot was experienced as more frustrating in the later weeks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper attempts to reconcile the conflicting concerns about information as a public resource and information as an economic commodity within an information society. The free and uncompensated distribution of information can be rationalized within the context of an agricultural or manufacturing society as a means for furthering the economic interests of the group; however, an information society requires a global economy which is interdependent, for information societies cannot survive without outside support for basic goods and needs. Such a society requires a legal system which recognizes the value of the contribution of those who engage in the creative process. The paper discusses various property rights in information, including rights of access, rights of confidentiality, and rights of reply. The paper also discusses jurisdictional questions concerning the structure of information transport systems, as well as the applicability of the GATT to telecommunications services and information pro...",

    "title": "Rob Kling and the Irvine School",
    "abstract": "The Irvine School refers to an intellectual perspective on information technology in complex organizational settings that emerged at the University of California, Irvine, over the last three decades of the 20th century. In many ways, the rise of the Irvine School was synonymous with the rise of Rob Kling’s inﬂuence on the international community of scholars who would eventually form what Rob called social informatics. This essay reﬂects on Rob’s role in the creation of the Irvine School, and the ways in which the rise of the Irvine School shaped Rob’s thinking. The Irvine School began as an unusual conﬂuence of talent at the new Irvine campus of the University of California in the early 1970s. 1 UCI was a new university, having opened its doors in 1965. Kenneth Kraemer, an architect and city planner by training, had joined the UCI Graduate School of Administration in 1967. He was one of the ﬁrst scholars to begin careful empirical study of the effect of computerization in government agencies, and soon started a research program on IT and local government at UCI’s Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO). 2 In the early 1970s Jim Danziger and Rob Kling joined him in this endeavor. Jim had been trained in political science and public administration, and had done research on local government ﬁnancial practices. This perspective ﬁt well with Ken’s emerging program of study, given that ﬁnance was then the primary application for information technology. Rob had been trained in electrical engineering and computer science, and had done important work at the intersection of fuzzy logic and planning systems in the area of symbolic artiﬁcial intelligence. This was an unlikely match for a study of IT use in local government, but Rob was a rather unusual computer scientist.",

This article sheds light on the possibilities inhered at this nexus. The project that constitutes the basis for this paper is the Camfield Estates–MIT Creating Community Connections Project, an ongoing effort at Camfield Estates, a predominantly African-American, low- to moderate-income housing development. As part of this project, we worked with residents to establish a technological infrastructure by offering every family a new computer, software, high-speed Internet connection, comprehensive courses, and a web-based community-building system, the Creating Community Connections (C3) System, that I codesigned with residents. This article presents an overview of the Camfield Estates–MIT project, theoretical framework developed in relation to this work, research design and methodology, project methodology and timeline, and early results. It concludes with a set of recommendations for the community technology and community-building movements.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the broadening of the range of issues addressed by human–computer interaction (HCI) in response to ongoing trends of networked and ubiquitous computing. The first trend is the growing scale of HCI, with a transformation of HCI from focusing on individuals to groups to society as a whole, resulting in sociotechnical interaction. The second trend is the increasing convergence of the human and the computer in HCI, leading to cyborg–cyborg interaction. The article considers the social and ethical implications of these two trends, in particular, the growing importance of nonhuman agency, including not only the bioagency of humans and nonhuman animals but also the cyberagency of information technology and the collective agency of networks. The article concludes that bioagency and cyberagency are in the process of converging, leading to growing collaboration not only at and through computers but also with computers.",

While industrial robotics has found its place since the 1960s, domestic robotics wherein humans interact with social robots is still an unsettled area. After reviewing data on the diffusion of social robots and on their use, the historical tradition from which social robots come is discussed. This discussion is followed by an analysis of the penetration of social robots in everyday life and the importance of interdisciplinary research is highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Every now and then a book comes along that is both validating and frustrating. Knowledge Power by Renee Marlin-Bennett is validating because at long last someone is paying adequate attention to information policy issues; and it is frustrating because she does such a great job at covering the various policies, issues, and debates that few could come along and compete without being repetitive. I have the fortunate lifestyle choice that I get to exist both within and as an observer of the world of policymaking. That is, I am an academic who observes the policymaking process but I am also a policy wonk, someone who tries to feed into the policy process. I feel pretty darn smart because I believe that my capacity to feed into the policy process gave me privileged seating to observe the process and thus understand the policies being considered in a way that mere academics couldn’t. Marlin-Bennett’s book managed to put me in my place. She delicately navigates the world of a variety of information policy quagmires, ranging from the protection of the secret formula for Coca Cola, to the use of meteorological data by countries and companies, across to the use of personal data by companies and governments. The academic in me loves the fact that she can do this within a single thread that binds the book together; the policy advocate in me is impressed by her knowledge of these various issue areas that I at least know a bit about, and I am merely assuming that she operates with the same integrity in the areas where I am clueless. For instance she focuses on the significant transformations of U.S. law after September 11 achieved through small regulatory changes to the practices of law enforcement agencies, instead of focusing on the more sexy but less significant changes under the USA PATRIOT Act. This shows that Marlin-Bennett understands the key policy issues and the areas that need greater attention, and is not just recounting what we may read in magazines and newspapers. Her students are much the richer for this, as you will be too. And we need a book like this. Though the readers of this journal are the least deserving of this critique, our collective disciplines are certainly guilty: We pay very little attention to information policy. With our understandings of technology, social actors and institutions, and politics, I have always wondered why we seem to do so little in the area of policy. We are in a position to best understand contemporary politics ranging from environmental policies, intellectual property policies, and even anti-terrorism policies, yet so often we ignore these areas. We are leaving a massive gap open in a world in which we could contribute, but instead it is being left to the lawyers and political scientists who, while they have their contributions to make, do not have the larger understanding of the role of technology and information. Knowledge Power plugs this gap. Policy is seen not as a mere output but as a complex area that is dynamic and often convoluted. Marlin-Bennett reviews a variety of information policy domains and points to the dynamics and convoluted logics that prevail. And then she asks the ultimate question: How does the ability to control intellectual property rights or the ability to regulate the flow of personal information become a source of power? She investigates case after case by going through newspaper articles, reports, seminal academic studies, and even court opinions. This seamless trip from quotations from intellectuals and academics and then onward to political leaders and lobbyists is done with great care. And her ability to incorporate examples and juxtapose cases from countries from around the world only furthers her case that these issues require global attention. She is able to show that all the policy issues involve social constructs, the historical contexts to these policies, the role of Western rules and globalization, and the power borne by those who control data flows and influence rule-making. In a sense this book should be in every university library as the essential reader on information policy. Every",

    "title": "Online Communities: Commerce, Community Action, and the Virtual University",
    "abstract": "The phrase “online community” is widely and some say indiscriminately used in education and commerce. It seems to imply warmth and personal commitment to spaces and tools that might otherwise be regarded as anonymous and impersonal. There are other recent books on online communities (Smith & Kollock, 1998; Kim, 2000; Preece, 2000; Barab et al., in press). What distinguishes this collection from the others and how useful is it? In general, this book is broad and shallow rather than deep and narrow. It is composed of many short essays organized into three topics: business, education, and community action. As such it is most valuable for undergraduate students and others who want a general understanding of online communities. Deeper and more exhaustive study of the many facets of online community discussed in this book will require reading the sources cited in the essays or in some cases the complete studies that were excerpted for other of the essays. The editors’ goal was to bring in more voices in the designing and planning of bitspace as a civic space. Thus, they brought together some authors who are not usually in the opus of academic literature and others who although in the academic literature are not usually seen in such a mix. They also sought no homogeneity of tone or style. Furthermore, they recognized that Internet-rendered communities offered no utopian answers to civic spaces and human rights. Therein lie both the strength and the weakness of this collection. It certainly attains more variability than other collections on community as it covers commercial, educational, and activist topics. Unfortunately, some of this variability is in the quality and warrant of the articles, which are uneven and so independent in regard to basic de nitions such as that of community that one suspects that no community of collaboration marked the writing of this book. Some basic questions that were only tacitly broached are: Is there some common understanding of community that works across domains? What can educational, activist, and commercial communities learn from each other? Many online educational communities seek to be educational, activist, and commercial ventures; is this kind of synthesis of purpose possible? It would be useful for these issues to be explicitly addressed, an effort that will require, as these editors recognize, that new voices be brought into the more usual conversations. The conversation around communities persists in part because of the increasing recognition of what Dewey showed in themiddleof the last century, that social context, historical context, and culture provide the background we can never escape in our work, in our schooling, our business, and in our activism (Dewey, 1938, 1980, 1981). The computer revolution has often paid more attention to the technical than to the social aspects of computer use, and we are now in a period of backlash to this attitude with a rash of books on community in cyberspace.

    "title": "A Review of “Knowledge Sharing among Scientists: Why Reputation Matters for R&amp;D in Multinational Firms”",
    "abstract": "Prescott C. Ensign’s Knowledge Sharing among Scientists: Why Reputation Matters for R&D in Multinational Firms is a lightly reworked version of the author’s dissertation work. His study focuses on research and development (R&D) work in social settings, looking specifically at the influence of reputation on technological knowledge sharing among colleagues. Through examination of both quantitative and qualitative data gathered through a mail survey to scientists in pharmaceutical firms with multiple R&D sites in the United States and Canada, Ensign finds that reputation plays a significant role in shaping scientific communication. In particular, he finds that the “expected action” component of reputation—he operationalizes expected action as a combination of predictability, reciprocity, and obligation—is an especially strong predictor of technological knowledge sharing (or “scientific know-how”). The book’s first chapter provides an overview to the study and the structure of the book, and in the second chapter, Ensign delves more deeply into the literature on knowledge sharing within organizations and reputation as he introduces his hypotheses. Fully half the book, chapters three through five, is dedicated to outlining the study’s methodology, its statistical design, and the variables that will be tested. The final two chapters cover hypothesis testing along with conclusions and discussion. Ensign presents three hypotheses based on the literature: (1) individuals will expect their coworkers who have behaved favorably in the past to behave favorably in future interactions; (2) individuals will be more likely to share technological knowledge with coworkers who have behaved favorably in the past; and (3) individuals will be more likely to share technological knowledge when they can expect favorable action from that same coworker. Focusing solely on dyadic relationships, or interactions between two individuals, he breaks “past behavior” further into the type of relationship (personal/professional), whether the individuals have cowork or colocated interactions, the duration of interaction, and frequency of interaction. “Expected action” is componentized as predictability, reciprocity, and obligation. Additional variables collected include physical distance, geographic location, organizational position, and systems, which refers to things like organizational rules about or rewards for sharing knowledge. Hypotheses one and three were supported, while hypothesis two was discomfirmed, though the duration component of past behavior was found to be significant. Many of the results at the level of individual variables are especially interesting. Ensign found that as personal/professional relationships became stronger, knowledge was less likely to be shared and additionally, close cowork or colocated interaction was found to inhibit knowledge sharing; the data show that strong relationships in the workplace are not necessarily good ones. Although the duration of a relationship was positively correlated with knowledge sharing, the frequency of interaction was not, suggesting that individuals assign value differently to different kinds of interactions; fewer high-quality interactions foster knowledge sharing more effectively than a large number of low-quality interactions. Ensign highlights a handful of these results in a small section on implications for practice as well as a somewhat",

These inadequacies are important to consider because government policies and regulations, industry strategies, and scholarly research can be impacted by inaccurate or distorted data. Given that there are ongoing discussions about policy initiatives to improve these data, this article sets out to critically review publicly available data, identify important limitations of these data, and profile studies that have used these data successfully. In this review, the dynamic nature of broadband data will be discussed and the tradeoffs of pursuing further investments to create better databases evaluated. This evaluation suggests a more fruitful research path would be to recognize and work around existing data drawbacks, using the studies profiled in this article as examples, to explore a multitude of issues related to broadband availability, adoption, and use.",

    "title": "Competition for Technology Leadership: EU Policy for High Technology, by Johan Lembke. Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar, 2002. xiv + 313 pp. $100.00 cloth. ISBN 1-84064-792-2",
    "abstract": "This is an informative book about the making of industrial policies for high-technology industries in the European Union (EU) in the late 1990s. Lembke chooses three cases for detailed analysis: the GALILEO satellite navigation system, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) wireless systems, and Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) digital radio. The author demonstrates that no industrial policies are likely to be forthcoming for industries, like digital radio, with low lobbying strength and low potential payoffs for political entrepreneurs (Table 8.5 on p. 280). In contrast, GALILEO satellite navigation benefited from the desire of industry representatives and political actors to have a European alternative to the American geographical positioning system (GPS), while UMTS benefited from the desire of Europeans to build on the success of the earlier Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cellular phone systems without ruining their chances for marketing thirdgeneration phones in the rest of the world, particularly in Asia. European solidarity was helped by the dominance of the United States in GPS systems and by the U.S. company Qualcomm in CDMA (code division multiple access) telephone technology. European solidarity was hindered by the existence of a competing European standard for digital audio that came out of the digital video broadcasting (DVB) effort after 1993 and the desire of EU officials to avoid another disaster like the one that occurred in the early 1990s with HD-MAC (the Europeans’ first and failed attempt to institute a standard for high-definition television). I was struck by the importance of military/strategic considerations in Lembke’s account of the support for the GALILEO system and of the creation of an antiUnited States coalition of European and Japanese forces in UMTS phone systems. Regional pride over the success of GSM played an important role not just in the UMTS debate but in the rejection of more parochial approaches such as that represented by the advocates of DAB. The Europeans clearly changed their approach to industrial policy in the 1990s. As Lembke argues correctly (p. 282), there is “a new form of critical industry support in the ‘information age’ which contrasts with the subsidy-based industry support promulgated by the first wave of strategic trade theorists in the 1980s and 1990s.” This new support tended to focus on global standardssetting processes based on consensus building among scientists and engineers (including some non-Europeans) on key technological questions, instead of the imposition of regional standards to insulate regional firms from international competition. As I read the DAB case, I had the impression the EU had made the right decision in not imposing a standard and in not backing the technology that came out of the Eureka research program. Here the opponents made a good case for the need not to foreclose innovation by prematurely imposing a regional standard. The claim by supporters that DAB would help to revive consumer electronics in Europe was not credible. Overall, I found the author’s descriptions to be interesting and accurate and his explanations for outcomes to be convincing. The subject matter is complex. It is impossible to describe what is in the book without using a lot of acronyms. There are many alternative technologies, numerous and diverse social actors, and the usual complications introduced by the interventions of individuals. For example, in one of the cases (DAB), a change in the composition of European commissioners was a crucial determinant of the outcome. This was sometimes a difficult book to read, and it would have benefited from better copyediting, but it is strong on details and reports many important and original findings based on interviews with key players.",

    "abstract": "Although there is near consensus on the need for privacy, the reality is that people's attitude toward their personal information privacy is complex. For instance, even when people claim that they value their information privacy, they often trade their personal information for tangible or intangible benefits. In this article, the research on different ways in which people respond to risks to privacy is examined. They include information seeking to reduce uncertainty, the withholding of information, and the provision of fabricated information. The impact of trust and inducements on Internet users’ willingness to share personal information is also examined. Thereafter, important postulates from theories in communication, social psychology, and sociology are synthesized into a comprehensive theoretical framework for personal information-related behaviors in the online environment.",

    "abstract": "Beginning with a reading of Marx proposed by the critical theory of value, the assumptions of Fuchs (2010) and Arvidsson and Colleoni (2012) in the debate on value creation in informational capitalism are analyzed. The theorization of immaterial labor proposed by these authors is limited in its capacity to articulate a radical critique of political economy. Since the immaterial labor theory is marked by the absence of a dialectical critique of knowledge forms constituted under capitalism, it cannot advance Marx's push for a critique of the categories of political economy. The dynamics of capitalism entail a process of alienation that is not limited to exploiting the work done immediately by the producers; they also generate an alienation of forms of knowledge: the alienation of the “general intellect” itself.",

    "abstract": "Given the push in academia toward disciplinary specialization rather than interdisciplinarity, it can be difficult to find a common vocabulary or framework within which to discuss the many different forms of social and political agency that occur with the Internet. Drawing upon the work of Andrew Feenberg, (Re)Inventing the Internet serves as a short, crisp, and enlightening introduction to what is termed critical theories of technology (CTS). Feenberg argues that CTS differ from social studies of science and technology (STS) because it sees “technological worlds as terrains of struggle on which hegemonic forces express themselves through specific design strategies in opposition to subordinate groups that are more or less successful in influencing the future form of the artifacts with which they are engaged” (3–4). The politically conscious vocabulary that Feenberg has developed is most useful for those within the information sciences who seek orientation to critical thinking about technology. Consequently, the use of the phrase “hegemonic forces” immediately alerts the reader that the book’s perspective has a long pedigree, and while there is no detailed homage to the 19th and 20th centuries, including Gramsci (Jones 2006), the book’s radical intellectual orientation is clear because Feenberg was a student of Herbert Marcuse. Habermas, another product of the Frankfurt School, is also often invoked and other important names arise, including Lukacs, Bourdieu, Lyotard, and Mouffe. However, while providing an essentially fatalistic view of technology this book does not entirely despair. What Feenberg and others do in this book is argue that the capacity to manipulate and move outside the controls of the technology is possible, particularly because of the inbuilt anarchy of the technology itself. The Internet, as a post-modern phenomenon, is “radically incomplete” (vii) because of its interpretive flexibility, and thus there is much more capacity to engage in resistance, though not at all times or in all places. In chapter 2, Sarah Grimes and Feenberg take on a critical theory of digital gaming, drawing on ludification theory. The commodification of games is an increasingly important feature of industrialized life, whether in the professionalization of sports, or online activity, or even work itself. As I was finishing this review, I received an e-mail concerning the application of “gamification” (sic) to retirement planning. Thus, the commodification and monetization of online games (virtual exchange and creation, virtual currencies, and so on) collapses the distinction between work and leisure, while games such as World of Warcraft, like many fetishized objects, still play (!) with illusions of real freedom. As Grimes and Feenberg note, “Gameplay is thus reducible to a series of variables, selections drawn from an immense but nonetheless finite number of possible options, expressed in the rudimentary language of computer code” (35). Marcuse’s fear of benign incorporation and domination by larger forces of capital or state control continues in this sphere that has massive global influence (Marcuse 1968). In chapter 3, Edward Hamilton and Feenberg take on the question of educational technology as a fait accompli in universities through an investigation of the rise of technological determinism as a response to budgetary cuts and a desire to expand the educational market as an industrial process. Computer-aided instruction (CAI) was not a result of programming code, but rather contingent upon the pedagogical and administrative decisions in the industrialized university. The role of the teacher has been cut out in favor of that of the technical expert, raising fears going back to Plato in the Phaedrus. The pedagogical",

    "abstract": "Abstract Information and communication technologies have transformed the nature of scientific communication. This article examines the suitability of print, microform, online, and CD'ROM technologies for providing access to scientific serials by Third World scientists. Findings from an investigation of the technological and institutional options available to the scientific information system of Sri Lanka, a small country with a poor telecommunications infrastructure, are reported. Online is found most appropriate, principally due to the presence of a small number of scientists with a broad range of interests which makes the fixed‐price regimes of the other modes disadvantageous. Policy responses, including the setting up of an online information bureau to gradually build up domestic and international communication levels to justify the introduction of internal and external data communication facilities, are discussed. The recommendations are user‐centered and emphasize the need for continuous monitoring o...",

This research was part of a six‐nation research programme and was supported by the FAST‐II research activities of the EEC, and the Agricultural University of Wageningen. The use of three types of information technology was surveyed: home computer, Videotext, and Teletext. Analysis of the finding indicates the types of households likely to benefit from information technology in the future and groups households into three classes according to their attitudes to information technology—productivistic, hobbyist, and socially committed.",

    "title": "Internet Inquiry: Conversations about Method, edited by Annette N. Markham and Nancy K. Baym. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2008. 264 pp. $35.95 paper. ISBN 978-1412910019 (paper)",
    "abstract": "Researchers utilizing qualitative methodologies confront many seemingly chaotic tasks. Beginning with design of the study through the analysis and presentation of the results, questions may arise with regard to the ambiguity of findings and the possibility that data collection and analysis may closely interplay with each other. One of the biggest challenges arises from the fact that, in many stages of analysis, decisions have to be made between inductive and deductive reasoning, which necessitates an articulate defense of each decision along the way. When searching for resources to help with the particularistic nature of one’s own research, however, stories of how previous qualitative researchers made their decisions remain largely undisclosed, an upshot of the countless decisions any study requires and the stark reality that all of them cannot find their way into print. This is especially the case when research deals with novel topics involving new communication technologies. Internet Inquiry: Conversations About Method, edited by Annette Markham and Nancy Baym, dares to talk about these troubles. The purpose of this book is to open up a discussion about the critical task of designing good qualitative research and to offer perspective on the numerous decisions that must go into any defensible research design. The editors of this volume acknowledge the necessity for dialogue about such issues between scholars and interested audiences, regardless of their academic areas of study. They masterfully organized this book around a series of methodological questions and invited experienced scholars to weigh in with their unique insights. Employing a Bakhtinian dialogic approach, each chapter presents one scholar’s perspective on key questions, followed by two response essays that comment on the points addressed. Both primary and response essays end with a list of recommended readings related to the topics discussed, which provides a useful resource for readers. After this extended dialog with invited authors, the final chapter presents Baym’s essay on criteria for quality in Internet research and Markham’s response that the cross-cutting issues in the book are not Internet specific but relate to any qualitative inquiry. The editors thus reassert their position that the fundamentals of valuable research should not vary by medium studied: Asking good questions matters more than blindly finding answers to questions that do not matter. To stimulate the discussion on key questions related to qualitative methodologies in Internet research, six questions are posed in this book, one in each chapter: How can qualitative Internet researchers define the boundaries of their projects? How can researchers make sense of the issues involved in collecting and interpreting online and offline data? How do various notions of privacy influence decisions in qualitative Internet research? How do issues of gender and sexuality influence the structures and processes of qualitative Internet research? How can qualitative researchers produce work that is meaningful across time, location, and culture? And, what constitutes quality in qualitative Internet research? Although the editors contend that Internet Inquiry is not a how-to guide but rather a volume intended to stimulate discussion, in some places the assembled authors do provide practical advice to researchers who are preparing to conduct online research. In Chapter 2, for example, Shani Orgad suggests that researchers should take steps to ensure that their data are of high quality, whether gathered from online or offline sources. Any decision in the research process should be grounded in the questions being asked, not in the nature of data, Orgad reminds readers. In her",

    "abstract": "An object-oriented system and computer program product for mapping structured information to different structured information, which allows a user to interactively define the mapping. The present invention operates as an object-oriented user tool by accepting interactive input from a user of a source input, by processing the input to display the source input in a format for accepting and processing user commands to create or edit a transformation map of source components to target components. Interactive user input is then accepted and processed for selection of an input file to be transformed and selection of a transformation map to be used for the requested transformation. Interactive user input is accepted and processed for selection of individual components of the first structured information format for mapping, and for selection of options for the target components. Exemplary options for the target components are a null value, the source component itself, a single selected target component, or plural selected target components. Interactive user input is accepted for processing to assign attribute values to components of the second structured information format. Exemplary options for the sources of attribute values are attribute values obtained from the source components, system attribute values, no value, attribute values input interactively by the user, and content of element. Interactive user input is then accepted and processed to initiate processing of a transformation of the source input file in the first structured information format to a target output file in the second structured information format.",

Original efforts to unite computer and communication technology has resulted in computing systems that serve to replace existing communication channels. However, another possibility exists for this technology that remains relatively unexplored—communication support. Exploration of communication support phenomena in organizations can provide a new frontier for research, discourse, and system development opportunities—opportunities that span the boundaries of communication, organizations, and computer technology.",

    "title": "A Cross-National Study of Computer News Sites: Global News, Local Sites",
    "abstract": "The Internet is not only an object of and a tool for study; it is also both simultaneously global and local. In order to address how global and how local it is, this study compares the news content of 1 week from four different computer news web sites in four different countries (using four different languages). These sites use the same code base and all strive to be the same in terms of computer culture. They are global in their reach and in the news they cover, yet they are all local in terms of language and geography. They are ideal locales to study how forces of the global and the local play out on the highly connected Internet, using Google language tools for translation. Findings were surprising in that they showed very little in terms of a pattern of any sort. This is similar to a 1953 UNESCO study of newspapers, but strange in that given the passing of 50 years and the connectedness of the Internet, greater overlap was expected. Link destinations for stories that were on more than one site were also examined, and the Japanese site had more in common with the American site while the two European sites were more alike in this lens. This is also surprising, given that an East/West split was expected. Little work in this specific area was found, and this study highlights some of the questions and methodological difficulties that need to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, education reform and teacher training projects have spent a great deal of effort to create and support sustainable, scalable online communities of education professionals. For the most part, those communities have been created in isolation from the existing local professional communities within which the teachers practice. We argue that focusing on online technology solely as a mechanism to deliver training and/or create online networks places the cart before the horse by ignoring the Internet's even greater potential to help support and strengthen local communities of practice within which teachers work. In this article we seek guideposts to help education technologists understand the nature of local K-12 education communities of practice--specifically their reciprocal relationship with teacher professional development and instructional improvement interventions--as a prerequisite to designing online sociotechnical infrastructure that supports the professional growth of education professionals.",

    "abstract": "The media industry is undergoing comprehensive change due to the shifting audience and consumption patterns fostered by the diffusion of the Internet. This article describes how these changes shape established practices of video production and redefine the cultural categories of video and broadcasting. Drawing on an empirical case study of the practices within the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the we show the production of video content to be increasingly unbundled and broken down into several smaller processes, which make it possible to manage and recompose in a variety of ways that transcend established institutional divisions and cultural perceptions. At the same time and as a means of accommodating multiplatform content delivery, video distribution is acquiring flexible and mutating formats that further destabilize the perception of video as a self-sufficient cultural form. In this context, video metadata rises to be an important coordinative medium that provides the cognitive resources for identifying and managing video content within and across particular settings and the link through which the operations of media organizations become entangled with the technical landscape of the Internet.",

An API is a back-end interface through which third-party developers may connect new add-ons to an existing service. The API is also an interface for researchers to collect data off a given social media service for empirical analysis. Presenting a critical methodological discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with quantitative and qualitative social media research based on APIs, this article highlights a number of general methodological issues to be dealt with when collecting and assessing data through APIs. The article further discusses the legal and ethical implications of empirical research using APIs for data collection.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a critical, cautionary stance toward the future structure of “Internet studies” as a field. A social constructionist reading of the process of organizing reveals the ways in which apparently obdurate structures are constructed and negotiated through everyday discursive practices. Subsequent structures and practices function ideologically to control organizational members in a concertive fashion by shaping and directing the conceptual frameworks for inquiry and action in a seemingly natural way. Definitions and metaphors construct conceptual boundaries of meaning for the field of inquiry, delimiting and protecting over time what counts as Internet and Internet studies. Over time, origins of knowledge are hidden within the structure of the organizations and a culture of unobtrusive control emerges. Unless radical measures are taken to reflexively interrogate everyday routines and habitual ways of talking in academic environments, the future field of Internet studies will not transcend the traditions of the academy but will be entrenched in and reproduce traditional structures and a traditional scholarly enterprise.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A number of countries in the Global South have adopted anti-China rhetoric in recent years. Here, we seek to assess the relation of such rhetoric to procurement of Chinese digital systems. We use the example of Brazil during the Bolsonaro government, examining whether Bolsonaro’s anti-China stance impacted procurement of Chinese surveillance technologies by sub-national (state/city) governments, which are the main bodies responsible for public security. We find that there has been broad and sustained procurement of Chinese surveillance technologies across the political spectrum; both among local governments politically allied to Bolsonaro and those from the opposition. Combined with acquisition at federal level, this suggests anti-China rhetoric does not feed through into procurement realities. Nor can China be singularly associated with diffusion of surveillance technologies as Western democracies have also been suppliers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Privacy impact assessment (PIA) has attracted the attention of privacy watchdogs and researchers for decades. This study focuses on a risk model and risk identification method, which are two crucial elements of the risk identification step in the PIA process. As a preparatory work, this article reviews national and international organizations’ current templates and guidelines and finds that PIA guidance includes multiple domains but rarely provide a risk model or a systematic risk identification method. Based on the analysis, our study offers a risk model that can capture various privacy risk realization processes. It further proposes a combination of risk identification methods that correspond to the main target domains in the PIA and the proposed risk model. This combination consists of privacy principles of a given personal information or privacy rule to check compliance with the rule, and our suggested list of risk factors is useful in inductively finding potential risk scenarios that violate social expectations of privacy.",

    "title": "Incorporating affordability, efficiency, and quality in the ICT development index: Implications for index building and ICT policymaking",
    "abstract": "Abstract International Telecommunication Union’s ICT Development Index and related measures of a country’s ICT development maturity suffer from several limitations, including subjective estimation of the weights of individual indicators and sub-indices, use of inappropriate quantitative models, specification bias arising from the exclusion of potential predictors from the estimation models, and a failure to capture the disparities among different groups of countries. To overcome these problems and provide a more reliable measure of ICT development, this study develops the Modified ICT Maturity Level Index using the 2015 data of 166 countries. This index adds affordability, efficiency, and quality to the existing sub-indices of access, use, and skills. Sub-index and indicator weights are determined in an outcome-orientated way using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. We find that affordability, quality, and efficiency significantly explain the variation in the level of maturity of ICT development in addition to the previously used dimensions of International Telecommunication Union’s ICT Development Index and modified ICT Development Index (mIDI) developed by Gerpott and Ahmadi, and that their explanatory power differ by a country’s level of economic development. The new index produces significantly different country rankings. This has important implications for ICT policy priorities and provides a measure of ICT development maturity less prone to the innocent or intentional distortion of such policy priorities.",

    "title": "How information systems came to rule the world: Reflections on the information systems field",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over some seven decades, a rather mundane transition that in its thoroughness and consequences has gone largely unacknowledged, has taken place, namely the revolution in modern information systems (IS) that guide organizations in their actions. Today, it is fair to say that IS have come to rule the world. They do this literally, by the rules they embody, which dictate how much of everyday life, as it relates to individuals and organizations and the transactions they engage in, takes place around the globe. In essence, IS have become important social and economic infrastructure. Seeking an understanding of how this has come about, I review historical developments in IS, focusing in particular on accounting systems, enterprise systems, retail automation, and electronic commerce. I argue that it is transactions and their facilitation that lie at the heart of IS and its development as a field of practice. I reflect on why this has gone mostly overlooked as such. I consider where we have now arrived with transaction facilitation as infrastructure and its importance in the light of current issues. I suggest how future studies might contribute to our learning more about where we should want to be with our transaction facilitation infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ways that humans acquire information is undergoing a fundamental change comparable to the introduction of Gutenberg’s printing press and broadcast systems. Using the literature and a growing body of empirical evidence, we describe a model of information acquisition that specifies the roles of education, salience, subject-matter literacy, and navigation skills in the decision to seek information. We refer to this model as a just-in-time information acquisition system. We focus on the acquisition of health information and science information separately and discuss the similarities and differences. We utilize a national U.S. survey to describe adult information acquisition behaviors empirically.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article advances understanding of the relationship between (a) people’s awareness of and (b) their attitudes toward the ways in which data about them is collected, analyzed, shared, and used. It draws on an online survey of 2000 adults in the UK, which found that people with greater awareness of data uses hold more negative attitudes toward them. This finding is important because it challenges the deficit model which underlies initiatives that seek to improve the public’s attitudes toward and trust in institutional data uses through improved transparency or better data literacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the spring 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, the proportion of employees who worked from home increased sharply, which increased the use of digital tools. In this context, we study how teleworkers improved their digital skills. More specifically, we ask whether the lockdown was an opportunity for teleworkers to increase their digital skills and whether some subgroups with traditionally lower digital skills (women, older workers, and less educated) have benefited from a catch-up effect. Using a sample of 438 employees working for firms located in Luxembourg, our empirical analysis shows, first, that three out of ten teleworkers felt that they improved their digital skills during the lockdown and, second, that the lockdown helped to reduce the gender and age digital skill gap but broaden the educational digital skill gap. Third, training and more frequent use of many digital tools during the lockdown are positively related to the digital upskilling feeling, but not for all subgroups of teleworkers studied. Finally, the feeling of digital upskilling is inverted U-shaped in the number of digital tools discovered during the lockdown, but not for all subgroups of teleworkers studied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although stigma is widely accepted to be a multidimensional construct, the implications of its dimensions for social support warrant greater consideration. We conducted a meta-analysis of 31 content analyses to investigate the association between specific dimensions of stigma and the types of social support messages shared in health-related contexts online. Among health conditions where character stigma was greater, information, network, and tangible support were more prevalent. Physical stigma was associated with a higher prevalence of esteem support. Information, emotional, network, and tangible support were more prevalent among health conditions where concealable stigma was greater. Among health conditions where visible stigma was greater, information, and esteem support were more prevalent. Our study contributes to stigma and social support research by providing evidence that health-related stigma has multiple dimensions each with distinct implications for social support. More broadly, this project offers a framework that can be used to examine the ways in which social meanings of health conditions may be translated into digital behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We argue that the stakes of scholarly communication are changing as a result of technology-enabled ability to self-track and the enhanced provision and proliferation of instant metrics. These developments accentuate the role of the individual, and conversely underplay the collective effort, in the advancement of knowledge by focusing attention on metrics centered on the individual, professional performance, and communication directed at oneself. We suggest – in line with previous research – that metrics play an increasingly important role in configuring the scholarly communication system. But we also stress, unlike previous research, that metrics are embedded in larger communication contexts, or systems, that are already codified and ordered. Hence the discursive value ascribed to metrics must take into account these contexts. This has at least two benefits. One, we do not reduce scholarly communication to an issue of metrics and rewards, like scientometric studies and contemporary notions of the so-called quantified academic self, and two, a communication framework allows us to see new sorts of conversations going on and new modes of togetherness enabled alongside the digital nurturing of metric regimes.",

However, the affordances of social VR and how users interact with them have been underexplored. We expand the discourse on media affordances by emphasizing user agency in strategic media choices for overcoming constraints in physical and virtual worlds. We qualitatively investigated user experiences of a social VR platform. Findings from semi-structured interviews (N = 28) revealed that media selection is determined through a dynamic relationship between platforms designed to encourage action possibilities and users strategically leveraging media affordances to overcome situational constraints of their physical environment.",

    "abstract": "Many organizations have made substantial progress in solving the year 2000 computer problem, while many others lag perilously behind. With the year 2000 deadline looming ever closer, this article examines several key issues, including the nature of the year 2000 problem itself, its potential to do harm, the progress that organizations have made to date on this issue, and factors that have worked to inhibit or facilitate organizational responses to this problem. An ethical analysis of the year 2000 problem is presented that reveals that both top management and IS professionals have an ethical responsibility to act on this issue. Organizations are urged to make the completion of their year 2000 problem efforts a top priority, because it is their responsibility and it serves as an investment for the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In an attempt to make Singapore an economic power in the post‐industrial information era, the Singaporean government is implementing a series of national computer plans designed to farther the country's efforts to move up the value‐added chain by driving information technology into all sectors of society, these plans can be divided into three distinct phases with the goal of the first phase to computerize the government sector; the goal of the second phase to computerize the country; and the goal of the third phase to turn Singapore into an information society with global connections. In looking at IT (information technology) policy for Singapore, we see that the government has had a high level of involvement in the computerization and informatization of Singapore. The Singaporean government has taken a large participatory role and a smaller but significant regulatory and coordinating role in the development and diffusion of information technology throughout the country.

Through a case study of the on-line Chinese language publications, it examines the potentials of such publications in supplementing and expanding the functions of the traditional ethnic media, strengthening cultural and communal ties of the ethnic groups, and mobilizing them for action The authors argue that in the age of cyberspace, the role of ethnic media in fortifying the cultural traits of ethnic immigrants is expected to be further strengthened. As a result, ethnic groups are more likely to be assimilated into the mainstream culture without losing their own cultural roots and ethnic identity.",

    "abstract": "The exceptional performance of Dell Computer in recent years illustrates an innovative response to a fundamental competitive factor in the personal computer industry - the value of time. This article shows how Dell's strategies of direct sales and build-to-order production have proven successful in minimizing inventory and bringing new products to market quickly, enabling it to increase market share and achieve high returns on investment. The Dell case illustrates how one business model may have inherent advantages under particular market conditions, but it also shows the importance of execution in exploiting those advantages. In particular, Dell's use of information technology (IT) has been vital to executing both elements of its business model - direct sales and build-to-order - and provides valuable insights into how IT can be applied to achieve speed and flexibility in an industry in which time is critical. Many of the insights gained from this case can be applied more generally to other time-dependent industries, suggesting that the findings from the Dell case will have implications for a growing number of companies and industries in the future.",

    "abstract": "Record-keeping practices are a central means by which organizations demonstrate accountability. These practices, though, are socially constructed and owe as much to organizational or professional cultural and ethical norms as to laws or procedural manuals. This article discusses accountability as a social construction situated in a specific spatial, temporal, and social setting; specifically, it details a qualitative study of radiological reading rooms. This research focuses on the preparation of one form of documentary evidence, the radiological report. Major findings include the need to think about accountability in the plural. Multiple accountabilities exist in both record-keeping processes and the records themselves. Sustaining and balancing these accountabilities can be difficult and can lead to compromises. Furthermore, accountabilities are the result of an iterative process between the individual and organizational levels that is required to make accountability robust and make it work.",

    "abstract": ", edited by Jan Servaes. Bristol, UK: Intel-lect, 2003. 260 pp., $39.95 paper. ISBN 1-84150-106-9.Although there always have been critical and skepti-cal voices in the (academic) debates on the emergenceof a radically “new” information society (Schement L Webster, 1995; Calabrese & Burgelman,1999), those voices were not listened to, disregarded, orneglected altogether. Instead, the coming of the informa-tion society was heralded and propagated by (most) aca-demics, governments, and corporate actors alike as havingrevolutionaryeffectsonalmosteveryaspectoflife—work,leisure,politics,capitalisteconomy,welfare,andsoon.Assuch, the technologies that facilitate the real-time distribu-tion of information and supposedly allow us to communi-cate more, more quickly, and more cheaply; form part ofnewly construed myths in support of the dominant “sus-tainablegrowth”and“revolutionist”paradigmincapitalistdiscourses. Within these so-called boom visions, technol-ogy is sacralized, and the machine becomes a god, capa-ble of any- and everything, and above all unquestionable(Kubicek et al., 1997). Such techno-optimistic discoursesdefend the idea that technology as such is neutral and thatthe rapid spread of information and communication tech-nologies (ICTs) in society will cause a social, economic,and political transformation of society that will be posi-tive and progressive by default. Authors challenging thesedeterministic assumptions were often labeled as diehardpessimists or doom thinkers.However, when the so-called “new economy/dot.com”bubbleburst,moreskepticalvoicesinthedebatesurround-ing the emergence of an information society suddenlygained more respectability. Some economic—as well asstate—actors even started adopting a more cautious dis-course. On the economic side, the collapse of the “new”economy and the failure of e-commerce, especially inEurope, showed that “old” business—and especiallyﬁnancial—practices, as well as long-standing economiclaws, were still relevant and valid (Lennon, 2000). Onthe policy side, discourses also shifted gradually fromblatantly technologically deterministic to a more shadedperspective, taking social contexts and divides into ac-count (HLGIS, 1994; HLEG, 1997; European Commis-sion, 2001). Nevertheless, we can still observe a ratherclassic continuum in the debate concerning the role ofICTs in society, going from radical discontinuity to the-ses of (accelerated) continuity, and it is fair to say thatthe dominant discourse is still ﬁrmly situated within thediscontinuity paradigm.The three books under review all take a critical stance,opposing these dominant discourses, but within those crit-ical perspectives different positions emerge. The skepticalview that Christopher May (2002) defends with strong ar-guments is clearly situated on the continuity end of thecontinuum revolution/evolution. One by one he rejects themost common revolutionary assumptions with regard tothe impact of ICTs on society. The ﬁrst relates to the moregeneralclaimthatanewagehasarrived,whichwill(orhas)seriously alter(ed) our societies—economically, socially,culturally,andpolitically.Thethreeotherclaimsareallre-lated to this more general assumption, namely, that of thenew economy, information politics, and the decline of thestate. In terms of the new economy, May concludes thatmuchhaschangedandischanging,butthattheseshiftsareembedded in a history of technological innovation and a(hyper)capitalistlogic.Havingdealtwiththemoregeneralclaimofanewera,Mayproceedsbycriticizingtherhetoricthat claims the new economy is capable of inducing new",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intelligence is an attribute that has, since time immemorial, drawn the line of distinction between man and machine. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the endeavor of the former to introduce some of this special faculty into the latter. Just as natural intelligence has undergone major changes as regards its definitions and understanding, so has the field of AI. In order to encompass the gamut of this fundamental capability and know its origins, AI researchers have often had to deal with psychological and philosophical viewpoints on the issue. From the point of view of cognitive psychology, the Information Processing (IP) paradigm and IP systems are of special interest, and we present a brief overview of these topics. While the AI community claims to have some understanding of the concept of knowledge, the idea of consciousness, which we consider of finer grain than any other, has received little practical attention. These related terms are discussed at length in the article. Further, of late...",

    "title": "Media Literacy and Universal Access in Europe",
    "abstract": "The promotion of media literacy as way of increasing access to the range of services available via today's media and communication technologies is currently an emphasis in Europe's information society policy debates. The notion of media literacy heralds a shift in the communications policy arena, especially with regard to media access as a policy goal. Taking into account the situated origins of the inherited regulatory concepts of access, this article argues that the way in which we operationalize media access must reflect how individuals engage with convergent electronic media services. It proposes a context- and user-sensitive approach, where the situation of media (non)users is assessed in terms of the technological and social infrastructure needed to support their access to particular media services.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationships between information and communication technologies (ICT) usage, the benefits a company derives from membership in a rural business cluster, and the success of rural companies. Analysis of 333 rural businesses located in northern lower Michigan showed a strong relationship between (a) ICT adoption and benefits derived from the membership in business clusters, (b) ICT adoption and self-reported business success, and (c) benefits derived from business clusters and business success. Although analysis indicates that these relationships may be industry specific, results suggest that ICT adoption by rural enterprises may have advantages for the region's social capital and business success and may help reduce the digital divide experienced in rural communities.",

This study tests several alternative explanations from labor economics, industrial organization, and political economy for employment reductions by U.S. local telephone companies. It evaluates the relative strength of the relationship between each explanatory factor and employment change. The contributions of six potential explanatory factors (wages, sales, technological change, competition, productivity, and profit rate) were investigated. Regression equation models were formulated and tested using crosssectional time-series data on 50 local carriers who provided 90% of the service between 1988 and 1995. We found that digitalization and productivity increases were the most important factors in explaining employment reductions by firms. Wage increases and computerization were significant sources for employment reduction only in the short term.",

    "abstract": "In Sri Dasam Granth Sahib: questions and answers, the authors Gurinder Singh Mann and Kamalroop Singh seek to redress recent debates about not only the importance and relevancy of the Sri Dasam Granth Sahib (SDGS) for the Sikh tradition, but they also entertain questions regarding its authenticity, authorship, as well as the historical and contemporary position of this text for Sikh thought. The perspective of the book is scholarly and grass roots, as both authors have spent time as active members of the Sikh community as well as having pursued scholarly research of the SDGS at the postgraduate level. This volume appears to be released as a needed intervention into the current controversy surrounding the SDGS as well as a brief installment along the way to a larger, more comprehensive work discussing the SDGS. With a view to describing some of the less well-understood intricacies of the SDGS, it is a welcome addition to the limited number of English language volumes discussing the SDGS. This work is meant to be a resource for students interested in Sikh Studies. As the title suggests, the book is structured around common questions that many Sikhs today have regarding the SDGS. Indeed, as the preface to the book reveals, some of the 50 questions posed in this work have been asked and addressed by the authors previously on the following three websites: (1) www.sridasamgranth.com (2) www.patshahi10.org and (3) www. dasam.info. However, while it may seem that the volume is merely repeating information that has appeared in other media, the volume is important as the authors have not only revised their original answers, but also because the volume collates these answers giving readers a singular reference for questions regarding the SDGS. The book is well researched, using manuscript sources from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as well as cross-referencing issues that arise from debates about the SDGS with passages from the primary Sikh scripture, Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The authors also use illustrations from these manuscripts as well as pictures of seventeenthand eighteenth-century Sikh relics in order to support the view that they are purporting. The work begins with a general description of the SDGS, it addresses the question of authorship – a point which is revisited at disparate points in the text, the SDGS’s central theme of the oneness of god is discussed, the SDGS’s engagement with moral themes, and finally a brief synopsis of the SDGS’s contents is provided for those unfamiliar with its outline. One of the central claims of the authors is that the SDGS gives a reinterpretation or, perhaps even, a correction to ‘Hindu’mythology in order to foreground",

    "abstract": "Rob joined the Department of Information and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), in 1973. He was at UCI for 23 years of his life, until he left for Indiana University in 1996. We first met, and collaborated most intensively during those years, in the URBIS (Urban Information Systems) Project at the very beginning of his tenure at UCI. I came to UCI in 1967 and joined the faculty of the new Graduate School of Administration, which was in its second year of existence. In 1975, I became the director of the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO), which is where the URBIS (Urban Information Systems) Project took place. The project had its roots in a consulting experience with the Department of Housing and Urban Development on a $30 million program aimed at helping cities to computerize. The idea was to use a systems approach and a multidisciplinary team comprised of aerospace/systems companies, research institutes, and city governments to develop prototype systems that could be transferred to other cities. The program, called USAC (Urban Systems Advisory Committee)2 for the federal interagency committee that created it, made awards to six cities to build integrated municipal information systems (IMIS).3 To maintain good will with the losing cities, a group of us were sent to all cities that competed for the awards to explain the selection process to city officials and to let them know that, in time, there would be a technology transfer program from which they could benefit. During these visits, we discovered that some of the losing cities were doing better with their computerization efforts than the chosen cities. I suggested that USAC support a research project to try to understand why this was the case, but it went nowhere because such an analysis could be a threat to the program.",

A narrative assessment was generated using a qualitative approach based on researchers' direct observations of day-to-day operations, interviews conducted with key stakeholders, and review and analysis of official internal and external documents detailing program elements. The FTRC's successful efforts are tied to a combination of an environment \"suitable\" for change, the participation and \"buy-in\" of key stakeholders with a shared set of objectives, and the ability of key change agents both internally and externally to draw upon resources to \"leverage\" a digital divide policy initiative.",

    "title": "A “Grand Challenge”: Measuring Information Societies",
    "abstract": "Even though there has been a proliferation of e-society measures in recent years, analyses of the metrics of the “information society” are still far from responsive to the needs of many stakeholders and continue to suffer from a number of serious limitations. Issues in eight critical areas are briefly presented. They include: definition of the universe to be measured; definition of the objects and phenomena to include in the universe; need to establish measurements based upon solid theories; units of measurements; data sources and collection; methods of analysis and construction of indicators; target audiences; and purpose and utilization of measurements. An organized collective effort, which could provide the impetus for the development of a coherent academic field of study, is called for to address this “grand challenge.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article we offer the first survey-based study on the motivations that spur consumers to bully others about the brands they support on social media, a phenomenon we term “Consumer Brand-Cyberbullying” (CBC). Analyzing data from 1,203 participants of online brand communities, we find that consumers who seek to be popular and attractive are more likely to engage in CBC, while those who seek to affiliate with close others and help the community are less likely to do so. Consumers who identify with and are loyal to a particular brand are more likely to engage in CBC. Taken together, our study moves us toward a systematic analysis of the relationship between brands and cyberbullying on social media.",

    "title": "Designing Deliberation Systems",
    "abstract": "In a liberal democracy, the evolution of political agendas and formation of policy involves deliberation: serious consideration of political issues. Modern-day political participation is dependent on widespread deliberation supported by information and communication technologies, which also offer the potential to revitalize and transform citizen engagement in democracy. Although the majority of Web 2.0 systems enable these discourses to some extent, government institutions commission and manage specialized deliberation systems (information systems designed to support participative discourse) intended to promote citizen engagement. The most common examples of these are political discussion forums. Although usually considered trivial adaptations of well-known technologies, these types of deliberative systems are often unsuccessful, and present a distinct set of design and management challenges. In this article, the authors analyze the issues involved in establishing political deliberation systems under four headings: stakeholder engagement, Web platform design, service management, political process reshaping, and evaluation and improvement. We review the existing literature and present a longitudinal case study: the Norwegian Demokratitorget (Democracy Square). We define key issues in each of the four areas, which need to be understood to design and manage a successful net-based deliberation forum.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the authors analyze the popular search queries used in Google and Yahoo! over a 24-month period, January 2004–December 2005. They develop and employ a new methodology and metrics to examine and assess the digital divide in information uses, looking at the extent of political searches and their accuracy and variety. The findings indicate that some countries, particularly Germany, Russia, and Ireland, display greater accuracy of search terms, diversity of information uses, and sociopolitical concern. Also, in many English-speaking and Western countries most popular searches were about entertainment, implying a certain gap within these countries between the few who search for economic and political information and the many who do not.",

In both years, the most frequent words appearing in the paper abstracts included Internet, online, community, social, technology, and research. The 2003 papers emphasized topics such as the social analysis/research of online/Internet communication, community, and information, with particular coverage of access, individuals, groups, digital media, culture; role and process in e-organizations; and world development. The 2004 papers emphasized topics such as access; news and social issues; the role of individuals in communities; user-based studies; usage data; and blogs, women, and search policy, among others.",

Most of the literature focuses on e-government projects, usually seen as opportunities to innovate the business processes of government in close alignment with ideas drawn from New Public Management (NPM).

It outlines alternative models for e-government and illustrates them with successful cases of projects based on such models.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Between February 2011 and October 2013, Silk Road operated the largest and most sophisticated anonymous online marketplace for illegal drugs. More than a business venture, it was designed for anarcho-capitalist resistance to state power. The primary research question of this inquiry is: Can a stable market, defying the state, emerge under conditions of online anonymity? The article shows that Silk Road was built on a contradiction. On the one hand, strong cryptographic anonymity was embraced because it facilitated hiding from the state. On the other hand, the very same cryptographic anonymity made it difficult to impose rules and create a stable market. Silk Road sought to cultivate subcultural norms to ensure proper behavior in face of anonymity but they were not strong enough to control the behavior enabled by its architecture.",

    "abstract": "The ideologies of technological utopianism and national competitiveness are two common strands of twentieth century technology policy in developed nations. The former is the tendency to paint an unrealistic picture of schedule or benefits for a planned technological shift, while the latter is the use of a (real or imagined) advantage held by another nation as a justification for domestic policies. Both are techniques that can and have been used to sell technology policies to government, industry, and the public at large. This theoretical framework is used to analyze the emergence of the ''multimedia''/information infrastructure boomlet in Japan in the mid 1990s, and, in the context of the country's history and institutions, is used to explain the policy distortions that resulted.",

The dynamics of the world of scientific research were intimately related to the shaping of the network and to the way in which it spread to other sectors of society. The construction of computer networks crossed the boundaries between science and society in order to build the scientific realm by transforming the world in which it is embedded.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a new approach to modeling information flows within today's information systems environments characterized by electronic commerce. We treat information as a resource whose value is fundamentally multidimensional in nature. In this article we consider the economic and psychological dimensions of the value of information. It is argued that it is meaningless to model the value of information in isolation away from the context and the specific parties between which this information is exchanged. We therefore focus exclusively on modeling information flows rather than information itself. To achieve this, we propose a formal framework for describing transactions involving information flows. The framework consists of a generalized model for representing information transactions and for defining a set of fundamental properties of multiparty transactions. These properties are fairness, constructiveness, and monopoly. Where applicable, they are defined for individuals, transactions, and a system of transactions. The proposed model reveals the nature of individual transactions and markets, and consequently has important implications for simulation of market scenarios and to help arrive at effective policies for pricing and market regulations.",

    "abstract": "The pages of The Information Society have hosted and incubated a number of fine critical studies and discussions of inclusion and accessibility, not least on topics such as universal service, digital divide, community networking, development, and access to information, Internet, and telecommunications. In one sense, then, this special issue foregrounds questions of accessibility and inclusion as they are raised by disability. This may function as a more-or-less recognizable and indeed common characterization and understanding of disability. Indeed, the various contributions to this collection certainly do advance our understanding of the fundamental aspects of disability and impairment as they interact with and are constructed by information technologies. With the rise of concepts of the information society and developments with convergent information and communications technologies, this is a topic that has gradually become visible and legible to scholars, policymakers, scientists and technologists, business people, and civil society organizations. It still has not received, however, the sustained study, analysis, and debate it merits, so we hope the articles we present here will further this enquiry. Our theme, however, has wider and deeper implications than are usually warranted, when it is custom-",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the 2005–2015 decade, news publishers, governments, and digital news aggregators re-negotiated the parameters of control over the circulation of digital content. Using governance and regime theory, we analyze five emblematic cases—Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom—of early governance reactions to news aggregators’ practices and identify different types of strategies: (1) discursive resistance; (2) controlled drop-out; (3) one-time payments; (4) opt-in ancillary copyright law; and (5) strict ancillary copyright law. Through contextualizing and triangulating, we explain the nuanced ways in which legacy actors struggled to find adequate strategies to maintain their definitional power when technology companies first manifested their interest in the news sector. The findings indicate a link between the strength of policy regimes that sustained copyright as a normative monopoly and shifts in normative interpretations. With that, we highlight the importance of considering policy regimes’ constituencies as an explanatory dimension when studying change and maintenance in media governance.",

    "abstract": "The potential of public Internet-based B2B (business-to-business) e-commerce applications to facilitate access to global markets and to reduce market entry barriers is a dominant theme in the burgeoning literature on e-commerce and international development. It is often assumed that these applications will enable producer firms in developing countries to benefit from reductions in the transaction costs they must incur to participate in international trade. Drawing on data from a detailed analysis of 117 B2B e-hubs in the garments/apparel and agriculture/horticulture sectors, it is argued in this article that the kinds of transaction-related support services available at these online trading platforms are more limited in their scope and functionality than is often assumed in the literature on B2B e-commerce development. The findings suggest that the mere application of, and access to, technologies such as the public Internet and the World Wide Web is not likely to enable a reduction in overall transaction costs that is sufficient to facilitate entry into new global markets by developing country producer firms.",

New Media's title dramatically contrasts with the book's content, as Slater breaks down each of the three elements from a universally applicable, taken-for-granted object to a culturally constructed network of people and things that must be constantly negotiated. By the book's end, Slater challenges core dogmas in order to promote change and growth.",

This article explores people’s motivations for nonuse. A survey was carried out among 210 Facebook nonusers (113 resisters and 97 rejecters) between 18 and 35 years of age. Exploratory factor analysis of the survey data indicated that their motivations for nonuse can be grouped into five categories: platform specific issues, disinterest, time management issues, privacy issues, and social pressure. Overall, resisters were found to be sturdier in their (negative) beliefs than rejecters.",

While the social value propositions for community informatics are useful for orienting pragmatic research and practice, they are currently not well considered theoretically. Sociological theory is therefore explored to provide a stronger anchor to community informatics as compared to the narrower theoretical agenda of information systems. Within this framework, the Capability Approach is identified as one example of a strong social theory with potential for adaptation into community informatics. This would have several effects, including strengthening internal theory, and building capacity to engage in stronger dialogue with other disciplines, including sociology and information systems. This new approach to CI theory via sociological theory also allows for the adaptation and testing of other bodies of theory.",

    "abstract": "Ethnographic methods and geographic information systems were used to investigate the extent, causes and consequences of telephone disconnection in Camden, NJ. The results have significant implications for public policies intended to promote universal telephone penetration. Universal service is usually perceived as an issue for rural areas and the elderly, but the most extensive pockets of low telephone penetration are found in inner cities, where the problem is associated with the young, the transient, and ethnic minorities. The basic monthly rate paid by subscribers is usually thought to be the most important factor affecting affordability, but the data suggest that most marginal users are driven off the network by usage-related costs, and more generally by the problem of credit-worthiness. Given prevailing consumption patterns in low-income urban areas, ''electronic redlining'' seems less of a threat than that poor Americans will, upon exposure to the advanced features of the national information infras...",

I identify a number of major rationales and contexts for anonymity (free flow of communication, protection, experimentation) and identifiability (e.g., accountability, reciprocity, eligibility) and suggest a principle of truth in the nature of naming , which holds that those who use pseudonyms on the Internet in personal communications have an obligation to indicate they are doing so.

Even though there have been prior studies of information and communication technology use in vulnerable communities in development contexts, such research has not taken sufficient account of cultural and power dynamics at the coalface of social research. This investigation also examines the positionality of the researchers, including relationships to patriarchal and communal structures in Bangladesh. In this context, it examines the Facebook posts by women of a village. In particular, it finds that the desire to be seen as a “good woman” acts to regulate personal agency and expression of the village women.",

After dubbing Hamad's utopia “Cyberplatonism, “ I divide its problems into two issues: (1) Does the Internet approximate the frictionless medium of thought traditionally sought by Platonists? (2) Does the peer review system offer an adequate model of how such a medium would enable inquirers to get at the Truth? Whereas Harnad argues yes to both questions, I argue no. In response to (1), I question Harnad's characterization of Internet publication as cost‐free and paperless, noting his failure to take into account the hidden institutional costs of maintaining electronic communication networks, especially during a time of increased network privatization. I also criticize Harnad's attempt to scapegoat the publishing industry for its supposed failure to realize the “esoteric” character of mo...",

As things currently stand, it does not appear that the Internet supports either the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations. Looking at factors such as conceptions of community and social interaction, systems of meaning, political engagement, and social inclusivity can help us assess the question. The exercise suggests that while the Internet may be a factor in change, it may not yield the kind of change many are anticipating. This finding raises doubts concerning the postnationalist hope that new social and political bonds will help ground transnational projects such as the European Union.",

    "title": "Measuring the Dynamics of Information Societies: Empowering Stakeholders Amid the Digital Divide",
    "abstract": "Accurate insight into the emergence of information societies is essential not only for understanding the social effects of information and communication technologies, but also for empowering stakeholders to promptly and appropriately respond to the challenges they encounter. One much-discussed challenge that is particularly in need of analytical clarity is the digital divide, which is difficult to empirically elaborate, given its complicated nature. It is prone to superficial interpretations that suit particular agendas. To address this problem, this article proposes a methodology that integrates and upgrades the analysis of absolute change, relative change, and time distance into a general multidimensional approach. With this methodology, target audiences have an intuitively persuasive and methodologically sound instrument that could reinforce trust in digital divide studies. The approach is applied in evaluating the Internet penetration gap between Slovenia and Denmark, which often serves as a benchmark for policymaking in Solvenia.",

    "title": "Beyond individual-centric privacy: Information technology in social systems",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In the public debate, social implications of information technology are mainly seen through the privacy lens. Impact assessments of information technology are also often limited to privacy impact assessments, which are focused on individual rights and well-being, as opposed to the social environment. In this article, I argue that this perspective is too narrow, in terms of understanding the complexity of the relation between information technology and society, as well as in terms of directions for managing this relation. I use systems theory to show that current approaches focus mostly on individual impact of information technology developments rather than their mediating role in society itself. I argue that this should be complemented by an analysis of impact on individuals (psychic systems) via co-construction of the environment (social system). I then take up the question of what the role of information technology in social systems would look like in terms of the social relations of trust and power, and how this can complement privacy in discussions on impacts of information technology.",

Goals and strategies for each component are formulated. Analysis of the functional architecture illustrates a key role of electronic highways and teleports as they interconnect the wired globe and the wired nation with the wired city via computer networks. Issues of the globalization process discussed are: the electronic frontier, to build or not build, and to inform or not to inform. A future option of programmed, democratic, global knowledge is mentioned.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Our objectives for this article are twofold: first, to examine the convergence of nations with regard to ICT access; and second, to see whether countries in the same continental region (South and East Asia, West and Middle East Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania) or having same initial ICT access have coalesced into groups. We constructed an ICT access index using three indicators (mobile phone, Internet, and broadband use per 100 population) for a sample of 198 nations for the 16-year period from 2000 to 2015. Results show that digital divide has declined in relative terms, but not in absolute terms. The countries, starting at lower ICT levels, are not adopting ICT faster than the leaders. Continental region-wise analysis also shows that the catch-up is maximum for already developed countries, and minimum for countries in African and Oceania continental regions.",

With so many social resources going into the conduct of these communities, it is essential that they are designed to be ethical. This requires that we identify the parties involved in each community, that we be empathetic and sympathetic to their needs and that we follow Kant's dictum by always treating them as “ends in themselves.”",

    "abstract": "One of the reasons the proponents of expanded universal service have not made much headway is that they have not been able to provide a coherent justification for the major resource and policy commitments it requires. The lack of consensus on the very meaning of the term \"universal service\" has added to the confusion. This article argues that it is critically important to articulate a clear justification for universal service before we discuss what it should include and how it should be funded, the two main preoccupations of the current debate. It answers the \"why\" question by drawing on the literature on consumption norms and citizenship rights and thereby provides a cogent justification for universal service. A clear articulation of the rationale for universal service should reduce some of the confusion in the current debate and bring greater clarity to the ongoing debate on this important public policy issue.",

    "abstract": "Fuchs (2010, 2012) argues that users of social media produce value and surplus value in the Marxian sense. Arvidsson and Colleoni (2012) critique this hypothesis, claiming that Marx's theory of value is irrelevant to the regime of value production on social media platforms in particular and in informational capitalism in general. They claim that the affective relations and financial speculations that generate value on social media are not dependent on labor time. This article critically engages Fuchs, and Arvidsson and Colleoni, by revisiting Marx's theory of value. Contra Fuchs, we argue that audiences do not produce value and surplus value—neither for social nor for mass media. Contra Arvidsson and Colleoni, we argue that so-called affective relations (philia) do not produce value either. Instead we demonstrate that social media generate revenue from four primary sources—by leasing advertisement space to generate advertisement rent, by selling information, by selling services to advertisers, and by generating profits from fictitious capital and speculative windfalls. All four, we argue, can be adequately explained by Marx's theory of value.",

    "abstract": "Body-to-body communication has widely been accepted as the prototype for mediated communication. This article interrogates the assumption that there is a dividing line between body-to-body and mediated communication. It shows that body-to-body communication intermingles profoundly with forms of mediated communication, to the point that it becomes very difficult to tell them apart. Starting from this framework, it analyzes the great imitative capacity of mediated communication with regard to body-to-body communication, and analyzes how this similarity is destined to grow in time. It concludes that because of these changes, body-to-body communication is an increasingly evanescent prototype.",

    "title": "ICTs in the Rush Hour of Life",
    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, many women have entered the labor market in the last two decades. This development - among other social changes - has resulted in substantial shifts in the time that Dutch people spend on paid labor and \"caring tasks\" on the one hand and leisure activities on the other hand. This task combination has caused serious time pressure and coordination problems among dual-income families with children. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to label this stage of life as the \"rush hour of life\". In this article the findings of a small-scale qualitative case study among these \"busy\" households are presented. The objective of this study is to describe and analyze patterns of acceptance and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially telecommunication technologies, in the context of the everyday life of these households. The question is raised whether ICTs can be a solution to time pressure and coordination problems. Theoretically, the research is rooted in a user-oriented perspective toward technological innovation, developed in the United Kingdom by Silverstone, Haddon, and others, which understands the incorporation of ICTs into the everyday life of households as a \"domestication process\". A paradoxical conclusion of this study is that ICTs are not explicitly perceived as solutions to the communication and coordination problems these households experience in everyday life, although they are being used for solving these problems. This ambiguity seems characteristic for the acceptance of ICTs in everyday life. The domestication concept is a useful concept to describe these ambivalent and paradoxical processes of (non)acceptance and use.",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, Brazilian IT policy has changed substantially from greenhouse protectionism in selected segments of the market to a more liberal regime. This article analyses the impact of liberalization on IT equipment production, diffusion, employment, and foreign trade. There were both benefits and setbacks, depending on the aspect analyzed. Users benefited from greater access to imported equipment, which could eventually contribute to productivity growth in the overall economy.On the negative side, there was a loss of local linkages with internal sources of components, technology, and employment. The article concludes that the future of the Brazilian IT industry does not seem to be in commodity hardware production. Rather, it lies in design- and engineering-intensive applications. Such \"production close to use\" can spur domestic use as well as create business opportunities for domestically owned companies in markets not dominated by foreign multinationals.",

These changes should not be thought of as predictable, linear developments, not even as mere discontinuous functions. They constitute a revolution, challenging established notions of the research process. Conventional economics is not appropriate as a means of understanding these changes because it is presaged upon resource scarcity, whereas data and processing power are not in short supply. Other inadequacies include the heterogeneity of research activity and research tools, and the chameleon character of many information technology services, which are what each user perceives them to be. To cope with the revolution, policy developers and research managers must resort to the blunter instruments of political economy, strategic and competitive theory, innovation diffusion and technology assessment, and be nimble....",

    "abstract": "We propose that the existence of a globally and tightly connected network of computer workstations such as the Internet can lead to the emergence of a globally self‐organized structure that we refer to as the Global Brain. Associated with that structure would be the capability for higher levels of information processing that could be harnessed to build new kinds of models that would be more rapid and appropriate in their responses to ever‐changing, nonequilibrium situations. To gain insight into possible characteristics of a Global Brain, we examine some functional properties of biological brains and discuss how their functional analog could be manifested in a Global Brain. We then explore the implications of a Global Brain for simulation modeling and present an eight‐step process for constructing models that utilize the Global Brain. We review some of the tools that are currently available to make the information and simulation resources of the global Internet system accessible to researchers wishing to ...",

    "abstract": "Electronic computers in information systems are often seen as \"ready-to-use\" technology, which simply becomes applied to certain domains. This article explores the sociotechnical processes involved in the development of information systems by studying two cases of medical informatics, the Laboratory Instrument Computer (LINC) and a medical information system at a hospital. They show that information systems have from the beginning been a result of multiple alignment processes between the relevant actors, among which are users, developers, and the technology itself. The first case reveals that information systems are successful when actors become aligned and coordinated across boundaries. This alignment includes user interfaces as well as parts and components of the computer. The second case exhibits disalignment between relevant actors, which leads to an unstable information system. The two mechanisms are found coexisting in medical informatics.",

    "abstract": "I start this article by noting the lack of a sustained theoretical engagement between the discourses concerning the information society and environmentalism, and contrasting that lack with the environmentalists' practical usage of information technology. Explaining why this discrepancy requires probing, I go on to introduce and interpret a European report that brings the aforementioned discourses together via its blueprint for ecological communication in the information society. Further, noting the contextual significance of development, I argue that the report uniquely places ecological communication between development and the information society, on the one hand, and environmentalism and the information society, on the other. I also underline the report's significance in disciplinary terms—contrasting its conceptualizations with the underlying orthodoxies of the academic discipline of ecological communication [EC]. On another level, I deem the report a culmination of post-1990 European efforts at developing an eco-informational and eco-communicational dimension to its environmental policy. Here, I introduce the key efforts, outlining their contributions and the broader factors contributing to their orientation and substance. I conclude the article by illustrating the report's distinction from those efforts, elucidating the report's novel conception of ecological communication, and speculating about the reasons behind the report's continued neglect within the intellectual realm (and outside the European environmental policy circles).",

However, the term has meant quite different things, depending on the audience and the context, and these competing interpretations may in fact orient toward different policy outcomes. The goals of this article are twofold. First, the authors unpack the term “digital divide” and examine how it has been deployed and interpreted across a range of academic and policy discourses. Second, through a framing experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey, the authors demonstrate how presenting respondents with two different conceptual frames of the digital divide may lead to different perceptions of who is most accountable for addressing the issue. From this, they discuss the dynamic relationship between the construction and communication of policy discourse and the public understanding of the digital divide, as well as implications for effective communication about the digital divide and information and communication technology policy to the general public.",

    "abstract": "Users of the Internet are stripped of voice inflections, body language, and other common cues of conversation-only their words are left. Some claim that the lack of these social cues and the lack of hierarchy in the structure of the Internet provide the potential for equality in cyberspace. Many others have shown, though, that the issues of power in cyberspace are similar to the issues of power in physical space. This article examines an intersection of feminism and cyberspace in the ethos of online discussion. It is a rhetorical analysis of two popular feminist newsgroups, alt.feminism and soc.feminism. Do these newsgroups create a feminist and inclusive space online? What are the rhetorical strategies that make an online space more or less inclusive of women? Usenet newsgroups reveal the rhetorical power of these bare words. Although no formal means of discrimination is built into Usenet newsgroup discussions, discrimination does occur through the subtle and not so subtle use of language. This article l...",

For individuals and local communities, the promises, hopes, and fears associated with the growth of the Web have particular poignancy as they face the challenge of establishing and asserting their identity in a ever more complicated and interdependent world and, through that, finding a strategy for achieving the sort of future they would like to live. The Net and the Web are technologies that promise us access to the world, but they and their associated social and economic trends challenge many of the premises upon which our identity is forged. The Net facilitates the development of new forms of transnati...",

    "title": "Doing more with less: Behavioral insights for anti-piracy messages",
    "abstract": "Abstract Using the lens of behavioral economics, we analyze recurrent elements used in anti-piracy messages: statistics on infringements, quantifications of economic losses caused by piracy, and a mix of strong and weak arguments. We argue that the more-is-better heuristic used in these messages can generate counterproductive outcomes because of the statistical victim bias, the scope severity paradox, the social norm trap, and the excessive number of arguments. While “the higher the numbers, the more convincing they are” seems appealing, we show that this logic is flawed and can be detrimental for the attainment of the desired objectives. We propose to design messages based on the homo heuristicus perspective, which activate and channel automatic processes in human beings toward desirable directions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent years, Western governments have come under sharp criticism for their use of surveillance technology. They have been accused of sweeping up massive amounts of information without evidence of the technologies being effective in improving security. The view of critics is clear, but what do intelligence officials themselves say? This paper analyzes statements of intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K. from 2006 to 2016, examines what criteria officials use in their discourse on effectiveness, and investigates how considerations of cost and proportionality factor into the equation. It identifies seven measures of effectiveness in the statements of intelligence officials, and finds that cost, though rarely discussed, is the driver behind formalized evaluations of surveillance programs.",

    "title": "WiFi Geographies: When Code Meets Place",
    "abstract": "This article argues that as our homes, offices, cities, and spaces get layered with digital information networks, it is vital that we develop new conceptual categories that integrate digital and physical spaces. With that objective in mind, it examines how WiFi networks interact with socioeconomic factors to reconfigure people, places, and information in physical spaces. Drawing on empirical research from ethnographic observations, a survey, and in-depth interviews, it shows how the availability of WiFi public hotspots has opened up new ways for freelancers to do their work, often using different locales for different phases of their work. Also, for freelancers in search of opportunities for co-working, WiFi hotspots are sites of informal interaction, social support, collaboration, and innovation. The article also illustrates how a WiFi network does not map onto existing physical or architectural boundaries. Instead, it reconfigures them in a number of ways by permeating walls, bleeding into public spaces, and breaking down some traditional notions of privacy and property while reinforcing others. Such reconfigurations of people, places and information require a new conceptual framing—codescapes—built on earlier notions of digital information and physical space.",

After a short exposition of this relationship, in which the author indicates that information should be seen as one of the essential know‐how resources, this article argues the value and necessity of information for development. An attempt is made to classify the various areas where information is needed for development, as well as the information systems and infrastructures available and/or required to provide for the different needs. A number of reasons are given as to why information has not yet played the role in development that it could play. In conclusion, some guidelines are given for optimal use of information as a resource for development.",

On the one hand, the elderly do not often send text messages and thus signal their ability and willingness to use the medium. On the other hand, stereotyping by the younger users perhaps inhibits them from sending text messages to the elderly. Is the non-use of texting by the elderly because of self-exclusion or lack of exposure or both? Should this be of concern to us?",

    "title": "Who Wants to Be a Discipline?",
    "abstract": "In contemporary times, two primary motivations have driven academics to attempt to form new intellectual disciplines. The first motivation is intrinsic to the subject matter at issue: Either old disciplinary questions need to be examined in new ways (as in the creation of sociolinguistics out of linguistics and sociology) or the field itself is novel (for example, computer science). The second motivation is more political: Unlike “areas of inquiry,” “fields of study,” or “tools of research,” new disciplines (e.g., cognitive science) often command significant academic real estate and sizable budgets. This essay considers several case studies in which potential academic disciplines have emerged—or failed to do so. The author suggests that in their attempts to determine what formal status they wish their research to hold, Internet scholars must carefully differentiate between the nature of their intellectual enterprise and legitimate professional desire for academic turf.",

    "abstract": "Social metadata are receiving interest from many domains, mainly as a way to aggregate various patterns in social networks. Few scholars have, however, taken the perspective of end users and examined how they utilize social metadata to enrich interpersonal communication. The results of a study of end-user practices of social metadata usage are presented in this article. Data were gathered from a variety of online forums by collecting and analyzing user discussions relating to social metadata supporting features in Facebook. Three hundred and fifteen relevant comments on social metadata usage were extracted. The analysis revealed the use of experimental profiles, clashes between work-and non-work-related social metadata usage and differences in users' social investment, causing social dilemmas. The study also resulted in developments of theory relating to social metadata and relationship maintenance. In conclusion, social metadata expand a pure “attention economy,” conveying a much wider qualitative range of social information.",

Specifically, we conduct a Toulminian analysis of arguments made at a cross-disciplinary symposium at Duke Law School on information goods and the public domain. We find that there are two “logics” underlying arguments on issues related to information goods: what we describe as digital and analog logics. We also identify five argument categories—profit motive, economic efficiency, innovation, ethics and fundamental rights, and temporality—and two different time frames used for judging impacts—proximal and distal. We conclude with a number of theory-generating propositions and a provocation for our conceptions of capitalism in the digital age.",

Business teams are effective mechanisms for addressing the need for dynamic, flexible organizations that can effectively cope with complexity and turbulence. Business teams are not a new phenomenon, but there is a new element in the equation: the use of information technologies (IT) to leverage team effort. Information technologies can enhance team performance through support of interaction processes by providing two types of functionality: coordination support and task execution support. An agenda for action for moving forward a team‐based organization and use of information technologies for support of business teams is provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this exploratory study we examine a less scrutinized aspect of multistakeholder arrangements: the presence and directionality of hegemonic power in the language used in the stakeholder deliberations. Specifically, we examine the deliberations of ten stakeholder groups of ICANN’s policy development body. Using meeting transcripts from 2011 to 2020, we operationalized hegemony as a latent, dependent variable (HEIN) by linking stakeholder participation to the policymaking agenda. We employed a mixed-methods approach comprising textual linguistic analysis (using DICTION 7.1), principal components analysis, and an autoregressive moving average model to identify the statistical significance of key variables that emerged from textual linguistic and principal components analyses. We found that three primary rhetorical devices – participatory evangelism, quiet politics, and glorification of the status quo – were present, which reinforce the entrenched power structure that favors some stakeholders and interfere with other stakeholders’ efforts to influence Internet governance decisions. In addition, four Diction variables, Commonality, Leveling Terms, Satisfaction, and Commonality at the GNSO (Generic Names Supporting Organization) level, yielded a positive impact on the production of hegemony, and Insistence was negatively associated with HEIN.",

    "abstract": "France's early adoption of Minitel and EDI in the 1980s was both a stimulus and an inhibitor to Internet-based e-commerce. It hindered the adoption of the Internet, but it also created the conditions for a rapid catch up when France switched to the Internet in 1997. The French were already open to the use of IT, a dense network of online specialists and information service providers already existed, and many investments required to go digital were already made. On the other hand, by mid-2001 France was still far behind the early adopters of e-commerce over the Internet. This is because the French catch-up was checked by the implosion of the Internet financial bubble in 2000. Second, many Internet-based business models did not fit the French distribution channels. These differences suggest that e-commerce paths of development can be differentiated among nations, because both needs and solutions differ. This conclusion goes against the conventional wisdom that e-commerce will lead to the emergence of an integrated global marketplace in which common commercial practices will be implemented.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that an enlightened, inclusive vision of universal service is possible by learning lessons from disability. Telecommunications policy has historically built in norms that needlessly exclude people who are regarded as having a disability and therefore being outside of the mainstream. Accordingly, universal service policies focus on availability and affordability of telecommunications services, rather than on their accessibility and functionality. The article shows how rethinking universal service through disability can lead to inclusive policies that benefit everybody.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Internet is unlike anything else in the history of technology. It is neither a tool nor a machine, but a network. As such, it is a new type of technical system. It resembles the telephone system in some respects, but it also has similarities to broadcast networks that distribute entertainment, shopping malls that distribute goods, and transportation systems insofar as it opens new “worlds” to its users. What is more, the users of the Internet take on new capacities and identities through their participation in the network, most obviously the unprecedented absorption in mediated social relations exemplified by Facebook. This Perspective article will attempt to put some order in the understanding of the Internet in terms of three theoretical approaches, loosely interpreted to suit this new object. These approaches are actor network theory, the phenomenological concept of world, and Simondon’s concepts of individuation and concretization.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the changing relationship between the academy and new public formations of scientific research, which we term “civic technoscience.” Civic technoscience leverages tactics seen in critical making communities to question and transform how and who can make credible and actionable knowledge. A comparison of two case studies is used. The first is a grassroots mapping process that allows communities to generate high-quality aerial imagery. The second is an academic-led project using environmental sensors to engage disparate audiences in scientific practice. These two projects were found to differ in their ability to form strategic spaces for community-based science, and suggest pathways to foster more robust relationships across the public–academic divide. By altering power dynamics in material, literary, and social technologies used for scientific research, we argue that civic technoscience enables citizens to question expert knowledge production through critical making tactics, and creates opportunities to generate credible public science.",

    "abstract": "Introducing an econometric approach to quantify the digital divide, this article presents a new method to facilitate crossnational and in-depth sectional analyses of the digital divide within a consistent framework. It examines the sociodemographic topology of the digital divide in an extensive crossnational analysis covering six sociodemographic factors and twenty-five countries. The findings contradict in part the conclusions of previous research. Although there are differences between the social groups, not all of the tested segmentation factors mark major fault lines of the digital divide. The notions of a gender gap, an income divide, and a divide between urban and rural areas are rejected because between-group disparity proves to be only minor in comparison to overall inequality. However, education, age, and main vocational activity do indeed mark digital boundaries in many of the observed countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract What information do people search about other countries and why? In this study we coded and analyzed more than 15,000 Google searches related to France and Spain during a 16-year period, from 18 countries with diverse characteristics and relationships with France and Spain. We coded these search queries into topical categories. We also collected country-level variables to reflect the power of each country and its proximity to France and Spain. We studied the associations between the components of power and proximity of countries and their search topics. Our findings reveal that the power and proximity of the searching countries can predict much of their search topics with some specific differences between France and Spain. While economically powerful countries tend to search more for travel destinations, poorer countries search more for sports. Richer countries with geographic proximity tend to search for shopping and transportation, while poorer countries with historical and cultural proximity search more for language and education opportunities. We propose an integrative model to assess the different dimensions of power and proximity of countries and discuss the implications of our findings to theories of global information flows.",

    "abstract": "When building a Strategic Information System (SIS), it may not be economically sound for s firm to be an innovator through the strategic deployment of information technology. The decreasing costs of the technology and the power of imitation may quickly curtail any competitive advantage acquired through an SIS. On the other hand, the iron law of market competition prescribes that those who do not imitate superior solutions are driven out of business. This means that any successful SIS becomes a competitive necessity for every player in the industry. Tapping standard models of strategy analysis and data sources for industry analysis will lead to similar systems and enhance, rather than decrease, imitation. How then should ‘true’ SISs be developed? In order to avoid easy imitation, they should emerge from the grass roots of the organization, out of end-user hacking, computing, and tinkering. In this way the innovative SIS is going to be highly entrenched with the specific culture of the firm. Top management needs to appreciate local fluctuations in system practices as a repository of unique innovations and commit adequate resources to their development, even if they fly in the face of traditional approaches. Rather than looking for standard models in the business strategy literature, SISs should be looked for in the theory and practice of organizational learning and innovation, both incremental and radical.",

In making this case, we highlight the value of social informatics, summarize its principles and common findings, point to current work and issues, illustrate the three perspectives through which to pursue this scholarship, and identify several current activities remaining for social informatics to institutionalize.",

    "title": "Beyond Access: Psychosocial Barriers to Computer Literacy Special Issue: ICTs and Community Networking",
    "abstract": "Research consistently indicates that Latinos and African-Americans are less likely to own and use computers than either Caucasians or Asians. While conventional wisdom holds that high computer costs and lack of access are the primary reasons for this discrepancy, my ethnographic research with 100 low-income adults reveals three non-cost-related psychosocial obstacles that significantly undermine motivation for acquiring computer skills: “relevance,” “fear,” and “self-concept.” My research thus suggests that a more complex relationship exists between ethnicity, identity, and attitudes associated with computers than previously examined; this relationship may better explain why some people are choosing not to use computers at this time. My research also indicates that while community technology centers (CTCs) play an important role in helping adults overcome their resistances and achieve computer literacy, they are presently an underutilized resource—less than 5% of San Diegans use them to meet their computing needs. Hence, my research also questions why more residents do not avail themselves of these community resources. I conclude that efforts to increase computer literacy in underserved communities must go beyond physical access and connectivity and consider the role of cultural factors.",

    "abstract": "In this article we focus on the challenges we have encountered in attempting to support the development of an online community of practice for grade 5-12 mathematics and science teachers. Specifically, this project involves the design and evaluation of an electronic knowledge network, the Inquiry Learning Forum (ILF), a web-based professional development system designed to support a community of practice (CoP) of in-service and preservice mathematics and science teachers who are creating, reflecting upon, sharing, and improving inquiry-based pedagogical practices. This research examines the interplay among a variety of variables that characterize the dynamics of building a social network through which participating teachers will seek to share and improve their pedagogical practices. Our research suggests that designing for virtual communities involves balancing and leveraging complex dualities from the \"inside\" rather than applying some set of design principles from the \"outside.\" This research provides an illuminative case study from which others can more readily identify patterns occurring in their own interventions and navigate the challenges they face more intelligently.",

    "abstract": "Significant U.S. policy initiatives in the late 1990s were intended to control Internet access, privacy, and indecency--specifically among children. This study reflects on these using quantitative data from a computer center in a children's library in the inner city. Researchers gathered 16 weeks of page requests ( n = 203,647) using \"click stream\" and behavioral data, and analyzed these using nonparametric tests. Findings show that users are highly influenced by each other and browse only a small universe of sites. Game playing and communicating with individuals (via e-mail and chat) were the most popular uses. Children were uninterested in pornography and sites directed toward children. Advertising was extremely common. Children were most likely to engage in sharing when using games and chat. For this population, access, privacy and indecency initiatives to control Internet use fails to achieve its stated goals, but activities that encourage sharing in public places hold some promise for building computer knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Critics have argued that information and communication technologies (ICTs) disconnect people from their social networks and reduce public participation. Research in support of this perspective has been biased by two assumptions. The first is a tendency to privilege the Internet as a social system removed from the other ways people communicate. The second is a tendency to favor broadly supportive strong social ties. Survey and ethnographic observations from Netville, a 2-year community networking experiment, suggest that weak, not strong ties experience growth as a result of ICTs. By examining a unique and underexplored stage in the life cycle of a community networking project, the end of a networking trial, this article demonstrates how ICTs facilitate community participation and collective action (a) by creating large, dense networks of relatively weak social ties and (b) through the use of ICTs as an organizing tool.",

The expansion fuels new patterns of use, which require changes, while on the other hand, the diffusion of and investments in the information infrastructure have a strong, conservative influence-the intertia of the installed base. The changes required to implement the scaling have to be in small steps. An information infrastructure is not ''changed,'' but rather it undergoes transitions. These transitions are highly involved sociotechnical negotiations. This article is based on a case study of the efforts to change the Internet Protocol (IP) in the Internet to facilitate further growth. The revision of IP is the most serious challenge to the continued scaling of the Internet during its nearly 30 years of existence.",

Contemporary literature abounds with ideologically biased accounts of on-line interaction that hinder the emergence of a coherent analytical framework. Scholarly work on computer-mediated communicative play remains underdeveloped. Through an empirically grounded theoretical orientation, this study aims to identify and illustrate processes and elements central to the emergence of self in on-line chat environments. By use of an e-mail survey, participant observation, content analysis, and open-ended interviews, the social nature of on-line interaction is illustrated and identified as significantly more than the technological sum of the medium. Findings indicate that through on-line chat-interaction a ''cyberself'' emerges, rooted in a unique form of communication that is disembodied, dislocated, anonymous, multiple-simultaneous, and faceless. Each of these elements introduces new possibilities to ...",

The interpersonal dynamics of these groups are increasingly coming under the scrutiny of academic research. The publicly available archived records of Internet virtual communities are being analyzed for a wide variety of research interests. The ability to do naturalistic observations of group dynamics, as they are exhibited in these exchanges of text, has captured the attention of many researchers. The institutional review boards of major universities are granting researchers exempt or expedited (exempt from full review) status for this work, due to the public nature of the notes being analyzed.

    "abstract": "In studying on-line communities, researchers must consider the unique environmental factors involved in order to minimize potential harm to human subjects. In particular, the often commented upon disinhibiting effect of computer-mediated communication can encourage people to agree to or even insist on a kind of public exposure by which they may eventually be harmed. On the Internet, where perceptions of interpersonal affect and effects may be obscured by the nature of the medium itself, care must be taken to guard against not only any increased tendency for researchers to objectify subjects, but also the tendency for subjects to underestimate the potential consequences of consent. The criteria for informed consent that may be sufficient in face-toface research environments are not necessarily so in a medium in which subjective experience is easily objectified and information is easily devalued.",

In this study, World Internet Project survey data were submitted to multi-group latent variable analysis and tested for configural and measurement invariance to illustrate why these tests might be important in cross-national comparisons. It was found that while the general Internet use constructs were applicable across national contexts, the way in which the items contributed was different.",

    "abstract": "The development of individuals’ digital skills has received much attention as a remedy for digital inequality. Although some researchers favor courses and guided learning for skills development, others propose learning by trial-and-error. Unfortunately, studies examining the value of the so-called “do-it-yourself approach” for the development of digital skills remain lacking. One difficulty lies in the vicious circle of lack of skill leading to infrequent Internet usage and vice versa, which limits the value of cross-sectional data for assessing the impact of this approach. We present longitudinal data on a random sample of Internet users in a Dutch city, which show that more frequent Internet use leads to more digital skills, but not the other way around. However, contrary to expectations about the potential of trial-and-error learning to reduce inequality, results also suggests that this approach is not always more beneficial to the “have-little” as compared to the “have-more.” The only inequality-reducing effect of this approach is that that older users profit more from it than younger users do.",

    "abstract": "In this article we highlight temporal effects in information and communication technology-enabled organizational change. Examples of temporal effects are explored in the context of one organization's efforts to implement an enterprise-wide information system. Temporality is presented as having two aspects, with the first being the well-recognized, linear and measured clock time. The second aspect of time is that which is perceived--often as nonlinear--and socially defined. We find that temporal effects arise both in changes to the structure of work and in differences among groups in how time is perceived. Evidence suggests that both specific characteristics of the implementation and of the enterprise systems' technologies further exacerbate these temporal effects. We conclude with suggestions for how to incorporate a temporally reflective perspective into analysis of technology-enabled organizational change and how a temporal perspective provides insight into both the social and technical aspects of the sociotechnical nature of enterprise systems.",

    "title": "“Go Away”: Participant Objections to Being Studied and the Ethics of Chatroom Research",
    "abstract": "In this article we present an empirical study aimed at better understanding the potential for harm when conducting research in chatrooms. For this study, we entered IRC chatrooms on the ICQ network and posted one of three messages to tell participants that we were recording them: a recording message, an opt-in message, or an opt-out message. In the fourth condition, we entered the chatroom but did not post a message. We recorded and analyzed how subjects responded to being studied. Results of a regression analysis indicate significantly more hostility in the three conditions where we said something than in the control condition. We were kicked out of 63.3% of the chatrooms we entered in the three message conditions compared with 29% of the chatrooms in the control condition. There were no significant differences between any of these three conditions. Notably, when given a chance to opt in, only 4 of 766 potential subjects chose to do so. Results also indicate significant effects for both size and the number of moderators. For every 13 additional people in a chatroom, the likelihood getting kicked out was cut in half. While legal and ethical concerns are distinct, we conclude by arguing that studying chatrooms constitutes human subjects research under U.S. law, but that a waiver of consent is appropriate in most cases as obtaining consent is impracticable.",

    "abstract": "Interactivity has been identified as a core concept of new media, yet despite nearly three decades of study and analysis, we scarcely know what interactivity is, let alone what it does, and have scant insight into the conditions in which interactive processes are likely to be consequential for members of a social system. This article attempts to address this deficiency by critiquing three self-defeating tendencies and an erroneous assumption of interactivity research, then proposes four basic propositions around which systematic knowledge regarding interactivity in society may be built. In the spirit of bridging mass and interpersonal processes, a model of interactivity is proposed to initiate discussion about the concept as a cross-level and multivalent phenomenon—one with both positive and negative consequences—and to spur more socially relevant research. For interactivity to succeed as a concept, it must have some meaningful social and psychological relevance beyond its technical status as a property of media systems or message exchanges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Search engines are one of the most trusted and used sources of political information. Yet there is limited research on how often people search for political topics in the real world, the search strategies they use to find information, and the results people select. We use a combination of survey and online behavioral data to illuminate how often people search for political content, what queries they use, how autocomplete affects political queries, how searches vary by political characteristics, and what types of results people view. We holistically investigate the political search process of 45 politically diverse individuals in the U.S., selected from a larger sample of 564, by observing 6-months of their online behavior. While politically interested people do most political searching and tend to favor their own side in the queries they compose and the results they visit, it is not overwhelmingly so. In fact, there is a substantial amount of cross-party searching and result visiting. Autocomplete and trending topics play a small role in political search overall. People visit a wide variety of results after searching for political information beyond national news sites. These findings extend our understanding of political search and have both theoretical and practical implications.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the relevance of social engineering for the postindustrial epoch. The concept of social engineering has been dormant in recent years, stained by the behavior of police states in the 20th century. Yet stripped of its excesses, social engineering still represents a defensible moral and political enterprise. What is needed for the 21st century, however, is a chastened, deontological theory of social engineering, one that accepts the inviolability of the person while still pursuing ambitious long-term teleological strategies through state action. For its content, progressive information society policy should revisit the ethical norms developed by the left-liberal tradition, as articulated by the late John Rawls and others. The article concludes that the information age offers a new opportunity to engineer a just social order, or, at any rate, that the policymaking community needs to reevaluate the idea of social engineering.",

    "abstract": "Using population census data since 1921, this article traces changes in employment and occupational structure in Singapore in the past 80 years. This is a follow-up to an earlier paper by Kuo and Chen (1987) that reported the nascent formation of the information society in Singapore till the 1980s. It also makes an assessment of the role of proactive government policies in directing industrial restructuring and occupational changes in this city-state. It is found that the long-term growing trend in information-related occupations has been in tandem and supportive of industrial changes in Singapore. One more wave of growth of information producers (and certainly, innovators) and information distributors is expected in the next couple of decades. The momentum has started, and competition from regional countries similarly aspiring to be information and knowledge economies will quicken the pace. The government has initiated fundamental changes in the educational system to meet the challenges of the knowledge-based economy. The small city-state has also long adopted an adaptive philosophy to be responsive to the ever-changing environment, either in technology or in regional politics. Based on the trend analysis, it is expected that the emergent information society will graduate into full status when Singapore attains a developed country status in the forthcoming decades.",

We find that having a home computer is associated with higher test scores in mathematics and reading, even after controlling for family income and for cultural and social capital. However, children from high socioeconomic status (SES) homes achieve larger educational gains from home computers than do lower SES children. Boys' performance advantage is larger than girls'. Ethnic minorities gain far less of a performance boost than whites. Home computing may generate another ''Sesame Street effect'' whereby an innovation that held great promise for poorer children to catch up educationally with more affluent children is in practice increasing the educational gap between affluent and poor, between boys and girls, and between ethnic minorities and whites, even among those with access to the technology.",

    "title": "Singapore's Dilemma: Control versus Autonomy in IT-Led Development",
    "abstract": "A frequently debated question is whether technology molds society or is molded by it. From the  rst perspective, known as a determinist view of technology (Ebersole, 1995), the Internet carries with it certain types of values, organization, and social structure that will inevitably impact society. From the second perspective, known as an instrumental view of technology (see discussion in Feenberg, 1991), technologies such as the Internet are “pure instrumentality” (Feenberg, 1991, p. 5), indifferent to the ends to which they are employed. This is closely connected to the issue of potential political impact of the Internet. A determinist perspective might predict that introduction of the Internet (with its means of decentered communication)would inevitably democratize government. In contrast, an instrumental perspective suggests that state authorities can wield the Internet to their own purposes, even using it to increase centralized control. The most extensive empirical study of computerization and political control was carried out by Danziger, Dutton, Kling, and Kraemer (1982), whose analysis of data from some 500 U.S. cities and counties indicated that computerization tended to reinforce the power and in uence of those already in authority. However, such research has not yet been replicated internationally, nor has similar research been conducted on the impact of introducing the Internet. One important test case for understanding the relationship of information and communication technologies and democratization is Singapore. This city-state stands out internationally in two regards. First, the country’s leaders exert a level of social and political control that is unique among wealthy nations. And second, those same leaders are engaged in one of the most far-reaching attempts to infuse information technology in society and make their",

The Inclusive New Media Design (INMD) project brought together thirty-one Web designers and developers with twenty-nine people with intellectual disabilities to explore the best practice for building Web sites accessible to the ID community. Specifically, the project took accessibility techniques identified in ID accessibility research, and investigated what would (or would not) make it possible for Web professionals to implement them. This article suggests some tentative answers to the question of whether a fully accessible Web can be built, one that includes people with ID. While the article outlines simple steps that can be taken to facilitate accessibility for people at the mild end of the ID spectrum, it also highlights a number of barriers that exist to implementing ID accessibility guidance, most notably the power holders and decision makers with whom Web designers work, who may not share the designers’ commitment to accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Internet and other digital technologies have opened up new channels and methods for online business. They have also led to a situation where the same channels can be abused and misused. One of these forms of technology abuse, which is becoming increasingly prevalent these days, is the piracy of digital content. This article introduces a relatively comprehensive and unified theoretical framework for studying and understanding a major aspect of digital piracy: namely, software piracy. Based on Routine Activities Theory, Rational Choice Theory, and guardianship concepts, the framework identifies key parameters that can affect the incidence of software piracy. We apply the framework in conducting a systematic examination of 75 articles dealing with software piracy. The examination reveals that a considerable number of parameters have received little or no attention from software-piracy researchers. In addition to suggesting research opportunities, the framework furnishes a systematic approach for structuring the design of future research studies in the realm of software piracy. The insights furnished by this article contribute to future investigations of the software-piracy phenomenon that are needed to avert the economic and social damage caused by software piracy.",

    "title": "The Pre-Internet Downloading Controversy: The Evolution of Use Rights for Digital Intellectual and Cultural Works",
    "abstract": "This article describes and explains the shift in the database industry's treatment of downloading. Downloading began as an unwanted by-product of new technology and became a product feature. The authors explain this shift in terms of shifts in “use-regimes,” or changes to market practices, legal rules, user expectations, and technology-based tools that shape the use of intellectual and cultural property. In the early 1980s, citation database users did not have the right to “download,” or save, citations from bibliographic databases, but by the early 1990s, citation database publishers had partnered with bibliographic citation software developers (e.g., ProCite) to make easy downloading of citations a product feature. In this article, the authors tell both the lost story of the pre-Internet downloading controversy and how and why the meaning of downloading changed over a twenty-year period. In doing so, they present a theoretical framework that is useful for analyzing changes in use rights for a variety of types of intellectual and cultural goods. Finally, the authors compare lessons from this historical case study to contemporary use right debates in the intellectual and cultural property literature.",

    "title": "The Role of Social Culture in Internet Adoption in Greece: Unpacking “I Don't Want to Use the Internet” and Frequency of Use",
    "abstract": "This article examines the role of social culture in Internet adoption in Greece. It employs Hofstede's five-dimensional framework of national culture and analyzes the European Social Survey 2008 data. It finds that social culture in general and particularly people's past or future orientation in life, and to a lesser extent their degree of openness to difference and novelty in life, are significant drivers of Internet adoption in Greece. It argues that the persistently low level of Internet adoption in Greece can be explained by pointing to a traditional, uncertainty-avoidant, and novelty-resistant culture that discourages technological development and innovation. It concludes that to explain that the statement “I don't want to use the Internet” and frequency of use and other such behavioral patterns, one should look beyond demographics, practical, and real-life factors and examine broader and socioculturally embedded drivers of Internet adoption.",

    "abstract": "Usenet is an international communications system composed of thousands of topically named discussion groups, called newsgroups, which enable anyone with an Internet connection and the proper software to read messages, post new messages, or reply to existing ones. Remarkable for its culture of ''anything-goes'' free speech, Usenet tradition recognizes only one kind of legitimate restriction on content: that which is abusive to the Net's ability to function as an effective discussion system. This article shows that this consensus stems from a long and often painful struggle, as Usenet's designers, administrators, and users attempted to comprehend, define, and govern the communication system they had created. The result is a forum that is not quite as free as Usenet's defenders like to imagine, and one given to excesses that seem destined to attract the attention of government censors.",

This article examines his contribution to social informatics through an analysis of the multiple theories, methods, and sources of evidence he relied on to make his arguments about the social life of computing and the consequences of computerization. His citation identity demonstrates that he transcended disciplinary boundaries but grounded his analysis of the political and social order in interpretive theory and critique. Kling created a working vocabulary for theorizing about computerization and social life. His sustained inquiry and critique, a very public record of his work, enthusiasm, and charisma, contributed to the penetration of his ideas and the fostering of a world-wide community of interest for a domain of study called social informatics.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of the concept of communities is growing and so are ideas on how to support these communities with technologies. We can find this particularly in the field of management and organization studies, in which communities are more and more seen as a solution for rigid, hierarchical and conservative bureaucratic structures. In fact, communties can be seen as the latest wave in an ongoing evolution of organizational structures (Wenger, 2000, Lesser, 2000). In the age-old traditional functional organization, concentration of expertise was (and still is) under hierarchical control. In the decades after World War II, and in specific during the seventies, the multi-divisional organization was seen as the answer to the ever-expanding functional organization. Business units were introduced as an organizational structure alternative to the functional division. A decade later, project-based organization entered the organizational landscape. Project teams were designed in order to be closer to the market. Since the mid-nineties, knowledge based organizations have overshadowed the project-based organization, at least that is what popular business press tells us. Communities instead of teams are the dominant structure of the organization, also coined as communities of communities (Brown and Duguid, 1991). Communities differ notably from conventional units of organization, such as teams or work groups. Group theory in general (Hackman, 1990) perceives groups in an organization, as",

To throw some light on these questions, first the use and limitations of conversational agents (natural language interfaces) are discussed. Then some aspects of the experience of families living in a smart house are described, and compared with that of employers of servants in 19th-century Britain. On the basis of this research it appears that people do not want household devices to be very human, and do not want to give them much autonomy. Designers are recommended to observe two rules: Smart domestic devices should put people firmly in control and should as far as possible be unseen and unheard.",

Generally referred to as broadband, a number of alternative technologies are now deployed broadly across the United States. This article utilizes a unique data set of 9000 survey responses generated by the Pew Internet and American Life Project in 2004 to examine the impact of several spatial factors, including population size and economic structure, on the likelihood of broadband utilization, after controlling for a set of demographic characteristics. The utilization of broadband is found to be greater with larger cities and in cities with large telecommunications-intensive economic sectors. However, demographic characteristics are also found to be quite significant and relatively stronger than geographic factors in determining broadband utilization.",

Each of these four—relations, markers, obduracy, and actions—are significant for and constitutive of memory. The argument is thus antirepresentational, suggesting that the world is perfectly capable of representing itself, and that our understanding of the world is immanent in the world and its relations.",

How are practices of online memorialization connected to conventional rituals of grief and mourning? What is the role of online digital identity postmortem? How do trajectories of death and dying incorporate both online and offline concerns? Based on our qualitative study of death and mourning online, we identify the way that social networking sites enable expansion—temporally, spatially, and socially—of public mourning. Rather than looking at online practices as disruptions of traditional practices of grief and memorialization, we examine them as new sites in which public mourning takes place.",

    "title": "Mobile Phones and the Cultural Ecology of Fishing in Kerala, India",
    "abstract": "Studies that go beyond the ICT4D (Information and Communication Technologies for Development) framework emphasize the social and cultural dimensions of mobile phones. Nevertheless, the cultural dimension, in literature pertaining to both urban and rural use patterns, typically takes an individualistic orientation. The possibility of actualizing the collectivistic logic in a community's appropriation of new technologies is mostly overlooked. The present article explores how the fishers community in Kerala, India, use mobile phones in culturally enhancing and ecologically oriented ways that improve their working and living conditions. In the case of Kerala fishers, the impulse toward cooperation has long been ingrained in their culture, as often happens among marginalized groups. The availability of mobile technologies has allowed for the amplification of this impulse and enabled new modes of cooperation, especially in sharing of information on promising fishing spots and safety and rescue at sea.",

    "title": "Network Organizations: Symmetric Cooperation or Multivalent Negotiation?",
    "abstract": "Abstract The network model of organization plays a central role in recent sociological accounts of the information economy. This model is also often presented in organization and information and communication technologies (ICT) literature with an air of enthusiasm that underscores its advantages—flexibility, cooperative culture, innovativeness, and knowledge and technology intensity. Such themes are usually based on a “networking logic” that assumes the trustful cooperation of large and small production firms in a rapidly changing economic environment. We believe that both the logic and the themes based upon it are too narrow to be able to explain the complex dimensions of interorganizational networking. Using Enron as a case study, our goal in this article is to enrich the logic just described and to develop an extended model of the network enterprise. We argue that this is only possible by extending the unit of analysis beyond the production firm, to include, among others, subsidiaries, banks, investors, auditors, and government agencies. The proposed extended model allows the broadening of many of the aforementioned themes, making it possible to arrive at a realistic picture of the complexities of the network enterprise. The managerial advantages of the model are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The World Wide Web possesses unique characteristics that distinguish it in important ways from traditional commercial communications environments. Because the Web presents a fundamentally different environment for marketing activities than traditional media, conventional marketing activities are becoming transformed, as they are often difficult to implement in their present form. In this article, we discuss the idea that these changes portend an evolution in the ''marketing concept'' and argue that in order for marketing efforts to be successful in this new medium, a new business paradigm is required. In this new approach, the marketing function must be reconstructed to facilitate electronic commerce in the emerging electronic society underlying the Web.",

    "title": "Making Privacy Impact Assessment More Effective",
    "abstract": "Europe's proposed Data Protection Regulation is expected to make data protection impact assessment (DPIA) mandatory, a development that could impact hundreds of thousands of organizations (both governmental and private sector) in Europe, as well as non-European entities offering their wares and services there. This article reviews the DPIA provisions outlined in the new regulation. For the nuts and bolts of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) methodology, Europe could select features from the PIA methodologies used in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the countries with the most experience in PIA. A European Commission (EC)-funded project, called PIAF, reviewed these various methodologies and proposed an “optimized” PIA for Europe (and elsewhere) based on the best practices of the aforementioned countries. Based on these best practices, this article outlines a 16-step PIA process. It argues that while some organizations may regard a PIA as a hassle, in fact, a PIA offers many benefits, as spotlighted in the article.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We investigate youths' conceptualization of social robots. Informed by Schudson's theory of the potency of the cultural object, we conducted two studies. The first study centered on essays on social robots written by bachelor's and master's students. The second study centered on prototypes of social robots built by small groups comprised of same students. The essays and prototypes were content analyzed. The results confirm that social robots embody all five dimensions that characterize cultural objects. However, to fully understand this peculiar cultural object, another dimension needs to be introduced: dynamicity.",

The company supplies information technology solutions for data integration and tracking to police and government agencies, humanitarian organizations, and corporations. To illuminate and learn more about Palantir’s opaque surveillance practices, we begin by sketching Palantir’s company history and contract network, followed by an explanation of key terms associated with Palantir’s technology area and a description of the firm’s platform ecosystem. We then summarize current scholarship on Palantir’s continuing role in policing, intelligence, and security operations. Our primary contribution and analysis are a computational topic modeling of Palantir’s surveillance patents (n = 155), including their topics and themes. We end by discussing the concept of infrastructuring to understand Palantir as a surveillance platform, where we theorize information standards like administrative metadata as phenomena for structuring social worlds in and through access to digital information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we investigate how Twitter’s switch from a reverse-chronological timeline to algorithmic content selection in March 2016 influenced user engagement with tweets published by German newspapers. To mitigate concerns about omitted variables, we use the Facebook postings of these newspapers as a counterfactual. We find that the number of likes increased by 20% and the number of retweets by 15% within a span of 30  days after the switch. Importantly, our results indicate a rich-get-richer effect, implying that initially more popular outlets and news topics benefited the most. User engagement also increased more for sensationalist content than quality news stories.",
