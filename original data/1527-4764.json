    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last decade, there has emerged a certain discourse about Miami as “the Hollywood of Latin America,” or even as “the cultural capital,” not just of Latin America, but also of the Spanish-speaking population of the United States. This article examines the basis and extent of Miami's status specifically within the international trade in the production and distribution of Spanish-language television programs and services in the Americas as a whole geolinguistic region. Miami serves as a reminder of the degree to which geospatial features still exert their gravitational pull upon the much-vaunted “deterritorialization” of communication media, yet what appears to be unique about Miami is the combination of cultural as well as locational and economic factors which it offers the rapidly internationalizing Spanish-language television industry. As such, it provides an interesting case for evaluating the relative significance of cultural vis-à-vis economic factors in the making of such an industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this short piece, I discuss the necessity of employing more-than-textual methods to understand more-than-textual phenomena. My case study is the feminized world of wellness, where stylish young entrepreneurs sell strategies of health-enhancement. While existing commentary typically frames wellness as the exclusive and somewhat risible preserve of wealthy white women—a framing enabled by the prominence of figures such as Gwyneth Paltrow—this narrative risks obscuring a more complicated story about the desire for health and well-being in an era of heightened precarity. Against this backdrop, I argue that the rise of wellness as a novel cultural formation and new commercial development must be situated within the broader social, economic, and political terrain of contemporary Britain. Methodologically, this means grappling with the glamorous trappings of wellness media and excavating the psychic investments and embodied experiences that animate this movement-market. </jats:p>",

Yet the military is simultaneously relying more on weight-loss and training practices originating in the commercial sector, including those found on TV, due to perceived “softness” and “fatness” within its ranks. This article thus examines the military-inspired disciplinary logics both reinforced and inadvertently challenged across weight-loss reality TV programs, the “fattening” and commercialization of the military, and the way each ultimately challenge the authority and expertise of the other, revealing numerous instances of disciplinary discrepancy. </jats:p>",

Two obvious examples are traditional, mainstream research of political communication, and substantial parts of the large body of research drawing on Jürgen Habermas’s theory of the public sphere. Starting from a short review of the rational view of the political/the civic presented within these traditions, Peter Dahlgren’s notion of civic culture is analyzed as a perspective that offers a complementary view. This article elaborates on its intellectual origins by paying special heed to the connection between the civic-culture view of the political and the civic and the perspectives offered by pragmatist philosopher John Dewey. Departing from these insights, the article presents empirical illustration of everyday workings of civic culture, and concludes with reflections concerning what becomes of the media within a civic culture approach. </jats:p>",

In this article, I argue that reality TV's construction of a new stratum of celebrity value—ordinary people performing “the real”—supports claims that the industry is moving toward a “flexible” model of economic organization. The production of reality TV expands the labor stock to include nonunionized, nonpaid or low-paid contestants playing themselves, while also displacing unionized actors from production opportunities. Moreover, reality TV's D-level celebrity generates novelty out of audience self-reflexivity with minimal risk and temporal flexibility. Celebrity value, as a mechanism to gather audiences, undergoes a new form of dispensable synergy that shelters the larger system of celebrity valorization from the dual problems of scarcity and clutter. </jats:p>",

In the era's neoliberal climate where multicultural celebrations of diversity mixed with calls for fiscal responsibility, being socially liberal and fiscally conservative became the political position of choice for a growing number of well-educated and upwardly mobile baby boomers and Generation Xers. As it came to be articulated in the ’90s, homosexuality fit conveniently into this delicate balance. Highly visible political battles over gay rights gave homosexuality a cutting-edge allure dulled just enough by its assimilationist goals. Meanwhile gays and lesbians, reported to be well educated with a disproportionate amount of disposable income, seemed to be economically self-sufficient. For those looking for an affordable politics of social liberalism, supporting gays and lesbians fit the bill, and consuming gay-inclusive television offered members of the Slumpy class a convenient way to affirm their openmindedness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Reality TV's (re)emergence at the turn of the century necessitates a reconsideration of what it means to work in television as on-camera talent. Through a study of reality actor Susie Meister, the author examines a new kind of television-based celebrity created in the wake of the longest-running U.S. reality series, The Real World (1992—). This form of celebrity, which I call “reality-celebrity,” diverges from other modes of televisual fame by encoding its participants as off-camera texts cast to perform their “ordinariness” within the confines of a reality persona. Different from other types of television personalities (e.g., talk show hosts, news anchors), MTV's reality-celebrities must continually act as if they are off camera. The “behindthe-scenes” quality of Meister's fame is explored to trace some of the ways in which MTV's construction of celebrity challenges past notions of televisual fame. Ultimately, this article considers the implications of reality TV's blurring of the distinction between participant and performer. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The television series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and PEN15 are contemporary cringe comedies that foreground female experience. While the vast majority of cringe comedies employ documentary form and/or practice and speak insistently in the present tense, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and PEN15 produce stories that not only unfold in the present, but also reframe the past, thereby building into their acts of narration, and by extension their cringe esthetics, a retrospective temporality. In light of themes taken up by both series—themes related to mental health and the construction of female identity and desire—this reframing has significant effects both politically and therapeutically. In this article I analyze the formal means by which a retrospective temporality of cringe is achieved in these series, including the use of musical numbers in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and unconventional casting in PEN15, and I explore the various prosocial effects that temporality produces for the series’ characters, creators, and spectators. </jats:p>",

This article examines the Chinese children’s animation program Boonie Bears and explores its narrative strategies in portraying heroism. By employing content analyses, in-depth interviews, and focus groups, the article discusses how producers construct animation heroes according to the ideological framework of the Communist Party, economic preferences embedded in the Chinese market, and broader cultural expectations held by society. Finally, this article offers a preliminary exploration of the collaboration between political power and market forces in children’s animation, thus revealing the changing needs and interests of the government, producers, and audiences in the process of modernization, and the social significance of animation in Chinese modernity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Queer television studies scholarship tends to construct “queerness” and “normality” as incommensurable concepts, defining queer “against the normal rather than the heterosexual.” In this article, we show how this construction is specifically intertwined with highly liberalized media contexts, and generates a fundamentally static understanding and operationalization of the concept of normality in queer television studies. Turning to Flemish television fiction of the late 1990s, we point to a dynamic and open-ended approach toward sexual and gender diversity, and illustrate how televised normality itself can be a queer phenomenon. In doing so, we offer a framework to understand the proliferation of LGBT+ characters and storylines in twenty-first-century Flemish television fiction, and contribute to a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of normalization and television fiction in a western European television industry. </jats:p>",

Key analytical points are as follows: (1) cultural journalists legitimize Mad Men’s quality by addressing aspects internal (aesthetic markers) and aspects external (culture industry markers) to the series, as well as the series’ broader social and historical anchoring; (2) Nordic cultural journalists position themselves positively toward the TV series based on their professional expertise and their personal taste preferences and predilections; (3) these legitimation processes take place across journalistic genres, pointing to the importance not only of TV criticism, epitomized by the review, but of cultural journalism more broadly in constructing affirmative attitudes toward popular culture phenomena such as TV series. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The production and airing of Color TV (2011–2012), a variety comedy show, on the South African Broadcasting Corporation was seemingly driven by creator, producer, and industry desire for increased representation of “coloreds,” or people of mixed race, seventeen years after the end of apartheid. Although constitutional mandates and nation-building discourses support proportionate racial representations, the series was not renewed. Using critical race theory and a production studies approach, this analysis explores the apparently supportive context that engenders controversial racial representations by minority television personnel. Drawing on in-depth interviews with the creator of Color TV, and the show’s commissioning editor, the study explores how the political economic context of television production constrains racial representations to favor integrative nation-building programming and construct palatable racial representations of minorities. </jats:p>",

More specifically, the article suggests that the revival abandons the original series’ emphasis on long-term audience engagement in favor of a retrospective outlook that serves to legitimate the revival’s status as a worthy continuation of the original run—and that this shift is informed by its status as an event series. In doing so, the revival resurrects a mode of television storytelling informed by the demands of television’s multichannel era. To make this argument, the article discusses the storytelling strategies of The X-Files’ original run, and examines their implementation in the revival series. </jats:p>",

Focusing primarily on Ireland’s public service broadcaster RTÉ, the articles consider how national television in Ireland has represented and negotiated the resultant tensions and divides within Irish society. They examine the endurance and evolution of a daily Catholic ritual on national television; the weaknesses of a transnational drama in addressing the legacy of institutional abuse; varieties of progressive post-2015 Marriage Equality referendum “queer” television; “property television” and the current housing crisis; and intergenerationally themed reality television in the context of growing generational inequality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Netflix’s 2020 release Indian Matchmaking drew a massive backlash particularly from South Asian and diasporic audiences who felt it normalized the experiences associated with arranged marriages. Audiences took to the internet to express how much they loved hating the show but at the same time also continued to obsessively watch despite their reservations. My paper takes up this paradox of simultaneously loving and hating a media product. By drawing from interviews with the showrunner, members of the production team and a close reading of the show’s texts and paratexts, I argue that “hatewatching” or “cringe-binge” as a mode of spectatorship only seems an oppositional form of viewing or an act of resistance to the reification of dominant hegemonic values. Far from being a function of spectatorial agency, I demonstrate how the platforms utilize “hatewatching” as a lucrative form of viewership and consumer habit to cultivate stickiness for their content. </jats:p>",

I analyze discussions in Western online media around a case of Chinese DouYu live-streamer. “Qiaobiluo Dianxia,” as her streamer name goes, became a topic in Western media after a glitch in her live stream revealed her to be a middle-aged woman, rather than young woman she was assumed to be. The discussions are analyzed with critical discourse analysis. It is argued that the aging bodies of women, both their presence and absence, should be read and understood through toxic gaming culture and geek masculinity and the hegemonic discourse they constitute. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on fan studies, sports media studies, media industries studies, and participant observation of the American Outlaws, this essay analyzes specific aspects of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup as televised by Fox Sports in the wider context of soccer’s evolving place within the American sports media marketplace. American media companies have increasingly positioned soccer as an upscale sport in the U.S. In addition to representing an affluent and cosmopolitan taste culture, the representation of the American Outlaws as part of Fox Sports’ programming and branding flattened the frictions of class, national identity, politics, and race that shaped American soccer discourse in the summer of 2019. This essay explores this flattening and the underlying tensions between televising a tournament based in American national identity that allows for a more mass audience appeal and the more niche-based framing of soccer—including the progressive politics of women’s soccer—in U.S. sports media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This special issue is devoted to The Good Wife ( TGW) and unpacking the discursive divide between “quality” niche programming and mass entertainment broadcast programming. These essays question the conversations about quality swirling around a show that carries all the markers of prestige, but that also features the female protagonist, broadcast home, procedural roots, and soapiness often denigrated or overlooked by critics and academics alike. In response to the inherently gendered notions of quality, these essays re-center feminine subjects and interrogate masculinizing discourses through an array of approaches to a single series, analyzing TGW via the lenses of habitual mobile technologies, fashion, fantasy, and the labor of wifedom and motherhood. Analyzing this particular series through discourses of quality is not only a way to acknowledge a broadcast series within pre-existing standards of excellence but also a way to begin to reclaim television studies’ feminist roots from often hyper-masculine discussions of twenty-first-century quality TV. </jats:p>",

We situate the production of these net dramas within the political economy and technological conditions of the streaming industry and further consider the implications of such mediated feminism for the pursuit of gender equality in China. Our examination of feminist discourses in streaming culture also resonates with the ongoing global transformation of cultural productions in the television industry. </jats:p>",

In this article, we explore the role of voice actors in the video game culture using the specific case of the recasting of the video game series Life Is Strange, which was caused by the 2016 to 2017 SAG-AFTRA strike against video game companies. Our qualitative empirical analysis of journalistic coverage (including interviews with voice actors), promotional materials, press releases, and player discussions reconstructs the events of the game’s production and investigates the reception of the recasting with regard to actor-character identification and to labor conditions of voice actors. We find that voice actors, whose status is partly dependent on the popularity of their characters, attempt to rise “above the line” by engaging in relational labor. </jats:p>",

This article uses the varied response to Gone Home’s narrative and mechanical structures as an opportunity to reframe the discussion around the game in terms of how it invites players to engage with the objects and temporalities that compose its environment or, more specifically, its archive. Drawing from queer theory, historiography, and game studies, I argue that although Gone Home gestures toward the radical potential of archives, it ultimately undermines this potential by adhering to design conventions grounded in normative and normalizing logics. Through this analysis, I also suggest ways in which digital games can help us think through the politics of archives and of queerness as a historiographical method. </jats:p>",

It shows how digital infrastructures support refugees’ new life in the European city, while also normalizing the conditionality of their recognition as humans and as citizens-in-the-making. Research in Athens, Berlin, and London revealed the city as a vital but fierce space for refugees to claim, and sometimes find recognition that the nation often denies. A multimethod qualitative study with refugees and civil society actors at the aftermath of Europe’s “migration crisis” recorded urban cultures of hope for cities that are hospitable and open. Yet, it also recorded conditional welcoming that sets strict requirements for newcomers’ recognition as more than a category of external Others that need to prove their “right to have rights.” As shown, a digital order requires a performed refugeeness as precondition for recognition: that is, a swift move from abject vulnerability to resilient individualism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates how social media affects German public television. Due to recent dynamics in the field of social TV, notions of social TV as basically “tweeting while watching TV,” or as an “additional function” of television, need to be revised. As an addition to existing ideas of “Social TV 1.0” and “Social TV 2.0” and other characterizations, I refer here to “Social TV 3.0.” Current social TV features need to be characterized in the light of a “network of content” that combines the “media logic of television” and the “logic of social media” by means of their dynamic, flexible, and horizontal integration into the “matrix-media strategy” of TV executives impelled by a social media policy. By taking the content network funk (“a consortium of public broadcasters” [ARD] and “Second German Television” [ZDF]) as a prime example of social TV 3.0 in Germany, I analyze the merging of television and social media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> YouTube-based ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) has become widely popular in South Korea as a readily accessible mode of self-care. However, ASMR scholarship in South Korea has largely overlooked a discussion of its engagement with gender norms. This essay fills the gap by analyzing South Korean male ASMRtists performing digital care through “boyfriend role plays” and “boy’s love (BL) role plays.” Probing into these examples from the perspective of digital gender, I argue that the ASMR’s haptic encounter has the potential to turn the ASMRtist, the audience, and the Internet itself into active performers rehearsing the possibility of subverting the offline society’s normative expectations of gender roles. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Brazil is a media-saturated country with some of the highest levels of television penetration in the developing world, where final episodes of soap operas become events that literally empty the streets of cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. It is no surprise that television coverage of a media-intensive event such as 9-11 beat audience records in Brazil, upstaging the previous national drama surrounding the kidnapping of television personality and media mogul Sílvio Santos. As it happened throughout the world, hundreds of thousands with relatives in the United States responded to these images with worry followed by desperate attempts to contact family members, whether in New York or anywhere else in the United States. For many of us who are immigrants, this was the first time on the receiving end of phone calls from panicky relatives, who were calling us after news of violence and perhaps even a war on America. Although immediate safety was the main subject of these telephone calls and e-mails from friends and relatives in Brazil and my partner’s family in India, there was also a great deal of concern about racial backlash. News of anti-immigrant rage, including the beating of a Brazilian boy outside Boston, had featured prominently in Brazilian news, and in our case, we had a memorable conversation with relatives letting us know we were always welcome to relocate to a multiracial Brazil. This brief essay examines how the biggest international news story of the year was translated and made sensible to local readers and audiences in Brazil. Along with India and other third-world democracies, Brazil represents an economically strategic position in a globalized modernity characterized by startling poverty alongside thriving markers of consumer culture. Brazilian media coverage of 9-11 must be seen in the context of",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research has criticized a tradition of seeing socialist media cultures as strictly separated from the West. While scholars have analyzed how socialist television institutions reacted to influences from Western media, there is little research on how socialist television culture traveled outside the socialist bloc. This article analyses the ways in which state socialist television culture appeared in Finland on the basis of the main Finnish TV guide magazine Katso in 1963, 1968, 1973, 1978, 1983, and 1988. The article argues that socialist television was a significant influence in the Finnish television environment. Finnish audiences were introduced to socialist television cultures through means such as cross-border access to Soviet broadcasts and journalistic depictions. Both public service and commercial television companies imported Eastern European programs of various genres. Thus, the Finnish case shows that a strict East/West binary is not helpful for understanding European television history. </jats:p>",

Whereas the public connection perspective thus far primarily has been employed in the study of audience’s use of factual media, this study, first, conceptually updates the notion of public connection and develops a framework sensitized to capture the significance also of audience’s use of TV-series. Second, based on large-scale qualitative data collection reflecting the sociodemographic diversity in Norway, this study empirically highlights how the use of TV-series forms part of diverse yet typical orientations toward the sphere of politics. The study finds that given favorable combinations of repertoires of media use and habits, alongside resources, values, and dispositions, the viewing of TV-series clearly provides audiences with a link to the sphere of politics. It further finds, however, that the civic exploits of watching TV-series also hinge on a number of factors connected to audience’s background resources. </jats:p>",

While these distribution initiatives aim to challenge Hollywood’s reach in developing countries, their activities nevertheless foster the integration of audiovisual industries in developing countries into global media industries. At the same time, the program’s pairing of formal distribution and development aid is at times at odds with audience and industry expectations. Using data from policy documents, fieldwork in Brussels, and interviews with recipients of ACPCultures+ distribution project awards—including a detailed case study of Africa’s first VOD platform—I explore how these initiatives attempt to shape formal distribution in countries on the peripheries of large audiovisual industries. </jats:p>",

This begs the question: how do Black lives matter on their own platforms? What kinds of stories are they marketing? By analyzing the trailers on these collections, we found that streaming platforms reduce Black storytelling to their hardship or trauma. Stories of trauma or struggle are more likely to include joy if they focus on famous or successful people. Stories of joy or complex everyday lives are clearly underrepresented and occur as frequently as stories that do not center Black people at all (despite their inclusion on Black-focused playlists).

This article utilizes ideas drawn primarily from the work of Guy Debord—the society of the spectacle—and Jean Baudrillard—his discussion of death in Symbolic Exchange and Death, to think through the significance of death on social media. Debord argued that the consequence of the ubiquity of the mass media, and television in particular, and their increasing imbrication with consumption capitalism, was that social relations are increasingly lived as spectacle. At the same time, in the modern world, death has become increasingly separated from life. No longer integrated into social life, death has become the feared and meaningless end of life, which is to be preserved at all costs. The death that is now meaningful is not “natural” death but violent death. Social media is full of unnatural deaths including beheadings and suicide. This article discusses the pervasiveness of these on social media. </jats:p>",

The study applies thematic and discourse analysis to demonstrate how the brand narrative articulated in interviews with the Duffer Brothers (a set of key promotional paratexts) enforces strict interpretation boundaries for Stranger Things, its creators, and Netflix. Specifically, the promotional discourse (1) draws on the commercial structures and reception patterns of genre franchises and auteurism to produce alignment with the value systems of different audience markets, and (2) capitalizes on cultural oppositions between film and television to connect the Duffers’ original authorship to the idea of Netflix as a unique streaming platform. The article thus suggests a complex branding process at work in the marketing of Stranger Things, preoccupied with notions of authorship, distinction, and the need to navigate fragmented streaming audiences. </jats:p>",

This article examines manga “industrial reflexivity,” using as a case study publisher Shueisha’s most popular periodical, the best-selling shônen (boys) manga magazine, Shûkan Shônen Jump ( Weekly Shônen Jump). Jump’s documentary-like portrayals of the manga production process have bled out from the magazine in “exclusive” footage that takes viewers on behind-the-scenes tours exploring Shueisha offices or mangaka ateliers to spill insider knowledge and industry secrets. This article argues that such disclosures are borne out of industrial survival as much as education and promotion. Jump’s professional self-reflexivity is an example of an old media brand attempting to fight for relevance in a shifting media environment through appeals to the legacy and ecosystem of the manga magazine format itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over its first decade Instagram became central to Facebook’s dominance of audience and advertising markets. In this article, we critically examine how marketing and advertising trade press documented the development of advertising and retail on the platform. Instagram’s platformization involved formalizing relationships among users, influencers, creators, advertisers, retailers, and analytics services. The development of advertising and retail on the platform was characterized by open-ended third-party experimentation and innovation, which was gradually incorporated into, and controlled by, the platform. Advertisers and marketers increasingly approach the platform not just as an advertising service, but an end-to-end advertising, analytics and retail infrastructure. While much attention has been given to the promotional and influencer culture of Instagram, advertisers and marketers saw it as an opportunity to integrate advertising with retail. We argue that Instagram has platformized practices of looking and buying historically associated with department stores, malls, home shopping, and catalogs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the effects of WhatsApp as a mode of dissemination of political posters. It found that platform affordances that control the crafting and dissemination of political messages open up the possibility of vague political messaging by conforming to the social media’s visual culture and limit the spread of these messages, restricting the ability to organically gather support for a political cause. Despite the growing appeal of social media in political campaigns, social media messages when used by individuals and small, independent social media groups, who are not a part of a larger, organized political party or movement, have little influence on electoral decisions of voters about a political cause that faces weak public support. This was discussed in the context of electoral results of the Leftist political party in India in 2019 national elections. The paper then contributes to our understanding of the extent of the influence of social media platforms on political media messages. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The softcore serial (or “softcore featurette”) is a prolific sexploitation subgenre spawned by the early-nineties popularity of Red Shoe Diaries, Zalman King's late-night Showtime program. Like Red Shoe Diaries, the softcore serial is an elaborately feminized and aspirational form with a pointedly “postfeminist” sensibility. Though this subgenre is also a self-consciously apolitical form structured by double standards and essentialist stereotypes, contemporary feminists have nevertheless been increasingly inclined to condone it, a trend that may dovetail with a larger postfeminist receptiveness to traditional ideas of femininity. This article proposes that the softcore serial and its (post)feminist reception are most usefully framed as the product of three overlapping cultural contexts: the histories of postfeminist cultural production, of American sexploitation cinema, and of premium cable programming. </jats:p>",

From within this neoliberal view, Africa has to “catch up” to and “be taught” how to emulate and achieve the standards promulgated in mainstream media. Through the lens of an alternative realism, however, such narratives can be reshaped. The African philosophy of ubuntu is one example of a deeply relational ethic from within which development can be reconceptualized as “freedom” in terms of democratic ideals and which can be used as a guiding principle for media work and the refashioning of (reality television) images. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In Pain Generation, Social Media, Feminist Activism, and the Neoliberal Selfie, L. Ayu Saraswati uses the concept of the neoliberal selfie as a form of online phantasmagoria to “trouble” the use of social media by feminist activists to mobilize the political potential of pain caused by sexual harassment, violence, and abuse (2). In so doing, she exposes the ways in which the neoliberal parameters and governing logic of social media limit feminist work in these spaces, whilst maintaining a level of empathy and nuance that directs her criticism firmly toward neoliberalism and the platforms themselves rather than the individual activists she discusses. The book offers an insightful analysis of how social media re-inscribes and reinforces neoliberalism’s emphasis on productivity and the self and offers strategies for feminist social media practice that seeks to transcend its limitations. Saraswati’s analysis focuses on four case studies of feminists who use social media (primarily Twitter and Instagram) to conduct feminist activism. In Chapter 1, she defines and contextualizes the neoliberal self(ie) as a product of the underlying neoliberal structure and governing logic of the social media platforms used by these activists and the ways that it limits and inflects their campaigns. The core message of Saraswati’s book is that:",

This article explores the relationship between automated identification and social sorting, decision-making, and response. To develop a theoretical framework for considering the ways in which facial recognition technology reconfigures power relations, the article considers the effects of treating the face as what Harun Farocki calls an “operative image”: not a representation, but part of a sequence of operations. These operations deprive the face of its distinctive character to facilitate the automated governance of space. For Foucault, environmentality focused on the governance of populations, but digital technology individualizes and particularizes this process. Facial recognition technology raises issues of public concern not simply because it changes the conditions of privacy and recognition in shared spaces, but because it enables new modes of automated control. </jats:p>",

Considering the great potential for redefining television in the digital medium, we highlight ways in which television was “rebooted” rather than reinvented. Without the technical constraints that shaped analog television, many carryovers to DTV can be ascribed to social rather than conventionally technical influences and stakeholders. Three themes emerge from our analysis: (1) a technocratic discourse that favored resolution over reception as central to broadcasting as public service, (2) an inadequate public information campaign and failure to explore the range of opportunities presented by the digital format, and (3) a rearticulation of the home theater assemblage to cope with DTV through replacement-driven obsolescence. We argue that approaching DTV as a “reboot” serves as a model for investigating digital transitions more broadly in a new model of public service. </jats:p>",

In particular, I seek to reappropriate the (now) racist, sexist, homophobic, and otherwise ethically compromised film as a means of seeing ideology, of perceiving societal change, of re-cognizing the contingency of every historical moment, including our own. Indeed, I define the dated film here as one that provokes the embodied experience of contemporary ethics as such. Presentist critiques of the past, however well-intentioned, inadvertently reify the present and its ideologies. They erroneously imply, like Francis Fukuyama, that we have reached the “end of history,” that our values now are (and should be) eternal. The dated film, then, serves as an antidote to the hubris of the present and opens onto greater possibilities for the future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses two trends in the debates about contemporary television journalism. First, journalism is said to be increasingly subsumed an economic logic, privileging entertainment before serious journalistic practices. Most often, this is framed as if entertainment is eating its way into serious journalism, affecting it negatively and thus being detrimental for the political public sphere and political reasoning. Second, it is often pointed to a changed relation between journalism and politicians, where the latter have lost some of their power, for example, in political debates. This article relates these two trends and argues, against a field model inspired by Bourdieu, that it is not entertainment that is eating its way into journalism, but the other way around: Rather than having been absorbed by entertainment, journalism has differentiated, become more autonomous as a subfield of cultural production, and has gradually come to dominate both factual and entertainment television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines (im)material digital labor essential to the production of closet decluttering videos on YouTube by analyzing two case studies: Leighannsays and Bestdressed. I highlight three interconnected forms of tidying labor, that is, home, data, and waste management, mobilized for influencer work and cultural platform economy. Wardrobe clean-out videos capitalize on both corporeal and affective aspects of housework and content production in the construction and maintenance of the digital self. They also assemble management labor to organize material articles in domestic space, produce/manage multimedia, and construct/amplify digital existence. The essay also discusses the (im)material labor required by the personal and outsourced handling of the disposed’s hereafters as goods and trash outside of the home. Unpacking how closet decluttering video production nests together (im)material tidying labor associated with disparate sectors from home-based platform cultural production to public management of household waste shed lights on imbricated operations of the influencer ecosystem. </jats:p>",

Although its success among audiences and critics opened the door for other bilingual television shows spoken in Hebrew and Arabic, it also caused frustration for the series’ creator due the limits imposed by commercial television operating in an antagonistic socio-political context. While previous studies on the show have focused on its main narrative conflicts and themes, the present study proposes to examine the televisual spatio-temporal, linguistic and dramatic structures that foster the encounters and conflicts between the two languages spoken in the series. </jats:p>",

While streaming video services operate globally and the issue of LGBTQ inclusion is not solely a national one, Australia’s complex history of LGBTQ representation in film and television offers a unique context to explore these issues. This article asks: How is queer content categorized and promoted on BVOD and SVOD services in Australia? How easily discovered is this content? And how does this impact the visibility and inclusion of LGBTQ identities within the Australian screen media landscape? Drawing on critical librarianship and catalog analysis, this article reveals discrepancies between curated categories and search results, the failure of search tools to recognize language associated with LGBTQ identities, and the obscuring of queer content within streaming video libraries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The death of broadcast TV has been predicted since the mid-1990s. What is more, the transformation from TV as one technological platform to a myriad of platforms, devices, and thus also to multiple reception contexts has been described in a rich body of research from the mid-2000s onward (Katz and Scannell 2009; Olsson and Spiegel 2004; Turner and Tay 2009). In line with these observations of how TV is not ending, but rather being redefined in the digital age, our ambition with this special section is to go beyond the hype about the impact of convergence on the television medium. Our aim is to provide empirical studies that demonstrate how new ways of watching television emerge as a result of competing platforms with video-on-demand and timeshifting devices. The migration to online platforms in particular creates a considerable and new kind of competition for linear television to the point that some question its role, position, and even its very future. This special section wants to contribute to the debate about the future of television by analyzing the extent to which some of linear television’s key characteristics must be reconsidered (or not) in the new media environment. Central to traditional, linear television in Europe—both public service and commercial—is that it gives structure and flow to television output by means of scheduling and continuity techniques. Schedules give each program its distinct time slot while scheduling techniques such as",

Scholars have argued that this pressure to conform might lead to uniformity, or isomorphism, in the ways organizations manage their presence on platforms. This article contributes to the debate on isomorphism by taking a bottom-up approach and ask to which extent creators on YouTube pursue similar, or different, strategies for uploading and monetizing content. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses of a sample of YouTube channels, we show how content creators adapt to, negotiate with, and defy institutional pressures. In the end, we find greater support for diversification, that is, polymorphism, than concentration in the ways organizations manage their presence on the platform. This has implications for how we understand platform power and integrate institutional theories in communication research. </jats:p>",

This leads us to ask, Just how helpful are social mobile media in maintaining relationships in times of crisis management, and how, if at all, do they depart from previous media and methods? Drawing from case studies conducted with participants living in Tokyo at the time of the horrific events surrounding Japan’s earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 (called 3.11), this article reflects on the role of new media in helping, if at all, people manage crisis and grief.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rapid development of new media technology, many people are “cutting the cords” and viewing television through Internet-based video services via streaming or downloading. This study aims to better understand and contextualize this phenomenon through investigating Korean transient migrants’ television-viewing practices. Through forty qualitative interviews and employing the framework of the domestication theory perspective, this article examines how these deterritorialized individuals who experience dislocation make home through cord-cutting practices. By making use of the Internet and delivery technologies/interfaces legally and illegally, Korean transient migrants go beyond territorial limitations and make home materially, feel home affectively, and connect home relationally in their diasporic space. Moreover, the study debunks some utopian ideas about online audiences and shows what remains fixed in terms of transnational postcable culture. I argue that the article provides many insights into investigating contemporary television audiences and suggest a novel approach to studying migrant media practices. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Great Australian TV Delay: Disruption, Online Piracy and Netflix",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Netflix’s arrival in Australia in 2015, almost a decade after its start as a streaming media platform, helped to close the cultural and technological gap in televisual content legitimately available to the national audience. Australians, eager for international content unavailable locally, had turned to Internet piracy, dramatically changing traditional national televisual consumption practices. Although commonly described as “disruptive,” Netflix’s arrival in Australia, according to its users, was mostly stabilizing and not as transformative to their viewing practices as it may seem. By drawing on in-depth interviews with Australian Netflix users, we provide an account of its early integration into the Australian media landscape. The methodology provides a new model for examining the experience of users engaging with technologies labeled as “disruptive.” The Disruption-Experience (D-E) model is a means for exploring participants’ experiences and accounting for ways that new technologies can reinforce, undermine and dramatically shift user thoughts, feelings and practices. In applying this model to the experiences of Australian Netflix users, we discovered that Netflix concretized—but did not necessarily create—a new set of expectations about agency, accessibility, and temporality that has not previously been accounted for. This is an important discovery at a time of rapid proliferation and adoption of streaming video-on-demand (SVOD) services in Australia, as the competing costs and demands of multiple services could mean a return to the once-prodigious levels of illegal and unauthorized access to television content. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it examines the emergence of the multiplatform brand Fearnet, a joint cable channel, website, and VOD service owned by Comcast, Lionsgate, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. It argues that the service, which features horror movies taken from the Sony/MGM library and includes a host of interactive features, not only illustrates the changing impact of new media technologies on film distribution but also the growing industrial utility of VOD services for both cable and film industries. By relying on subcultural practices and discourses specific to horror fandom, digital services like Fearnet act as branded media conduits for the various markets and commerce that sustain niche-oriented categories of horror as a commodified experience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Scholars have recognized how new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have reduced and transformed barriers to producing and circulating community-based media. Yet community media projects tend to apply these technologies within established communities whose histories have been shaped by broader socio-spatial factors. This article draws from critical geography and studies of technology and infrastructure to reconceptualize the problem of media accessibility. Rather than programs for addressing disparities in technology or training, community media projects would benefit from recognizing how significantly their media production activities rely on local communication infrastructures and a collective sense of home. This article uses a case study of public access television in San Francisco to demonstrate how cable and telecommunications policy, urban redevelopment, and community-based media groups co-constitutively determine a scale of political extensibility by providing broader access to decision-making arenas beyond local TV programming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Michael Mann was the Executive Producer for the first two seasons of Miami Vice during the mid-1980s. This article argues that his worldview is deeply imprinted on the series. Mann's worldview thinks of society as organized by law and that, outside of the law, there is unregulated violence. In Miami Vice this view organizes the relationship between the United States and the world beyond its boundaries—a world of gunrunners, drug lords, and others who are threatening the integrity of the United States. Most especially, this United States is threatened by Latin Americans whose illegal activities have to be stopped by the Miami Organized Crime Bureau. While Miami Vice has been praised for its avantgarde, postmodern emphasis on style, this article argues that it was actually the show's politics—so reassuring for mainstream, white America—that provided the basis for Miami Vice's remarkable popularity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> HBO’s global success, Game of Thrones (2011–2019), is known for having an active international fan base. In this qualitative interpretive study of the show’s reception in Spain, Germany, and Argentina, I examine themes emerged from interviews with twenty-one viewers. I interpret their readings on the series together with online and offline engagement practices. Rather than marked cultural contrasts, the study identifies common patterns across nations: varying degrees of analytic and emotional engagement leading to diverse fan subjectivities within their “locality.” Theoretically, I draw from Mittell as well as Jenkins et al. to argue how GoT provides an arena for casual viewers and die-hard fans to move on both axes of engagement: drillability and spreadability. To finalize, I reflect on dominant academic discourses that reinforce notions of proper fandom and propose to apply anthropology’s cultural relativism and respect for the emic perspective to acknowledge agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study sets out to understand how journalism is represented in the Danish fiction series Borgen and the Spanish series El Caso: Crónica de Sucesos. The aim is to provide an understanding of how journalism is conceptualized in non-American fiction. Through textual analysis, we found out that Borgen (years 2010 and up) represents a generational and evolutionary conflict in which journalistic values are restrained by political and commercial imperatives reflecting challenges in Danish journalism. As such, this series criticizes the free press myth—commonly found in American fiction series. El Caso (1960s) also engages with this myth through the representation of journalism practices embedded in Spain’s Francoist regime that balance public and political-religious interests. However, El Caso smooths over this conflict to illustrate how journalists cleverly overcame the censorship of the Catholic church. Both series explore the gendered and cultural obstacles of their respective contexts and eras. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the representation of the COVID-19 global public health crisis on U.S. network television medical dramas. Programs featuring healthcare professionals like Chicago Med (NBC, 2015-present), The Good Doctor (ABC, 2017–2024), and New Amsterdam (NBC, 2018–2023) depicted the devastation of the pandemic and the plight of the frontline healthcare community to viewers at home through the fictional hospital. In particular, Grey’s Anatomy (ABC, 2005–present) produced a “very special season” dedicated to portraying COVID’s toil. I argue that the primetime doctor show attempted to lessen the pain of COVID’s impact by presenting its audience-as-patient with a way to manage their emotions around loss through narrative catharsis. The program adheres to a logic of alleviation in its care work for viewers. Such a tele-therapeutic strategy of engagement on the long-running Grey’s Anatomy, amidst mass suffering and death, also served to revive the series as compelling broadcast television in the streaming era.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article moves beyond the textuality of the map to focus on the way in which mobile mapping is constructed discursively, semiotically, and experientially. It centers on the autoethnographic and reflective experience of the researcher analyzing video and Global Positioning System (GPS) recordings of walking interviews, during which the interviewees conversed about, and engaged in, mobile mapping practices. This reductive process can be considered in light of its re-presentation to the researcher for analytical purposes—a ghostly abstraction of a past spatial experience. The article considers the manifold hauntings stirred in the process of abstraction and the creation of multiple layers of experience: that of the firsthand experience of the walking interview and that of the secondhand analysis of the video and geocoded data. The discrepancy between firsthand movement and secondhand analysis underscores questions about the relationship between mobile maps, representation, and movement and about those epistemologies and ontologies that haunt the interstices between individual records. </jats:p>",

In the United States, corporate policies are the leading indicator for data governance practices, influencing a system known as multi-stakeholderism. In China, forced localization to government servers drives data governance practices.

In an era marked by the relentless corporate makeover of news media and a concomitant decline in public trust in journalism, satirical videos that took on Narendra Modi, Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, and other political figures during the 2014 election campaign season offered a strikingly different and immensely popular mode of engagement with the political. Moving past well-worn paradigms for understanding the relation between entertainment and politics, this article situates online satire within a vibrant field of everyday digital media production that marks contemporary Indian public culture. I show how satirical videos became part of an intricate, networked, yet comprehensible intertextual field that linked the 2014 elections to long-standing political issues and debates around caste, class, gender and sexuality, and religious nationalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1997 United Parcel Service (UPS) strike highlighted the conflict of interests between corporations and their employees, challenging the notion that the 1990s economic recovery had benefited all Americans equally. Television coverage of this strike, however, failed to reflect the class nature of this conflict. Instead, it framed the strike in nationalist terms and projected the interests of business onto the nation by constructing a harmonious national community with shared goals. Through a textual analysis of 269 news reports on ABC, CBS, and NBC, this article discusses the economic and social components of the “nationalist antistrike narrative.” Economically, this narrative constructs the viewer as a middle-class consumer and invites the audience to identify with UPS. Socially, it offers mechanisms of corporate and national conflict resolution based on idealized nuclear family relations. This article argues that the narrative’s logic stems from the institutional structure of American television, which is simultaneously a national and a nationalizing medium. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that the postfeminist gender politics of Friends (NBC, 1994–2004) are played out via a series of manipulations and reversals of space and mise-en-scène. Arguing that clearly gendered domestic space forms a stable part of the sitcom’s equilibrium, it analyses instances where the mise-en-scène boldly calls attention to men’s and women’s spaces, puts the gendering of space into flux, and highlights the burden of domestic labor. It reveals through close textual analysis how space in Friends is used to offer the playful promise of freedom from restrictive gender roles, but ultimately maintains a conservative status quo of both space and gender. It also makes a case for paying close attention to the aesthetics of the traditional sitcom to appreciate the expressivity of production design offered in such texts which, although (deliberately) unspectacular, is by no means unremarkable. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Streaming services have become a primary intermediary between international content producers and global audiences, and their palpable influence as gatekeepers, tastemakers, and disruptors of media industries abroad have significant ramifications for the way television is produced and distributed. Using the case study of how Netflix is influencing the Japanese anime industry, this research outlines the contradictory ways that the streaming service engages with international media and how local creators are grappling with the specter of globalism that Netflix represents in their own work. Utilizing textual analysis, discursive analysis, and interviews with industry insiders, this article identifies some of the shifts that are occurring in the anime industry due to the advent of Netflix on the level of production and text. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article deals with the use of the American television series Game of Thrones (HBO: 2011–) as part of the political discourse of the emerging political party Podemos in Spain. First, we focus on Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, who, in 2014, edited a book devoted to analyzing this series from a political science viewpoint. We then move on to study ideologically charged symbolic gestures and the detailed analysis of the parallelisms between Daenerys Targaryen’s revolutionary enterprise and Podemos’s bottom-to-top quest to seize power. We then scrutinize how emergent political forces that threaten the enduring hegemony of traditional parties use popular cultural artifacts to intervene in the social fabric and how they attempt to tune in with the Internet-dedicated, socially networked younger classes. This article, thus, analyzes how the relationship between politics and serialized TV fiction has morphed within the Spanish mediascape, paying special attention to the impact of participatory culture. </jats:p>",

This phenomenon was on display after 9/11, when shows including 24, Family Guy, Friends, The Simpsons, and others had full episodes and/or specific scenes cut from distribution. This phenomenon demonstrates how television’s popular archive is mutable, popular memory acts as a site of social and political struggle, and production, ancillary markets, official and unofficial distribution, the cultural standing of television and its genres, and other factors interact to determine which aspects of television’s past are available to the public at different moments. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a postbroadcast society with both online and offline news media widely available, there are many ways for an audience to (actively) consume news about distant suffering. This focus group study looks into the combined use of broadcast media (television) and a postbroadcast platform (Facebook) for watching disaster news. It is considered that the interactive possibilities offered online to watch and experience the news, combined with watching news on television, could possibly help in fostering a closer relation between a Western audience and the distant suffering. Informed by concepts from social and moral psychology, the findings show not only that personal narratives on social media have the potential to incite a more personal connection between the audience and the distant sufferer but also that this potential was not to be overestimated. </jats:p>",

We put forward two criteria that can assess media’s capacity to enforce inclusiveness in public deliberation. A mediated deliberative system is inclusive if it (1) proactively gives visibility and voice to vulnerable groups to be seen and heard on their terms and (2) allows those with less power to act as “deliberative agents” capable of facing their interlocutors, articulating, defending, and considering one’s views. We provide empirical context to this argument through the case of the Reproductive Health debates in the Philippines, as they played out in two different television genres that differently accentuate deliberative agency. </jats:p>",

We not only explore the specificities of these new media technologies and the cultural practices they afford but also highlight the intimate relationships they instantiate with their surroundings. The specific case studies highlighted in the contributors’ essays discuss gaming in Canada (Engel) and Japan (Hjorth), the traces of racism in South Carolina (Cooley), the topographical footprint of settler colonialism (Zwicker et al), Hong Kong pace (Wilmott), and artistic experiments that use the city as a laboratory (Verhoeff). What holds all of these contributions together is their indebtedness to creative cartography. This special issue on Urban Cartographies explores the paradoxes of presence, co-presence and absence as represented on and generated by our living, mediating screens.",

Examining trade press, promotional material, and fan discourse, I demonstrate how structural whiteness functions as point of intersection between industry and fan-driven distribution. </jats:p>",

We argue that platform affordances, architectures and cultures serve as a nodal point to bring together a disparate set of practices, discourses and ideological positions to facilitate polarized, reactionary, and or strategic networked publics in the context of digital politics and the (re)emergence of culture wars. Papers within this special issue speak to our argument in varying ways. They explore the mechanisms, sentiments, tolerances, and practices in local and global contexts. They consider how certain practices manifesting as social justice interventions apply to negatively impact marginalized groups, theorize the role of and power of platforms in propelling cancelations, and track the rituals associated with cancel culture on platforms. In doing so we encompass perspectives and case studies from the global majority to inform what has to date been a largely Western area of focus and scholarship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the fabrication of liveness, understood as a category of affective urgency and narrative motivation, in two reality series derived from a sex tape scandal: Keeping Up with the Kardashians and The Kardashians. The reality programs narratively incorporate Kim’s live TV appearances to compensate for the sex tape intertext’s incomplete liveness. Consequently, the Kardashian series suggest that live TV might imbue other media genres, like reality TV and sex tapes, with the liveness those genres only partially replicate. At the same time, the Kardashian series indicate a deficiency in live TV’s intertextual influence. The two series necessitate artificial liveness, produced through esthetic techniques, and simulated liveness, manufactured from imitations of live TV, to bolster the liveness of Kim’s live TV appearances. The Kardashians’s intertext, Saturday Night Live, clarifies this complication in live TV’s intertextual impact by parodying live TV’s decline as the dominant medium for liveness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the unofficial role of camera phone practices in visualizing everyday forms of play as part of emergent urban cartographies. I argue that camera phone practices—especially in an age of timestamping—are creating their own cartographies of place that overlay the visual with the ambient, social with the geographic, emotional with the electronic, in new ways. By focusing upon the playful qualities of camera phone practices, we can begin to understand places as sites for ambient meandering and co-presence. Having outlined the notion of performative cartography as part of what has been defined as “critical cartography,” I consider how camera phone practices can be understood through ambient, co-present play. I turn to a site-specific mobile game, keitai mizu (mobile water), made for a post-Tokyo tsunami and Fukushima disaster context (known as 3/11), to explore the ways in which cartography can be performed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent developments in AI promise to further enact the shift from personalization to personification in automated digital interfaces. We have already seen the rise of virtual influencers and, more recently, of chatbots that adopt the personas of celebrities. Drawing on the intertwined history of the relationship between parasociality and personal influence, we frame the shift toward personification as a strategy for re-centralizing control over the online media environment. The shift is likely to extend beyond the realm of social media influencers to characterize our interactions with a range of services, platforms, and media content, from search engines to online news and entertainment. Automated personification anticipates a world permeated by enhanced parasocial relations with media devices and interfaces. To the extent that the interactive infrastructures shaping these relations remain controlled by commercial tech platforms, we can anticipate their imperatives will be baked into this version of automated sociality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes American cable channel HGTV’s programing strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically their construction of a “COVID-free” fantasia in their series Home Town and its spinoff, Home Town Takeover. By considering this response through the lens of dissonance, I argue that while the network originally emphasized their social responsibility to mitigating the spread of the virus, their business model incentivized them to move past the virus more swiftly than other channels, pushing the labor of mediating dissonance onto their on-screen talent and their audience. This case study foregrounds how variables like genre, channel, and audience shaped the television industry’s response to the pandemic, with HGTV’s business model built on “evergreen” reality programing leading them to abdicate principles of social responsibility both more quickly and more thoroughly, despite numerous options that would have addressed the dissonance of COVID in a more balanced fashion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I argue that the Discovery Channel's reality-based automotive show American Chopper produces a recuperative blue-collar masculinity that attenuates the putative losses suffered by working-class men under the postindustrial service economy of the contemporary United States. In its on-screen presentation of blue-collar work, American Chopper valorizes a form of working-class manual labor at precisely the moment when such labor has all but disappeared in the United States. In its presentation of a world of masculine labor and fraternal affect, American Chopper constructs a nostalgic world of blue-collar work in which the skilled manual laborer—always understood to be male—still reigns supreme, untroubled by the supposed defeats suffered by hegemonic masculinity in the post-civil rights era. By celebrating neoliberal consumer capital and the traditional consumption of the American dream as coterminous discourses of celebrity identity, the show elides the still vast gaps in opportunity and remuneration in the contemporary United States. </jats:p>",

These developments are indicative of significant shifts in the cultural life of both media celebrity and citizenship, as charitable stars and the small acts of digital caring they solicit from their media audiences have emerged as central linchpins in global governmentality. Tracing the social, cultural, and political-economic productivity of celebrity branding and media interactivity for global regimes of governing, this essay shows how caring stars and audience labor are mobilized to fuel a digital economy of global care that sustains the social welfare work of the international community. </jats:p>",

It compares how the limited animation of Hanna-Barbera Productions transformed in the shift to cable and greater media conglomeration under Turner Broadcasting System. Using a thick description of the production process, the chapter illustrates how Cartoon Network programmers remixed the corporate archive to create Space Ghost: Coast to Coast. Through this remixed production process, channel programmers used limited animation esthetics to disclose on their own labor as programmers and producers within Turner’s media empire. It ends by examining how Space Ghost: Coast to Coast’s unique production techniques and esthetics shaped Cartoon Network’s adult programing block, [adult swim]. </jats:p>",

Based on data from twenty-five focus groups held in Norway and Britain, it examines audience talk around interlinguistic subtitling and articulated responses to two case study programs: The Office (BBC2, 2001—3) and Nissene på Låven (TVNorge, 2001). Discussing constraints associated with transnational TV comedy, the analysis underlines national differences in engagement with subtitles but argues that participants tended to underestimate the ability of transnational viewers to comprehend and enjoy the case study texts. Drawing on theories of humor and nationality, the article suggests that the recurring emphasis on cultural difference served to maintain nation-based us—them distinctions.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Of Social Networks and Suicide Nets: Biopolitics and the Suicide Screen",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes how the Silicon Valley ethos has influenced the development of screening technologies designed to enforce survival. Although various technologies have been used to ensure the survival of clumsy, sick, depressed, or unpredictable subjects, this article focuses on recent developments in suicide screens—that is, those screening technologies that detect suicidal subjects and aim to prevent acts of suicide. Digital versions of these screens have also emerged: the U.S. military, in particular, has begun developing software designed to analyze returning veterans’ social media posts for hints of suicidal tendencies. Meanwhile, Foxconn, the Asian super-manufacturer that assembles products for Silicon Valley giants like Apple and HP, notoriously developed a network of “suicide nets” designed to prevent its miserable workers from jumping to their deaths. In Foucaultian parlance, while the state and its allies routinely “let die,” suicide threatens the state’s sovereignty over life by introducing a rupture of political intelligibility whereby a community can come to realize its basic biopolitical autonomy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The political satire boom in the United States and the United Kingdom experienced a brief, albeit notorious success on British and American television, most notably represented by That Was The Week That Was. In the United States, the satire boom largely evaporated with the assassination of President Kennedy. This article examines the transatlantic history of this iconic programme during the Kennedy years and how that transatlantic exchange manifested in the midst of the immediate aftermath of Kennedy’s death with the British satirists’ hastily produced tribute episode a day after the American president’s assassination, its broadcast on NBC twice in the days following the assassination, and the Anglophilic response by American audiences to the programme in voluminous letters sent to the BBC. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article situates Nat King Cole’s NBC experience within those of Hazel Scott and Harry Belafonte, whose own programs bookended the first decade of television. While Scott was blacklisted and her Dumont show canceled, the brief primetime stints of Cole and Belafonte on national network television, reveal a shifting rhetoric surrounding the policing of blackness on TV that focused blame on the South. The South, then, became a convenient rhetorical device in the rejection of Black national television content. This article follows these two parallel yet interlocking threads, with the first section detailing the rise of national television in conversation with the South and the deflection of racism onto the region—an easy representational task amidst news coverage of the civil rights movement. The latter portion of the article follows a genealogy of Black hosted variety programs and Black televisual resistance from Scott to Cole and Belafonte. </jats:p>",

These programs focus on the attempts by survival experts Bear Grylls and Ray Mears to remain alive in the wilderness. After considering the place of survival television in the history of nature documentaries and its articulation of a “primitive” form of masculinity, it is argued that the genre elaborates a neoliberal form of utopia. Survival television dovetails with the shadowy side of neoliberalism, ennobling a precarious, self-punishing mode of existence in which one struggles to maintain one’s present position rather than improve it. Yet, drawing on a widely shared meme featuring Grylls, I conclude by suggesting that the conservative effect of survival television is tempered by the exaggerated nature of Grylls’s performance, which offers a glimpse into how survival might be perceived from a genuinely utopian future. </jats:p>",

It juxtaposes the conservative cable giant Fox News with the progressive YouTube-based network the Young Turks (TYT). TYT stands as one of YouTube’s longest running and most successful “news and politics” channels on the platform. This progressive digital network has long embraced a populist anchoring style that resembles Fox News and the style of its conservative YouTube competitors. This study establishes the stylistic affinity between TYT and Fox News and then explains how it is driven by a similar commercial-economic logic that prizes “loyal” viewership and “intense” engagement above all else. Shifting from political economy to media activism, this article also chronicles TYT’s role in creating the Justice Democrats, the progressive PAC that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other “Squad” members. This article seeks to complicate the commonly held association between populism and political conservatism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, this paper examines a sample of X hashtags supporting or criticizing Johnny Depp or Amber Heard in their 2022 domestic abuse/defamation trial, where in both cases there were calls to cancel each. The analysis explores how the acts carried out by the targets for canceling, along with concrete details of their personal circumstances, become set aside as what we call “trigger-ready” interest groups become activated by a perceived transgression in relation to their own more narrow and heterogeneous concerns. Hashtags become an entanglement of vaguely articulated discourses relating to matters including fandom, gender, abuse and conspiracy. These discourses stack up against the target and coalesce into growing outrage. The analysis suggests that intensity of canceling bares little relationship to any actual transgression but to the extent to which these “trigger-ready” groups become involved. This may be a characteristic of wider patterns in online cancel campaigns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the “metastory” surrounding Gary Webb’s 1996 “Dark Alliance” series as a moment of crisis in mainstream journalism. Two forces converge in Webb’s series and its aftermath: (1) establishment journalism confronts and manages the reemergent phenomenon of conspiracy theory, and (2) establishment print-based journalism attempts to organize a relationship with the emergent medium of the internet. When these two forces collide in the profession, conspiracy theories and the web end up mutually defining each other. This problematization of a conspiracy theory has multiple effects—not only in disqualifying the story itself but in reshaping the profession of journalism in its relation to new technology. Eschewing technological determinism, this article demonstrates how a new technology is made sensible through a professional discourse as a way of making it manageable. In turn, professional journalism operates as technical expertise in a liberal political rationality of “governing at a distance.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1955, Daily Mirror reported, “An unmarried mother hid her face on TV last night. . . .” The headline referred to the BBC's Is This Your Problem? ( ITYP? 1955—57), in which members of the public sought the help of an “expert” panel. Based on archival research, this article situates ITYP? in relation to the historical circumstances of its circulation, exploring what it can contribute to knowledge of British television's aesthetic development and production of cultural identity and how these were negotiated by the BBC. In precariously negotiating public service values and popular appeal, ITYP? is interesting for prefiguring debates about television's “tabloidization,” and the program's reception speaks to the cultural debate that greeted the talk show in the 1990s. While there is always a danger of fostering an “undue proximity” between past and present, ITYP? offers a valuation contribution to the genealogy of these debates, particularly in elucidating television's (re)negotiation of public—private spheres. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Indian Family on UK Reality Television",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article demonstrates how The Family (2009), a fly-on-the wall UK reality series about a British Indian family, facilitates both current public service broadcasting requirements and mass audience appeal. From a critical cultural studies perspective, the author examines the journalistic and viewer responses to the series where authenticity, universality, and comedy emerge as major themes. Textual analysis of the racialized screen representations also helps locate the series within the contexts of contested multiculturalism, genre developments in reality television and public service broadcasting. Paul Gilroy’s concept of convivial culture is used as a frame in understanding how meanings of the series are produced within a South Asian popular representational space. The author suggests that the social comedy taxonomy is a prerequisite for the making of this particular observational documentary. Further, the popular (comedic) mode of conviviality on which the series depends is both expedient and necessary within the various sociopolitical contexts outlined. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The cultural magazine Kobra (2001−2017) was one of the longest running shows in Swedish public service television history. Kobra defined culture broadly as arts, popular culture and subcultures, both international and Swedish. The study uses three lenses—journalistification, transnationality and cultural/societal criticism—to analyze how Kobra evolved over its long run. It focuses on four globally eventful years 2001, 2005, 2011, and 2016 and shows how the shifting SVT mandate is reflected in the show’s title sequences, program structure, visual features, and text. Transnationality becomes established through topic themed episodes connecting various cultural domains in different parts of the world or through country/city-themed episodes. A close reading from three different years reveals that Kobra exercised transnational systemic criticism through the choice of theme and interview subjects, rather than through evaluation of cultural expression, in line with its increasing journalistification and public service mandate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the use of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) to treat combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder. In this therapeutic practice, patients wear a head-mounted virtual reality display and enter a simulation designed to incarnate their triggering memories. VRET visualizes the formerly invisible site of psychotherapy, achieving a medical aspiration that has been pursued since the turn of the twentieth century. This visualization subjects therapy to a mode of surveillance and mediates the conditions in which trauma is processed. In this article, I consider how VRET’s user interfaces produce feelings of agency that reconfigure how power is distributed at the scene of therapy. I situate this novel practice at the intersection of two technological histories: the industrial history of the military-entertainment complex that spawned VRET, and the theoretical history that unites psychoanalysis and computation in their mutual ambition to formalize thought. Contending that neither of these histories can be disarticulated from the violent projects they have sustained, I interrogate the politics of a practice that visualizes and virtualizes psychotherapy, arguing that VRET processes trauma according to a militarized worldview. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In light of the promise of humorous political memes as popular routes to citizen empowerment as well as concerns over their potential dangers, it is necessary to examine how everyday citizens make sense of their role in political expression and how they engage with them—or not—in their everyday social media activities. This focus group study explores these questions by focusing on the digital practices of U.S. young adults. The findings suggest a range of benefits of posting political memes and humor online, including building solidarity with likeminded peers and reinforcing communal identity, as well as advancing accessible and influential political critiques. However, these positive assessments are complicated by concerns over the relationship between political meme humor and threats of trivialization and hyper-polarization, which limit some users from participating in its circulation and lead them to seek alternative modes of online engagement that are perceived as more civically valuable. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the specificity of media participation in a small nation, Wales, through empirical research on participants in historical reality television. It takes as its focus the case study of BBC Wales’s multiplatform project, Coal House (Indus, 2007) and Coal House at War (Indus, 2008), which exemplifies how public service broadcasters in the digital era seek to cultivate diverse forms of participation from national and regional audiences. Drawing on interviews, text-in-action participant observation, and online postings, the authors examine how participants and their families negotiate issues of experience and embodiment, engaging in unpaid media labor to protect and promote their own experiences and interpretations of the show. In contrast to theories of celebrity emerging from analyses of globalized formats such as Big Brother, the authors propose the concept of the “localebrity” to explain how celebrity functions in the local and regional context of the small nation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The past decade has seen an increase in the use of the mobile phone as a facilitator for political protests. Yet, to date, how the use of mobile phones affects participation in protests remains unclear. This study employs the distinction between communication and metacommunication to investigate the informational and relational dimensions of the mobile phone in protest mobilization in four cases in China. By drawing upon fifty-three in-depth interviews, the results reveal that, in addition to communicating mobilizing information, participants metacommunicate their mutual relationships via mobile phones in the mobilization process, and this shapes the practice of information exchange and the interpretation of information. As the pivotal driving force for protest participation, this metacommunication involves an engagement of reciprocal relationships, generates a sense of mutual engagement, and enhances a feeling of solidarity. The dynamic of the mobile phone as a facilitator in protest lies in its embedding of metacommunication beyond information dissemination. </jats:p>",

The authors argue that their activities are advancing the development of convergent cultures associated with counterinscriptions of a grassroots globalization and the expansion of contexts in which new forms of indigenous and Afro-Caribbean cultural citizenship can emerge and become effective. Hence, mediated practices of cultural persistence on Nicaragua’s Mosquito Coast intensify and broaden the revivification and circulation of relational, nonmodern ontologies whose epistemic force contributes to wider Latin American movements for social transformation and illustrates in new ways the importance and the potential of indigenous media operations and the intercultural global networks within which they are implicated. </jats:p>",

The possibility that we are moving into a “postdocumentary” culture is posed. This is a culture in which many conventional elements of documentary will continue to develop, but in a radically changed setting—economic and cultural—for all audiovisual documentation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Researchers are increasingly recognizing anime and manga as worthy of scholarly examination. However, relatively little research examines how fans synthesize the cultural content of anime. This paper provides an analysis of representations of race/ethnicity and gender in two televised anime, and contrasts the understandings of scholars to fans. As anime can weave together images from Japanese culture, other cultures, as well as fantasy, anime presents many faces to fans. Fans do not necessarily see all of these faces at once, and they interpret the cultural content of anime differently. As a result, anime has the potential to generate different types of cultural influence. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through an analysis of the British comedy quiz show QI (BBC2/BBC4, 2003—7; BBC1, 2008—), this article examines the ways in which “knowledge” as a discourse is constructed, maintained, and disseminated in popular television. The article draws on the work on discourse of Michel Foucault as well as sociological analyses of education and knowledge from writers such as Karl Mannheim and Pierre Bourdieu. The analysis explores the ways in which being knowledgeable is performed as well as the ways in which knowledge is related to issues of class and gender, particularly in a British context.The article argues that knowledge in QI is dependent on empiricism and posits the value of knowledge as being related to ideas of the civilized gentleman, showing how it is used to promote idea of “appropriate” behavior. While acknowledging the ways in which participants in the program may dissent against its discourses, the article concludes that, while the series may aim to undercut conventional ideas of education, it nevertheless resolutely upholds and promotes ideas of knowledge that sociologists have demonstrated maintain social divisions and power hierarchies. </jats:p>",

We focus on the ten most popular individual blogs in Lebanon during the time period April 2009–2010, noting bloggers’ mutual connectivity and links to online media in Lebanon. We then analyze themes common to these blogs, focusing specifically on how Lebanese bloggers question the norms and push the boundaries of what can be said mediated public sphere. While there are differences between the bloggers not least due to whether they are writing in Arabic or English—almost all explicitly criticize the current sectarian system, human rights violations, as well as existing religious, gender and environmental norms. Whether they see themselves as cosmopolitan or locally based activists, a significant minority uses humor and political satire as key elements in their blogs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although abstinence-only programs in the United States have historically failed to provide medically accurate information on sexual health, young people in the twenty-first century have turned to YouTube to answer their sex questions. The accessible and engaging format of the YouTube video has helped some sex educators achieve Internet fame among a mass audience of users devoted to watching their web series and interacting with them on social media. Using two sex education channels (Laci Green’s Sex Plus and Lindsey Doe’s Sexplanations) as case studies, this article investigates the ways in which YouTube stardom shapes the production of and engagement with online sex education videos. In doing so, the article uncovers how Internet fame helps to create a brand of sex education salient to audiences across media platforms that rely on the illusion of face-to-face interaction, the development of an authoritative yet approachable identity, and the cultivation of a virtual community. </jats:p>",

While critical media scholars continue to presume that audiences engage media one at a time, industries and advertisers are increasingly examining how viewers split their attentions across multiple screens at once, and how best to integrate these screens into synergized content streams. This article relates industry discourses on simultaneous media to longer-standing interest in audience inattention, specifically the ways that producers are reconceptualizing multitasking from a distracting activity to a potentially interactive one. Examining these discourses provides a foundation from which critical scholars can engage with the multiscreen contexts in which audiences use new media, while critiquing the presumptions of interactivity at the heart of convergence culture. </jats:p>",

Scholarly study of file-sharing tends to focus on movies and music, keeping TV marginal despite its heavy circulation in P2P networks. By considering its cultural implications as revealed in the discourses of P2P TV sharers, this essay’s aim is to understand TV file-sharing as one term in the negotiation of television’s value during the contemporary period. It is especially concerned with understanding the ethical theories of file-sharing participants. It situates these within the context of television’s shift from low, mass culture to a more legitimated status; from a freely accessible public good to a private good for which one must enter into terms of commercial exchange; and from a national/local form of culture to a global, cosmopolitan experience. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we explore this intersection in the case of Bangalore’s water supply, where IBM in alliance with the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is implementing a water-flow sensor network and geographic database system under the label of “big data for water supply.” We illustrate how the BWSSB-IBM approach narrows down the complex field of water provision to a question of water in- and out-flow measurements and the monitoring of BWSSB ground personnel. In theoretical terms, we discuss the ways in which these processes constitute both particular claims to knowledge, and the redefinition of citizenship as consumption. </jats:p>",

One campaign emphasizes stereotypes that the program itself problematizes, and another humanizes the images of real-life incarcerated women. Using feminist textual analysis, we explore these campaigns in relation to intersectionality and analyze the construction of intersectional identities within Netflix’s two promotional campaigns: The New York Times’ paid promotional content “Women Inmates: Why the Male Model Doesn’t Work” and the “Crazy Pyes” food truck campaign. Applying theoretical work from scholars such as Lotz and Gray, we discuss the ideological messaging of the campaigns, and examine how Netflix commodifies images of OITNB’s incarcerated, female characters, and also images of actual incarcerated women—and how these images function in exchange for viewership for Netflix and OITNB. </jats:p>",

As these institutions have ventured onto media platforms very unlike traditional broadcast radio and television, discussions about the scope of their activities have flourished. The case of the internet clearly illustrates the emerging challenges. How have public service broadcasters approached the internet? How do regulatory frameworks relate to the wider remits? Is it public service media online? This article presents a comparative study of three Western European mainly publicly funded broadcasters' activities on the internet, their arguments in support of them, the role of competitors, and actual regulatory frameworks they relate to. It scrutinizes how different forms of regulations affect the developments. Based on the findings, the article outlines remaining problematic issues for national regulation of public broadcasters' online services and suggests how researches might get a better grasp of public service media online. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "I have always thought that the title of this journal indicated a certain lack of confidence about television, and notice that ‘television’ has disappeared completely in the anniversary invitation to contribute a piece on ‘My Media Studies’. This invitation encourages the programmatic, the manifesto, and the speculative. Instead, I want to employ the anecdotal to reflect in on the way in which technologies of the future (or, actually, in this case, the recent past), affect the ways in which we understand the media – such as television – of the twentieth century in the twenty-first.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that ABC’s After School Specials (1972—95) employed a “rehabilitative approach” in representing teen problems and addressing teen viewers. The Specials represented coming of age by consistently linking heterosexuality with able-bodiedness and metaphorically representing adolescence as a process of “overcoming disability.” This rehabilitative approach united television’s “turn toward relevance” with educational and sexually themed programming strategies from the era to create hybridized television content and a narrative structure that addressed teen viewers and teen sexuality proactively rather than protectively. Articulating insights from disability studies to television studies, this article suggests that this strategy also rehabilitated television’s image: the Specials’ disability narratives redefined both teen television viewing and teen sexuality as productive rather than damaging. This article also historicizes the constitution of the “teen viewer” as a self-regulating proto-citizen while it examines how this series negotiated the complex terrain of teen sexuality, representations of disability, and an assertion of commercial television’s educational value. </jats:p>",

Drawing on interviews with TV industry practitioners and market researchers, I examine the impact of institutional beliefs and practices on the production of lesbian programming. Based on these interviews and investigation of the contemporary cable and marketing industries, I consider the use of lesbian programming as a method for targeting cable’s increasingly fragmented audiences. I use the basic cable network Bravo and the premium cable network Showtime as case studies, positing an emerging trend in television: cable channels use lesbian programming to tap into multiple markets. What I have termed multicasting, targeting several distinct audience demographics, provides a framework for understanding why lesbian images are commodifiable in the postnetwork cable TV landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The U.S. dominance of the international television marketplace has long been a central focus for media scholars and policy leaders concerned with television’s impact on national culture. Thus, research on the export of U.S. television programs has focused almost exclusively on its “one-way flow,” and relatively little scholarly attention has been devoted to how programming from abroad fares in the United States or to how U.S. dominance in the global arena is affected as the industry adapts its products for export. This article contributes to the theoretical and empirical “opening up” of the cultural imperialism approach by considering how the U.S. television industry is influenced by program trends from abroad. In particular, it examines the impact of Latin American telenovelason the U.S. daytime soap opera genre in the context of shifts during the past decade in the demographics of the U.S. population and changes in the practices and tastes of television audiences. </jats:p>",

Most importantly, however, the cinemas of transactions does not represent a radical break from past configurations of cinematic and audiovisual promotional history; rather (as the name suggests), it represents the continuation of a relationship initiated at the inception of cinema history. </jats:p>",

The rise of production centers around the world and the increase in contra-flows fueled claims that television had entered a new era, one with unfettered circulation of programs in all directions. The United States is central to such discussions, both as an exporter of products and as a proponent of free trade, but such contra-flows have not reached American soil. The debut fall schedules for the mainstream broadcast networks over six seasons, 2004—5 through 2009—10, reveal a total absence of finished programs from outside the United States. There were imported program formats, including fictional dramas and comedies, but no finished programs. The analysis also shows the market dominance of six media conglomerates, with an ownership interest in between 85.9 and 94.7 percent of the attributable programs on the debut schedules of the networks. </jats:p>",

I reflect on increases in ethical regulation and the role of ethics review panels. Drawing on original data from empirical research I examine some of the ethical issues that arise in studies of family life with particular attention to qualitative mixed methods research and the use of psychosocial approaches. I propose that multilayered in-depth approaches require us to consider carefully ethical standpoints, affecting how we thread together individual and/or family case studies. Unsettling stories in research on emotional–social worlds refine our understandings of 'harm' and 'distress' and reconfigure ideas of 'responsible knowing'. Qualitative mixed methods research situates 'messy', conflicting and unfavourable data as part of ordinary parenthood, reformulating ethical and epistemological dilemmas for researchers of personal lives.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates whether social media in general—using Facebook as an example—warrant identification of a new public sphere, another private sphere, or a different corporate sphere, as some scholars have argued. It is argued that social media platforms neither warrant a recalibration of Habermas’ public sphere, nor a conscious blending of spheres. Rather, social media platforms form a contested space where private, public and corporate interests compete to produce new norms of sociality and connectivity. In order to understand the dynamics of social media, it is not enough to revamp existing social theory of networks, to polish up legal frames, or to reintroduce political-economic schemes. We need to connect these theories and come up with an analytical model that accounts for the complexities of the various interests interpenetrating the new space of mediated communication. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Big Brother",
    "abstract": "Since its launch in 1999, Big Brother has become that rare cultural phenomenon that brings the role of television and new media into the heart of public debate. Devised by Jon De Mol in The Netherlands, the Big Brother “project” was soon one of the most successful franchises in television history. As a sociocultural phenomenon, it inspired much discussion about the meaning and function of television and the internet at the turn of the century. In this issue, we attempt to put the series into context by presenting a series of papers that reflect on its success. Our aim is to connect the program to the larger shifts within television in what John Corner describes in this issue as postdocumentary culture. One of the first questions that arises concerns the question of genre: what exactly is Big Brother? A documentary, a game show, or a psychological experiment? Perhaps the safest answer is to say that Big Brother is a typical product of our commercially oriented age in being a hybrid, a combination of various genres designed to maximize audiences. Like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, what makes the format such a creative business proposition is that it has been imported into countries where their own national characteristics can be revealed. The newness of the format has passed some critics by. Instead they choose to fulminate about the role of television as a corrupting influence on both those watching and those participating. In this version, Big Brother represents a further “dumbing-down” of culture. In many ways, it is seen as a more damaging form of “reality TV.” Critics argue that the production and consumption of such an exploitative program does not reflect well on any nation that screens it. In France, police used tear gas to disperse protestors who believed that the show undermined public morals. As Ernst Mathijs shows in his article on critical responses to Big Brother in Belgium,",

The digital and analogue platforms construct a space that is inhabitable by fans, one in which to express their own desires.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Focusing on the televising of Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary, this article elucidates, and ultimately complicates, the notion of Russian media complicity in a state-led national identity mission in which the city's mythology is used to (re)integrate prerevolutionary imperial tradition with Soviet ritual and Western ideology. It draws on Dayan and Katz's notion of media event and on Bakhtin's concepts of chronotope and carnival that facilitate this particular media event's cultural contextualization. The analysis reveals how television articulates a distinctive Saint Petersburg space-time accommodating an ideologically sanitized national carnival of popular participation, but also a local identity project that, precisely by offsetting the latter, authenticates it. It further identifies the rudiments of a generic model for televising national celebrations. Through the metatextuality characterizing that model, the medium inscribes itself into the participatory process it describes, confirming that, far from suppressing democratic rhetoric, Russian television internalizes it, recasting it for nation-building purposes. </jats:p>",

It asks what changes when we frame the discussion of male streaming labor around affect, and what is gained from thinking about streaming labor as a product and producer of norms and desires. Though a growing number of scholars have considered the roles of labor generally and affective labor in particular on Twitch, less attention has been spent on the particular role of masculinity in a space where the majority of streamers and viewers are male. This paper argues that male Twitch streamers ought to be understood as performing an inherently intimate and affective relational labor that produces and is produced by homosocial desire and the reification of geek masculinity, in addition to the affective labor of performance. </jats:p>",

We formulate this agenda in the context of the rapid datafication of society, amid emerging technologies, including the Internet of Things, and following a transformative decade, which overlapped with the pervasion of social media, proliferation of connected gadgets, and growing interest in and concern about big data. The agenda we formulate includes substantial and intellectual priorities concerning intrusive technologies, critical data literacies, labour, co-option, and resistance, and argues for the need for research on these matters, in the interest of audiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the moral and ethical implications of television representation in a global age. It focuses on the role of the television industry in challenging and changing the distance between the remote and proximate, the foreign and familiar. The emphasis is on the institutional processes that enable as well as circumscribe these sorts of presentations. At the core are economic collaborations for the making of television documentaries made by television practitioners of different nations and cultures. In this space of social and political communication, the collaborating parties who are geographically, materially, and culturally distant from each other negotiate these distances as well as the distances between the subjects being presented (the alien viewed) and their audience (the distant viewers). The method applied is “participant observation.” The focal point of this approach is an annual event— the Israeli Forum of CoProductions—at which producers from different countries hammer out collaborations. Findings show that the interlocutors are designing the distance between the strange and familiar, the distant and near—challenging and changing it while simultaneously preserving and perpetuating it. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Movie theaters typically appear adjacent to discussions of new media. Although there has been work on digital cinema, we shift the focus from the digitization of the medium to the digitization of the theatrical audience and analyze the movie theater as new media. To do so, we look at the historical and contemporary strategies for digitizing the theatrical audience of a prominent theater chain. We identify common media of digitization, including credit cards, computerized point-of-sale systems, and loyalty programs. The origins of these techniques and imperatives trace back to the 1970s and 1980s, even as they take on new forms today. We then analyze the industrial logics of audience digitization and emergent communication and data collection methods. Finally, we analyze the movie theater as a platform, showing both the relevance of movie theaters and the challenges their inclusion as an object of study poses for contemporary platform studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article follows a comparative perspective on media narratives and practices pertaining to India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi, previously Chief Minister of the Indian State of Gujarat, and Turkey’s former Prime Minister and current President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. I argue that both have attained a current position of nearly opposition-free leadership by buttressing a “people’s unity” of those who believe in the reliability of particular information. Modi has achieved this by successfully avoiding journalistic and legal investigation into his actions and politics ever since the mass-mediated, anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat 2002, supporting, instead, the people’s confidence in their own capacity to identify the “truth.” Modi, thus, democratically procured his own intangibility. Erdoğan, in contrast, is more vulnerable to democratic opposition, even though he successfully claims to provide his supporters legal and moral guidance against the historically adversarial and nationalist-secular media system and against critical information about himself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores Chinese fans’ use of WeChat in the televised spectatorship of European football. Drawing on the data from in-depth interviews and participant observations, I demonstrate how WeChat as a second screen affords a form of virtual collectivity among fans that transforms the individualized and rational viewing of television football. In particular, this virtual collectivity normalizes the privacy and propriety of emotional expressions and in turn refrains intimacy and sense of community among fans of the same club. I also argue that WeChat draws Chinese fans to this virtual collectivity during public game-viewing in real life, which disrupts the potential face-to-face interactions and solidarity among the onsite fans. This case offers implications for the role of second screens in the glocalization of sports consumption in reforming China. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates a new, popular, award-winning reality television show, Your Home Made Perfect. Drawing on insights from Sara Ahmed’s work on the promise of happiness, our thematic analysis of nineteen episodes of Your Home shows how architectural entertainment is uniquely positioned through its use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology to circulate happiness and uplifting emotions and to critique the power imbalances of architect-client relationships. The paper argues how Your Home foregrounds happy emotions to the re-design of homes, where emotions are mobilized through design visualizations that turn both home and architects into “happy objects.” Moreover, through “happy objects,” this property television show seeks to deflect anxieties of housing precarity and growing wealth disparity. Finally, the paper reveals how architectural TV entertainment reinforces regressive ideas of identity and home ownership. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> House Hunters is an American lifestyle TV program that focuses on home buying. Across episodes, the program represents a wide range of buyers—singles and couples, married and not, with and without children, gay and straight, young and old. Families are often multiracial, multiethnic, or international. The program mobilizes diverse buyers, budgets, and locations, representing the American domestic real estate market in terms of variety and difference. As these buyers assess homes, ideas about domestic needs, comforts, and ideals proliferate—ideas that carry specific gender implications. Through repetition, these gender differences accrue weight as familiar cultural touchstones. The conventional gendered domestic territory exists in tension with the program’s emphasis on inclusiveness and diversity, as all kinds of people buy houses across the United States. With this tension, House Hunters provokes multiple and variable fantasies of American mobility, domesticity, security, and adventure through narratives of house hunting and home ownership. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study provides a select thick reading of how the moral contagion that followed the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast during the broadcast of the 2004 Super Bowl moved into the commercial realm. It is framed by an assessment of how the Super Bowl was “super-cooled” by the “moral panic” that followed the Jackson incident. Super Bowl commercials, usually “celebrated” in postmortems of the broadcast, came under closer moral interrogation. To understand the cultural fallout and “cooled environment” that ensued, a critical approach that blends concerns over “communicative dirt,” the characterized reader, and ethical criticism is used in the analysis of four commercials that were “banned” from the 2005 Super Bowl broadcast. Conclusions focus on dynamics of moral contagion in the Jackson incident and its likely impact on moral contours of the public sphere in light of changed notions of “banned” texts in the internet era and selectivity in processes that lead to cooling. </jats:p>",

Race, the legacy of racial injustice, and anonymity are major themes found throughout the series, which highlight the complicated nature of social control and the infrastructural legacy of racism. The mask itself is a site of struggle with polarizing calls for freedom from the mask as tyranny and freedom through the mask as safety, all during a public health crisis. In Watchmen, the deployment of infrastructural control and the implications of masking and unmasking are enacted through racist ideologies and promises of safety through anonymity. </jats:p>",

It puts forth the argument that music videos stimulate public discourse because of their capacity to (1) promote ideas and make them visible, (2) conjure up several meanings and interpretations, and (3) circulate through “hypermedia space,” a communicative space created by networked broadcast, mobile, and online platforms. The analysis of the circulation of contentious public discourse around WA leads to the conclusion that music videos are best understood as instruments of visibility in a symbolic economy that suffers from attention scarcity. </jats:p>",

The article explicates how Chinese producers followed the “bible” of format production, differentiated ideological points of contestation, and modified narratives contradictory to Chinese ideology in the localization process. Ugly Betty’s localization reflects the political, cultural, and commercial imperatives in China. The producers recreated a televised drama with its own unique Chinese modernity, which invited a large spectatorship within the boundary of the current politico-social landscape. It also initiated an innovative marketing model that could maximize profits through format localization. As a new industry development strategy, TV formatting brings western values into China and is changing the landscape of Chinese TV. </jats:p>",

These interactions are examined using interviews and participant observations through three case studies—(1–2) Integration of two independent web-content creator groups into mainstream Israeli television system and (3) integration of ultra-Orthodox filmmakers into mainstream Israeli cinema system. The findings show that stiff and flexible systems are two main forms of characterizing relations between alternative and mainstream systems—defined based on the specific interests and implications for each media system, including integrated content, producer perceptions, and audience reception. It includes themes of recognition, conservatism, novelty, freedom, and authenticity. The interactions reveal processes of diffusion or symbiosis of the source system’s products. The findings contribute to a theoretical model of media interactions that offers ways of examining and defining the characteristics of media system interactions. </jats:p>",

I take a case study approach, performing a content analysis of the videos from three political YouTubers from January 1, 2017, to April 1, 2018. My analysis reveals that for these influencers, micro-celebrity practices are not only a business strategy but also a political stance that positions them as more credible than mainstream media. All three conflate the mainstream media with “social justice” politics, claiming both are sensationalized and silence dissenting voices. By adopting micro-celebrity practices that stress relatability, authenticity, and accountability, they differentiate themselves from both the mainstream media and progressive politics as they perceive them. Thus, the YouTubers in this study align micro-celebrity practices with a reactionary political standpoint. These findings complicate previous mythologies of Internet celebrity that treat participatory culture as inherently progressive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The labor of video game testers has barely registered within political-economic analyses of work practices in the game industry. This article addresses this gap through a critical deployment of the concept of precarity and its multiform nature experienced by game testers. Drawing on Harry Braverman’s concept of “degradation of labor,” I aim to contribute to media labor literature by introducing the concept of “degradation of fun,” where testers are alienated from play and forced to develop instrumental and selective ways of play. I make the argument that as opposed to popular representations, game testing is a decidedly precarious labor, due to its assumed low-skill status, and because of the existence of a large reserve army of labor, which depresses the wages and renders testers expendable. Ultimately, the “immateriality” and joy of testing as labor comes with material physical and bodily pains, and sentiments of second-class citizenship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article works from the established assumption that narratives produced for local audiences are always going to operate in some relation to established discourses of local or national cultural identities. In the case of Australian television soap opera, this is not in any way a radical assumption, given the format’s routine construction of a recognizable version of the local-everyday as the ground on which its narratives are staged. In this article, the author argues that it is likely, in the case of certain versions of reality TV that draw on the soap opera format for their narrative and formal structures, that reality TV’s representations of the real and the everyday are going to operate similarly—indigenizing even the most international of formats and genres. Thus, the way to examine “the local” in the “global” may well be through mapping processes of appropriation and adaptation rather than through the proposition of any thoroughgoing specificity or uniqueness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although most massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) remain entrenched in a binary system of gendered avatars, the limited representational framework of avatar creation is only one among many different strategies for what sociologists refer to as “doing gender.” This essay explores how a doing gender approach might be useful for analyzing the interactive dimensions of gender play in the rich communicative environments of MMOs. Specifically, this essay explores how players do (or do not) hold one another accountable to sex category membership through their interactions, in so doing either reproducing or resisting normative forms of gender. A doing gender approach, I argue, holds out the promise of being held accountable to a different set of rules for doing gender—of doing gender differently or, in a more utopian sense, perhaps doing away with it altogether. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper explores how visual affective practice is used to spread and bolster a nationalist, extremist and racist ethos on the public Facebook page of the anti-immigrant group, Soldiers of Odin. Affective practice refers to a particular sensibility of political discourse, shaped by social formations and digital technologies—the contexts in which political groups or communities gather, discuss and act. The study shows how visual affective practice and sharing and responding to images fortify moral claims, sense exclusionary solidarity and promote white nationalist masculinity which legitimizes racist practices of “soldiering.” By examining both the representations and their reactions (emoticons), the study demonstrates how ideas and values are collectively strengthened through affective sharing and are supported by platform infrastructures. Most importantly, it demonstrates that instead of considering the affect of protecting the nation as a natural result of “authentic” gut feeling, we should understand the ways it is purposefully and collectively produced and circulated. </jats:p>",

It highlights the increasing connectedness of digital data tracking, aggregation, and analytics across domains that include and move beyond media, as data are increasingly combined and shared across diverse digital spaces. Thus, it connects media and communications scholarship concerned with datafication to debates in other related and overlapping fields, as part of the larger project of building data studies as an interdisciplinary and critical field. It briefly introduces the papers in the special issue, all of which constitute detailed empirical investigations that ground the study of data power in specific, material contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Wellington, New Zealand is a major international screen production base for movies including Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. New Zealand production companies like Jackson’s Weta Group producing content for international markets benefit from local policy settings that support such productions. In 2008, a group of long-time Jackson collaborators including Richard Taylor established Pukeko Pictures. In a small country with a deregulated media system, no dedicated public service broadcaster, and minimal supports for children’s television, Pukeko is a successful, globally oriented producer of children’s content. This article examines the strategies that underpin Pukeko Pictures’ production portfolio, which includes the 2015 reboot Thunderbirds Are Go, and a preschool coproduction with China. The combination of dispersed production practices, local subsidies, and quality infrastructure contribute to Pukeko Pictures’ success. We suggest, however, that strategic international relationships managed by Taylor are also critical to Pukeko Pictures developing a significant foothold in transnational television services. </jats:p>",

The article analyzes biometrics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain as part of a technological assemblage, which I term the biometric assemblage. The article identifies five intersecting logics that explain wider transformations within the humanitarian sector and in turn shape the biometric assemblage. The acceleration of the rate of biometric registrations in the humanitarian sector between 2002 and 2019 reveals serious concerns regarding bias, data safeguards, data-sharing practices with states and commercial companies, experimentation with untested technologies among vulnerable people, and, finally, ethics. Technological convergence amplifies risks associated with each constituent technology of the biometric assemblage. The article finally argues that the biometric assemblage accentuates asymmetries between refugees and humanitarian agencies and ultimately entrenches inequalities in a global context. </jats:p>",

Using the concept “cultural oxymora,” contradictions that serve to negotiate meanings, the analysis examines the case through six lenses: pluralism (stressing the institutionalized pluralism by auditioning in Israeli and Jewish communities outside the country), performance (songs that are associated with the Jewish State’s bereavement rituals while adding a counterhegemonic vocal presentation), patriotism (nationalism and the military in the transnational format), periphery (exposing its ethnic richness while using stereotypes), participation (manufacturing consumers’ “democratic” election), and promotion (national media event of coronation with ordinary characteristics). The conclusions suggest that cultural oxymora may explain the appeal of reality TV since they support a complex inclusive interpretation of the shows that maintain a dialogue between neo-Marxist readings, emphasizing a critical view on the show’s commercial-hegemonic structure, on one hand, and reception-centered readings, stressing audiences’ gratifications and pleasures, on the other.</jats:p>",

This North-in-South divide plays out internally within Australia given its status as a British settler-colonial society which continues to perpetrate imperial and colonial practices vis-à-vis the Indigenous peoples and vis-à-vis Australia’s neighboring countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This article draws on and discusses five seminal examples forming a case study on Australia to examine big data practices through the lens of Southern Theory from a criminological perspective. We argue that Australia’s use of big data cements its status as a North-in-South environment where colonial domination is continued via modern technologies to effect enduring informational imperialism and digital colonialism. We conclude by outlining some promising ways in which data practices can be decolonized through Indigenous Data Sovereignty but acknowledge these are not currently the norm; so Australia’s digital colonialism/coloniality endures for the time being. </jats:p>",

The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the “natural” conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit. Data colonialism paves the way for a new stage of capitalism whose outlines we only glimpse: the capitalization of life without limit. </jats:p>",

Systematically examining 104 articles, we address three research questions: Which geographical contexts, platforms, and methods do researchers engage with in studies of racism and hate speech on social media? To what extent does scholarship draw on critical race perspectives to interrogate how systemic racism is (re)produced on social media? What are the primary methodological and ethical challenges of the field? The article finds a lack of geographical and platform diversity, an absence of researchers’ reflexive dialogue with their object of study, and little engagement with critical race perspectives to unpack racism on social media. There is a need for more thorough interrogations of how user practices and platform politics co-shape contemporary racisms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the globalization of the telenovela format in relation to issues of adaptation, proximities, and national identities. As a case study of glocalized telenovelas, it deals with the domestic adaptation of one of the most popular Latin American telenovelas, Yo soy Betty, la fea (1999-2001), into the “telenovelle” Sara (2007-2008), which takes place in a Belgian (more specifically Flemish) context. Therefore, this article specifically asks how Flemish identities are represented through the production process of Sara. While examining the international flow of telenovelas and the cross-cultural adaptation of the telenovela format, this case study considers an additional geopolitical and cultural context, as well as confronts and combines thematic textual analysis with expert interviews. Considering the successful export of “canned” telenovelas and the adaptation of this format within the framework of national identity and identification, this article deals with the emergence of the telenovelle as a local genre that is inspired by, and modifies, the original Latin American format. </jats:p>",

By focusing on the interplays between these dualities, this article aims to underscore the modalities of power and political possibilities of dissent in Istanbul, Turkey. Data-based smart city apparatuses are supposed to at once fix infrastructural breakdown and stabilize the socio-political order. However, during the Gezi protests of 2013, the integrated tactics of sabotage in urban space and data vandalism in the digital realm undermined both data control by the state and its political authority. Yet Gezi’s example also shows that hyperconnectivity, data motility, and virality by themselves do not necessarily lead to more meaningful participation in urban politics. </jats:p>",

Because of signal fidelity, screen size, presence, and the rights to air top-tier sports events, television is likely to remain the medium of choice for fans ready to watch live sports. Fans will use newer media, with their interactive options and affordance of agency to supplement and enhance their viewing experience. Although traditional and newer media are competing for fan attention and advertising dollars, use of these media for live sports is not a zero-sum game. This may not be the case for sports journalism and related programming about sports where, over time, fans may turn to newer media at the expense of the old. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Broadcast television has most often been understood as a site for the narration of unified national identity. But at the same time, it has been associated with the development of diversified cultural citizenship. This article considers some of the issues arising from situations in which cultural identities have clashed with national ones, especially the case of Indigenous issues on Australian television. The evolution of new forms of citizenship is matched by post-broadcast forms of television, in which audiences can be seen as organized around choice, affinity, and the production as well as consumption of media. These developments have powerful implications for the way nations are narrated in broadcast television and for our understanding of how television itself is evolving. The article argues that Indigeneity points the way to new notions of both nation and television. </jats:p>",

Faced with falling industry profits, ballooning production costs, and music television stations that cared more about ratings, music videos no longer enjoyed the industry support they once had. But as music videos were being sidelined by the music and television industries, they were rapidly becoming integral to online video aggregates and social media sites. The “days of the $600,000 video” might be gone, but in recent years, a new music video culture and economy has emerged. Exploring how music videos are being used, how they are being made, and how money is being made from them, the article not only documents the impact that digital convergence has had on music videos but it also describes the lingering role that older music and media industry paradigms might play in shaping the future of online video. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through the ethnographic survey of the ownership, use, and display of television-related devices of forty households in Singapore, this article frames the concept of Skeuomorphic Domestic Television. This term describes the continued centrality of the traditional “living room television” amid digital media’s portability. Results from the stocktaking of the ownership of television-related devices in the surveyed households point to the narrowing of the digital divide arising from the greater affordability of media technologies. However, within the highly densely populated city-state, it was found that social distinctions from television cultures were maintained in the skeuomorphic luxury of the “TV-Sofa space” in living rooms of surveyed households. Such a space that distinguishes individuals watching television in cluttered rooms against the more communal viewing practices in designated spacious living rooms characterizes the “Analog Spatial Divide” of skeuomorphic domestic television cultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article argues for creating a mutually beneficial connection between postcolonial and television studies in order to understand how imperial legacies have shaped contemporary television regions. What it contributes to this work, more specifically, is the beginnings of a postcolonial account of intra-European broadcast regions. As both the original center of colonialism and the site of recent global economic, social and cultural crises, Europe is a major reference point in such attempts to re-historicize “empire” in order to understand industrial and ideological configurations within present-day media regions. I zoom in on three examples to highlight the imperial layers that have informed television in Europe: industrial collaborations between East and West, the imperial vestiges of 1960s to 1970s historical adventure series, and the imperial connections that tie together forms of TV comedy across Europe. The three examples demonstrate an opportunity to bypass the obligatory nation-state framework and begin to write the region’s history of television in a postcolonial, regional, and European perspective, outlining the imperial legacies of aesthetic, infrastructural and economic factors that underscore all cultural industries in the region. </jats:p>",

This leads activists and everyday feminists to the need to negotiate digital dis/connection in their everyday lives. This article explores the affective dimensions of social media dis/connection in feminist contexts, grounding it on 22 in-depth interviews with people engaged with online feminisms and activisms in the Portuguese context. The article foregrounds the relationship between digital activisms and different affective ambiences, both internal and platform-driven. It explores the pressures felt by activists, the sense of disillusionment that paradoxically co-exists with discourses of political potential of social media, and, finally, practices of partial or temporary disconnection that emerge as means to negotiate the affective ambivalences of digital activism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2011, the U.K. government announced that the national meteorological agency would be releasing a significant volume of data as part of its Open Data policy agenda. This article explores the interrelationship between this announcement and efforts to boost the competitiveness of the United Kingdom’s weather derivatives industry. Primary qualitative data are analyzed to produce a genealogical account of these policy developments, and Braman’s concept of “informational power” is used to frame a critical narrative of the broader dynamics of power at play. We argue that although there have been significant tensions around efforts to open the United Kingdom’s weather data, these have largely been absorbed by and, ultimately, contained within the hegemonic structures of the United Kingdom’s neoliberal state. We conclude by arguing that this struggle needs to be broadened and externalized beyond the state so that critical questions about the deepening data-driven financialization of climate change can be addressed. </jats:p>",

Thus, the questions of how images in television news are contextualized, complemented, displaced, explained, or contradicted by the auditory channel and linguistic messages on the screen have not been studied extensively. Based on an exploratory content analysis of CNN, MSNBC, and FOX News coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina, the author categorizes the interplay between the three modes of information transmission in the broadcast news: moving footage (iconic messages), on-screen textual elements (linguistic messages), and voiceover (audio messages). The analysis identifies six organizing categories: (1) polysemy reduction, (2) meaning attainment through audio, (3) reinforcement, (4) contextualization and acquiring meaning, (5) contradiction, and (6) slogano-symbolism. These categories provide an interpretative framework for visual analyses of television news and offer new directions for research. </jats:p>",

This article examines the new, market-oriented business practices within American public television that emphasize the building of brand identity. Since the mid-1990s, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has sought to extend its brand beyond broadcast television and cash in on consumer loyalty to PBS. This branding strategy targets an audience of consumers, and it sells both \"content\" and an image to these consumers. This is part of a broader strategy aimed at leveraging the PBS brand to create new revenue streams by licensing the PBS logo, selling new forms of advertising, and developing several PBS brandname product lines. After mapping the contours of this new strategy, the article explores the consequences of the brand-building approach for the future of public service broadcasting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The trend in media conglomeration has run at the speed of light over the past couple of decades, accelerated by the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In the midst of merger-mania the internet appeared to be a wide-open media terrain until America Online’s (AOL) acquisition of Time Warner. In light of this recent development between old and new media, this article will apply a critical political, economic, and theoretical framework to this emerging media environment by examining corporate ownership of Internet portal sites and search engines. As corporate presence on the Internet has increased, source diversity appears to decrease. Just after the 1996 Act became law, then Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Reed Hundt had raised concern over fostering four different notions of diversity: outlet diversity, source diversity, voice diversity, and program diversity (Hundt 1996). Two of these concepts apply directly to the recent course of media conglomeration: outlet diversity, which refers to “the number of separately owned media outlets” and source diversity, which concerns the number of “programming producers” or content producers (Hundt 1996). The term “source diversity” will be used here to imply the number of separately owned media outlets, as well as the number of content producers. Corporate concentration subsists in practically all major media (broadcast television, cable television, radio, newspapers, magazines, book publishers, record distributors, etc.), which",

As media begin to transform themselves from traditional to new, it is imperative for content to adapt itself structurally as well. This textual analysis of Quarterlife is based on the theoretical background of Bolter and Grusin’s remediation theory. Through this research, a better understanding is gained regarding how structural elements need to be altered across media. The content of Quarterlife catered to a very small niche audience, but these elements do not translate well to a wider television audience. It is apparent that Quarterlife incorporated elements of both hypermediacy and transparent immediacy. However, these elements were disproportional, possibly leading to its failure as a television series. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> I collected data from political social media pages to show how memes serve as means to engage in heated “nation-talk.” Contending claims are made through memes on the identity of an “Indian” and on the sense of belonging to India. I collected memes over a period of twenty months from two overtly political Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands of followers. After multiple rounds of coding and filtering we arrived at a final sample of memes to be studied in depth. The memes, from opposing political sides, draw inter-textual component elements from the same popular culture, mythology etc. Through the repetition of specific components, slogans etc. these memes exclude certain claims of belonging to India while enforcing others. Key to this repetition are the circulatory dynamics of memes over digital networks, and their performative aspects. India’s history emerges as a significant battleground for these memes. </jats:p>",

Although the Angelus is TV you are not supposed to watch, the document archives at Radió Teleifís Éireann offer plenty of rich evidence that people have always watched the Angelus closely, that they feel a personal stake in its modes of representation, and that they approach religious images as statements about religion and the Church. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the hectic context of 2020 America, television became a salve for many, while an increased middle-class emphasis on staying at home to mitigate COVID-19 spread softly benefited streaming services’ bottom lines. Ted Lasso (AppleTV+, 2020-2023) was beloved for its positive outlook and comforting tone during these unsettled times. This paper discusses three “discursive mantras” which white Ted Lasso fans deploy in interviews about the series, and argues that fans use these to code their engagement with television as acceptable and necessary. In their description of the series’ impact, white fans use Ted Lasso as an escape, but also as a way of thinking through the nation’s political, racial, and medical crises. In so doing, they reveal the position of white comfort viewers during the early pandemic, a group who are living through vast cultural unrest but privileged enough to be soothed by television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Facebook page of the anti-copyright The Pirate Bay (TPB) explains much about the group in few words. “We like copies,” it explains, “just don’t let the others fool you.” The paradoxical phrase reveals the contradictions of TPB. Their use of “copies” deliberately chaffs with their opponents who equate piracy with theft of intellectual property. Pirates copy digital bits; they do not steal intellectual property. Championing copying is problematic for a group at the center of the Piracy Movement. The warning that “others [might] fool you” acknowledges the tensions brought about by celebrating copying while depending on their privileged voice. This article addresses these contradictions by describing TPB as an assemblage defined by conflicting forces of centripetal pull and centrifugal push. Understanding the contradictions of TPB offers greater insights into the challenges faced by other Hacktivism groups as they struggle for political change and legitimacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This special issue concentrates on a dominant trend in contemporary transnational crime television: quality dramas featuring serial criminals who break the bodies/psyches of young women or children, thereby attracting the inquiries of female detectives who have suffered trauma themselves. This trend has generated resources, industrial partnerships, avid viewers, and, importantly for the authors here, feminist commentary across continents. We reframe the debate over whether these shows are feminist or misogynist by exploring staples of transnational language that underwrite their popularity in disparate national markets. In fact, we address the paradoxical gender-based violence and female empowerment at their core as crucial to their transnational legibility by tracking recurring elements that circulate a gendered and raced lingua franca rooted in fundamentals of media aesthetics: strategies of storytelling and genre, modes of perception, and the production of affect. Ultimately, these programs raise questions about cultural currencies of televised feminism in the digital era. </jats:p>",

This article analyzes media texts, government plans, corporate narratives, and infrastructure data to examines two ways that transnational media, such as K-dramas, function as cultural interfaces to disseminate and operationalize the infrastructural desires in the Philippines. First, Philippine internet service providers (ISPs) co-opt Netflix’s language of internet speed as a criterion of infrastructural quality, trying to secure the country’s public and economic recognition in Southeast Asia. Second, through the collaboration, local ISPs successfully translate K-drama’s cultural power into a public campaign presenting high-speed internet as not merely desirable, but a predestined future for digital consumers and the developing nation. </jats:p>",

It then looks forward to recent work in the sociology of expectations, to consider the role of future predictions. The article concludes that audience research is perhaps not a field or a discipline, although the aspiration to be so is not altogether a bad thing. The article suggests that the best destiny for the field is to be a rogue element within the broader media, communication, and cultural studies domain, demanding—and providing—empirical evidence in the face of normatively charged claims. </jats:p>",

Constructed as such, these media are seldom considered in the mainstream as having an impact on social incorporation, and media and opinions in the larger U.S. public sphere. Based on field research conducted in Detroit and Los Angeles, this article challenges such notions, showing how Spanish-language television, when utilized as a place-making tool as well as a source of local and national information, can contribute to viewers’ resilience, sense of self, and sociopolitical expression through media enfranchisement. In contrast to other studies that emphasize textual analysis or media enterprises in the aggregate, this article takes a meso-level approach, focusing on the differences made for Latinx communities by innovation in media access, reception strategies, and outreach by media professionals, along with the qualitative improvement of audiovisual representation. </jats:p>",

Profit-driven manipulation of online conversations, including paid posting and the so-called “dark public relations,” is a widespread problem on the Chinese Internet. Governmental regulation on paid posting, however, is ambiguous and inadequate. This research proposes a new approach to conceptualize paid posting. It argues that paid posting is a controversial form of content production that emerges in relation to market-oriented exploitation of the media as well as commodification of communicative labor in digital settings. On this basis, this research analyzes the law’s role in the installation of market relations in digital media. It argues that the ambiguous regulation of paid posting is part of a long-term problem that resulted from media policies that prioritize economic growth and political control over disruptive impacts of the market. </jats:p>",

We present the subjective dimension of the mode of production (cooperative labor), the objective dimension of the mode of production (common ownership of the means of production), and the subject–object dimension of the mode of production (the effects and products of the mode of production). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Patriarchal bargains have been studied in many settings as a strategy that helps women circumvent constraints and forge spaces for individual empowerment. Despite the growing use of mediated communication, little is known about how patriarchal bargains are enacted and realized within online interactions such as in discussion forums. By analyzing how Chinese unwed single mothers renegotiate the state’s oppressive population control and gender policies through their online activity, this study proposes the concept of “online patriarchal bargain” to extend patriarchal bargain theory to women’s Internet use. It further explores linkages between social support and patriarchal bargain to elucidate how support is integral to enacting agency in the face of forbidding systemic constraints. The findings also delve into the role of therapeutic culture in the day-to-day experiences of women, especially those in marginalized communities. </jats:p>",

    "title": "My “Middle Way” Media Studies",
    "abstract": "I would argue that the problems that contemporary capitalism gives rise to are not the result of the classic exercise of power and hegemony characteristic of the monopoly phase of capitalism but of the “creative destruction” of such a phase. Schumpeter’s famous phrase is reflective of Lash and Urry’s (1987) notion of “disorganised capitalism” or of Robert Reich’s (2007) claim that large corporations have significantly less power now than three decades ago. The consequence is that there is a need to explore an economic “middle way” in debates about the narrative of the relationship between culture and economy, between the Scylla of total explanatory political economy and the Charybdis of tedium-by-case-study. This involves a Schumpeterian emphasis on entrepreneurial or enterprise economics (Cunningham, Banks, and Potts 2008). Schumpeter, in 1962, in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, argued that Marx had “no adequate theory of enterprise” and failed to “distinguish the entrepreneur from the capitalist” (quoted in McCraw 2007: 349). Schumpeter, his most recent biographer, Thomas McCraw, “told of capitalism in the way most people experience it: as consumer desires aroused by endless advertising; as forcible jolts up and down the social pecking order; as goals reached, shattered, altered, then reached once more as people try, try again.” He knew that “creative destruction fosters economic growth but also that it undercuts cherished human values” (p. 6). Schumpeter’s most recent biographer, Thomas McCraw, says that he elucidated what capitalism “really feels like” (as quoted in McCraw 2007: 349, 6).",

The number of television sets has increased, and the number of TV channels has soared as television industries have been privatized and commercialized. New broadcasting systems such as cable and satellite broadcasting industries have also become part of everyday life around the world. This article maps out how the transformation of the global television-industry system can be understood within the larger context of global political-economic shifts and accompanying technological development. Specifically, I explore the changing structure of the broadcasting industry by examining consolidation. That is, I analyze foreign and domestic investment activities of the TV industry through mergers and acquisitions in the past twenty years. I also discuss the role of national governments and domestic communication industries in the transformation of the television system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article departs from the concept of “double articulation” within domestication theory, which views media as both objects and texts. Unfortunately, its empirical application has been problematic because researchers tend to concentrate on the contextual, losing sight of specific meanings of objects and texts. Therefore, we subscribe to the concept of “triple articulation,” viewing the immediate sociospatial context of consumption as a specific articulation. Still, the practical relevance of this concept has been questioned. Therefore, we develop and test a methodology that explicitly incorporates this triple articulation in the field of convergent audiovisual media consumption. The results indicate that audiovisual media technologies are meaningfully articulated as objects, texts, and contexts. Moreover, the devised method, which allows the uncovering of articulation interactions, points out that each articulation is able to contribute independently to consumption meanings. Hence, the variation within objects, texts, and contexts raises questions about what we consider “television.” </jats:p>",

Completing filming after the summer 2020 resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the role of the police is further compromised in Mare of Easttown. I read the show’s episodic anxieties—its increasingly unrealistic plot developments that push at the borders of each episode in order to keep them open—as managing these ambivalences: between stranger and intimate rape; between “crime” and “the family”; between the public and the private; between trust in law enforcement and critique. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Donald Trump, known as a mogul and reality TV celebrity, is presented as horrific in the press now that he wants to be President of the United States, a position requiring controlled and civil behavior, which he cannot master. Comparisons between his candidacy for president and a reality TV show abound, forcing us to contend with the conventions, privileged behaviors and ethics of the current culture of surveillance (which includes reality TV), arising in contexts of surveillance but now exceeding these. The crossover from reality TV celebrity to presidential candidate is troubled, highlighting the uncomfortable intersection of Trump’s whiteness and wealth with his crass behavior. The reality TV genre is seen as trashy, featuring people without class in behavior and often in social and financial status. The presidency, however, is for the elite white upper-middle or upper-class (usually male)—Obama negotiates the politics of respectability to fit this ideal. Popular articulations of Trump demonstrate the uneasy alignment of elite whiteness with white behavior marked as working class or poor, displaying panic about a president unable to exhibit appropriately classed behavior. This dangerously elides the larger machinery that is the government and big business, belying our cultural preoccupation with individualism and obfuscating the systemic. Taking Trump for the system negates how the current machinery has in fact produced a string of Trumps (Palin, Bachmann, Cruz), leaving us longing for the more civil days when white elite men knew how to speak their hatred in a civil manner. </jats:p>",

The practice of adding these captions is far from innocent and is prone to abuse and overuse due to the lack of official guidelines and an evidence base. We conducted a multimodal analysis within the framework of relevance theory to provide an empirically supported insight into the way in which these captions, known as “telop” in Japan, form part of a production’s deliberate and careful media design. Our findings suggest that telop are deployed in conjunction with other communicative resources that are deliberately used to influence viewers’ interpretations, to enhance and make affective values in TV programs more explicit. The increasing use of diegetically integrated captions elsewhere further justifies the need for critical TV and new media research on telop. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article revisits the history of television (TV) formats—concepts of TV shows that are licensed for local adaptations—focusing on scripted entertainment. While the TV format revolution of the 1990s bypassed scripted formats, they have been catching up in recent years. This article analyzes both the reasons for this late rise and the factors behind the recent growth. It argues that the adaptation of scripted formats is more complex, and risks remain higher than for other genres. The underlying economics of their production and distribution also differ from nonscripted formats. The stars aligned when demand for drama increased worldwide, Hollywood studios began to mine their catalogues, new exporters and scripted genres emerged, and knowledge transfer techniques improved. Finally, this paper analyzes the significance of the rise of scripted entertainment in the global TV format trading system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Located at the heart of the University of South Carolina campus is the historic Horseshoe—originally the South Carolina College campus (est. 1801)—a site whose construction during the antebellum years relied on enslaved labor. Ghosts of the Horseshoe is a cross-College, collaborative “critical interactive” for iPad that features the Horseshoe campus and endeavors to make visible this unacknowledged history. The application uses as its dedicated navigational interface a historic 1884 Sanborn Fire Insurance map of the site; participants can also activate a Google Map overlay of the site and determine its degree of opacity with respect to the archival map image. Importantly, however, the two maps do not actually “map” onto each other. This serves as a first mis-mapping of several mis-mappings. This article considers how such mis-mappings, involving geo-locative contingencies, representational disjunctions, and potential dis-locations, mediate site-specific explorations and, as such, make possible alternative historiographic understandings of place. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Italian Ambivalence",
    "abstract": "The horrific footage of the terrorist suicide attacks on the Twin Towers burst onto Italian television screens in the early afternoon of the 11th of September, interrupting the routine programs of soaps and talk shows mostly watched by female audiences. Therefore, in many cases it was women who were the first to be informed and who contacted others at home and outside about what was happening in New York and Washington. But even if in Italy as in every other part of the world nobody had seen or could have foreseen anything similar, the country was not completely unprepared for such a terrible event. I do not intend to refer to any kind of awareness or even the most vague anticipation of a risk of such magnitude and impact, hovering over the United States or elsewhere, that could have been hinted at in the Italian media or public opinion. (That a popular magazine some days before had suggested that the only way to boost the languishing destiny of CNN would be for another—highly unlikely—war to break out is naturally only a fortuitous coincidence rather than a disturbing one.) In saying that the country was not completely unprepared, I refer to both past experiences and collective attitudes, as well as more recent facts of political topicality; both have preestablished and supplied tried and tested ways to react and ready-to-use structures of feeling, which Italians could quickly resort to even in such an unprecedented and unexperienced circumstance. As a consequence, whereas the eruptive event had never been seen before, the reactions were to a great extent déjà vu. As we are dealing with a terrorist attack against symbolic and human targets of the United States, it is necessary above all to cite the Italian relationship both with terrorism and with the United States. For years, Italy has had to live with local political terrorism, above all (but not exclusively from) the extreme left wing, in a not-too-distant past. The last murder by terrorists was in 1999, and many times during the past year there were ominous signs that there could be a return of this",

The specific case studies highlighted in the contributors’ essays discuss gaming in Canada (Engel) and Japan (Hjorth), the traces of racism in South Carolina (Cooley), the topographical footprint of settler colonialism (Zwicker et al), Hong Kong pace (Wilmott), and artistic experiments that use the city as a laboratory (Verhoeff). What holds all of these contributions together is their indebtedness to creative cartography.

    "abstract": "On 30 April 1997, more than 32 million Americans watched Ellen, witnessing television history as Ellen Morgan became television’s first openly homosexual leading character. Amid the controversy and protests, one group of more than four million Americans actively refused to watch the much-hyped episode as part of a nationwide protest. This specific movement, however, was not protesting the program’s representations of sexuality nor reacting to any perceived immoral content within the episode. Rather, the boycott of Ellen was a byproduct of a larger protest against the medium of television itself, as an organization called TV-Free America sponsored its third annual TV-Turnoff Week, coincidentally concluding the day after Ellen’s coming-out party. Founded in 1994, TV-Free America “encourages Americans to reduce, voluntarily and dramatically, the amount of television they watch in order to promote richer, healthier, and more connected lives, families, and communities.” This organization promotes its philosophy of television reduction primarily by sponsoring the National TV-Turnoff Week, encouraging Americans to go without television for one week at the end of each April. These weeks are locally organized through schools, libraries, community councils, and city governments, and they seem to be quite successful, adding approximately one million participants in each successive year; TV-Free America boasts that more than eighteen million people have participated in these weeks since 1995. The TV-Turnoff Week approach has been attempted in various local incarnations since 1974, but TV-Free America has made their focus national. TV-Free America also provides resources and literature advo-",

Although studies on reception are now common regarding television, the reception of documentary is an underexplored area. Typically, documentary theory has placed an emphasis on truth and epistemology; only recently have there been inquiries on audiences. Expanding on the latter contributions, the author looks at critics' reception of the documentary and the way identity and truth related to racialized interpretations of the text. The author's analysis suggests that these viewers responded strongly to the documentary's racial arguments. However, the responses were not determined by the viewer's race. To reconcile this finding with an idea of race as determinant of reception, the author proposes that it is not the viewer's racial identity but the function of race in the viewer's life that determines modes of reception.</jats:p>",

While Barr’s firing may seem like a rarified event, my concern is with the vexed position of the unruly comedienne in a paradoxical cultural moment in which feminist activism has impacted the media industries, yet misogyny and xenophobia are blatantly incarnated in U.S. political leadership. Barr’s brand of unapologetic comedy served as a foundational heuristic for the development of feminist television studies, yet her politics have been increasingly revealed as abhorrent. This article examines this puzzling disconnect between progressive political gains around gender, class, body size, and sexuality in the realm of media personalities, products, and theories, and the seemingly intractable position of regressive racism, a conflation that Barr’s brand of toxic provocation both articulates and underscores. </jats:p>",

We explore the encounter of “social” and “public” on three levels: the level of institution, professional practice, and content.

How can public television profit from the abilities of social media to engage new young audiences (and makers) without compromising public values? And will PSB be able to extend the creation of public value outside its designated space to social media at large? While the boundaries between public and corporate online space are becoming progressively porous, the meaning of “publicness” is contested and reshaped on the various levels of European public broadcasting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Analyzing the Nigerian video industry through the lens of new media theory, this article proposes a genealogy of the Nollywood media format to identify and define its specificities. The films that the industry produces are often referred to as cinema but, compared to the output of other film industries around the world, Nollywood produces something that can be located in between cinema and television. The informality of Nigerian videos’ production and distribution has in fact allowed for the articulation of complex processes of remediation, which have participated in creating an original product, something that I would like to call “small screen cinema.” This media format has had a determinant role in Nollywood’s popular success and its definition is thus important for a general understanding of the industry’s social, economic, and cultural relevance. </jats:p>",

Situated within feminist epistemology, our approach is interdisciplinary, and we argue that the series is an instance of McNay’s neo-Foucauldian framework in practice, with her three dimensions of agency integrated in a critical discourse about life in women’s prisons. We contend that Kohan presents the protagonists as active subjects with potential for transformation. In our view, her narratives of resistance against the disciplinary practices of the institution can be read as political statements that promote consciousness-raising among viewers. </jats:p>",

This study approaches the show’s representation of multinational, homosocial masculine friendship and commentary as a text that advances the goals of damunhwa, a locally specific articulation of multiculturalism. Non Summit does this by constructing a normative ideal of a cosmopolitan citizen who espouses liberal progressive values and appreciation for superficial multicultural difference. The ideal, which the show associates with the West, is occasionally ruptured through fleeting moments when non-Western members challenge Western superiority and Koreanness, however, the ruptures are patched through the show’s policing of difference through shared, heteronormative masculinity and homosocial friendship. </jats:p>",

This article is an attempt to address this gap in the dominant framework for discussing consumer labor in digital contexts. It draws on feminist frameworks, particularly the work of Fortunati, in arguing that affective, immaterial labor has a variable and often indirect relationship to capitalist exchange. This indirect relationship allows the products of such work to retain their use-values while nevertheless remaining implicated in systems of exchange. This in turn draws attention to the immaterial product of reproductive labor, which is the social order itself, and the importance of the disciplining function of reproductive labor. </jats:p>",

The article explores the politics espoused by some of these “ Internet Hindus” and frames them vis-à-vis the larger themes foregrounded by the electoral victory of the Hindu nationalist political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In doing so, the article attempts to locate “ Internet Hindus” in a democracy, which has the third largest Internet user base in the world, and seeks to deconstruct their ethno-nationalistic online posturing, while reflecting on what this may mean for the online collective itself. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Remembering Popular Music, Documentary Style",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past forty years, a growing number of television documentaries have attempted to produce a history of Anglo-American popular music for a wide audience. This article represents an attempt to come to terms with the particularity of the popular music documentary form and the different ways in which these documentaries present themselves as authoritative public texts that circulate understandings about popular music’s past. The argument is inspired by the landmark mid-1970s installment in this tradition: Tony Palmer’s epic seventeen-part narrative, All You Need Is Love. While this series makes strong historical claims—in Palmer’s words, it sets out to tell “nothing less than the entire history and development of popular music”—the author argues that the series is, in fact, based on the tropes and discourses of memory. Through an analysis of some of the particular formal and aesthetic characteristics of the series, this article reveals the ways in which talking and thinking about the past of popular music and its culture necessarily call on an experience of the senses that is simultaneously replayed and refracted as memory. </jats:p>",

Drawing on a case study of the popular web site TelevisionWithoutPity.com, this article explores the way in which online viewer activity doubles as a form of value-enhancing labor for television producers in two ways: by allowing fans to take on part of the work of making a show interesting for themselves and by providing instant (if not necessarily statistically representative) feedback to producers. Based on interviews with producers and contributors to a bulletin board they frequent, the article explores both sides of interactivity: the promise of shared control and the ability to off-load some market research labor onto viewers. </jats:p>",

It offers an understanding not only of how people in Sweden experienced the arrival of the television but also of the ways in which its material properties fashioned peoples’ use of space and how this worked in tandem with social stratifications, national discourses, and gendered ideals. Engaging in the historical and material actuality of the television offers additional insights into the ways in which the television is experienced today, and how these experiences continuously contribute to fashioning peoples’ experience of the TV object. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although there are numerous prominent examples of social media misuse, these cases should not disproportionately characterize the scope or potential of digital media participation as a whole. Using cancel culture as an entry point, this essay discusses how digital practices often follow a trajectory of being initially embraced as empowering to being denounced as emblematic of digital ills. However, while platforms such as Twitter do have characteristics that militate against nuanced debate, scholars can productively direct attention to interactions in other digital spaces, particularly using methods that yield more qualitatively informative data. These spaces include message boards and comment threads, which foster more long-form engagement. It is also important to look beyond the major English-language platforms, both to account for platform-specific features and so that conditions of online discourse routine in many global contexts, such as negotiating censorship, are centrally theorized in digital media studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the contemporary configuration of power relations in the U.K. television sector, probing, in the process, the enduring accuracy of longstanding economic arguments concerning distributor dominance in the “cultural industries” more broadly. Such arguments are important because we cannot understand the power of the media unless we understand the circulation of power within the media. The article shows that while recent developments in respect to both producer—distributor and producer—advertiser relationships have begun to enhance the leverage enjoyed by the production community, the steady inflation of the mass-market premium enjoyed by the leading distributors (the terrestrial broadcasters) in the advertising market has largely sustained their power, in relation to smaller (multichannel) distributors, to producer suppliers, and—of course— to the consuming public. </jats:p>",

Perhaps this decision does not define imperialism, but it certainly has raised the specter in the eyes of much of the rest of the world. Of course, the obvious question became what evidence was there of imminent danger that should justify an attack? From the start, the principal challenge never was a matter of whether the U.S. military had the capacity to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime. Rather, the challenge has been all along a matter of how to sell the war and U.S. military occupation to the community of nations, the United Nations Security Council, the American people, and the Iraqi people. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We discuss two points raised by the articles in this special issue, which are related to our previous work on media movements in Latin America. First, we analyze the dimensions of data activism in the region. Recent experiences in Latin America suggest two types of data activism differentiated by goals and spheres of action: social data activism and data rights activism. They also have diverse tactics and achievements. Second, we discuss the Global South as the site of counter-epistemic and alternative practices, and we wonder whether the concept of “data colonialism” adequately captures the dynamics of the digital society in areas of well-entrenched digital divides. We argue that datafication and the opposition to datafication in the South does not develop exactly as in the North given huge political, economic, social, and technological differences in the context of the expansion of digital capitalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the early history of Boston's black public affairs television program Say Brother from 1968—1970. This history shows that as a local broadcast, WGBH's Say Brother could take a more outspoken position than a national program, such as Black Journal, could have taken. The article explores the radical pedagogy offered by Say Brother, which attempted to impart “new principles of Blackness” to its viewers using multiple genres. Through an analysis of the archived program and interviews with former staff members, the article demonstrates how Say Brother's youthful creators took advantage of establishment fears about black uprisings to create an openly critical television show that examined black discontent, showcased black viewpoints and black artists and overcame a cancellation attempt by rallying community response. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Disconnected neither from close textual analysis nor socially engaged theory, this article shows how what can be called “responsive” levels of political discourse are mobilized to react and propose alternatives to dominant ideology. Through an analysis of a character's changing sexuality in the television show South Park, it demonstrates how cultural texts can act discursively within the wider framework of contemporary politics. Over the course of eleven seasons, Mr. Garrison has functioned specifically to address and attack rhetoric surrounding queer identity, (hyper)masculinity, femininity, and heteronormative sexual identity. Engaging with contemporary queer theory, the essay attempts to formulate an understanding of identity based not in “difference,” “tolerance,” or “resistance” but as an assemblage of discourses and representations that are both reactions to and attempted critiques of dominant (binary) positions on sexuality that point us toward new, socially responsive locations and locutions within which one can conceive and interact with cultural politics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how the media define women's experience of time in the postfeminist context through analysis of the popular Food Network program 30 Minute Meals. In a context in which women attempt to “have it all,” the media expose anxieties about and offer solutions for how women should balance home and work demands. Contemporary representations of domesticity on television present the home as radically affected by the temporal logic of the working world. By interrogating 30 Minute Meals's real-time narrative structure alongside the marketing strategies of stores like Crate and Barrel, this article argues that postfeminist media propose contradictory remedies to the contemporary “time crunch” in the form of rational and efficient time management and nostalgia for an imagined past in which women had endless amounts of time. Studying how the media represent women's time is crucial to understanding definitions of femininity and women's labor and leisure in the postfeminist context. </jats:p>",

This differentiates Wii games from other videogames in that the moving, acting body becomes the center of the play, where four modes of production define the parameters and norms of play: technique, discipline, improvisation, and defiance. The player acts with and through these four modes in order to view themselves as a more enhanced part of the game and the screen.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Israel seems to import more telenovelas than any other country. VIVA, its telenovela cable channel, became instantly popular after its inauguration in early 2000. Its success surpassed the expectations of its owners, who launched the channel with ample evidence to support that they already counted on a solid demand for their product. VIVA competes, and often outranks, the top-rated national newscast in prime-time ratings. This channel established a weekly VIVA telenovela magazine. Its shows' musical themes rank high in the hit parade, driving the most popular singers and record labels to launch Hebrew versions of the songs. This article argues that telenovelas lead television entertainment in this country because of four primary factors: the centrality of cable to the television industry, the limited television programming before the 1990s, the cultural and political climate in which audiences watch telenovelas, and finally, the telenovela compatibility with Israel's narrative traditions, particularly its popular cinema. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In countries with a mature public broadcasting sector and where public broadcasting is being challenged by the multichannel and digital environment, there is a veritable avalanche of discourse aiming to ensure the future of the sector. Various key concepts are intoned like mantras-public service, public sphere, citizenship, democracy-as if by their very repetition they had the power to hold hostile forces at bay. The present article examines just one of these-democracy-and suggests that the invocation of the term in typical defenses is at best imprecise and at worse outdated. Furthermore, in its devaluation of various forms of popular media, the typical defense ends up championing a set of media practices that are increasingly irrelevant. The article concludes that a generalized defense of public service broadcasting is \"impotent\" and must be replaced by localized and specific analyses of where public broadcasting fits in various media ecologies. </jats:p>",

It tries to sieve the realities of techno-enhanced education from its hype and in the process discusses the sociocultural and economic implications of such a novel idea in a digitally divided global economy. It uses results gathered from a study that evaluated students' performances in physical and virtual classroom environments as a case study. The research came out with the following summary: the online/virtual classroom environment is a useful complement and not a substitute to physical classroom interaction. New media technology has a lot to offer society in flexible delivery of educational materials but it is still at the experimental stage and more work is needed to extract its full potential. It is, however, still predominantly a Western preserve. </jats:p>",

One of the spaces in which the ghosts of the past manifest themselves is that of television drama. In this article, Mark Fisher’s reading of “hauntology” provides the theoretical frame for an analysis of two recent TV series set in Northern Ireland: The Fall and Derry Girls. Although the programs could not be more different in both tone and content, they both illustrate sharply that the region remains, in John Hewitt’s indelible phrase, a “ghost-haunted land.” In particular, The Fall and Derry Girls reveal that Northern Ireland continues to be deeply troubled both by those who were lost during the conflict and by that which was lost in the transition to peace. </jats:p>",

Previous research has argued that marketers are bound to present children as competent and savvy to legitimize their own practices. Drawing on interviews with Swedish producers of child-directed online advertising, this study shows that marketers are not destined to portray children as competent as the idea of the vulnerable and incompetent child was an important construction among the Swedish producers. The Swedish producers constructed a multifaceted and ambivalent image of children, mixing the idea of the vulnerable and dependent child with the idea of the competent child. This study contributes to the wider understanding of media producers’ constructed audiences, particularly regarding how culture and media regulation shape the notion of the child audience among producers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The participation of women in video games continues to be interrogated, especially the participation of women who are, or are perceived to be, feminists. A considerable portion of the discourse on the appropriateness of feminism in live streaming takes place on Twitch and gaming subreddits. This paper applies a qualitative analysis to several Reddit threads that address the subject of feminism in live streaming. The analysis of subreddit comments about feminism in streaming suggest that many Twitch users believe feminism is an ideology that is incompatible with video games and live streaming. Furthermore, many of these users believe that feminists actively harm live streaming communities. This paper presents an understanding of how and why the presence and legitimacy of feminism in games continues to be contested and demonstrates what is at stake for feminists who desire to participate in building a future for themselves in video game live streaming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at the appropriation of cancel-culture activism by anti-queer parental rights activists online. By examining their digitally mediated anti-queer rhetoric, this paper studies how these activists drive public outrage to promote cultural censorship. Surveying digital campaigns by Libs of TikTok and Moms for Liberty, this paper analyzes how their media amplifies “grooming” and “pedophilia” discourses to dynamize older anti-queer stereotypes. Drawing upon the language of child protectionism from 1970s educational debates, this mediated rhetoric demonstrates how anti-queer activists have appropriated the social justice origins of cancel-culture online. By using social media to frame conservative activists as marginalized, these campaigns invert the history of anti-LGBTQ+ media and educational environments to rationalize anti-LGBTQ+ censorship. By looking at how this rhetoric flows from social media into conservative TV journalism, this paper uncovers how this digital activism shapes a broader reactionary media ecology with corrosive democratic effects in the United States. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article advances an affect-based theorization of genre as atmospheric assemblage by applying such a framework to an analysis of videogame genre. The affective excess originating from the relations between the components of the assemblage is experienced by the player as a specific type of thinking-moving-feeling understood as a wholistic atmosphere. By looking at the cases of the soulsborne, rouguelike, and metroidvania genres, the article explains how an assemblage framework is useful to explain how players experience individual videogames as belonging to the same genre despite noticeable differences between them. On the other hand, a final example, that of the puzzle game, illustrates how minimal changes to the articulation of an assemblage enables quite different experiences for the players that may result in the establishment of a different genre. This article suggests that the atmospheric assemblage framework could be applied to other media forms, such as television and film. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In scholarly and industry analyses of television’s expansion into online distribution, few have accounted for the specific negotiations required when old television content streams on new media. This article considers the economic consequences, viewer utility, and cultural position of television reruns as they expand from the pushed flows of legacy television to the pull contexts of digital streaming. The emergence of streaming outlets upsets conventions of off-network syndication yet introduces new licensing revenue to television markets, and streaming undermines the pleasures of familiar, passive entertainment offered by reruns. Reruns, as a concept, a cultural commodity, and as an archive of a televisual past and present, are reconfigured with the move toward streaming television. Internet distribution of television reruns provides a necessary case study to investigate the full scope of how streaming services are destabilizing the conventions of the U.S. television industries. </jats:p>",

Whereas colonial governance operated in relative secrecy with archives not quite available to ordinary citizens, what do we make of current institutions from government departments to banks flaunting their commitment to Open Data? Looking at data activism in Hong Kong, this article highlights the (post)colonial histories that have shaped the reception of Open Data in this context. More so, it explores the ways in which the techno-materialities of data infrastructures affect and reconfigure postcolonial struggle. Building on Kelty’s discussion of “recursive publics” and Hui’s account of recursivity, my notion of recursive politics underscores the mutuality of social history and techno-materiality. While recursive politics can contribute to technodiversity, I analyze how such politics weigh up against the political and ethical investments of postcolonial struggle. </jats:p>",

Drawing mainly from Diane Negra’s and Angela McRobbie’s work on postfeminist popular culture, and specifically McRobbie’s concept of “double entanglement,” I argue that network television, with rare exceptions, not only avoids representations of female childlessness but also promotes pronatalism, which it associates with neoliberal principles of the market (as illustrated in everything from the booming surrogacy industry to the quest to enroll children at the best private schools, etc.). </jats:p>",

A first aim of the article is to establish the extent to which offerings in these markets confirm or reshape the findings of transnational flow studies on the imbalance of content supply. A second aim is to analyze how these offerings reflect the platform’s investment strategies in the different markets. Although findings point to increased diversity in catalog composition, as well as growing investments in European works, Netflix also reconfirms and contributes to existing power imbalances between markets. US content dominates the four European catalogs, while investments in European original content considerably favor strong media markets over weaker ones. </jats:p>",

The use of music in evening drama is analyzed here with a view toward interpreting the place of music within several programs in relation to the larger changes affecting the medium. From this analysis, it seems clear that the use of composed music and popular songs is intended to act as a stylistically distinct feature of the overall experience and understanding of evening dramas to attract and hold the attention of viewers across multiple sites of consumption in an increasingly competitive entertainment market. An expansive use of the concept of televisual flow is employed to connect the aesthetic contours of the use of music in evening drama to the ways in which producers try to create and maintain connections with viewers whose viewing patterns and practices are changing rapidly and unpredictably. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Bipolar Machine: Sovereignty and Action in <i>24</i>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the TV show 24 (2001–2010) and its one-season reboot (2014), tracing how they depict a fictional U.S. government torn between two paradigms of power: one centered on notions of sovereign power and one centered on the improvised, chaotic action of government agents and institutions. Using Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s notion of a “bipolar machine” as its conceptual framework, the article argues that the structure and style of the show can be construed as both a demonstration and critique of an economy poised between legality and transgression, and that the logic of this economy was part of the show’s harshly criticized indulgence in violence and torture. Finally, the article compares the original 24 with its reboot and argues that while the original show was preeminent fictionalization of the Bush Administration’s War on Terror, the rebooted show generates a critical fictionalization of the post-Bush era. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Precarious Labor of Queer Indie Game-making: Who Benefits from Making Video Games “Better”?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at issues of precarious and exploited labor surrounding contemporary queer independent video game making. In recent years, there has been a marked rise in indie games made by and about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people. These games and their creators are commonly lauded for inspiring change in the mainstream game industry and making the medium of video games more diverse and therefore “better.” However, this cultural narrative obfuscates the socioeconomic challenges faced by many queer indie game-makers. Drawing from interviews conducted by the author, this article presents a counter-narrative about the work of developing video games by and about marginalized people. Although such games are often described as “easy” or “free” to make, they in fact entail considerable, and rarely fairly compensated, labor. Simultaneously, value is being extracted from this labor by companies who look to queer indie games for inspiration, which translates into profit. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Though the political economy of Filipina care workers and their lives on the ground might appear to be a world distinct from that of digital platforms, this article explores their continuity: between the multiple demands for Filipina care workers in Taiwan to relentlessly serve the demands of others, and thus to be “always-on,” and the logics of the platforms that they use to stay in touch with loved ones and chill during down time. Based on interviews and online observation, I argue that examining the lives of women OFWs in Taiwan helps us understand how platforms that require their users to be always online remediate the asymmetries of global care work and the longstanding demands for feminized and racialized servitude that have historically been made upon various “others,” including migrants, people of color, and residents of the Global South. Such demands, I further show, cannot be divorced from U.S.-driven developmentalist policies that continue to “modernize” the Asia Pacific into a readily extractable market. </jats:p>",

We explore two different representations of Korean Americanness, the first in CNN’s Parts Unknown and the second in Bravo TV’s Top Chef, to identify the demand for ethnic transformation that Korean Americans face and examine how these trials reanimate the role of Korean Americans on television. We argue that the iconoclastic figure of the “Bad Korean” highlighted in Parts Unknown challenges stereotypical portrayals of Korean Americans by positioning cast members as active and disruptive cultural producers. In our analysis of Top Chef, we focus on the emergence of the “Shifting Korean” to highlight the transformative process demanded by the reality television genre. We conclude by querying the representational possibilities for Korean Americans, asking what claims the “Bad Korean” and “Shifting Korean” can make on cultural authenticity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The publication of John Hartley’s new book, The Uses of Television, could not be more timely. It appears at a time when the territorial disputes between television studies (as a branch of cultural studies), cinema studies, and traditional disciplines seem to be at a low-level skirmish. In some of the panel exchanges and hallway talk at the 1999 Cinema Studies Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, there seemed to be a palpable lament, nostalgia even, over the passing of the high moment of cinema theory. This pining for the golden age of cinema theory is exemplary of many of the positions that target popular culture, political correctness, and intellectual fashion as the culprit in the erosion of the serious regard for serious art and serious intellectual study. This state of affairs is, at the very least, prompted if not driven by a suspicion—in some cases, hostility—toward cultural studies and within that formation, television studies. Where the field of cultural studies generates suspicion for its purported lack of theoretical rigor and its intellectual fashion, contempt for television (and by extension, those who watch it and that branch of study concerned with it) stems from its identity as a popular medium whose appeal is the crass commercialism of aggressive capitalism. This is of course a very old story, but so it goes. The Uses of Television also appears in the United States when the politics of representation, especially over questions of access, images, and the role of television in the production of the nation and citizenship, is once again a",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Livestreaming during the Covid-19 pandemic has become a staging ground for a kind of virtual socialization that favors gendered and middle class norms of intimacy, affective labor, and domesticity, despite a grave lack of material support for the transition to online learning and working from home. In this paper, I focus on key images and discussions circulating in the press and on social media around the performance and construction of the livestreaming space in relation to virtual learning and remote work among white collar professionals. Livestreaming reshapes domestic life and space through its ability to blur the boundary between home and work and the nascent norms and practices of livestreaming borrow from existing streaming subcultures such as video game streaming on platforms like Twitch.tv. The intimacy of livestreaming, however, is a double-edged sword as it exposes livestreaming’s inability to curtail the worst effects of the pandemic and the disproportionate impact of this vast social rearrangement on women. Livestreaming is easily integrated into existing regimes of control and is the subject of an intense public debate about its politics this very reason. </jats:p>",

Although the benefits and consequences of participating in such shows have long been debated within academia and beyond, research into actual experiences of participating in such television productions remains scarce. Based on in-depth interviews with participants of the disability dating show The Undateables, this article focuses on how contributors deal with their position in the production and how their experiences reflect the emancipatory claims of the program. By presenting the production process through the story and from the perspective of three participants, different modes of participation will be discussed, revealing how instances of submission, appropriation, and contestation of the production logic are linked to ideals of representation, notions about empowerment and voice, and to strategies of negotiating normalcy and difference. </jats:p>",

Drawing from interviews, fieldwork, and discourse analysis of marketing from two companies, Stoll and Resonance, we argue that software is integral to the creation of a new kind of designer, a “digital craftsman,” that directly interfaces with a new kind of supply chain. This interaction is defined by its “seamlessness”—what we describe as both an emergent technical design element and an imaginary of software-enabled manufacturing free from friction between sites of concept development and its material execution. Counter to this imaginary, we mobilize the “tactile grammar” of seams to foreground the role of embodied communication and labor practices in shaping software-defined industrial futures. Studying the connections between fiber, fingers, and code, this article opens up new lines of inquiry into industrial software and into the links between media production and larger spheres of commodity production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2017, BBC released a video revealing that Jodie Whittaker would be the actor to play the thirteenth Doctor in the 2018 season of Doctor Who (1963–), the popular BBC television series. The “reveal” that a woman had been cast in the role of the Doctor prompted an overwhelming backlash and fierce online discussion. The same period saw a number of popular films and series cast women as leads. The intense discussion that the reveal generated indicates that televisual representations of gender continue to matter greatly to viewers. The question is how? Fan comments posted below the reveal video on YouTube suggest that viewing publics are less engaged in a controversy over feminism than bewildered by gender categories becoming unstable. Notably, once the series aired, discussion about the Doctor’s gender died down. Seeing the Doctor addressed as “Ma’am,” it turned out, was not what upset viewers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay focuses on U.S. broadcasting to Cuba, specifically the development and programming of TV Martí, a channel whose ostensible aim is to undermine the communist Cuban government and promote democratic transition. Since TV Martí’s first broadcast in 1990, Cuba has successfully jammed the signal, and the question of why the United States should continue to fund a station with no viewers has been the subject of ongoing discussion. Issues of reception have so overdetermined the debate as to obviate analysis of the productions themselves.This article argues that the existence of TV Martí is best understood in relation to Cuban exile nationalism. Fundamental confusion exists on the issues of what TV Martí is supposed to represent and for whom it is created, raising questions not only about its effectiveness as propaganda meant to interpellate Cuban nationals—if there are any watching—but also about what is at stake in exporting the exilic national imaginary. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This performance-based text uncovers internet knowledge/power inequalities through the use of code. The term codeis used in a very broad sense and goes beyond formal computer science language to include hardware, software, and internet terms that are used in everyday real and “virtual” dialogue. The author argues that the process of the construction of knowledge claims takes place when learning to use the internet. The researcher uses case studies to expose how these codes affect the people on the bottom half of the Digital Divide. Nearly two years of participant observation at a community-based internet program in a small midwestern city inform this work. The primary mission of the program was to provide low-income community residents with tools and access to the internet in order to help bridge the gap in the Digital Divide and to build community networks. </jats:p>",

This paper offers case studies of the early implementation of interactive online sites at the ABC to explore an alternative remembering of the ABC. Using the success of ABC Online as a model of how to remember the ABC, one might choose to remember the ABC as dispersed and plural, even rhizomic. Rather than being nostalgic for a unified past or future, we might instead be nostalgic for the diversity, plurality and in-between nature of ABC practices and programming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the conceptualization of spatiality and temporality in television drama series in the age of extensive digital media consumption by focusing on Turkish audiences’ reception of Danish TV dramas. Based on the empirical data collected through extended fieldwork in Turkey, and relying on Bakhtin’s concept of chronotope (spacetime), I analyze how research participants negotiate socio-geographical features, as well as both spatial and temporal textual representations signifying Danish culture and society by delineating “authenticity” and “local color” to distinct spatiotemporal cues in Danish TV drama series. This study reveals that by critically articulating notions of authenticity and local color as distinguishing markers of a particular spacetime, Turkish audiences employ these concepts as strategies to define “national chronotope” which provides a middle ground for reconciliation between the facticity of the geographical place and mediated images of space, as well as factuality of time and local temporalities on screen. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> From The X-Files to Friends, Gilmore Girls to Twin Peaks, revivals of beloved TV series have dominated the airwaves and streaming services over the last decade. The media landscape has changed significantly since these series’ original airings, however, and webisodes, video games, social media hashtags and fan communities exist alongside—and act upon—the “original” text. By focusing on The X-Files and Twin Peaks revivals this chapter theorizes the return of cult television series as neo-cult. I use the concept of the dialogic to argue that if cult is defined dialogically between text, audience, industry, the media and the academy, neo-cult emerges through discourse recalling the series’ earlier iterations as cult being reflected and amplified, thus resulting in the revived text becoming a self-referential cult text or neo-cult. </jats:p>",

In recent decades, sport broadcast television viewing opportunities shifted from a primary reliance on a single “box in the corner” in the domestic living room environment to the availability of a multiplicity of television sets in different household spaces. Later, as television screen size increased, picture quality improved, and public viewing sites multiplied, new interactive screen-based devices emerged that have enabled audiences simultaneously to watch sport in many different spaces and to communicate about the experience to distant others. This “live” performance of mediated sport spectatorship parallels in some respects “live” mediated athletic performance, involving sharing the now and the making of digital memory. </jats:p>",

Against the backdrop of growing economic insecurity, most people must now assiduously self-promote and hustle in order to find or protect their jobs. Trump supporters are not ‘dupes’ buying the hype then; they recognize that Trump’s brand is his skill set, admire it, and see it as all the qualification he needs to become president. While Trump’s ‘brand’ is figured as the result of his own personal style and power, it is actually the product of the underpaid, highly exploited labour of thousands of workers. Trump the Brand and reality television’s gauzy promise of mini-celebrity are symptoms of, and alibis for a flawed and failing political economic system. It will take the concerted, collective power of people in the streets, demanding something better, to stop him. </jats:p>",

As a prime-time network series, Chico presented a mediated fantasy space that appealed to utopian possibilities and offered multiple sorts of pleasure and displeasure to a multiracial audience, providing the opportunity to interrogate cultural signs of Otherness or Chicano-ness in comparison to whiteness, which traditionally “never has to acknowledge its role as an organizing principle,” as George Lipsitz states. Although the paternalistic relationship between an older white figure and a young Chicano at the show’s core invokes the racial power dynamics of other 1970s integrated ghetto shows, Chico offers brief disruptive moments that escape this strategy of ideological containment. These highlight the contradictory nature of the show (and TV itself), which often succeeds in quelling minoritized voices but can still be mobilized by them as an instrument for enjoyment/self-affirmation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay traces and analyzes emerging zones of conflict as the transmission of popular sport content shifts from the historically dominant platform of broadcast television to the online environment of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW). These conflicts are many and marked, underpinned by a shift in the media sport content economy in terms of the production, distribution and consumption of content. This economy is conceptualized as moving from a long-established broadcast model characterized by `scarcity', with high barriers of access and cost restricting the number of media companies and sports organizations able to create, control and distribute quality, popular sport content. In comparison, the emerging online model is defined by `digital plenitude', with the Internet and WWW significantly lowering barriers of access and cost and thus increasing the number of media companies, sports organizations, clubs, and even individual athletes able to produce and distribute content for online consumption. </jats:p>",

We position Glee within a transmedia framework, using textual analysis of program storylines, ethnographic fieldwork, and messages about Glee circulated on the microblogging site Twitter, to examine fan responses to and uses of Glee. We find that young adults experience and deploy Glee in two ways. First, they use Glee as a text to interpret their own life experiences, and imagine how they might articulate queer desires and acceptance of them. Second, as a malleable and mobile symbolic object, Glee acts as a strategic device used to signal identifications with and levels of awareness and acceptance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT)–identifying people. Although some of the engagement with Glee on social media echoed textual themes, we also find devoted fan engagement that diverges from that of our ethnographic observations. </jats:p>",

In the decade and a half prior, men-only, homosocial, domestic “man caves” became a cultural trend. Given man caves’ popularity and potential to enable patriarchal oppression, we ask: what do man caves suggest about masculinity’s vitality in an era wherein patriarchy reigns, but challenges to hegemonic masculinity are evident? To answer, we textually analyze Man Caves, DIY (Do-It-Yourself) cable channel’s renovation reality show. From a feminist perspective, we examine how Man Caves constructs “neo-orthodox masculinity,” our term for masculinity that recovers and challenges old forms of masculine capital. Through mutually contradictory themes, Man Caves makes over masculinity in ways that respond to feminism as a movement to end patriarchy. We conclude by considering how feminist anger, hope, and activism may exploit the vulnerabilities that neo-orthodox masculinity highlights. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze whether humor can release some of the tension in Islam controversies and open up new directions for dialogue. We do so in the context of Dahlgren’s civic cultures framework, asking whether humor can be a civic practice and how it is articulated with value conflicts. We examine the features of the humor performed in two comic vlogs on YouTube and the sentiments these vlogs evoked among their viewers. In one vlog, the comedy calls for interreligious acceptance, while in the other vlog comedy is used to “other” Muslims. The comments on both vlogs, however, comprise negative and positive sentiment in the same patterns, often expressed in an antagonistic style. These findings call for caution when contemplating the potential of humor to alleviate interreligious tensions and the prospect of the Internet to form a space for meaningful democratic deliberation, especially when dealing with topics as controversial as Islam. </jats:p>",

    "title": "My (Global) Media Studies",
    "abstract": "What we commonly refer to as “global media studies” or “global communication studies” still struggles to live up to its name. Mercifully, the field appears to have exited the suffocating paradigmatic monoliths of the past, opening up space for theoretical and methodological experimentation and for studies grounded in a geosocial locus but without predetermined outcomes. At the same time, the field is painstakingly coming to terms (to speak optimistically) with its Western ethos and location. Most parts of the world contribute mainly case research framed by Anglo-American, French, or German theory. Other approaches rarely become theoretical guideposts, with the notable exception of Latin American cultural theory (itself with unequivocal European influences). This “weak” internationalization is clearly caused by the precariousness of institutions of knowledge production in much of the world and the lack of (required) instruction in languages other than English (sometimes French or German) in the West, especially in the United States. “Strong” internationalization would require the integration of theoretical ideas and historical experiences from the nonWest in knowledge production not only in the West but also about the West, with corresponding linguistic and cultural competences. As I have argued elsewhere (Kraidy 2005), if American studies has managed to make this issue central to its development, a field that calls itself “global communication studies” has no excuse not to.

In this contribution, I argue for the increasingly important and politicized role of media scholarship to privilege lived experiences and situated practices as a counter to the active neutralization of data-driven systems and their implications. In particular, I argue for the relevance of media studies to emphasize the uses to which technology is put and explore how data practices relate to other social practices and historical contexts as a way to broaden the parameters of response, moving data politics beyond the confines of the technology itself, and contending instead with the premise and terms of the debate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cultural studies scholars have long been interested in the nexus between people’s online activities and their identities. One activity that has drawn attention is reading/writing fan fiction (fictions written by and for fans that build upon the characters and worlds depicted in commercial texts). While fan fiction and its surrounding communities have long been understood as resistant to heteronormativity, previous work exploring the fans who produce and consume fan fiction has largely insisted that most of these fans are adult ciswomen. Little has been written about the experiences of trans and genderqueer fans. To remedy this elision, this article explores two trans and genderqueer individuals’ experiences with fan fiction. It closely examines the roles reading, and especially reading fan fiction, has or has not played in their understandings of themselves, their identities, and their places in the world. </jats:p>",

The researchers utilized a descriptive survey research design with a structured questionnaire as the instrument for data collection. The data for the study were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a one-way multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The result of the study showed that reduced collaboration decreases job satisfaction. Also, modern technologies increase reduced collaboration. Further results showed that modern technologies have led to reduced collaboration in private TV stations more than federal and state TV stations. It was also found that the creative application of modern technologies will lead to increased collaboration and job satisfaction among TV stations in Nigeria. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores anticipation as a temporal structure in digital platforms. It contributes to the growing research of platformisation of everyday life by focusing on temporality as a central dimension of platform power, a key mechanism tying participants by structuring intimacies, socialities, and relations that platforms enable and engender. The article shows how the temporality of foreboding, prospecting and speculating about one’s own and other’s social media presence and actions permeates the user experience. Studying media diaries and interviews with participants from different social and occupational groups (politicians, actors, the unemployed, undocumented migrants), the article analyses anticipation as a structure of feeling, as time- and energy-consuming digital labor and as the embodiment of platform power’s mechanisms. While anticipation has previously been examined as operational logics of the platform economy, this article demonstrates how anticipation also concerns ordinary media users on the level of their everyday life worlds, experiences and practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the role of transnational television in supporting transnational subjects’ ontological security in a world of information, risk, interconnected spaces but fragmented social relations. The discussion draws from Silverstone’s and Giddens’s work on ontological security and modernity. It revisits Silverstone’s analysis of television as a core system for managing modern subjects’ insecurities and relocates this thesis in a transnational context. Enabling symbolic as well as physical co-presence, the space around television becomes a contradictory, yet important, frame for managing everyday anxieties shared by many migrants and diasporic subjects. This is particularly the case for people torn by anxieties associated with separation, political instability in their region of origin, and the precariousness of migrant life. With reference to empirical research with Arab audiences across Europe, the article shows that television sustains its central role, even when new media make significant advances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The socio-technological affordances of Twitter have steadily enabled audiences of reality television shows to form virtual communities through the use of hashtags to organize and share commentary about their favorite shows. Although the communication activities around hashtag communities are becoming more apparent, research on mapping their online cultures remains underappreciated. Scholarly work is needed that makes the links between culture and communication more apparent, thereby enhancing our understanding of virtual communities formed around interest in reality television. Using a small-scale sample of tweets ( n = 203) from season eight of the reality dating show Date My Family, I explore what the cultural expressions of the South African #Datemyfamily virtual community entail. A thematic analysis suggests that values, norms, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors constitute a strong cultural part of what is communicated by the #Datemyfamily community. Ultimately, the virtual culture of this online group places emphasis on solidifying the community’s imagined collective consciousness. </jats:p>",

I argue that these negative images engage in excess in a way that is inversely proportionate to the lack of any such contemplations of identity in respectable media texts. Activating the definition of “negative” as “expressing or containing negation or denial” reveals the ways that disreputable images such as those found in reality television disrupt hegemonic norms of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Viewed from this perspective, television shows like Love and Hip Hop exemplify the intersectional marginalization of black women. If the current post-racial, colorblind moment is really a color-mute one (to quote Linda Williams)—where identity is seen but cannot be uttered—then the negative image functions as the repository for those identities, experiences, and feelings that have been discarded by respectable media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many reports indicate higher education counseling centers are finding it difficult to keep pace with the growing rates of stress, anxiety, depression, and sleeping difficulties in undergraduate populations. Some universities are turning to telepsychology, or means of providing mental health care through videoconferencing, software, and other digital tools. This article analyzes one such platform, therapy assistance online (TAO), through a critical walkthrough of the platform’s self-help modules to consider how they communicate and construct care as individual labor which generates data for the platform. We argue that by removing traces of the therapist’s body and, in turn, dialogic communication, the platform produces modes of neoliberal self-care operationalized through data extraction, where the individual user works through modules while providing personal information to the platform. While TAO is offered as a solution to overcrowded and understaffed care facilities, it demonstrates some limitations of relying on third-party platforms to care for students. </jats:p>",

    "title": "“Public Service” and the Journalism Crisis: Is the BBC the Answer?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Professional journalism is under extraordinary pressure: not only are its traditional business models under enormous strain but it is also regularly accused by the Right of peddling ‘fake news’ and criticized by the Left for failing to play a robust monitorial role. In this situation, there is a temptation to see public service media, and the BBC in particular, as beacons of light in an otherwise gloomy picture. This article attempts to provide a note of caution to those who see the public service model as the most effective means of holding power to account and as the most desirable alternative to the flawed news cultures of both commercial and authoritarian landscapes. It considers some of the structural and institutional factors that constrain the BBC’s journalism and suggests that its intimate relationship with elite power has long undermined its ability to act as a reliable and independent check on power. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the creation of a national index of sexist violence in Argentina in 2016 as an example of data activism in the Global South. Drawing upon a qualitative content analysis of press coverage and activist posts on social media, as well as interviews with activists, it describes the context of the #NiUnaMenos feminist mobilization and the collection “from below” of data on gender violence. This study illustrates how activists in the Global South can appropriate technology and promote new uses that not only respond to their local and immediate needs but also contribute to the production of alternative imaginaries on big data in the longer term. Moreover, the article positions women’s movements as an essential component of current social movements in Latin America. </jats:p>",

While these shows did not center disability, they often featured strikingly similar episodic narratives involving disability, using the framework of romantic dates with a main character. This article analyzes these episodes as a microgenre, referred to as “disability dates.” This microgenre represents a fleeting subgenre of the sitcom that used similar strategies to represent disability and to reproduce popular discourses that opposed or undermined the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the experiential affordances of watching online TV as outcomes of the material underpinnings of online TV and the actions taken by viewers. Potential experiential changes derive from how online TV services can be considered libraries of content affording self-scheduling action possibilities. Such changes need to be situated in the slow-to-change conditions of television viewing. We draw on a qualitative study of how viewers respond to the action possibilities and constraints of online TV services. We argue that potentials for individualized viewing are counterbalanced by television viewing as a social activity. Next, self-scheduling ties in with viewing as a deliberate action, appropriated to create experiences where attentiveness is tailored to what is narratively required. Finally, flow schedules are replaced with programed paths constraining the agency of viewers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since Ireland’s 2015 Marriage Equality referendum, emerging trends, variances and understandings of LGBTQ identities have begun to emerge on Irish television. At the crux of this post-marriage equality queer visibility lies a friction between the assimilation of queerness to an acceptable homonormative alternative to monogamous heteronormativity versus broader representations of indeterminate variety and fluidity. In exploring the dynamic between assimilation and representation, the article makes a two-pronged argument. On the one hand, post-marriage equality television becomes a site of containment, performing a regulatory function configuring queer visibility through a homonormative paradigm, reflecting the mainstreaming evident in the marriage equality campaign. On the other, post-marriage equality Irish television has enabled cultural scripts to emerge pertaining to the challenges still remaining for the gay community in response to more intersectional, complex understandings of diverse LGBTQ experiences. </jats:p>",

The author begins by discussing how incessant commodification of difference in advertising and consumer culture compromises the ability and desire of many people to make stable and lasting investments of affect in many traditional forms of difference. In this context, it is argued that Seinfeld’s appeal lies not so much in the comic defamiliarization of everyday life but in the creation of privatized strategies of ironic agency that allow the show’s characters to create something out of nothing, difference out of sameness. The author concludes by assessing the broader political implications that attend these forms of agency. </jats:p>",

Serazio argues that authenticity is “nothing short of the central moral framework of our time”: on a quest to alleviate the anxieties and pressures of modern life, we pursue an inner sense of self—one purportedly unaffected by contemporary economic and social forces (p. 2). However, a careful choreography goes into authentic performance, professionalized by what Serazio dubs the “authenticity industries”: a subset of cultural industries including reality television, music, and politics. Through an analysis of more than seventy interviews and extensive press coverage, Michael Serazio argues that authenticity has become more important, and more profitable, than ever before amidst a reality of alienating technological standardization and capitalistic marketplace motives. </jats:p>",

I have paid attention to the uploaded video strategies of the seven international YouTube channels of Galinha Pintadinha (American, British, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, and Spanish) considering the number of subscribers to each channel, the number of views, and the growth of the channels. The success reached by Galinha Pintadinha around the world is a result of the audiovisual reconfiguration processes considering the Brazilian audiovisual history in the global flow of media content. </jats:p>",

The respondents were engaged in negotiations of how to realistically maintain public values in a commercially configured online milieu. The nature of organizational adaptation within PSB is found to be complex. Several elements of the Nordic PSB model appear to counteract acquiescence to algorithmically aided personalization: its majoritarian heritage, its institutional caution toward data positivism, favoring more interpretive editorial audience knowledge, and the high costs and structural consequences of making individual users uniquely identifiable. These organizational ambitions and obstacles are embodied in recent innovations that act to mimic a personalized delivery, however, doing so without utilizing algorithmically aided prediction and instead favoring manual editorial selection. </jats:p>",

Through multimodal rhetorical analysis of data visualizations of migration, I examine the interplay of written-linguistic, visual, and spatial modes of communication deployed in two approaches to visualizing migration and propose that the contexts of collaboration behind their composition influence their representation of the migrant as a “problem” and hold the power to resist this narrative. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the popular phenomenon of news parodies using the concept of genre. While genre is often used as a category of industrial production and marketing, the author argues that Mikhail Bakhtin's notion of genre as a socially embedded aesthetic form allows us to understand the proliferation of news parodies as a commentary on the social authority of the news. Comparing examples from Canada, the UK, and the United States, the article argues that the political significance of intertextual social communication resides in the doubleness of texts that ask an audience to recognize the problems of official forms of culture while simultaneously possibly reinscribing their dominance. The article offers a comparison of shows that merely parody the news with those that actually satirize politics, and ends with a discussion of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report and their particular significance as daily news parodies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the aftermath of its initial broadcast run, iconic millennial sitcom Friends (NBC, 1994–2004) generated some quality scholarship interrogating its politics of gender. But as a site of analysis, it remains a curious, almost structuring absence from the central canon of the first wave of feminist criticism of postfeminist culture. This absence is curious not only considering the place of Friends at the forefront of millennial popular culture but also in light of its long-term syndication in countries across the world since that time. And it is structuring in the sense that Friends was the stage on which many of the familiar tropes of postfeminism interrogated across the body of work on it appear in retrospect to have been tried and tested. This article aims to contribute toward redressing this absence through interrogation and contextualization of the series’ negotiation of a range of structuring tropes of postfeminist media discourse, and it argues for Friends as an unacknowledged ur-text of millennial postfeminism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides a feminist analysis of Chinese reality TV, using the recent makeover show— You Are So Beautiful (你怎么这么好看) as a case study. I argue that the notion of gender essentialism is highlighted in the production of You Are So Beautiful, which distances the Chinese show from its original American format— Queer Eye. This phenomenon is indicative of how existing gender power relations influence the production of popular cultural texts in post-reform China, where capitalism and authoritarianism weave a tangled web. The outcomes of the research articulate the interplay between post-socialist gender politics and reality TV production in the Chinese context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cancel culture in China has multiple specificities that invite further investigation, given the role of the state in producing content and regulating media platforms, alongside the distinct factors that can trigger canceling. This paper draws on social media posts, news articles, and government edicts for several illustrative cases, presenting a critical qualitative account about the involvement of ordinary media users, platforms, and state actors. State pronouncements on celebrity conduct, fan cultures, and digital media content all structure the regulatory environment, but canceling can originate as both bottom-up incidents and state-initiated events, with platform authorities also playing key roles. Whether netizens and the state reinforce each other or the government seeks to temper public anger, the cancel cases demonstrate how ideologies of nation and good citizenship are propagated and sometimes contested through user and state actions, an analysis that helps further theorize the culture and politics of digital platforms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Beneath Turkish TV dramas’ global glamor lie workplace accidents, systemic injuries on workers’ bodies, and deaths. In response, workers seek to impose restraints on what can be done to their bodies by resorting to law and evoking ideals of equality as they struggle for workplace safety, healthcare, and dignity. Drawing on ethnographic research across production sets, industry summits, union meetings and more than fifty interviews since 2015, this article documents drama workers’ bodily vulnerabilities, arguing that precarity in this global media industry is a bodily phenomenon legally sanctioned by the state. I dewesternize the notion of precarity in creative industries by foregrounding the materiality of the body and the regulative power of law as centers of exploitation and resistance. Critical scholars of media production could learn from non-Western contexts in identifying how creative workers do not only demand stable incomes but also legal recognition and protection of their bodies. </jats:p>",

Focusing on a span of streams from November 2020 to January 2021, the article first seeks to define cozy wholesomeness as a streaming process that combines choice of game, style of streaming, and audience interest to form an experience driven by intimacy, sincerity, and active resistance to alt-right mentalities even as the concept itself potentially becomes a product or marketing hook. For this particular streamer, producing a supportive, active chat community driven by cozy wholesomeness inevitably collides with sustaining streaming as a profitable venture—a process compounded by Twitch’s own interest in commoditizing queer content as a way of displaying its own apparent diversity. </jats:p>",

Accounts of game industry practices have been at the forefront of efforts within media studies to document and theorize conditions and transformations of labor under digital capitalism. The study of digital game labor has tended to cluster around four areas of inquiry: below-the-line labor, the creative labor of game development, player-production, and game labor politics. Providing empirically informed portraits of diverse contexts and experiences of gamework, this issue interrogates multiple dimensions of precarious work and social exclusion within an industry whose playful self-image can make it a resistant object of labor-centered analysis. The contributors to this issue promote a research orientation that is attentive to how work in the digital game industry might be made more accessible and sustainable. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a new critical framework through which to analyze television period drama, recognizing elements that indicate a more progressive point of view than many previous scholarly responses have acknowledged. It begins by assessing the seminal works of Andrew Higson and Claire Monk in the field of period drama, adopting the latter’s term of “post-heritage” to identify an alternative critical perspective. The five guiding elements of the proposed post-heritage framework are then outlined, with reference to pertinent critical works that identify these in period dramas and other production. A preliminary case study of The Crown is then offered, through which the post-heritage framework is demonstrated as an aesthetic methodological process. The Crown’s use of the media within its narrative and conceptual ambiguity are considered particularly closely. The article concludes by suggesting the wider applications for the post-heritage critical framework, and potential further study relating to The Crown. </jats:p>",

In analyzing the effects of internet distribution on sports television, this article specifically examines how internet distribution has fostered the emergence of independent sports television producers and distributors operating outside the traditional sports television system. Using the sport of Ultimate frisbee (Ultimate) as a case study, the article first argues that the new streaming companies that have emerged around that sport have largely modeled their streams on legacy sports television, but have also looked to adapt the conventions of traditional sports television to the specificities of the sport. Second, the article suggests that a particular area of concern for these independent streaming companies has been representation, as these companies have sought to offer a more progressive form of sports television. </jats:p>",

Using The Bachelorette’s 2020 season and CNN’s concurrent coverage of 2020s famously disputed presidential election as case studies, it argues that both broadcasts’ copious references to the soundness of the “processes” they purport to depict both naturalize and stabilize the tenuous notions of heterosexuality and democracy on which they rest. The two programs’ exemplary televisual “process” discourse reassures even cynical viewers that, though much of the pleasure US audience-members take in their broadcasts derives from the spectacle (or threat) of dysfunctionality, we can ultimately rely on the functionality of the systems that govern our lives. Not least, it courts the perception that television is the true arbiter of “the process,” and thus that TV itself deserves Americans’ trust—a vitally important impression to maintain during a global pandemic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following work by John Ellis and John Langer, scholars often define television stardom against film stardom, a dichotomy that depends on a view of television as lesser than film, and which impedes our understanding of television stardom. Taking Friends as a case study, this article argues that situation comedies freeze stars in time, limiting their abilities to work both outside their character type and as they age, while offering limitless possibilities for the circulation of the star in a media culture characterized by self-referentiality and intertextuality. While previous scholarship on stardom might suggest that this failure to transcend character makes television stardom less valuable, in the television economy, the character is more valuable than the actor who plays her. Following Derek Kompare’s argument that the rerun is the quintessential television form, stardom gained from a Nielsen-dominating sitcom with an ever-present afterlife may be the most valuable form of television stardom. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "It should not be a mystery to readers of this journal that White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told Americans to “watch what they say” instead of “don’t watch Bill Maher” after the infotainment talk show host questioned White House hyperbole. One of the first casualties in the television war on terrorism was free inquiry on the news and public affairs programs on the major U.S. networks. When the canary in the informational coal mine is Bill Maher, however, you know Fleischer’s warning is more than a call for judicious journalism. After all, the White House spokesman did not go after Susan Sontag, who echoed Maher’s remarks in a New Yorker article. Television news and public affairs programming, even the quasi-comedic formats, are the primary means for U.S. residents to know the world (truly sorry, Susan). Although decades of downsizing international news operations in the five networks should have produced the strategic silences desired by the Bush administration, the dialectics of commercialization worked instead to increase the demand for sensational imagery, including an unedited statement by Osama bin Laden that all the networks greedily rushed to buy from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera satellite news (which was reportedly charging U.S.$20,000 per minute to the U.S. networks for use of its exclusive reporting from Afghanistan). The ratings soared for news as ad time diminished. In an effort to banish all dissenting opinion from the airwaves, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, brought the White House agenda directly to executives at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and Fox. Do not show “inflammatory” messages from bin Laden or the Al Qaeda group again, she told them. They agreed. Monitoring the effect of White House",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article examines emerging practices of personalization in political talk shows on Romanian television. Our interest lies in the reconfiguration of the role of critical journalist, as performed by talk show hosts on private TV channels, in the context of increasing commercialization and instrumentalization of the Romanian media in postcommunism. This development consists of the strategic use of personalization, achieved through the talk show dispositive, for the enactment of positions of journalistic interpretation, adversarialness, and intervention on behalf of the citizens. The findings indicate shifts in the symmetry/asymmetry relationships between journalists, guests, politicians, and publics, as well as new ways of constructing and understanding public issues. Two main patterns of personalization have been identified: the journalist as a fully engaged voice, effectively substituting itself for the public opinion, and the journalist as an ordinary person, who has the capacity to see through and expose dominant public discourses. </jats:p>",

Through an examination of Barbie Fashionistas, Style Studio: Fashion Designer, and Central Park Wedding Prep, all of which are representative of traditional dress-up and makeover-oriented girl games, I explore how seemingly broad mechanics-based choices available to players within the games reinforce and respond to patriarchal ideologies, and argue that the mechanics of mobile and online girl games serve gendered and neoliberal ends both in game and in the larger context of North American gaming culture. Conducting close readings on and accounting for the mechanics of an understudied genre within the field to advocate for greater study of both game mechanics and girl games, I demonstrate how the availability of choice intrinsic in girl games provides opportunity to explore how players are constructed as neoliberal subjects. </jats:p>",

Using the theoretical frameworks of critical digital labor studies, girls’ media studies, and feminist theory, we argue that the tween-coms imagine the tween content creator as a post-feminist neoliberal subject in three ways: first, by hiding the labor behind the affective sentiments of play; second, by obscuring the misogynistic structure; and third, by framing childhood digital spaces as separate from adult spheres, legitimizing corporate encroachments into children’s digital lives. The shows are a distillation of the neoliberal, post-feminist ideologies that define late-stage capitalism. The discursive formation of digital girls on children’s television has been overlooked in the field of digital studies and girl studies. Our paper explores how digital content creation is discursively constructed within the cultural imaginaries of children’s media. </jats:p>",

In this article, I illustrate how Lost uses the strategies of what I call mastermind narration to rearticulate this imperiled textual authority. The strategies of this tendency include the use of repeated subject matter, particularly confidence tricks, and the patterning of textual form, particularly through shifting the narrational valence of series flashbacks.</jats:p>",

The work examines how participants on reality shows, to legitimate themselves under surveillance, must assert what the author terms the “therapeutics of the self,” a pride in displaying a consistent self verified by surveillance. The “therapeutics of the self” builds on the trend observed by scholars studying therapeutic culture in which people are incited to constantly work on, hence change, the self. The author argues that the “therapeutics of the self” promotes as therapeutic the assertion of self-sameness across disparate social spaces (on the shows and in “real” life): stasis. Hence, paradoxically, the unchanged self works to improve—change—the self. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital platforms, from Instagram to Spotify, have become central to the production, distribution, and monetization of cultural content. This essay discusses how this process of platformization poses three interrelated challenges for the research on and governance of contemporary cultural industries. First, platformization complicates the question of media concentration, as platform corporations integrate highly diverse businesses, not only hosting and curating media content, but also functioning as advertising networks, data intermediaries, and so on. Second, it thwarts the regulation of media content, as platforms channel vast amounts of heterogeneous materials, shared by a broad range of users, making it extremely difficult to maintain oversight. Third, the growing dominance of platform corporations over the cultural domain makes it vital, but also difficult, to develop and sustain online public service media and alternative noncommercial platforms. The essay closes by discussing how these challenges can and should be addressed from the perspective of media studies. </jats:p>",

In both contexts, Netflix first establishes itself through collaborations with over-the-top (OTT) television operators and then expands through collaborations with legacy providers. By using the perspective of cross-national comparative research, this analysis complicates the scholarly understandings of subscription video on-demand (SVOD) global expansion by drawing attention to the significance of national multichannel providers. Given the differences between the Spanish and Israeli pay-TV markets, Netflix’s similar pattern of engagement in each case highlights the value of understanding SVOD global expansion as a coherent industrial process that produces distinct, context-dependent outcomes. Ultimately, the histories of Netflix in Israel and Spain reveal that internationalization operates at a meso-level where collaborations with pay-television providers facilitate access to national audiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the aesthetic genealogy of the cue card confession social media trope, where producers create a self-portrait or vlog featuring handwritten cards to relate an autobiographical narrative. Returning to Michael Foucault’s theories of self-writing as a confessional discourse of the self that creates a correspondence of ethical perception between the writer and reader by way of contemporary theorizations of the demand for authenticity and consumability in social media, I argue that the cue card confessions constitute an important mode of self-writing that uses the visual spectacle of the body and the discursive demands of confessional discourse to invoke mediated witnessing as a mode of ethical engagement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reflects on the growing urge among researchers to visualize large-scale digital data. It argues that the desire to visualize unfolds in the context of a complex entanglement of (1) the pragmatics of data visualization, (2) the problematic ideological work that visualizations do, (3) the politics of data power and neoliberalism, and (4) visualization pleasures. The article begins by outlining the considerations that constitute data visualization design, highlighting the complexity of the process. It then provides an overview of critical debates about the way that visualizations work, which are relevant to reflective visualization practice. Then, it turns to the context (of datafication and the neoliberalization of the university) in which academic researchers contemplate visualization futures and which simultaneously constrains the realization of these futures. Finally, the article acknowledges the cracks in these structures, the pleasure of visualizing data, for example, in using visualization for advocacy and social justice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates marketers’ new media strategies targeting the millennial generation. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with industry professionals and an assortment of business discourses, I find that this consumer demographic is routinely conceptualized as “digital natives” who exhibit a “networked hypersociality” and a “participatory exhibitionism.” A variety of innovative promotional tactics are being used to solicit self-expression and cultivate community within branded spaces and flows online. This development could reshape the advertising industry as commercialization further blurs with social and cultural content, obfuscating branding’s persuasive purpose from audiences. It also raises concerns about commercialization hijacking the political potential of an often-cited “empowering” new media environment as well as diminishing opportunity for youth identity to exist autonomous from the consumer marketplace at a time of escalating personal debt. </jats:p>",

Devices such as smart phones, cameras, drones, and a growing array of environmental sensors (both fixed and mobile) and interactive online platforms have come to permeate daily life in technologically equipped societies. Consequently, we are witnessing a shift from targeted, purposeful, and discrete forms of information collection to always-on, ubiquitous, opportunistic ever-expanding forms of data capture. The increased use of sensors marks important changes to our understandings of surveillance, information processing, and privacy. In this article, we explore the transformations associated with the emerging sensing environment. The notion of a sensor society provides a conceptual basis for understanding the characteristics of emerging forms of monitoring and control. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article discusses the social uses of television from the late 1950s to the mid-2000s. In the tradition of media ethnography, it depicts both the structural and the relational uses of television. It looks at changes in watching television in social intercourse: in family viewing and social life outside the home. The primary sources for the study are two collections of written reminiscences about television in Finnish everyday life. The article shows how multidimensional the uses of television have been over the decades and how TV has often played an important role in social life. Looking broadly at the findings, one could say that despite the many technological and cultural changes in television’s history, most of the main features of television habits remain. TV is still a social family media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article documents two ethnographic explorations (2012, 2015) held at Hop! group based in Israel, when it was in transition from being a preschool television company into a preschool content group. Three core challenges presented by new technologies were revealed: the need to be present on every screen; understanding the affordances of each technology; and finding successful collaborations. The article discusses the ways in which Hop! addressed those challenges, focusing on the transition from a dedicated television set into a multiplicity of screens; the negotiation of the new platforms’ affordances; and the development of a workforce suitable for platform content production. These challenges reveal that despite the feeling of revolution within the company caused by the great extent and rapid pace of technological innovation, what we see is a potentially endless transition period since, like the mythological hydra, after the affordances of new technologies become clear another technology springs up. </jats:p>",

The results reveal a continuum of activity from “lurkers” to a thriving, interpretive community of “outlaw” fans involved in the consumption and production of favored cultural texts. In contrast to historical images of rabid television fans, the researchers discovered a sophisticated audience, devoted to programs that make them think and that inspire meaningful exchanges in online discussions. Internet technologies have empowered these fans to more effectively organize en masse as resistors and shapers of commercial television narratives. </jats:p>",

Informed by phenomenological approaches, they present a comparison between Breakout and Wii Sports to suggest that the short history of videogame “plesiovision” should be rethought. The Wii’s genuine novelties are worthy of analysis in their own right but also highlight the significance of kinaesthesia in popular technoculture, suggest ways of theorising and studying proprioceptive bodies (both human and nonhuman), across videogame culture and televisual history. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article seeks to raise questions about historiographical practice, challenge the reliance on apparently stable discourses of nation and race within contemporary historiography, and expand understanding of the potential and multiple sites of influence in which television operated during its early years as a popular medium. Drawing on principles articulated by Foucault and de Certeau about the production and generation of knowledge, the article critiques previous historical examinations of Amos ‘n’ Andy for overlooking salient features of the television program's cultural and industrial context, as well as its syndication run from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. Using information about the syndication of Amos ‘n’ Andy gleaned principally from entertainment and advertising trade journals, the article points out how a more thorough understanding of the local, regional, and international context and of industrial practices may prove essential for recognizing possibilities about the patterns and circulation of cultural beliefs and historiographical norms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Television scholar Jason Mittell coined the term narrative complexity to describe television shows that feature serialized plots within episodic television. In this article the author examines a specific form of narrative complexity, temporal displacement, as a salient feature of contemporary television shows. He argues that shows that rely on temporal displacement illustrate the industry’s reaction to and the audience’s resolution of post-modern schizophrenia. Furthermore, the author demonstrates how the contemporary digital media landscape not only encourages but also seemingly necessitates a complex interaction with temporality. The author concludes that temporal displacement is a palliative consequence that is beginning to inscribe people’s interaction with all media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at the use of digital kiosks and multimedia and multisensory presentation within the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in Washington, D.C., to denaturalize assumptions about visitor and audience subject formation. Museums like the NMAI include numerous media technologies including multimedia presentations and digital kiosks as they vie for the attention of museum visitors. Proponents of digital kiosks in public spaces argue that they promote active engagement among visitors by encouraging “free-choice” learning, a process through which users make decisions about the content reviewed. This article argues that “free-choice” learning makes several assumptions regarding subject formation and that these assumptions constrain understanding of how media technologies shape meaning making potential in indigenous museums. It suggests that the existence of digital kiosks and multimedia presentations indicates disparate assumptions about visitor subjectivity and that these media are integral to the “techniques of the self” performed by the museum visitor as a multicultural citizen. </jats:p>",

They also are a significant and growing component of production budgets for television programming and commercials. Yet, despite the rising status of VFX, this sector of the media business has been in turmoil for over a decade, a situation made palpable by recurring waves of bankruptcies and layoffs, most notably including Rhythm &amp; Hues, the company that scored the 2013 Oscar for VFX in Life of Pi. This essay analyzes the increasingly globalized mode of production in the VFX industry. We critically examine the specific practices and protocols of the VFX business, demonstrating their impact on workers and labor-organizing efforts. Tying together insights from political economy, creative economy, and production studies, the essay offers a middle-range analysis that connects specific local labor conditions to broader trends in the media industries. </jats:p>",

This labor involves digitally mediated outward countenance, including being friendly to viewers, soliciting donations, building parasocial intimacy with spectators, and engaging audiences through humor. We offer an examination of streamers broadcasting as a “character,” which we situate within the context of play becoming work, the labor of performance and acting, and the economic compulsions that shape cultural labor on Twitch. We draw on hundred interviews with professional and aspiring-professional game broadcasters conducted in 2016 and 2017 at gaming events across the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Poland, alongside ethnographic research. This inquiry into the dynamics of digital games and labor underscores the importance of studying live streaming as part of a wider critical investigation of contemporary digital work. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In pandemic TV, the horror of the home was not only part of the narrative in several shows that depicted pandemic-related plots, but also a result of the tension between the textual and the contextual. As people were feeling trapped indoors, even the most colorful televised living room stood as a symbol of the inability to leave the spatial confines of domesticity. In this paper, I show how pandemic television added an ominous layer to the representation of the home, either directly through narrative means or indirectly through text-versus-meaning dissonance. Intersectionalizing feminist analysis of the domestic space, I argue that texts that attempted to sidestep pandemic-related content often emphasized it even more so, through format and framing, therefore negating the escapism they were trying to achieve.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last decade, depictions of characters who obtain abortions onscreen have come closer to representing the reality of abortion seekers, addressing, though not eliminating, documented discrepancies across race, class, and barriers to abortion care. Yet year after year, portrayals of characters parenting at the time of their abortions represent less than 10% of the total characters who have abortions, a striking departure from reality, where most people who have abortions are raising children. This paper is a qualitative content analysis of the twenty-three characters onscreen from 2013 to 2023 shown parenting at the time of their abortions. I incorporate the theory of the abortion imaginary to explore how these representations are materially different from the majority of televisual abortion representations in that they offer a window into the (im)possibilities within motherhood. These portrayals may disrupt some stereotypes about abortion seekers, but they also reinforce conservative ideals about intensive, all-consuming, self-sacrificing motherhood. </jats:p>",

It explores terrorism as a hypermedia event that resists conceptual containment in Dayan and Katz’s three categories of “contest,” “conquest,” or “coronation.” It builds on work that recognizes the globality of media events. The article uses the rise of IS to explore events as a peculiar articulation of space and time, and draws on the global “network-archive” that IS created (its digital footprint), the referentiality of which means that we experience IS depredations as one continuous “global event chain.” In this analysis, media events are a productive force that articulates territoriality and temporality through affect. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article asks, “How can indigenous media fulfill its obligations toward the indigenous population while also connecting with the majority?” In the entertainment television series Muitte mu, produced by the indigenous public service broadcaster NRK Sápmi in Norway, famous Norwegian artists learn to joik, a Sámi form of music. Muitte mu triggered a discussion concerning cultural appropriation and commercialization, as well as the traditionalist versus pragmatic and interethnic views of indigenous cultural expressions. One of NRK Sápmi’s goals is to share content about the Sámi, and, in a market-oriented media environment, the series uses Sámi iconography and celebrities to fulfill this goal. However, this approach does not necessarily resonate with its main obligation, which is to provide programming for the Sámi people. What is at stake in these debates are the credibility, relevance, and legitimacy of NRK Sápmi, all of which depend upon the recognition of the Sámi themselves. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Story Work: Non-Proprietary Autonomy and Contemporary Television Writing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on interviews with three dozen working writers in American television, this paper argues that TV writers assert their status as labor to guarantee their shared craft identity with novelists, dramatists, and authors of other conventional literary material. The tension between writers’ desire for literary prestige on one hand, and their recognition that they create at the behest of company executives, on the other, emerges, alternately, in the imagined difference between writers and producers and, most basically, between autonomous creators and corporate hacks. Our novel observation is that writers’ identification with labor, including their commitment to their union, the Writers Guild of America, plays a central role in resolving these tensions. Union membership solves a problem at the heart of contemporary TV writing insofar as it transforms a necessity into a virtue; opposing management as labor, the writer registers her opposition to creative input that might otherwise compromise her sense of artistic integrity. That opposition allows writers to imagine themselves at odds with the studios and networks that employ them, and at the same time to commit to artistic over and against corporate values. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Try Guys’ “what happened” video, which appears on their YouTube channel, narrates their cancellation of colleague Ned Fulmer because of an extra-marital relationship with an employee. Some literature suggests that cancel culture offers disempowered individuals and groups methods of identifying and correcting hateful practices. However, I employ the humanities practice of close reading to demonstrate how emotional cancel practices can elide intolerant systems and sustain norms. I analyze The Try Guys’ content, reportage about the group, and YouTube. As I argue, The Try Guys’ claims about enacting an ethical cancellation displace their reliance on “humorously” sexualizing women’s bodies and mocking femininity in videos about incongruously wearing women’s clothing. I also elaborate on direct address literature as a method of articulating cancel culture’s “direct addresses with feelings,” how The Try Guys use the cancellation to render the brand and connect with fans, and how my analysis contributes to related scholarship. </jats:p>",

The study draws on interviews with nightlife photographers to examine how they account for the creative and promotional aspects of their labor.

This article explores the use of dubbing among Italian and Mexican audiences of The Big Bang Theory and The Walking Dead. Fieldwork consisted of twenty-two semi-structured interviews, preceded by the textual analysis of the two series. Participants showed awareness that dubbing plays a role in the viewing moment and is clearly connected to the expected fidelity of translation, furthermore, it could be also a factor with wider social significance. In Mexico, watching dubbed programming was connected to issues of distinction and cultural capital, while in Italy dubbing is still pervasive but younger generations are using it less. In the current television landscape of wider availability of content and linguistic versions, interdisciplinary work with Audiovisual Translation scholars could be productive to account for the practices of international audiences. </jats:p>",

Behind the emergence of these practices lie important trends enabling alternative public discourses and altering the cultural production, but also an environment mainly characterized by the low trust in mainstream news organizations and high ideological polarization that seem to give shape to political entertainment contents—and especially their overt political partisanship. Based on observations of independent political entertainment YouTube channels in Mexico, this study delves into their apparently contradictory intersections with professional journalism and the constraints imposed on their practice by platform affordances. </jats:p>",

However, a growing community of leftist YouTube content creators, loosely coalescing into the platform’s “LeftTube,” have developed dialogic relationships with some of YouTube’s most extreme content. This work focuses on one specific LeftTube creator, ContraPoints, to explore how those on the political left engage with YouTube’s cultural and technical affordances to challenge alt-right ideology. Through a textual analysis of ContraPoints’ top thirty videos, we identified three main discursive strategies: practicing deradicalization strategies on YouTube; establishing alt-right individuals as an intentional audience; and developing a language for escaping alt-right logics. ContraPoints, and her rightful critics, demonstrate how political subjectivities are created and contested within YouTube as both a technical and cultural space. </jats:p>",

Amy, a white American English teacher in Korea, highlights the differences between her and Korean society in her content about Korea, while Erin, a Korean American, critiques Amy’s content by emphasizing the distinction between her experience as an immigrant and Amy’s experience as a white American. The study explores how the emphasis on self-branding can obscure power dynamics and historical inequalities within identity-based content creation, which inherently reflects geopolitics and racial hierarchy. The research further examines how this type of content creation can serve as a space for the negotiation of power dynamics between dominant and non-dominant identities while also functioning as a means to build a self-brand in the digital content creation field. </jats:p>",

As both programs enact and respond to television’s and the pandemic’s challenging of boundaries (public/private, inside/outside, self/other, fact/fantasy) but do so in very different ways, they highlight limitations and possibilities of media logics in this pandemic age.</jats:p>",

However, children were not passive victims: they took an active role in diminishing their television-related fears by using various coping strategies, including peer mediation. These results support the notion that children are second-level mediators who share with their peers both their own experiences and what their parents have taught them about television. </jats:p>",

This article takes online TV interfaces as its object of study and interrogates to what ends SVODs use them. In particular, it examines how the interface can operate as a part of an SVOD’s larger branding campaign. Using Netflix as a case study, the article argues that the interface is discursively positioned as empowering viewers to easily find what they want to watch, yet the actual operation and affordances of the interface significantly delimit viewer agency. Instead, the interface works to guide viewers to Netflix original content to strengthen the core brand values of abundance, personalization, and exclusivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how a specific form of lifestyle programming indexes both national concerns and transnational financial trends as well as diffuse social fissures in Irish life. Emerging in the late 1990s amid a construction boom, Irish property television adapted and thrived through the subsequent post-2008 crash, the concomitant implementation of austerity policies and an ensuing housing crisis. This boom-to-bust cycle was precipitated by the financialization of property within Ireland, a process whereby housing and commercial property became embedded in transnational financial market cycles. Through an analysis of three key examples of the genre, this article argues that for the most part, Irish property television seeks to hold at bay anxieties generated by a growing wealth and income disparity in the state. While this programming displays an ideological commitment to the “investor subjects” of home-ownership, increasingly the concerns of those excluded from this version of the good life are evident. </jats:p>",

The year 1995 marked a disruption when the National Science Foundation (NSF), the public agency that controlled and exploited the network, transferred its regulatory responsibilities to the private sector. Despite the system’s provision of free access to information, the Internet’s entire economic logic was modified when advertising became the standard norm. The objective of this article is to summarize the history of the Internet and the points that are important to understanding its actual political and economic logic via an emphasis on social networking sites.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years several older, serialized TV dramas have experienced surges in popularity among young viewers. The 2020-21 online resurgence of The Sopranos (1999–2007) is perhaps the most compelling example of this. Using the data from a series of semi-structured interviews conducted with fans who watched the show for the first time in 2020-21, this study considers what draws audiences to “old shows” and how they adapt them to contemporary contexts of interpretation. I argue that there are specific considerations that we need to make when investigating contemporary audience receptions of old television. Ultimately, The Sopranos resurgence highlights a new type of “afterlife” for serial drama. Using Miller’s work on retextuality I conclude that it is important that we understand the resurgent versions of these TV shows as the new texts they are. They perform impactful types of cultural work, distinct from their original run. </jats:p>",

But Trump’s very singular personality clearly exerts its own form of agency—somehow appealing to his supporters, and increasingly alarming to many others. In tandem with a set of cultural anxieties, gendered and racialized phobias, economic disparities, and new social media avenues for the expression of populist violence and rage, the industrialized process of celebrification we described in our book has functioned to elevate, and not to diminish, the significance of the particular set of reactionary and narcissistic pathologies Trump embodies.

Live streaming is a key part of the contemporary digital media landscape; it sits at the center of wide-reaching shifts in how culture, entertainment, and labor are expressed and experienced online today. Gender and sexuality are crucial elements of live streaming. Across live streaming’s many forms, these elements manifest in myriad ways: from gendered performances to gender-based harassment, from LGBTQ community building to real-time sex work. This special issue models an interdisciplinary approach to studying gender and sexuality in live streaming, featuring scholarship from the humanities, social sciences, and human-computer interaction. It also serves as an impassioned call to those who study technological tools and platforms like live streaming to pay attention to the crucial roles that identity, power, embodiment, and intimacy play in these technologies. There can be no full cultural understanding of live streaming that does not address its entanglements with sexuality and gender. </jats:p>",

Although a mainly German-speaking group, the IAAPP also regularly referred to studies from the U.S., but only selectively adopted their approaches concerning audiovisual practices in psychiatry. Technological and legal conditions for the implementation of television systems in psychiatric clinics were debated and elaborated by the working group and formed the basis for the development of various methods of television and video therapy. The members of the IAAPP were particularly interested in approaches to self-confrontation through video recordings which should induce self-reflection, compliance with therapeutic measures, or a coherent self-image. </jats:p>",

This moment thus provides an example of bottom–up, “vernacular” policy making that challenges top–down approaches to policy. Taking the experience of Madison, Wisconsin, as its case study, this essay explores the processes of local policy translation, including metaphors of outcomes, constructions of community identity and power, and struggles over locally dominant understandings of the community within local political-economic conditions. It also draws conclusions about the conditions within which a media-minded public can emerge and organize itself for reform, the relative power of utopian and dystopian rhetoric in citizen policy making, the conflict between citizen activism and bureaucratic governmentality, and the mechanisms by which citizens might secure policy advantages relative to economically and politically more powerful parties. </jats:p>",

Empirically, the article looks at how (Indian) Idol rewrites cultural values, assumptions, and norms for nonfictional entertainment, particularly music talent shows in India. Using a production studies approach, analysis zooms in on production negotiations—the strategies and goals of the Idol format, specific calculations targeting Indian market, and how rival, homegrown shows review and revise (or reject) a format’s appeals. By investigating how producers from local nonformat shows such as Saregamapa (discussed further in the article) deliberate and rewrite their productions to challenge and overcome Idol’s allure while also adopting Idol’s features, this article argues that format copying is a coping mechanism, which reveals the tactical, creative, and cultural responses to the power of global media capital and not creative lethargy or mere copycatting. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Algorithmic Television in the Age of Large-scale Customization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> One challenge that Television Studies faces today is how to respond to the rise of an industry increasingly organized by what Antoinette Rouvroy calls “data behavioralism.” The rise of streaming prestige television, exemplified by Netflix, has significant implications within the U.S. screen industry, but the “Netflix effect,” as McDonald and Smith-Rowsey call it, is more than just a change in the industrial mode of production, means of distribution, and method of consumption. The datalogic turn on which Netflixism is based also undermines the theoretical models on which Television Studies was largely built, including theories of representation, visual interpellation and pleasure, and power as “productive.” Hence, the rise of algorithmic television is not simply a new “object” or “wave” for us to study and comment upon; it challenges the mode of knowledge-production (or dispositif) on which the field has grounded itself. </jats:p>",

The article analyzes the thematic frames the show utilizes to espouse and reinforce sport as a site of conservative value-making and male bonding. In using an interracial male pairing of Colin Cowherd and Jason Whitlock, the show mimics similarly popular debate programs on rival network ESPN, such as Pardon the Interruption and First Take. However, Whitlock in particular advances a unique brand of Black conservatism, and his clashes with progressive activists and other black guests represent intraracial tensions among Black sport media members. This paper argues Speak for Yourself brings Newscorp’s conservative messaging to a nominally apolitical space in sport media. </jats:p>",

Focusing on digitally targeted caste violence and mass protests in the name of the Tamil nation, this article argues that the networked publicity of satellite television and new media have layered themselves over existing infrastructures of mass-mediated populism. Many of the political challenges to existing structures fueled by newer media forms appear as shorter-term events, consisting of tighter, sometimes explosive temporal loops intersecting with longer-term formations. New media have thus taken advantage of the affective and narrative potentials within cinematic populism, all the while reflexively marking themselves as “new” in relation to the forms they have become parasitic upon. </jats:p>",

In the light of empirical analysis, the author presents a hierarchical typology of news stories on distant suffering that consists of adventure, emergency, and ecstatic news, and she examines the two broad ethical norms that inform these types of news: communitarianism and cosmopolitanism. The possibility for cosmopolitanism, the author concludes, lies importantly (but not exclusively) in the ways in which television tells the stories of suffering, inviting audiences to care for and act on conditions of human existence that go beyond their own communities of belonging. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws upon interviews with work-at-home (WAH) agents who did technical support for DirecTV between 2009 and 2016. Satellite television technical support workers comprise an important node in maintaining the flow of television content as it is distributed by corporations, like DirecTV, through complex and often fragile technological conditions. Using interviews, trade press, and online employee forums, I outline the history of DirecTV’s WAH call center work and employment conditions, and its dissolution after the merger with AT&amp;T. This research intervenes to demonstrate the ways in which WAH television technical support work is an ambivalent form of distributive media labor, at once feminine and immaterial, while also creative and essential for television distribution. This article also demonstrates how technical support work is influenced by current precarious and digitally converged working conditions, surveillance tactics, and media conglomerate mergers and structures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores a pronounced queer women-centered pop cultural imaginary in post-2010 China, namely, “older sister” (jie 姐﻿) fantasies that center around mature women. It contextualizes this imaginary in relation to Asian and Chinese-language girls’ love (GL) and queer women’s cultures. I trace this “older sister” trope on contemporary Chinese TV to the enduring popularity of an online 2012 autobiographical-styled queer women’s story known as the “sister-kid literature.” My analyses of the transmedia metamorphosis of the trope and the wide recitation of the story in contemporary Chinese media and pop cultural terrains reveal an evolving, heteronormativity-intervening temporal logic of adult female homoerotic narratives. By (re)considering the significance of reconstructing this “older sister” imaginary across divergent media to dismantle China’s heteronormative-patriarchal assertions of the (non-)futurity of adult lesbianism, I suggest transformative ways to understand queer women-driven (trans)media productions and cultural activities that are situated in largely LGBTQ-suffocating social and fantasy worlds. </jats:p>",

At the same time, Charlie had to be co-opted into the show’s gender dynamics. This article argues that Charlie epitomizes the ongoing postracial politics of respectability and hyper-class mobility that construct black women’s limited entry into postfeminist womanhood, as well as into the, still, rarefied white world of the “mainstream” American sitcom. Charlie seems to trouble, if temporarily, these racial limits by being both Ross’s equal in terms of education and employment and by being a temporary part of the group through her relationships with Joey and Ross. Comparing her with Ross’s previous girlfriend Julie, this article will also consider the ways that the problematic representation of Ross’s girlfriends of color structure the postfeminist tropes of fate and retreatism central to Ross and Rachel’s happy ending. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through evidence gathered from sixteen interviews with producers and businesspeople in the podcast industry, this paper argues that the professionals that populated the early phase of the formalizing podcasting scene made up an interpretive community defined, in part, by their appreciation for, and experiences with, public radio. I chart how this interpretive community cast themselves against dominant public radio paradigms when they moved into podcasting, while also retaining much of public radio’s ethos, and I discuss what the central preoccupations of this interpretive community were. I assert that audio broadcasting as understood and practiced within the interpretive community is a particularly millennial medium, influenced by the norms of digital communication. And I make claims about how this is foundational to understanding podcasting’s political and aesthetic predispositions. Ultimately, this argument advances and nuances one connection between public radio and podcasting using qualitative interview data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article juxtaposes The Good Wife’s ( TGW) representation of Alicia Florrick’s experience as a professional woman and a mother, against interview accounts of middle-class women who left successful careers after having children. I show that TGW furnishes a compelling fantasy based on (1) the valorization of combining motherhood with competitive, long-hours high-powered waged work as the basis for a woman’s value and liberation, and (2) an emphasis on women’s professional performance and satisfaction as depending largely on their individual self-confidence and ability to “lean in,” while marginalizing the impact of structural issues on women’s success and workplace equality. This fantasy fails to correspond to women’s lived experience, but shapes their sense of self in painful ways. The TGW fantasy thus involves a relation of “cruel optimism”: it attracts women to desire it while impeding them from tackling the structural issues that are obstructing realization of their desire. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the way media technologies provide interfaces for the complexity of cities as historically layered, continuously changing, and intricately connected spaces. Following Branden Hookway and Alexander Galloway, I understand media interfaces as processes rather than objects. An interface is not something; it does something. I propose to focus on the way in which often temporary, mobile, and connected interfaces produce urban cartographies in the very act and process of navigation. This navigation constitutes a performative cartography of ambulant presence, fluid connectivity, and an inherent multiplicity of connections between locations and other subjects. In what follows, I examine a small collection of urban art projects that speak to this description and suggest that the interface’s pursuits of connectivity, and the stakes and claims inseparable from these pursuits, produce and structure urban cartographies. The article then questions in what ways interfaces can create, not a threshold between two dimensions, but spatial transformations of a third kind. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the figure of the lifestyle expert on television through an analysis of a popular U.S. makeover show, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. It situates the popularity and significance of this program within the context of recent scholarship documenting a broader shift away from more traditional, educational modes of mediatized expertise toward revalued, “feminine” forms of “ordinary” knowledge. Despite the persuasive claims for this shift, the lifestyle expert nevertheless plays a strongly pedagogical role by authorizing certain models of social identity and “good” citizenship—lifestyle and makeover culture being associated with idealized images of the self as a reflexive and enterprising consumer—citizen. Using Queer Eye as a generative exemplar of this increasingly common mode of pedagogy, the article analyzes the way in which the show attempts to negotiate the potential disjuncture between a conception of the self as reflexive and “post-traditional” and more traditional classed and gendered models of selfhood. </jats:p>",

Subsequently, a comparative case study analysis is conducted. Included in the analysis are three PSM multiplatform projects targeted at younger users: that is, TV Lab (France Télévisions), Carte Blanche (VRT, Flanders), and BNN University (NPO, the Netherlands). Findings are based on a qualitative document analysis and semistructured interviews with both producers of and participants in these multiplatform projects. </jats:p>",

As developers are central to the industry and the larger games culture, their views reveal how indies are imagined as a privileged site free from economic pressures where racism can be ameliorated. Based on interviews with developers, I argue that the project to redress representational inequities within games is shifted on to indie developers, intensifying their emotional and cultural labor. Indie game developers are imagined as the solution, yet this perspective underestimates the precariousness of independent game production. Economic precariousness may encourage indies to repeat certain patterns of racial representation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While race is usually an implicit discourse in reality television, making it an explicit discourse seems to have little effect on challenging the prevailing representations of race in prime-time television. This research demonstrates how Survivor ’s “race wars” season attempted to reinforce a “postracial” narrative that race no longer matters in contemporary U.S. society while simultaneously perpetuating the familiar representations that reproduce racial ideology. Using data derived from a systematic content analysis, the author argues that Survivor spectacularized race by (1) using racial logic to explain the success and failure of teams as well as the failure of individuals to survive within their teams, (2) essentializing people of color’s racial identity as biologically and culturally bound while simultaneously making whiteness invisible and normal, and (3) promoting color-blind and postracial assertions that contradicted the clear salience of race in shaping contestants’ “survival.” The author considers what this explicit racialization of the program reveals about the potential for—and pitfalls of—addressing race in reality television.</jats:p>",

It posits that a variety of narrative features enable a strategy of “working through” in which characters’ frank conversations and evolving perspectives depict the process of experiencing ideological challenge. Working through emphasizes the need for scholars to fully explore the internally contradictory narratives that are characteristic of the increasing complexity of some television storytelling and defies norms of critical media analysis that argue particular media texts either reinforce or resist dominant ideology. Cogent examination of other instances of working through could reinvigorate stymied intellectual spaces by insisting that scholars consider characters’ process of struggle with ideological perspectives throughout the unfolding of a series. </jats:p>",

The narratives and representations in the three programs raise questions about the role of immaterial labor, gender, and technology in contemporary life. Each series articulates and reifies the unequal sexual division of labor around prized technological work. The texts also express the instability of humanity as it becomes ever more intimate with new technology. As cyborgs, the main protagonists are temporary subjects because technology is driven by capital’s need for newer products and newer iterations of existing technology. The potential for liberation and collective activity that comes with the newfound power, skill, and interconnection of cyborgs is closed off.

    "abstract": "A 16 September 2001 New York Times article describes a vision of the future “in the Brave New World of Fortress New York” (Barstow 2001). A diagram of an expensive but secure Times Square displays camera icons at each major intersection. These cameras would be connected to facial recognition technology that can digitally identify people on the street. According to the article, biometrics are a favorite of each of nine security and terrorism experts interviewed. On 17 September, the stock market reopened, and Visionics Corporation, the leading company in facial recognition technology, finished at number six in CNBC’s top ten stocks for the day. This was quite an achievement for a company whose premier product offering, aptly named FaceIt, is easily fooled by lighting changes, camera angle, beards, weight gain, and other minor changes in facial appearance. Much of the press coverage, however, has failed to adequately address the potential fallibility of the technology, instead structuring the debate over new surveillance systems as a trade-off between security and privacy. If the anti-terrorism legislation is any indication, it seems that “privacy” is losing both the discursive and the legislative battle, even if it is not clear how the new surveillance will provide us with increased “security.” Still, to say that privacy rights are suffering post-9/11 is an oversimplification. Consider a Visionics white paper issued on 24 September titled “Protecting Civilization from the Faces of Terror: A Primer on the Role Facial Recognition Technologies Can Plan in Enhancing Airport Security” (http://www.visionics.com/newsroom/downloads/whitepapers/ counterterrorism.pdf). The document offers an outline of how the company’s FaceIt system can be used to nab terrorist suspects without infringing on privacy rights.",

Using material collected during an extensive study of diverse media treatments of British politics, it raises questions about the functions that comedy performs within civic culture and civic subjectivity, giving emphasis to broadcasting. Selected accounts from respondent groups are used to investigate further the ways in which comedy contributes to the placing of politics within the everyday and to the naturalization, or questioning, of the power relations at work. The article concludes by suggesting that further work on comic treatments, alongside studies of other sources of political information and commentary, will be a valuable aspect of research on political culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article develops a critical alternative to the common equation between participatory culture and democratic communication and argues that power on online participatory platforms should be understood as the governance of semiotic open-endedness. This article argues that the concept of cultural expression cannot be understood solely by looking at users’ cultural practices, but should be revisited to pay attention to the networked conditions that enable it. This involves tracing the governance of disparate processes such as protocols, software, linguistic processes, and cultural practices that make the production and circulation of meaning possible. Thus, communication on participatory platforms should be understood as the management of flows of meaning, that is, as the processes of codification of the informational, technical, cultural, and semiotic dynamics through which meanings are expressed. This makes it possible to understand the logics through which software platforms transform information into cultural signs and shape users’ perceptions and agencies. </jats:p>",

Focalizing the anniversaries of September 11, 2002 and 2011, on Swedish television, this article pursues how the medium annually commemorates the tragedy. Fusing television research with memory studies, the argument is that we may approach the anniversaries as an electronic “lieu de mémorie”: a material-symbolic space reappropriated annually as media become vehicles for “working through” in commemoration, mourning, debate, and critique. Despite the fragmentation of both television and collective memory in the context of digitalization, on the anniversaries, Swedish television promotes itself as a central “nucleus” for connectivity offering viewers a return to the traumatic site— to the television set—while interpellating them as a “global we,” of media witnesses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> On Congressional approval in 2014, Brazil’s charter of civil rights for the Internet, the Marco Civil da Internet, was widely acclaimed as a template for national Internet policy elsewhere in the world. This was the result of a phenomenon I dub “draft once; deploy everywhere,” a pervasive belief in the universality of Internet law. This presumption underpins multiple charters of Internet rights drafted by digital rights organizations and policymakers. By showing how the Marco Civil was bitterly contested by blocks of powerful actors, the role played by Brazil’s recent history of dictatorship as well as its status at the margins of the global digital economy, I problematize the Marco Civil’s status as a global blueprint. This matters because without proper contextualization, the effective transfer of Internet law across national jurisdictions will be harder to realize, and their democratic virtues will prove more elusive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While brand-run accounts of Twitter have attracted many a meme for their hit-and-miss attempts at relatable humor, on Instagram one type of brand account is quietly thriving: the Netflix Original series Instagram account. This paper studies brand personification on social media at a niche angle. By analyzing posts from three popular Netflix Original series Instagram accounts, we found that each account co-ops fan practices and enacts its own specific fannish persona. This paper reports on how and why Netflix enacts a fannish persona on its Original series Instagram accounts, to locate the personified Instagram account within the context of social media communication strategies. As the original advertisers of Instagram, there is established research on influencers which investigates the implications of people turning themselves into brands. What may call for more research in the future is the opposite: what are the consequences of brands turning themselves into people? </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Banality of Boundaries: Performance of the Nation in a Japanese Television Comedy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through the framework provided by what Billig terms “banal nationalism,” this article analyzes the performance of national identity in the Japanese media.The specific target for analysis is an episode of nodame cantabile, first broadcast on the Fuji Television Network in 2006. After a review of literature on Japanese nationalism, a number of bordering processes are identified, in particular: the presentation of a Japan—the West dichotomy, the re-presentation of social relationships and semiotic markers of Japaneseness, narrative devices that promote confidence in the Japanese mode of social organization, and the role of “trickster” played by a “foreign” conductor. The significance of these processes becomes clear when placed within the context of what, in the literature, has been termed the emergence of a diverse and multicultural “New Japan.” Although the observations contained in this article do not refute this thesis, they do add a cautionary note. As is shown, the representation of Otherness found in this episode, and the way in which “Japaneseness” is placed in relationships with the Other, highlights difference and instrumentalizes foreigners in a way that reinforces ideas of national and cultural boundedness. For a “New Japan” to emerge, it is argued, alternative forms of representation are needed; however, the possibility of this or any kind of neutral representation is called into question. The article concludes by considering avenues for further research as well as the limits and potential of this type of interpretive research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Far from being merely “a show about nothing,” this article argues that the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989-1998) managed to develop a sophisticated theory of situations and events in modern life. The show explored a rich and humorous multiplicity of everyday situations and events that took its main characters and audience members alike to the very limits of their conventional lives. Yet Seinfeld consistently stopped short of raising larger political stakes in these explorations. In other words, Seinfeld never took its critique of everyday modern life to a structural level, that is, to the historical forces and social relations that shape contemporary situations and events. By bringing Seinfeld into an intellectual encounter with communist philosopher Alain Badiou’s work on situations and events, I argue that we can gain a deeper appreciation of both sides and rethink the political and aesthetic potential of situation comedy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Viewership of traditional television programming has been steadily declining, particularly among younger audiences, who have turned to smartphones, social media, streaming services, and YouTube to consume video. These audiences also frequently engage in second-screening practices, using another device to virtually connect with others regarding what they are watching. Most prior research has focused on the effects of second screening via social media with televised content. Through a survey of teens in the Middle East ( N = 258) and young adults in the United States ( N = 643), the current study found second screening frequently occurs with both traditional TV and streaming content. Framed by co-viewing theory, results show both practices positively correlate with a constructed second-screen social capital affinity (SSSCA) scale, mirroring co-viewing in person. Findings also indicate that second screening need not take place simultaneously with video viewing to gratify social needs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since her solo debut album in 2003, Lee Hyori, one of the most famous stars in Korea, has kept her name in the limelight as a singer, actress, show host, advertising model, and fashion trendsetter. The Beyoncé-like diva in Korea metamorphosed after declaring a hiatus due to plagiarism on her fourth album. Suddenly, she became an animal-rights activist, a vegetarian, and a donor to poor citizens and encouraged political engagement. On her Twitter account, she updated all of her practices asking for public attention to social issues. Gradually, she transformed from a sexy TV diva to an exemplar of celebrity activism. However, she did not abandon her life and popularity as a top star; rather, she repositioned herself in between a beloved celebrity and a respected activist. This article examines how she has accomplished these two different tasks and what roles her social media engagement has played in the achievement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since its launch in late 2015, the Norwegian web-series Skam ( Shame), produced by public broadcaster NRK, has become one of the most notable successes in Norwegian television history, both in terms of ratings and critical acclaim. A high-school web-series about teenagers, mostly girls, coming of age in the Norwegian capital of Oslo, the series not only depicts young people in their everyday digital-media use but also reaches its audience through these same media and in a variety of formats extending far beyond video clips. Its success, we argue, is significantly tied to its multimedial form and distribution. We unpack the show’s sociocultural potential by analyzing its various outputs (video clips, screen grabs of the characters’ messenger chats, and updates from their Instagram accounts), as well as the audience’s/users’ responses to these in the form of comments to the web page. We argue that the show functions as a “transitional object” (per Winnicott) for its teen audiences, providing them with a “potential space” (also from Winnicott) in which they can learn how to cope with the challenges of a media-saturated society. </jats:p>",

Through close textual analysis of Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette (2018), I argue refractive comedy alters the message, affective nature, and form of stand-up comedy through a rejection of the dominant worldview and subsequent centering of marginalized standpoints. This essay examines Gadsby’s refraction in a broader discourse of industrial and cultural, gendered, and racial gatekeeping. I examine how refractive comedy, additionally, has inspired critical conversation on comedy’s role in relation to shared and collective trauma, as seen in Bo Burnham’s Inside (2021). </jats:p>",

It underlines the need to understand the motivated circulation of racializing discourse in the wider context of forms of “postracialism,” and the need for research to move past the paradigm of “hate speech” to get to grips with the significance and impacts of intensively circulated racist “noise.” </jats:p>",

Framing the podcast as an adaptive cultural platform, I emphasize how it is ideologically informed by both the established infrastructure and dynamics of communicative capitalism and Joe Rogan’s ethos as a comedian. The paper discusses three ways Joe Rogan and his format negotiate their relationship with platform infrastructures. The first is Rogan’s relationship with Spotify and his interest in shaping “cancel discourses” and, subsequently, his own role as an embedded, “uncancellable” skeptic. The second is the combination of Rogan’s roast universalism and pioneering speech-a-ton format, designed to establish an infrastructure for platforming his cohort of podcasting comedians on YouTube. The third is Rogan’s relationship with platform-owner Elon Musk, whose communicative capitalist agenda has political implications. The paper establishes a theoretical connection between studies of platformisation and the under-studied cultural influence of podcasting comedians. </jats:p>",

Based on a review of 102 peer-reviewed CVPF articles, we argue that CVPF has as a whole trained computers to “see” a very specific, idealized form of pornography: pictures of lone, thin, naked women. The article supports this argument by closely reading the algorithms proposed in the CVPF literature and quantitatively analyzing the images included as illustrations of these algorithms. Drawing on pornography studies, we also compare the CVPF pornographic imagination with “noisy” pornography that exceeds computer vision. Ultimately, the article argues that this very narrow imagination of porn in CVPF reflects and reinforces larger gender and sexual inequalities in the technology industry as a whole. </jats:p>",

Through an analysis of newspapers, magazines, and advertisements, this article contends that video’s history has been shaped by two seemingly opposed visions of the medium: one which embraced it as a tool for intimacy, and another that condemned it as a harbinger of spectacle. Ultimately, I argue that these two seemingly contradictory views actually share similar convictions and emerge in response to crises and conditions of American capitalism. In their attempt to grapple with video, they condemn commercial television, defend a nostalgic vision of home and family, and in so doing reveal the instability of intimacy and persistence of spectacle at the heart of American domestic life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Historically, companies have invisibilized some media workers to maintain underlying infrastructural ideologies. Likewise, contemporary commercial content moderators (CCMs) are hidden to obscure tensions inherent in digital platforms’ neoliberal ideologies and data economies. Despite this, CCMs are increasingly demanding visibility and legal rights. However, companies are responding by crafting their own narratives about CCMs for different audiences. What representations do these companies create about CCMs, and with what effects? Using thematic analysis of three case study examples, I outline discourses of “heroic battles,” resilience and wellness, and humanness. These discourses naturalize underlying infrastructural ideologies and could impact future legal protections. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> When An African City, an online television series produced in Ghana, debuted in 2014, the show immediately garnered a following, both within Ghana and abroad. The success of An African City demonstrates not only the capacity for independent filmmakers to reach global markets in the digital age, but by subverting dominant narratives about Africa it also suggests that, under certain conditions, creating counter-hegemonic narratives can be economically successful. Using Bourdieu’s theory of practice as an analytical framework, we examine how the creators of the show use various forms of capital to produce a commodity that can circulate within the global marketplace. At the same time, we also examine how the transnational nature of the show also determines the degree to which its creators can disrupt western discourses about Africa. </jats:p>",

Together, they analyze how revivals rely on past TV experiences to circulate new products through the crowded contemporary media landscape, and how they seek to negotiate the televisual heritage of original series, feelings of generational belonging, as well as notions of the past, present, and future in meaningful ways. This introduction to the special issue provides the definitions, broader historical context, and theoretical framework of televisual repetition and innovation for understanding contemporary TV series revivals. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the ways in which executive authority and media organizations categorize the spectacle of public violence and disaster, with particular reference to an event (the Germanwings crash in 2015) where large-scale fatalities were purposely caused. On occasions when a perpetrator commits multiple killings (acting impersonally but with “malice aforethought,” and usually against civilian victims), the immediate question appears to be whether or not the incident should be classified as a terrorist attack. This is especially the case during periods when mass or individual assaults are prominent in the public domain. The article examines the problems inherent in the uses of unstable or contested linguistic definitions, which typify the family of terms that include both the act of terrorizing individuals, groups, and wider polities, and the supposedly political practice known as terrorism. </jats:p>",

The authors continue the debate on the complex relationship between media, event, and terror by introducing hybridity as yet another angle to this topical discussion. </jats:p>",

This article contributes to scholarship on basic cable economics and scripted programming by providing insight into how the institutional prioritization of millennials is shaping commissioning and marketing strategies in the sector. Using the USA Network drama series Mr. Robot (2015–present) as a case study, it demonstrates how widespread assumptions within media culture concerning millennial viewers’ personalities, preferences, and behaviors are influencing approaches to basic cable series narrative and promotion, and—accordingly—informing channel brand identities. It argues that these assumptions are influencing channels to (1) develop brands around programming that can be perceived to have social value, (2) amplify stereotypes of millennials as “digital natives” and “snowflakes,” and (3) circulate marketing material that presumes millennials’ familiarity with online technology and deemphasizes the promotional purpose of such content. </jats:p>",

Our analysis reveals the company’s strategic use of legacy media industry power, networks, and expertise to transform YouTube stars into global brands through the creation of toy, clothing, and lifestyle product lines across several industries. We further argue that Pocket Watch’s newly formed advertising division, Clock Work, exploits its child partners through problematic native advertising and host selling practices. The strategies implemented by Pocket Watch and other similar emerging companies may therefore act as a litmus test for how governmental regulation and platform policy changes will impact the evolving landscape of children’s digital media as commercial forces increasingly groom a growing number of young children to shift from YouTube stars to global brands. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this day and age, it is increasingly important to ask how the cultural industries adapt to the evolution of communication technology. Recent technological changes influencing our understanding of media communication processes are discussed in various fields, with western traditions often predominating. However, the particular impact on industry dynamics is hardly universal. Specifically, the way such changes influence the dynamics of small, distinct peripheral markets remains largely underexamined. To this end, this manuscript focuses on such questions as they relate to the specificities of Central and Eastern Europe and the Czech Republic, a particularly small industry with distinct cultural proclivities. In ascertaining how media representatives/workers comprehend and engage their audiences, this paper presents a fuller understanding of the microsocial processes by which Czech media audiences are framed and conceptualized within Czech media industries and offers insights into the rationales directing the Czech media industry itself, particularly in relation to mediating the dialectic of local dynamics, international competition, and the evolution of digitalization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the recent phenomenon of telecommunications companies distributing screen content over-the-top (OTT). It begins by localizing this international trend through an Australian case study and exploring how this process manifests in a relatively competitive telecommunications market. The article reveals that telecommunications companies going OTT contributes to increasing concentration among Australian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and also raises a series of consumer issues. I go on to argue that the ownership or provision of telecommunications infrastructure must be separated from content distribution and that net neutrality needs to be embedded as a central media policy concern, even in markets with a relatively strong level of competition. However, the article also notes that such policies do not address the long-term profitability of telecommunications companies that are not already vertically integrated, a problem that future research needs to address. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers how established methodologies for researching television distribution can be adapted for subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services. Specifically, I identify a number of critical questions—some old, some new—that can be investigated by looking closely at SVOD catalogs in different countries. Using Netflix as an example, and drawing parallels with earlier studies of broadcast and cinema schedules, I ask what Netflix’s international catalogs can tell us about content diversity within streaming services, and how this can be connected to longer traditions of debate about the direction and intensity of global media flows. Finally, I describe what a research agenda around Netflix catalogs might look like, and assess the utility of various kinds of data within such a project (as well as some methodological pitfalls). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Concentrating on the series “Girls” (2012–2017), “Fleabag” (2016), and “Insecure” (2016–), this article examines the female-centered dramedy as a current genre of U.S.-American television culture with specific investments in gendered value hierarchies. The article explores the format’s dominant narrative and aesthetic practices with specific focus on prestige dramedy’s “cringe” aesthetics. Cringe is increasingly mobilized as a mode of political expression following the format’s privileging of female subjectivities. As such, cringe is tasked with negotiating the tensions between drama and comedy on one hand and intersectional relations of identity politics on the other. Character “complexity,” embedded in ideological themes around identity, modifies the “comedy” in cringe and becomes associated with the more prestigious dramatic mode, this way governing the texts’ appeal to cultural value. The article demonstrates the ways the female-centered cringe dramedy expresses its politicization and “complexity” via disturbing gendered expectations of mediated femininity, and specifically body and sexuality politics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the tenth year after Danish daily Jyllands-Posten published twelve cartoons, the Muhammad Cartoons, this media event—and the hegemonic understanding behind it—continues to be a discursive reference point for new controversies around national borders and racial boundaries. Then, since late 2010, radicalization as a “pre-terrorist” phase has become the lens through which the category “Muslims” has been represented in much media coverage. In this article, I argue that the dominant hegemonic understanding in Denmark that is based on a certain spatial–racial logic is not a passive production of knowledge. It keeps informing news coverage of media events as terror and thereby risking describing the hegemony more than adequately understanding the events at hand. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Focusing on the United Kingdom, this article addresses key issues facing the international distribution industry arising from over-the-top (OTT) digital distribution and the fragmentation of audiences and revenues. Building on the identification of these issues, it investigates the extent to which U.K. distribution has altered over a ten-year period, pinpointing continuities in the destination and type of sales alongside changes in the role and structure of the industry as U.K.-based distributors adapt to a changing U.K. broadcasting landscape and global production environment. At one level, increasing U.S. ownership of U.K.-based distributors and the arrival of OTT players such as Netflix highlight the tensions between the national orientations of U.K. broadcasters and the global aspirations of independent producers and distributors. At another level, video-on-demand (VOD) has boosted international sales of U.K. drama. Although the full impact of subscription VOD (SVOD) on content and rights has yet to materialize, significant changes in the industry predate the arrival of SVOD. </jats:p>",

Despite its contradictory and uneven agenda, OITNB should be seen as an important ally in the process of raising awareness about media (mis)representations of female prisoners, not least because of the program’s own self-reflexive commentary on tropes of the women in prison genre. The article calls for a tactical alliance between academic examinations of female imprisonment and critical sensibilities in popular culture to further more fundamental critiques of women’s incarceration, and its concomitant cost to individuals, families, and society. </jats:p>",

By accepting the myth of televisual ubiquity, we are making assertions about the television experience of some viewers over others, as well as creating a distinction of which television can be seen to have lasting importance.

Of particular note is the way in which documentaries are seeing social issues as a means of getting to the personal and emotive. This new focus has also entailed a fascination with the psychological. Big Brother stimulated a number of debates concerning the rights and responsibilities of television producers to the subjects.

It uses aggregate data from eight entertainment trade journals to show that docudrama emerged in broadcasting and film in the 1930s and has played a significant role in US media culture ever since. It analyzes trade journal commentary and radio broadcasting practices to demonstrate that the two key components of docudrama—dramatization and a discourse of factuality—developed in the network radio era. The key radio innovation was dramatization, which required producers to re-create actual events, conform to generic expectations, and promote a particular ideological perspective on social events. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The telecommunications firms have continually attempted to introduce a new intelligent television system for the past thirty-plus years by making the best use of ever-developing information and communication technologies, changes in media consumption patterns, collapse of regulatory barriers, and so on. Internet protocol TV (IPTV) is the most recent version of such corporate attempts. This article contextualizes IPTV in terms of its history, identity, and challenges. Despite the rhetoric of newness, IPTV is a replica of the interactive TV of the past, which has a turbulent genealogy of its own. Even with the interactive services based upon advanced IP technology, it is not structurally different from conventional television as the medium is organized following the TV model. In addition to competition, a contradiction between the open internet and walled-garden IPTV will pose critical challenges to the medium. However, IPTV is still evolving, and its future is not yet fully determined. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> At first, House, M. D. appears to be a medical procedural show, as it follows a physician and his team around as they diagnose mysteriously ill patients. However, rather than following procedure, House shows the protagonist Dr. Gregory House avoiding work and subverting the hospital’s policies, procedures, and authority. Dr. House’s success comes from his wit, intellect, and problem-solving abilities, all of which allow him to work outside of both standard medical practices and the hierarchy of his hospital. This article argues that House, rather than being the procedural it appears to be, is in actuality a superhero program. Dr. House’s intelligence is his superpower (much as is the case with comic superheroes), and it allows him to ignore traditional authority in favor of his own method. Consequently, House calls into question the very status and existence of both authority figures and mechanisms of control in the postmodern landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Globalization has intensified interconnectivity among television industries worldwide. Interconnectivity happens through structural and institutional linkages among television systems and industries worldwide, resulting in an increasingly integrated global business governed by similar practices and goals. The dynamics are reflected in the popularity of television formats. On the surface, global dissemination of formats may suggest not only the global integration of the economy of the industry but also the standardization of content. A dozen media companies are able to do business worldwide by selling the same idea, and audiences seem to be watching national variations of the same show. At a deeper level, however, formats attest to the fact that television still remains tied to local and national cultures. Bringing up examples of Latin American cases, this article argues that television is simultaneously global and national, shaped by the globalization of media economics and the pull of local and national cultures. </jats:p>",

Rather than focusing on the well-known military provenance of AMM, this article shifts attention to how the work expresses politically specific ideas about the importance of the individual in human–computer interaction and how ArcMac formulated these ideas in response to the discourses of urban crisis and techno-paranoia circulating during the 1970s. The city in crisis provided a convenient metaphor for the staging of ideas about how human–computer interaction could dramatically extend the power of individuals to create and govern their own worlds without the assistance of any intervening social institution or government body. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues the possibility of building not just a queer gaming experience but rather a queer game mechanic—that is, a game whose very structure of play can be theorized as queer. It presents the prototype game Go Queer, a locative media history app, as a theoretical experiment in what it might mean to play queer. Queer theorists and historiographers have demonstrated the intimate relation between queer subjects and the city; the game literalizes this dynamic, requiring players to travel the physical spaces of the city in the hopes that they will encounter queer history—now disappeared, redeveloped, forgotten. It proposes that a productive and underrepresented setting for queer play is the space of the city itself and that the hybrid reality of locative media provides particular affordances to enable particularly queer navigations, occupations, and constructions of queer urban space. </jats:p>",

Their attempts to build multimedia empires, and, in particular, their lawsuits against Republic Studios in order to prevent their older feature films from appearing on television, were seminal in the history of the relationship between film and television. A closer look at their lawsuits helps illuminate that important period in media history and even overturns some long-held beliefs about that time. It shows how all periods of disruption are influenced by many persons with a wide range of diverse interests, and how amidst that tangled web of agendas, two actors from B-westerns could hold the film and television industries in suspense for years. </jats:p>",

The article discusses how ideas of interspecies intimacy are publicly performed in an interactive process between the dairy industry producers and social media users. Two examples from the Swedish dairy industry were chosen for analysis: one Instagram account and one Facebook account. The analysis shows how the pages are premised on spectacularly visualizing the emotional labor and performances of cows for capital accumulation. The dairy industry’s social media presence encourages the media users to engage in building the perception that Swedish dairy farms represent an idyll where the cows are willing producers of the milk that is taken from them, and the dairy industry is loving, caring, and compassionate. Thus, the social media marketing represents a co-opting not only of the ideals of participation that social media holds but also of the ideals of ethical consumptions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Audience reception research was a child of the broadcasting age, emerging strongly as a subdiscipline in media and communication research in the 1980s. Many saw reception research as a cross-fertilizing force theoretically and methodologically, bringing together research traditions from the humanities and the social sciences, and adding a qualitative orientation to the near-hegemonic rule of quantitative methods in audience research. This article discusses the ways in which reception research is reinventing itself in a post-broadcasting age. With sense-making processes as the continued key concern, three transformations are affecting the trajectory of reception research: An empirical shift has occurred from analyzing viewers’ “decoding” encounters with media “texts” to mapping audience participation in the wider mediascapes of traditional, digital, and social media; a theoretical adoption of, and contributions to, theories of participation and mediatization; and a methodological shift from purely qualitative to a mixed-method research design. </jats:p>",

It explores previously unpublished questionnaire data from a 2011 survey of over 1,000 UK film and TV workers, which suggests that such prerequisites to mobilization are still present in the TV workforce. Finally it examines recent and ongoing mobilization by video game workers as a modern comparison, updating the relevance of Kelly’s theory to explore and consider potential models for a new politics of resistance in the digital age. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Labor of Creativity in Images of Networking Children",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Children’s programming today reveals an alarming trend in the number of storylines involving ’tween and teenage entrepreneurs. From Disney’s songwriting duo Austin and Ally to True Jackson VP’s teen executives, these programs reflect the idealization of creative labor and naturalize the exploitation of the commons that drives biopolitical power in an increasingly immaterial global economy. These shows hyper-realize the contemporary emphasis on futurity by almost entirely doing away with childhood as child newsmakers, fashion designers, web programmers, and professional celebrities struggle each week to balance the stresses of adolescence within the framework of demanding careers. This paper will show the ways a variety of programs airing on Disney and Nickelodeon channels exemplify the conversion of social life to productive time that characterizes the late capitalist ethos and the consequent ramifications for political life, with particular attention paid to the impact of immaterial circuits of production to young women’s developing subjectivities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, audiences in the United States and around the globe have witnessed an explosion of television and streaming content focused on hip hop. Such content contemplates, historicizes, promotes, and represents the art form, artists, industry, and regional genres that have together emerged as a central feature of contemporary popular culture. This article explores the spatial and thematic links to the theoretical Global South in Atlanta and Sintonia. Analyzing the series’ respective portrayals of race and inequality from the margins, I examine how hip-hop/ funk and the Global South function as narrative tools and symbolic spaces through which notions of a shared precarity stemming from global flows of capital are constructed, consumed, and challenged. By considering the series’ connections to the Global South, this article contributes to a growing body of work that aims to move beyond research that centers the west and the nation-state. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From Digital Hype to Islands of Isolation",
    "abstract": "This article focuses on the importance of the shift in use from analogue, to digital, transmission systems for radio and television signals. Put simply, analogue communications use energy waves, which can carry information signals (telephone, radio and television, satellite wireless and television, etc.). Such waves come in a number of forms, including those used for communicating on the long, medium, and short “wave” bands, very high frequency waves as used in the FM band, and the extremely high frequency waves used in analogue satellite transmissions. Many European readers will be familiar with the properties of these bands, such as the ability— when unwanted this will be described as interference—to receive stations from other European states on the medium and long wave band. Readers will also generally be aware that very high frequency broadcasts (VHF/ FM) can only be received in an area that is directly in sight of the transmitting towers, and that this results in much cursing when, on long-distance car journeys, signals are lost from one area and the wireless needs to be retuned. Television transmissions are similarly limited in their reception, one consequence of which is that transfrontier reception of television signals has, historically, been very limited. Short wave is not generally used for intra-Europe wireless communications except by government services intent on reaching “foreign” audiences. However, many readers will be aware of its use in long-distance communications between continents (say Australia and Europe).",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on Jean Baudrillard’s theorizing of the theme park, this study recognizes the TV show Westworld (2016-2022) as a simulation of contemporary America with intriguing questions about rape culture and justice in a post-#MeToo moment? In seasons 1 and 2, android characters like Dolores (Evan Rachael Wood), Maeve (Thandiwe Newton), and Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon) are violated but rebel against sexist and racist programing, and the “Man in Black” represents the violating nature of the stereotypical, Western hero. The principles of the Old West, like benevolent violence, are reflected in a TV industry where the actors of Westworld document their own violation in #MeToo artifacts, such Wood’s documenting of abuse in Phoenix Rising (2022), and interviews with Newton. In thinking about justice, Westworld falters, because it frames redress only in terms of further violence and revenge. Wood and Newton, however, represent the prevention of future violence, offering a possibility of justice. </jats:p>",

Past mediation, familiarity with children’s media, parental instructions and joint leisure activities were positively associated with mediation of both interactive and non-interactive media use, whereas country of residence was not significantly associated with mediation.

Rising to prominence via tabloid scandal and reality TV, French experienced a sharply pitched fame trajectory that culminated in her death that same year, which was attributed to a drug overdose and created a national media and political furor over cocaine use. Building on the work of scholars working within British or American contexts, I scrutinize French as a tabloid and reality star in Ireland. Both lauded and castigated as an icon of the so-called “Celtic Tiger,” French, I argue, acted as nexus point for hot-button social issues related to sexuality, femininity, consumerism, multiculturalism, and national values. My examination highlights the workings of postfeminism in a neoliberal Ireland and reveals the persistence of conservative patriarchal ideologies distinctly at odds with the national self-image during a boom period of unprecedented economic growth. </jats:p>",

It shows how Adult Swim texts and paratexts, news stories about the network, and industry trade journals discursively construct the Adult Swim audience as an embodiment of dominant cultural identities (i.e., young, white, heterosexual masculinity), while simultaneously framing this community within discourses of subcultural taste and oppositional distinction. In doing so, the network alternately profits from and disavows white-male privilege by promoting this structurally dominant and highly valued group as a cultist, counterhegemonic fan base. This articulation of young, white, heterosexual masculinity to subcultural politics of taste and community both reflects and feeds the continued valuation of the young-white-male demographic in a nominally fragmented American media environment. </jats:p>",

The one-hour evening soap opera facilitated these companies' domination of prime-time network access and foreign syndication sales by allowing them to use access to a nationwide audience to engage economies of scale in television production. </jats:p>",

It joins mechanisms such as foreign program sales and transnational satellite channels in shifting television further from its domestic origins. To date, examination of television’s internationalization has focused on programs and programming. Foreign ownership may be a less obvious “cultural” form of business internationalization, but it nevertheless affects the television culture made available in many places and poses consequences for cultures of consumption. Foreign ownership also opens up new avenues of inquiry for global television scholars to question the shifting geographies of power in the field of television production. </jats:p>",

Because audience activity on social media becomes part of the media brand, it is a priority for the industry to achieve some level of control/influence on that activity. In this article, I discuss writers’ room Twitter accounts as a space used to model and reinforce fan behavior that serves industry interests, arguing that these accounts serve industry needs through the behaviors they promote and recognize. Through analysis of three writers’ room Twitter accounts—for Jane the Virgin, Faking It, and Orange Is the New Black—I show how this process works, as well as the ways in which a show’s individual industrial context shapes the type of fan that is hailed. </jats:p>",

It argues that Netflix’s shift to “classics” is not just part of the company’s general expansion strategy but must be seen in broader context of current VOD market regulations as well as Netflix localization tactics in specific national markets. Most of these films, however, are hidden from the general viewer. Therefore, this study combines analysis of personalization tactics and analysis of curation of “classic movies” to explore how Netflix, with the help of archival films, performs middle-brow cultural taste, and at the same time complicates the relationship between accessibility and discoverability of film heritage online. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The way we do television studies changes with ongoing innovation; digital media and successive phases of subscription pay TV have complicated our work for the better. Additional contextual complexity in TV delivery, and the related notion of TV as a medium in perpetual identity crisis, contribute to experiences especially vivid in terms of pandemic pressures. This essay shares our collaboration from the Summer of 2020 through January 2021. We synthesize email correspondence and our many Zoom meetings discussing pandemic-inflected topics including sitcom redistribution and sports, weaving these conversations into an “inner-personal archive” combining individual history and notes on experience with in-depth television criticism. The essay explores how we as television scholars refer to the archive, and how we relate to archives that are becoming subsumed into the digital. It uses a conversational format to deconstruct, decolonize, and demonstrate the process of narrating the archive, capturing our struggle to grasp recent changes in television viewing while overwhelmed with loss, betrayal, and pain. </jats:p>",

This article demonstrates that how-to screenwriting manuals both feed into and exemplify the new cultural economy and the position(s) of creative labor within that economy by offering the opportunity to dream up and invent one’s own career and providing blueprints for doing so. The article draws on a critical discourse analysis study of a selection of the most popular manuals and analyzes the discursive strategies the texts deploy to concretize aspects of screenwriting labor, from story structure and formatting to pitching and rewriting. The manuals are discussed as a type of psy-technology and as a sophisticated form of professional self-help, and they are also analyzed as precarious governmental tools that shape industries, practices, and subjects but in ambiguous and chaotic ways. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Launched in 2005 as a platform for user-generated content (UGC), YouTube is one of the most popular websites in the world. In this article, I focus on the site’s use of “the view,” which I argue serves as a pervasive category enacted through the platform, in its information regimes and beyond. The view supports a myth of viewer intentionality and satisfaction and serves as the operational logic of the platform as a whole. It is a category in Durkheim’s sense, ordering practices and naturalizing hierarchies and inequalities. These hierarchies concern, and impact on, participation, financial compensation, visibility, and popularity. In making my claims, I demonstrate how the celebratory discourse around YouTube as an empowering tool that levels the media playing field was positively misguided. I make a plea for a critical reading of the view, which can enhance our understanding of the platform and its culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As national borders are being transformed into technologized zones of securitization and national power, the surveillance of particular individuals and groups has become routine. Aided by a public culture of suspicion and belief in the neutrality of technology, national borders work to ferret out the digital tracks of those predetermined to be of risk or threat. Fortifying discriminatory structures of immigration control, the reworked digital frontier filters gendered bodies of risk and drafts their visual records for scrutiny. Engaging with the objections raised by Muslim American women wearing head cover to the unwarranted search of mobile phones at the border, this article addresses the entangled connections between nationalism, digital archives and transparency. The objections which center around the veil and data visibility serve as an embodied point of departure to rethink and render visible assumptions regarding national belonging in terms of the new itinerancy of data and marked bodies. </jats:p>",

New technologies are made more relevant to working-class African American and Latino students by using them to report on their immediate community as well as to their own lives and their own neighborhood. What misconceptions arise when children try to evaluate the information they find on the web? How does the web push children’s interest away from local politics and toward a global entertainment culture? Through an ethnographic classroom study, the article discusses the ways children have both generated and discarded story ideas; how their stories reflect their conflicting and overlapping age, gender, and ethnic identities; and how their use of computers has challenged this author to reexamine the project’s goals and the meaning of the internet in children’s lives. </jats:p>",

I demonstrate that the show locates violence within a series of masculine homosocial realms in order to highlight Dexter’s alienation from these spaces and, thus, his “monstrosity.” I am interested in achieving two things with this reading. First, I want to pay extended attention to Dexter’s location within the representational context of contemporary television—a context filled with police and forensic shows, murder, and hyperbolically violent (and masculine) men—in order to articulate what this program is doing differently. Second, I want to use Dexter as a means of thinking about the ways that violence and gender become linked through representational practices in ways that visibly and invisibly constitute social and gender norms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphones are increasingly becoming an all-pervasive and embedded part of everyday life. In this phenomenon, the rise of high-quality camera phones and growth in distribution services via social media has heralded new forms of visuality. With geotagging almost a default setting, these new visualities are marked by a different relationship between information, co-presence, and place. In particular, these new visualities are shaping, and shaped by, gender. One key location that has become famous for its high deployment of camera phone practices, especially self-portraiture ( sel-ca) by women, is Seoul, South Korea. However, as camera phone practices increasingly intertwine with locative media, we see a shift in the motivations, genres, and affects. In this article, I explore some preliminary studies conducted into women’s use of camera phones and how, with the overlay of locative media like geotagging, this is shifting the role of camera phone images in depicting place and intimacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses issues of user precarity and vulnerability in online social networks. As social media criticism by Jose van Dijck, Felix Stalder, and Geert Lovink describes, the social web is a predatory system that exploits users’ desires for connection. Although accurate, this critical description casts the social web as a zone where users are always already disempowered, so fails to imagine possibilities for users beyond this paradigm. This article examines Natalie Bookchin’s composite video series, Testament, as it mobilizes an alt-(ernative) social network of vernacular video on YouTube. In the first place, the alt-social network works as an iteration of “tactical media” to critically reimagine empowered user-to-user interactions on the social web. In the second place, it obfuscates YouTube’s data-mining functionality, so allows users to socialize online in a way that evades their direct translation into data and the exploitation of their social labor. </jats:p>",

After brief discussion of various media studies approaches, including media ecologies and algorighmic cultures, the article discusses the institutional rise of data sciences and compares this field to media studies. The author argues that while the foundational assumptions, methodological frameworks, and mindsets of data sciences and media studies differ, curious co-existences can morph into lively collaborations rather than turf battles, and concludes by pointing to research that explemplies a productive synthesis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Rapid developments in digital infrastructure have made all-encompassing surveillance all too possible. However, the same infrastructure has simultaneously enabled the use of new possibility spaces that react to, shape, and resist these structures of control and surveillance. The Israel/Palestine conflict is no different, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has created an electronic unit with hackers to circumvent and resist the Israeli matrix of control and its surveillance. I argue that out of this dialectical relationship in Palestine, between new possibility spaces of resistance and structures of control, new phenomena arise in the gray area between the nation state hacker and the hacktivist as PIJ emulates the features of a modern state army. To understand the nature of its electronic unit, one must take this dialectic into account by introducing the category, “proto-state hacker.” </jats:p>",

Using viewer mail in series producer David Susskind's collected papers, the article examines how mostly Northern, white viewers used the show to make sense of changes in race relations in the midst of the civil rights movement. Using internal production memos and other sources, the article also charts the difficulties encountered by the show's producers in getting a series about “urgent issues” onto the airwaves. </jats:p>",

A review of the rationale and methodology for the project frames the presentation of two case studies. One study focuses specifically on how young people as media producers learn the “languages” of video production and how they conceptualize their audience. Another study examines issues of reception, in which ideas about a shared sense of “youth experience” and young people's conceptions of their counterparts in other cultures are both playing key roles. A concluding discussion reviews the multiple and interrelated findings of the entire study and the implications they hold for cross-cultural communication, youth media production, audience interpretation, and media education. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores South Korean “thrift” television by examining Homo Economicus (EBS), a reality TV show that challenged participants to save ten thousand dollars in six months with guidance from financial advisors. Situating thrift television within the broader sociohistorical context of the long recession after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, I show how Homo Economicus suggested frugality as a way of life in a time of precarity and economic polarization by providing techniques of compulsory thrift and turning participants into aspirational savers. Gendered narratives of consumption played a pivotal role in the process and the program took millennial women as its main target of intervention. Gendered thrift television exemplifies the ways media culture problematizes women’s consumption while failing to address structural gender inequality. I also discuss the close relation between thrift television and online financial communities that served as a crucial space where thrift television found its financial experts. </jats:p>",

Approaching these media ventures as productive failures, we examine how industry workers narrate these failures to trace how the contemporary television industry in the United States imagines racial and ethnic identities. Bringing together interviews with media industry professionals, observations at a media industry convention, and thematic analyses of trade press and news coverage, we argue that both media ventures are symptomatic of nationalist logics that inform the operations of television industry professionals even as they seek to target audiences increasingly embedded in transnational media circuits. Industry professionals’ misreading of South Asian Americans’ position in the racial economies of the United States and changes in patterns of media circulation reveal the challenges confronting the media industry when it comes to issues of race and ethnicity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the climaxes in Han Ju, “the Korean Wave” in Mandarin, is women's confession of love for men. However, such emotional outbursts invariably are contained by rather than destabilizing the patriarchal tradition. In Asia, while Korean women's daring confession captivates the audience, who are burdened by the heritage of feminine passivity, it may signify less a feminist breakthrough than an underhanded boost to the male ego that withholds its affection until the “weaker” sex confides first. The best metaphor for the paradox of Han Ju's female repression and confession lies in the leading actresses' often full, sensuous lips painted and even overpainted beyond lips proper to intimate a rebelliousness or transgressiveness, even as lipstick connotes femininity. The tiny fraction of bright, striking color taints beyond the lower and the upper lips; this border crossing verges on the indecent. This motif in Korean dramas lies at the core of its appeal to the Asian female audience as well as to the volatile Asian communities juggling tradition and modernization. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Getting NIL for Unpaid Labor: Self-Branding U.S. “Student-Athletes” in the Influencer Marketplace",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> For decades, the NCAA and its member schools profited richly from sports while denying student-athletes “employee” status and a direct compensation share in generating that value. Since 2019, state-level reforms pertaining to student-athletes’ use of their own name, image, and likeness, alongside a landmark Supreme Court decision, radically transformed the collegiate commercial landscape and burgeoned influencer-style, social media endorsement opportunities. Examining nearly 400 news articles published during that time, this qualitative textual analysis tracks and critiques the media coverage and stakeholder discourse around this issue as key policy events (both legislative and judicial) unfolded and shaped these prospects. The essay argues that NIL has been championed as market liberation for those willing to self-brand and hustle gig-economy leads—in keeping with ideals of neoliberalism and especially for already-marginalized female student-athletes—but that any such celebration remains premature when unpaid labor on the field of play persisted exploitatively. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the whiteness in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The author argues that the show’s overwhelming whiteness is a product of a generalized white anxiety about the numerical loss of white dominance across the United States and, in particular, in California. The article goes on to think through the role that Jewishness plays in the program, discussing the relationship between the apparently Anglo-American Buffy, played by a Jewish actor, and her sidekick, Willow, who is characterized as Jewish but is played by a non-Jewish actor. The evil master in the first series is given Nazi characteristics and the destruction that he wants to inflict carries connotations of the Holocaust. Structurally, Buffy is produced as the Jew who saves the United States from this demonic destruction. In this traumatic renarrativising, the Holocaust comes to stand for the white-experienced crisis of the loss of white supremacy in the United States. With this reading we can begin to understand the show’s popularity among early adult, predominantly white Americans. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Scholars have criticized how tarento (television personalities) who might be considered “transgender” have for decades provided comic relief on Japanese mainstream television, but few have considered the recent emergence of a different kind of trans celebrity who rejects the entertainment narrative to embrace the “wrong body” discourse (having mismatched corporeality). This article explores this phenomenon through the example of Nishihara Satsuki, a trans-identified internet celebrity-turned- tarento, drawing mainly on discourse analysis of their blog, memoir, and variety program appearances. I demonstrate how Satsuki’s celebrity departs from narratives of trans tarento as objects of entertainment to align with hegemonic discourses of the wrong body, which govern how trans individuals are understood in Japan and reflect the broader context of heightened trans visibility elsewhere. In doing so, Satsuki offers an important platform for discussing trans issues and experiences today, which I argue has encouraged the media to take trans representation more seriously. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines a new form of resistance to right-wing populist discourse on social media which I define as counter-populist algorithmic activism. Practitioners of this type of activism exploit platforms’ automated ranking mechanisms and interface design to bolster the online visibility of counter-populist voices. By so doing, activists seek to stymie the digitally mediated spread of right-wing populist rhetoric and advance an alternative, non-exclusionary vision of “the people.” To explore this nascent form of resistance, this study draws on a year-long online ethnography of a Facebook group of Israeli activists called Strengthening the Left Online. Through an observation of the group’s activities during 2017, as well as interviews with its main administrator and other left-wing Facebook users, I elucidate the distinctive nature of the motivations, strategies, and goals that guide counter-populist algorithmic activists. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Amid a global cultural landscape defined both by the ambiguities of deterritorialization and the persistent impact of established geopolitical hierarchies, the idea of cultural reflux offers a potent tool to conceptualize and lend context to the study of nascent peripheral and semiperipheral media industries. Dialoguing with Thussu and Iwabuchi’s work on media flow as well as Curtin’s concept of media capitals, this article proposes to analyze “mockbusters”: derivative copies of established metropolitan media properties. I specifically look at the output of the Brazilian studio Video Brinquedo, infamous in the 2000s for its blatant, low-quality copies of established children’s media properties. In examining the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) mockbuster as a case study of opportunistic media counterflow, the idea of cultural reflux complicates debates over where we should situate our analytical objectives with respect to mediatic peripherality, and how we can more concretely examine the relationship of media flow to transnational imperial frameworks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper offers a case study of the cross-cultural consumption of Friends (1994-2004, USA) in South China. It focused on media poachers, or people who use the sitcom in unauthorised or nonlegal ways, and strove for an interdisciplinary and internationalist understanding of global Hollywood. It deployed the qualitative method of in-depth and focus group interviews, both face-to-face and online, and critically surveyed media reception theories, from the effects tradition to the active reader paradigm. Scott Olsen’s theory of narrative transparency (1999) grounded the study’s theoretical premise; central to which is Olsen’s notion of ‘mythotypes’— that which render foreign media texts transparent for indigenous decoding and recoding and which in correspondingly throwing affective hooks at foreign audiences, kept them engaged. The case study revealed that the affective impact was neither uniform nor even: varying degrees of transparency and opacity indeed existed. This finding challenged Olsen’s assertion that affects were universal and therefore escaped culturally coded constraints. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of “prosumers” and “produsers” suggests that production and reception are more conflated now than ever before. But is their mediation through the performance of hybrid roles new? And were the two ever separate? This article criticizes social theories of the media and “production studies” for overstating the distinction between producers and audiences and the instrumental means whereby the former engage the latter. It rejects this postulate of a “structured break” between production and reception by discussing the producers’ tacit knowledge of the audience, their reflexivity and socialization, and their use of “audience images.” The article then draws on Goffman (1959) and Meyrowitz (1985) to propose a new model for understanding production: as a social situation sustained by participants but explicitly oriented to an absent third party: the audience. It concludes by discussing the implications of the model for the study of production and producers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article traces connections between the institutional configuration of the AMC basic cable channel and the deliberately paced narratives of its original series, such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and Rubicon. Scholarly and popular discourses concerning U.S. drama series frequently observe the divergent ways in which the economic models of network and premium cable each influence series production, emphasizing the fundamental distinctions between the two institutional types. Yet such discourses, by relying on this paradigm of institutional binary, often overlook the role of basic cable’s economic model in the commissioning of drama series. This article explores the unique implications of this model along with the specificity of AMC’s particular institutional configuration. Utilizing a combination of narrative and industrial analysis, the article determines the economic logics that enable AMC to situate its series’ slow-burn storytelling within an advertiser-supported context. </jats:p>",

Managing price and availability is important to advertisers for securing prices and premium inventory and to publishers for safeguarding long-term revenue. The article compares US network television’s annual upfront events with adtech company the New York Interactive Advertising Exchange (NYIAX). This article contributes two primary observations. First, that buying and selling forward advertising inventory is an important, and understudied, part of advertising markets. Second, the design of infrastructures that enable adverting futures markets are social and contested. The formation and framing of forward media markets has consequences for the advertising industry at a time of critical juncture and for broader media that rely on advertising revenue. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the renewed popularity of teen television, SVOD services such as Netflix are increasingly investing in the production and distribution of teen series. Netflix is one of the first SVOD service to have adapted the genre outside of the western world. This transnationalisation of teen television is, we argue, infused with the streamer increasing emphasis on diversity. Based on a qualitative analysis of Netflix’s teen series trailers, this contribution explores how the streamer (a) challenges existing televisual conventions and (b) establishes its cultural authority through distinct negotiations of the global and the local. We highlight four dimensions of Netflix’s transnationalisation of teen television and conclude that, more than mere diversification of its catalog, Netflix managed to encapsulate different dimensions of diversity within the teen genre as part, on the one hand of its transnational strategy of expansion, and, on the other hand, its cultural politics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that the BBC’s Sherlock is outwardly a conservative text sedimenting the historical function of Sherlock Holmes as a model of hegemonic British masculinity. However, queer disruptions in the performance of masculinity may be read as, after Butler, destabilizing and revealing the groundlessness of gender constructions. For as Butler has argued, hetero-masculine performativity is “constantly haunted by that domain of sexual possibility that must be excluded for heterosexualized gender to produce itself.” Referencing Laclau’s perception of “hauntologies” to texts (adapted from Derrida), I posit that the presence/specter of the queer villain Moriarty can be read as a caesura challenging performed hegemonic masculinity. With the possible death and promise of Moriarty’s return at the close of the current season, the series now stands at a crossroads. It may either revert to the queerbaiting of previous seasons or foreshadow a more radical text. </jats:p>",

Using Goffman’s work on stigma as a framework, we examine representations of elderly women on OITNB, while also considering “binge-watching” (the process of consuming mass amounts of television) as a method of analysis. Binge-watching, or “marathon viewing,” a temporal phenomenon laden with feelings of guilt and shame, works to highlight the stigma of temporality aging women on OITNB face. Thus, we offer “marathon viewing” as an alternative, stigma-free method of critical feminist media analysis. This article suggests marathon viewing is a product of media convergence, reliant on today’s streaming services and a highly productive method of media critique. </jats:p>",

We argue that even though popular culture is often assumed to reiterate and consolidate the discourse of heteronormativity, adult animated sitcoms create space for queer resistance. Since the genre draws on postmodern strategies of representation, we argue that queer resistance is subversively articulated through instances of pastiche and parody. It is embedded in content that is both complicit with and critical of the heteronormal. Through a textual thematic analysis of Family Guy, this case study illustrates how postmodern textual strategies create deconstructionist instances that expose and subvert the hegemony of heteronormativity.</jats:p>",

However, at the same time, the series has been recognized and critiqued as offering white, conservative feminism. This article explores how Hulu’s adaptation often works to domesticate Margaret Atwood’s novel and the series’ feminist implications in regard to reproduction and motherhood. While The Handmaid’s Tale has become spectacularly visible as a popular feminist television series, its reproductive politics and representations of women, family and motherhood are largely conservative: waging a limited resistance on behalf of neotraditional white Anglo-western mothers. In light of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, this article is motivated by the conviction that it is increasingly important to hold sociocultural representations of reproduction and motherhood to account. </jats:p>",

Analyzing Dalit mobilization online, this article argues that technological affordances and distinct cultural practices associated with digital media have enabled certain sections of Dalits to resist the dominant caste narrative, thereby contributing to mobilization against caste-based discrimination. However, multiple “counter-narratives” within the subaltern digital sphere and hybrid media systems have placed limitations on unified action, signaling the need to address mediated factional positions and caste Hindu narratives online in efforts to strengthen the Dalit social movement. This article forwards the argument by examining the expansion of web forums organized by Dalits, with a closer focus on a nationwide online agitation that drew reference to the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article introduces the tenets of a theory of datafication of and in the Souths. It calls for a de-Westernization of critical data studies, in view of promoting a reparation to the cognitive injustice that fails to recognize non-mainstream ways of knowing the world through data. It situates the “Big Data from the South” research agenda as an epistemological, ontological, and ethical program and outlines five conceptual operations to shape this agenda. First, it suggests moving past the “universalism” associated with our interpretations of datafication. Second, it advocates understanding the South as a composite and plural entity, beyond the geographical connotation (i.e., “global South”). Third, it postulates a critical engagement with the decolonial approach. Fourth, it argues for the need to bring agency to the core of our analyses. Finally, it suggests embracing the imaginaries of datafication emerging from the Souths, foregrounding empowering ways of thinking data from the margins. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses the first series of both the original British and American remake of the sitcom The Office. We discuss how television format adaptations work through articulations of national identity, and suggest that the success of an adaptation may be linked to its ability to reflect and interpret its new context. Despite the global success of the sitcom genre there are clear differences in the situations, characters and humor used by British and American sitcoms which must be addressed by an adaptation. The way in which The Office has adapted to the institutional context, culture and humor of the United States, after its success as a British sitcom, illustrates that national identity is a vital part of the global television format trade. While it may appear that the growth of format adaptations reflects the increasingly globalized contemporary world, in fact, format adaptations encourage articulations of national identity and cultural belonging. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The history of sports culture and fandom has long been as reactionary as it has been hospitable to progressive politics. As the most conspicuous recent example, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s U.S. anthem protest generated intense controversy with many critics claiming that sports and politics should, generally, not mix—a condemnation that ignores that context’s already pervasive militaristic nationalism. This article offers the first nationally representative examination of fans’ antipathy toward sports’ politicization through a critical textual analysis and inductive classification of their responses to the issue. Ostensibly “aracial” rebukes to that activism could nonetheless be characterized in lineage with historically stereotypical representations of and affronts to black athletes: as threatening to society, not intellectually equipped to engage, and illegitimate as leaders. </jats:p>",

Mystery (2018) and how it can be interpreted in Chinese gender discourse because it is the unique boys’ love fanfiction being adapted for an online drama in mainland China. We use the term bromance-as-masquerade to denote a representational strategy of depicting male–male romance under the guise of homosocial bromance. Bromance-as-masquerade facilitates the promotion of male intimacy cultivated by the leading actors themselves and the production team in the marketing process. Their actions demonstrate a proactive engagement in the counterpublic discourse; however, this article argues that the self-censored modification of the plot-setting represents a refusal and exclusion of boys’ love subculture, which places the notion of the counterpublic in question. </jats:p>",

This article draws on forty-five student essays describing the sensations evoked by technological failure and explores them as vignettes into the affective dynamics evoked by constant connectivity to, and dependency on, network media. By asking how the essays articulate and configure the notion of “the user,” the article suggests that devices and applications are the loci of potentiality that may or may not be available and which impact—increase, sustain, or diminish—the users’ capacity to act. Furthermore, it argues that visceral responses to technological failure are intimately tied to the uncertainty and instability of users’ sense of control in ways that call into question the very notion of “the user” itself. </jats:p>",

Through discourse and textual analysis of news coverage, popular media, and first-person testimonials, this article argues that del Castillo’s persona of a rogue entrepreneur on-screen and off-screen shaped her success and made her a target for state and media organizations. Del Castillo’s narrative struggles across media and languages countered longstanding conceptions of women’s roles in narcotrafficking and in narco-cultural productions. The article illuminates the continued appeal that the cultural grammar of narcotrafficking holds as a way to articulate power in North America. </jats:p>",

To account for the reconfigured roles of media and audiences, I propose a renewed emphasis on the diverse flows of communication on digital platforms, specifically the metacommunication that yields metadata. Metacommunication is key to reinterpreting what audiences do with digital media and what digital media, in turn, do to audiences. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, they look closely at the format, genre, and televisual character of this representation, its timing, and its ability to generate audiences and other media coverage. Specifically, the authors are interested in the ongoing fascination with Michael Jackson as an expression of unresolved social tensions in the U.S. imaginary, especially with regard to notions of indeterminate or unfixable racial and sexual bodies. </jats:p>",

The couple made cinematic headlines in 2016 with the release of Suicide Squad. In this case study of the “mad love” canon/fanon ship (as embodied in recent works of fanfiction, shipper manifestos posted and shared through social media, and Tumblr discourse), I examine the progressive rhetoric and feminist elevation of Harley Quinn as a shield for the underlying toxicity of the Joker. Fandom’s discourse of “problematic faves” is important as it provides space for fans to love a text even while admitting its representational problems; however, in the case of Harley and the Joker, this discourse risks becoming an excuse for not subverting the toxic tropes of the idolized, abusive, yet still lovable, villain and his obsessive fangirl following. </jats:p>",

Beginning with an analysis of the daily log interface, the author situates the humorous icons in discourses of menstrual jokes and euphemisms to show how these apps participate in the suppression of menstruation. The author then turns to the analytics features to demonstrate how these apps encourage users to understand their lives through their menstrual cycle. The article ends with a call for collaborations between humanists, scientists, and designers to revise and mobilize these apps to explore under-explored issues of sexual and reproductive health. </jats:p>",

I focus on two aspects that prompt broader considerations about the role of scripted television in responding to pressing social issues. First, I demonstrate how the episode’s narrative structure appeals to democratic deliberation as an idealized form of conflict resolution. Second, I consider how its production and airing timeline responded to—and failed to account for—the current events its narrative attempted to incorporate. Although the disjuncture between these two elements demonstrate the pitfalls for fictional television to address social issues in a time of constant crisis, I conclude by proposing that these “failures” can also serve to illustrate a specific “post-pandemic” structure-of-feeling, one where futures are perpetually deferred and where dealing with new social realities requires constant speculative iterations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although Australian media consumption follows general Western trends toward increasingly media rich households, there seems to be a distinctly regional response to how media technologies are incorporated into the Australian home. Although a majority of Australian families with children have a second (and many a third) television set, few choose to locate these technologies in children's bedrooms. Thus, Australia's high level of screen entertainment media is not associated with a high level of children's bedroom access, as would generally be expected. When family conflict does arise regarding television viewing, it is just as likely to be about “where to watch” as “what to watch.” Through the use of an audience ethnography approach, this article explores how Australian parents and their children make sense of their television viewing in the home environment, highlighting how new and multiple media technologies are integrated into the spatial geography of the antipodean family home. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Brazil is both a leading television producer in the Global South and home to TV Globo, one of the largest and most commercially successful networks in the world. Indeed, for nearly fifty years of its sixty-five year history, TV Globo and its standardized production of extremely popular telenovelas have largely come to characterize Brazilian television fiction as a whole. In this article, I situate the meteoric rise of the independent production company and YouTube sensation, Porta dos Fundos, within the broader context of TV Globo’s declining audience share and the wide-ranging effects of the Pay Television Law (2011). In doing so, I argue that Porta dos Fundos’s audiovisual production for the Internet and prime-time television serves as an illustrative case for understanding the interrelated ways in which recent policy, new distribution platforms, emerging independent production companies, and an influx of locally produced content are helping to shape the changing landscape of Brazilian television fiction as it transitions out of a six-decade-long network era. </jats:p>",

The questions are, In what ways is public service broadcasting (PSB) changing in the contemporary audiovisual environment? How is the contradiction between commercial needs and the public service mission being articulated? Which paradigms are shaping the practices surrounding PSB institutions? To answer these questions, the authors analyzed the trends toward digitalization and funding in selected broadcasters: the British Broadcasting Corporation, Radiotelevisione Italiana, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After discussing claims that PSB organizations have been enjoying a period of relative stability, the authors conclude that the broadcasters' resilience is mainly due to their readiness to embrace competition and commercialism; as a result, public broadcasters are losing their distinctiveness and purpose. The sidebar details the exemplary conditions of the Italian public service broadcaster. </jats:p>",

However, the political economy of satellite television in postliberalization India has ensured the construction of a music television audience that is neither antinational nor antielder. On the basis of a reception study of music television in India, this article argues that audiences construct a sense of generational, national, and global identity in a manner that calls for a deeper understanding of cultural imperialism and audience reception. The findings of this study suggest that although the emerging youth culture in India does not seem confrontational in generational or national terms, it is not so much a case of audience resistance as that of co-optation by global hegemonic forces. </jats:p>",

Fun has been theorized as “a political matter”; and as an agent to undermine hegemony. Fun also remained an indelible feature of right wing mobilization and nationalism. Everyday digital practices are articulated through wit, parody, sarcasm, and “memification”; and translate to joyful conducts, spontaneity and lightness, or fun. Drawing from Lempert’s “mimetic practice,” this research argues that fun emerges as the site of “mimetic resistance” or ideological tension, as diverse political actors negotiate cultural identity through challenge to cultural purity and engagement with news. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I study transnational crime TV through a key recurring textual element—serial narrative—to understand how it creates terms of transnational legibility in a major import market, the United States. These programs’ serial form both suits the ecology of the U.S. post-network era and articulates aesthetic and ideological norms recognizable to U.S. audiences. Imported serial crime TV is tied to multiple genres and familiar tropes of gender and race, often relying on the discovery of white female victims to galvanize police investigations, serve as gothic spectacles, and animate family melodramas. DR’s Forbrydelsen exemplifies such complexly layered and “translatable” serial form. I argue that the aesthetics of this and other programs foreground raced female bodies to deterritorialize them, in the process creating a transnational lingua franca in crime TV. In repeatedly pairing such victims and female detectives, these shows ultimately also illuminate the place feminism itself occupies in transnational flow. </jats:p>",

As a response to larger trends in the media industries, this merger positions the newly converged union as a more unified front at the bargaining table. By analyzing the public discourse of SAG and AFTRA’s history from 1980 through the 2012 merger, this article situates actors and their unions within the industrial consolidation that began in the 1980s, looking at how and why SAG and AFTRA responded to (and often lagged behind) industry conglomeratization. I argue that by focusing on “convergence,” the merger rhetoric effectively masks one of the core issues that expedited it, namely, the diminishing importance of film and the growing importance of television and other media. </jats:p>",

Apart from the massive size of their populations and the considerable degree to which they define the centers of two of the major cultures of Asia, India and China are important as the sources of two of the world’s greatest diasporas, so each has substantial although dispersed overseas markets to cultivate in pursuit of its own globalization.

Indeed, the resulting public outcry not only led to the game industry’s first sex-based controversy, but the antagonism signals the desire to regulate sexual expression on a new media technology as game producers—following the lead of adult video professionals—attempted to transport users’ joysticks from living rooms into bedrooms. </jats:p>",

The basic assumption of this article is that the spread of neoliberalist ideas, together with technological innovations (e.g., digital TV, digital remote control, and digital video recorder), has encouraged the privatization of media time, leading to the experience of media time squeezing. To be more concrete, multichannel applications allow control over viewing schedules, time settings, and time flow. But while the diffusion of digital technological platforms has made privatization of the television time sphere possible, the regulation of these technologies is based on state time management subject to traditional, linear, nontechnological principles. Moreover, even though neoliberalism facilitates systematic deregulation and privatization in the arena of television and new media, one cannot overlook the dualism sustained between technological vision and cultural substantiation. </jats:p>",

By closely analyzing the app itself and the texts produced by the company, this article finds that such technological solutions to risk both create and relieve a new anxiety about the need to know exactly where one’s family members are at all times. </jats:p>",

    "title": "For a Materialist, Non—Media-centric Media Studies",
    "abstract": "dromology” of speed as a generalized aspect of contemporary culture (Virilio 1986), we need an analysis of the stratification of access to different modes of “connexity.” As against the much-trumpeted role of new technologies in allowing the transcendence of social, geographical, and cultural divisions, our inquiries should also be concerned with how new divisions are continually reinscribed in technical modalities (on “techno-zones,” see Barry 2001). In pursuing these questions, media and communication studies need to take their interdisciplinary roots more seriously. Thus, within geography, it is now widely recognized that the striking improvements in transport speed, efficiency, and capacity that now enable vast quantities of material and people to be moved around the world at low cost are one of the key driving forces of the global economy (Crang and Thrift 2000). Within sociology, recent years have also seen the emergence of what has come to be called the “new mobilities” paradigm concerned with the diverse mobilities of populations, goods, information, and wastes (Urry 2007). In this connection, Appadurai’s (1996) now canonical argument for the importance of addressing the disjunctions between mediascapes and other systems of flow or blockage (e.g., in relation to patterns of physical mobility and migration) has been much quoted but little implemented—with emphasis remaining predominantly, if not exclusively, on the (increasingly transnational) flow of information (and, to a lesser extent, on its regulation). It is for these reasons that my own audience work has, in recent years, increasingly stressed the material location of audiences, in terms of both their domestic settings and their variously sedentarist or migrant lifestyles (Morley 2000, 2006). My proposal is that we need to do more to investigate the changing relations between the material and the virtual realms of communications. In doing so, we need to avoid the simplistic periodizations and overdrawn binary divides between the worlds of the “old” and the “new” media, which unfortunately characterize much contemporary work in this field. Rather than assuming that “we” have proceeded abruptly from one era of communications to another, we also need to investigate the continuities, overlaps, and modes of symbiosis between old and new technologies of symbolic and material communications and the extent to which material geographies retain significance, even under changing technological conditions. In this context, critical work on the virtual realm has also begun to recognize that cyberspace itself has a perfectly identifiable geography, the routes and locations of which largely replicate the structure and patterns of earlier modes of communication (Zook 2005). The object of our analysis should thus be defined as the shifting landscapes of differentiated forms of virtual and actual connectivities, in which old ghosts from previous historical eras still haunt the byways of cyberspace (just as new satellite/telephony systems in the Balkans “remap” these territories along the lines of the Austro-Hapsburg empire; Parks 2007) and where the effectivity of even the latest technologies still depends, ultimately, on material infrastructures (e.g., much internet traffic still runs along the old imperial routes of undersea cabling technologies). Contemporary theorizations of globalization provide a good example of the deficiencies of approaches that focus only on symbolic communications, to the neglect 116 Television & New Media of transport. In most analyses of globalization, which fetishize speed and focus on “electronic instantaneity,” shipping is largely neglected, as if e-mail and air travel constituted the totality of global movement. But the slow and massive movements of the shipping industry still constitute the foundations of global economics (Sekula 1995). If globalization is about the movement of information and people, it is also about the movement of goods. The key development here has been the container box, now at the core of a highly automated “intermodal” global transport system (road, rail, and ship), which has decreased costs so as to transform the structure of the global economy (Levinson 2006). Just as digitalization converts all information into a standardized form, readily transferable across different media platforms, so, with containerization, transport has become intermodal. When we speak of technological convergence, as media scholars have done for some time now, we must also attend to its significance in the realm of transport, for we have much to learn from debates that have already taken place there about technological forms and their regulation. In better addressing the articulation of virtual or symbolic and actual or physical modes of communication, it may be possible to set a new agenda for the future that rewrites the paradigm for communication studies so as to transcend their narrowly media-centric focus on the technologies for the transmission of information. We need to be more concerned with the articulation of complex networks of both communications and physical transport, if we are to develop a paradigm that places questions of media and communications in the broader frame of their material contexts and settings (see Morley forthcoming).",

The analysis aims to contribute to studies of digital racism by showing Facebook’s ideological position on racism and identifying its implications. To understand Facebook’s approach to racism, the article deconstructs its governance structures, locating racism as a sub-category of hate speech. The key findings show that Facebook adopts a post-racial, race-blind approach that does not consider history and material differences, while its main focus is on enforcement, data, and efficiency. In making sense of these findings, we argue that Facebook’s content governance turns hate speech from a question of ethics, politics, and justice into a technical and logistical problem. Secondly, it socializes users into developing behaviors/contents that adapt to race-blindness, leading to the circulation of a kind of flexible racism. Finally, it spreads this approach from Silicon Valley to the rest of the world. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> After her termination as a Friends writers’ assistant, Amaani Lyle filed suit for harassment and discrimination. In response, writers defended their professional authority over the writing process, facing two related tensions. First, Lyle v. Warner Bros. emphasized frictions between artistic freedom and social responsibility, amid concerns about a lack of diversity among writers. Second, the case also spotlighted the ambivalence of writers’ artistic status, within a collaborative and vertically integrated system of production. Focusing on problems of organization and profession, this article explores writers’ negotiations of these tensions as negotiations of their role in a complex industry. </jats:p>",

It draws attention to the distinctive features of broadcast licenses as a form of soft property and the significance of policy settlements as ways in which regulators in different countries have managed the relationship between private ownership and public interest. It traces the development of broadcast media policy in Australia from the 1950s to the present in this light, arguing that continuities in policy over time that have favored incumbent commercial interests have been the prevailing pattern of policy outcomes. The article concludes by raising issues about whether a social democratic approach to media policy should support the introduction of greater market competition in a multiplatform environment rather than seek to maintain the existing broadcasting order and draws on so-called new public interest literature to make this argument. </jats:p>",

I propose an analysis of the Mexican case to review some of the problems to which the radio model in the region is subject and that have, in many cases, their roots in the rules that guide the operation of the mass media. This analysis also will provide the key to understanding the challenges that must be met by countries that are making fundamental changes, that through the law can appoint lines of action, that become communication policies, and that can develop more democratic ways of social participation in radio. Understanding the principles that shape the radio-communication model of a country is a determining factor for discovering the characteristics of this medium. Indeed, analyzing radio regulations tells us about the society that makes those regulations. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Unexplored Challenges of Television Distribution: The Case of Azteca America",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The goal of the Azteca America television network, a new arrival within the U.S. Latino field, has challenged the long-standing duopoly held by Univision and Telemundo. Because the Azteca network was launched with a limited coverage of 18 percent of U.S. Hispanic households, its economic viability depended on the expansion of its coverage through co-opting TV affiliates. The dynamics of television programming distribution remain largely understudied by media studies. The author argues that the site of distribution is a structured space that not only defines the access and future success of newcomers in the television business but also demonstrates the institutional culture and business practices in which televisual media represent acquired economic value. At the core of Azteca America’s corporate distribution efforts to reach nationwide coverage lies a process of making the network attractive and valuable to future TV station affiliates, advertising agencies, and corporate clients. The way executives add economic value by deploying Mexicanness by means of the hybrid Azteca America identity and the network institutional business culture allows for the interrogation of longstanding assumptions held by media professionals about the Hispanic market, the U.S. Spanish-language television industry, and its constituency, the Latino audience. </jats:p>",

The article draws on a variety of archival materials, including advertisements from medical trade journals such as Modern Hospital and the American Journal of Nursing and analyses of healthcare architecture. Extending substantial theoretical work on the relationship between technology and gendered labor forms, it demonstrates that television's entrance into the nondomestic, institutional context of the hospital was contingent upon received notions about nurses' labor and patient comfort. Recognizing the possibilities of television as a new communication medium, the most significant challenge involved the integration of television into the daily operation of the hospital. This article shows that assumptions about the nature of nursing labor influenced the design and implementation of television and its technologies (such as the remote-control, pillow-speaker, and nurse-call features). </jats:p>",

By contrast, the film industry has operated as a publisher, selling or renting its individual media products to theaters. During the home video era, while the film industry shifted its focus to the VCR, television remained reliant on advertising and has held only a marginal presence in the video software market. However, increasing corporate synergy and the swift rise of DVD technology have prompted the practice of publication as an alternative means of television distribution and reception. This article explores why television did not succeed on VHS but has been transformed by DVD. The DVD box set in particular, as introduced with Fox’s first set of The X-Files in 2000, has reconceived television series as collectible objects, fostering a new commodity relationship between television and its viewers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "I first encountered Herbert Schiller’s work in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and I recall being struck by how alone he was among people writing for both an academic and a wider public in the United States. It impressed me that in spite of all the utopian rhetoric about how, for example, cable television, the internet of that era, was going to create a wired democracy, Schiller stood practically by himself to write with confidence about how old and new media were expanding the American empire. Moreover, amid all the government and business hoopla about the liberating power of communication satellites, in 1969, he again stood almost alone, this time to write carefully and intelligently about how the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and their friends at AT&T, RCA, and ITT beat down the opposition to create Comsat and Intelsat and ensure early American dominance of satellite technology. It was not easy to be a lone voice asking critical questions about new technologies and businesses enthusiastically supported by both old and new organs of communication. Although he had supporters on the left, few of them cared much about the mass media, considering it too soft and ephemeral for serious neo-Marxist analysis. Undeterred by the lack of interest on the left and with the help of people such as Dallas Smythe and George Gerbner, Schiller worked to fill this blind spot by describing what amounted to a military-industrial-communication complex. Although he is given some credit for courageously addressing the political issues surrounding new media, Schiller is not recognized enough for the conceptual work it took to understand back in 1969 just how business and government were turning both the electromagnetic spectrum and the geosynchronous satellite orbit into commodities not unlike oil, gas, or soybeans. Nor is he recognized enough for the theoretical work it took in 1973, just as Daniel Bell’s The Coming of a Post-Industrial Society was appearing, to write in The Mind Managers about how information was fast becoming a leading commercial commodity.",

Television Studies’ and Media Studies’ embrace of the “new” and their continuing focus on new media forms, practices, and technologies is not itself anything new. The new has a history and is, in fact, a historically specific category. All media were once new, the new regularly remediates the old, and because the “new” is a product and effect of industrial modernity, there has never been a time when we were not confronted with new media and new technologies. The fact of the history of both new media and its study, therefore, is worth revisiting so that we may be more reflective and skeptical in approaching the latest, newest media things. The implications of unreflective emphasis on the new are only becoming more urgent and the potential for dire consequences increasingly apparent. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article questions the way that movie recommendation systems designed to microtarget spectators are thought to operationalize microgenres, highly specific groupings that appeal to narrow niches. If industry leader Netflix’s “altgenres” can track fluid preferences and reconceive audience groupings continuously to effectuate “deep personalization,” such trends towards individualization would undermine canonical genres and their study. But in clarifying the differences and similarities between microgenres, altgenres, subgenres, and cycles, this article situates digital microgenres beside long-standing Hollywood practices, discovers traditional genres enduring at the heart of industry applications of data science, and argues for analytics as a potential boon for film genre studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The issue in media studies that concerns me the most is the way in which evidence is marshaled to support claims about games that are fundamentally flawed. Media studies is no stranger to the debates over media effects, and violence and fears about games seems to be particularly acute. Media psychologists are in rough agreement that games are bad for you and cause things like “increased physiological arousal” and “aggressive thoughts” and “aggressive emotions”. Cultural critics contend that most of these studies miss critical insights about media consumption, the transgressive nature of play, and the cultural context of gaming. Indeed, when these things are carefully accounted and rigorously controlled for, the negative effects of videogame violence seem to evaporate. The issue, I contend, is more about methodology than it is about content. And those methodological concerns have everything to do with how we approach game studies in the future.",

We argue that TV series production and representation changes and is changed by the urban restructuring of globalizing Istanbul since the late 1980s. Analyzing internationally popular series such as Noor, Valley of the Wolves, and 1001 Nights and building on television, urban and cultural studies, this article explores the ways that Istanbul’s neoliberal renovation process appears in and is shaped by TV series. The three segments of the article probe how series reflect and push forth the gentrification of historical neighborhoods, their increasing use of abandoned post-industrial areas as shooting locations, and their promotion of spaces associated with creative industries and luxury lifestyles. We show that both images and image making are connected to city making. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, I argue that the show’s representations of social media use valorize the primacy of connecting with and accepting one’s “real” self, making legible a subject position that speaks particularly to young people—the program’s target demographic—in the contemporary juncture of 2010s “crisis” neoliberalism, by transposing political questions into personal crises. </jats:p>",

Although the mission was a monumental event viewed by millions of people around the world, the production and handling of the recorded materials was a matter of little concern to more than a small group of employees, historians, and space enthusiasts. This article argues that despite the fact that the erasure of these archival materials was accidental, it was not an accident per se but rather a fulfillment of a logic designed into the apparatus of magnetic tape recording from its very inception, and therefore a generative event for the media archeologist. By evoking histories and theories of broadcast and magnetic recording, I argue that erasure is a process that discloses networks of economic, cultural, material, and aesthetic discourses and interests. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Creative Genre Matters: Trendy Drama and the Rise of the East Asian Global Media Market",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The trendy drama, a new TV genre coined to signify contemporary trends, initially emerged in Japan in the 1980s and became popular with middle-class audiences across East Asia for portraying Western-like chic metropolitan lifestyles. This television genre typically consists of a 10 to 13 episode long miniseries with 60 to 90 minute episodes. Their narratives focus on love affairs between rich, attractive, hard-working elites as they question traditional Han Chinese values and consider whether women should be independent, allowed to work, have sex outside marriage, and divorce. While specifically Chinese, these values have influenced cultures across East Asia. While espousing liberal and feminist ideals, they roam from trendy stores, such as fashion clothing and cosmetic shops, to expensive restaurants, and back to their luxurious apartments. Quickly, these dramas became so associated with highlighting current global and local trends and countering tradition that they became known as “trendy dramas”. </jats:p><jats:p> This genre quickly took off and soon thereafter, South Korea and Taiwan partnered together to create their own versions of trendy dramas that helped generate much of contemporary East Asian popular culture, including the rise of K-Pop. Based on Mittell’s claim that genres function as a means of framing mass audiences’ taste, here I explore the role of this TV genre in the context of globalization and local culture in East Asia and its effect upon reshaping social meanings during the 1980s and the early 2010s. In particular, the Taiwanese trendy dramas played a key role in elevating this genre within the Asian TV market. In this article, I argue that in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, the trendy drama became a way to debate Han cultural values and their role in the lives of liberal metropolitan Asians. In the process, this genre helped reshape the East Asian TV market along with popular culture around the globe. I will begin by describing the history of the trendy drama before focusing on how it debates traditional beliefs and considers the value and utility of feminism and individualism in contemporary urban Asia. </jats:p>",

This essay makes the case that studying music video demands a multifaceted approach to genre: if we accept that music video is a moving assemblage of genres and media, we can move toward unpacking the unique configurations of genre and medium in a given music video or subset of music videos. This method might suggest a shift in the way we think through genre in the future, moving away from single genre studies (however expansive or changeable a given genre might be) and toward studies that treat genre in a more recombinatory way. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> For many academics, using social media has both drawbacks and advantages. Social media may allow connection with colleagues, scholarly promotion, and public engagement, and may also open researchers up to criticism and even possible harassment. This essay argues that we must think critically about logics of self-branding and attention-seeking given these two sides of the coin of social media publicity. First, publicity can easily be weaponized against scholars engaging in projects that may be socially or politically controversial by individuals or organizations who disagree with their premises. Universities are often unprepared to deal with this negative publicity and fail to protect researchers from the consequence. Second, self-branding may undermine one’s ability to be viewed as a serious scholar and requires rigorous self-censorship, particularly for those far from the white, male ideal of the professoriate. I conclude with some recommendations for academic social media use at different career stages. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The dramatic success of Playboy magazine in the 1950s paralleled the meteoric rise of television as both an industry and cultural form, but the magazine's relationship with the new electronic medium was an uneasy one. Television's status as a domestic, even feminine, medium posed particular challenges, even more so than the “masscult” critique. Rather than recommending specific programs for consumption as it did with books, albums, and movies, the magazine promoted parody as a “sophisticated” way to engage television. Parody was adopted as a form of interpretation that produced alternative pleasures and meaning, thereby making visual consumption practices a marker of cultural capital. The tensions between Playboy and television were especially apparent in Playboy's own syndicated program, Playboy's Penthouse (1959—1961). The urbane and varied performances of the program, and its distinctive televisual style, offered a version of sophisticated television production that supplemented the magazine's model of sophisticated television watching. </jats:p>",

I argue here that this multi-layered approach is important as it allows for exploration of the nuances between representation and everyday lives, specifically when analyzing the complexity and contradictions related to the girls’ hetero-sexy embodiment and the process of becoming female in a (digital) culture still largely dominated by the sociocultural constitution of slenderness. Throughout the analysis, I aim to demonstrate the way in which the girls’ engagement with “We Cheer” was mediated by their own embodied sensemaking and work on the self. As such, I focus on the partial stories that the girls tell about their own embodied femininities to advance studies of media reception in ways that are arguably unique to interactive exer-games such as “We Cheer.” </jats:p>",

In the service of this strategy, I investigate how CBS dusts off an old tactic from The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the 1970s, using fashion to target a “quality” professional female audience and self-referentiality to resignify broadcast television as an activity for progressive, educated, and diverse women. Ultimately, I argue that The Good Wife uses costuming with female characters to self-legitimate and brand itself as “quality” television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 2006, Kuwait-based Teshkeel’s The 99, billed as the world’s first Islamic superhero team, has developed into a transnational cross-media brand, with theme park tie-ins, merchandizing, and an animated series coproduced with Endemol sold to nearly a dozen countries around the world. The 99 is intended to be a transformative brand that repairs and redefines Islam’s reputation through branding and marketing. Yet, attempts to bring the TV series to U.S. audiences have repeatedly been met with accusations that The 99 is attempting to indoctrinate non-Muslims into Shari’a law. American resistance to The 99 reveals both the limits of consumer capitalism as a great equalizer and some of the incompatibilities of brand marketing and correcting misperceptions about Islam. In particular, I argue that emphasis placed on “brand authenticity” functions as a double-edged sword for Islamic brands, which are simultaneously perceived as both inauthentic and too authentic for broader commercial appeal. </jats:p>",

Faced with issues including political upheaval, climate crisis, and austerity, young people in Ireland and elsewhere have recently organized themselves online and on the streets as social, environmental, and political activists. This article examines recent Irish reality television texts that encourage intergenerational cooperation and solidarity, offering visions of mutual reliance and positive relationships between young and old that dissipate any notion of “generation wars.” Familial and community structures are thus reinstated as a safety net for current uncertainties. This article proposes that these programmes reflect a desire that the cohesion and transformation gained through intergenerational exchange and cooperation on social issues in Ireland might also be leveraged towards addressing the more stubbornly divisive economic inequalities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay examines the increasing interdependence of television news organizations and citizen journalism, specifically focusing on CNN’s citizen journalist website called iReport. Using Tiziana Terranova’s notion of “network culture,” I show how CNN simultaneously denigrates and depends on the unpaid labor of its iReporters, especially when covering a political uprising. I draw on a series of interviews conducted with iReporters who covered the Iranian elections and protests of 2009, in an effort to address the complex political imperatives that inspired their unpaid labor for CNN. In this sense, my case study ultimately reveals that citizen journalism is less a story of exploitation and more a story of negotiation, as hegemonic journalistic representations of world events ultimately unfold within the increasingly disruptive informational milieu that is the product of network culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper unearths the archeology of reaction media across cinema, television and the Internet. We show how reaction content exists in high and low modes, tracing their reoccurrence and remediation from art-house and horror in cinema, to television soap opera, to animated GIFS, and YouTube compilations. Because reactions can be readily repackaged and resourced, we argue that they are a form of inter-media; operating in-between media text and media reception; in-between narrative and sensation; in-between authenticity and performativity; and in-between entertainment and resource. Reaction media are a form of sensory media with material properties. The textual and aesthetic richness of reaction content informs their persistent function, allowing for generative repurposing by internet users as a form of cultural expression and also operating as a rich resource of content able to be repackaged by professional content creators for producing economic value. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the antifeminist appropriation of cancel culture in South Korea, focusing on the controversy surrounding the finger-pinching motif, allegedly associated with Megalia, a now-defunct feminist online community. While cancel culture originated from marginalized groups challenging systemic injustices, it is now appropriated by dominant groups to reinforce social structures—in this case, to protect male privilege and undermine feminism. The study reveals how antifeminist canceling in the country has extended over the years beyond subcultural industries to companies, government agencies, and public institutions. Although both feminists and antifeminists engage in cancel practices, antifeminist canceling has led to the removal of numerous advertisements and the sanctioning of women and precarious workers, reflecting the fundamental gender power imbalance in South Korea. By examining social, public, and institutional responses, I argue that such institutional enforcement upholds and reproduces the antifeminist hijacking of cancel culture, further silencing marginalized communities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the relationship between cultural identity and televisual representations of global and local community formations through a case study of television production in Vancouver, Canada. As part of a larger economic and political project to establish Vancouver as a global city, the provincial government sought to attract runaway Hollywood production and establish Vancouver as a global media center. This integration into the American production system has, according to some scholars, led to the development of a local television industry that erases the sociocultural specificity of the lived place of Vancouver in a manner contrary to the nation-building goals of Canadian broadcasting policies. Drawing on archival research and interviews with television producers, this case study illustrates the contradictions in global media practices and finds that often the most local, and overlooked, community media outlets are best able to reflect the sociocultural specificities of life in the globalizing metropolis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the representation of Irish identity in the media-sport discourse surrounding Euro 2016 in France. The behavior of Irish football fans attracted considerable attention in both the domestic and international media, and they were praised for their friendliness, helpfulness, and goodwill while in France. This media lionization eventually culminated in the Irish fans being awarded (jointly with their Northern Irish neighbors) the Medal of the City of Paris in July 2016. In this article, we examine how fan footage, taken on smartphones and uploaded to the video-hosting site YouTube (mostly by Irish fans themselves), featured centrally in news coverage of the tournament and fed a wider discourse about Irish identity, which relied on longstanding representational tropes. In concluding the article, we reflect on the paratextual significance of Euro 2016 for the Irish football team’s corporate sponsor Three, and more broadly, for Ireland as a nation brand. </jats:p>",

Set against the backdrop of China’s illiberal digital landscape characterized by rapid platformization and evolving Internet governance, the paper draws on in-depth interviews with twenty-one Chinese young gay men to explore how they take advantage of digital platforms and algorithms to creatively and resiliently carve out a space for expressing same-sex desires in a precarious environment. It argues that, although these creative acts of sexual citizenship empower gay men in self-understanding and community-building, they are also critically limited by China’s intertwining neoliberal and illiberal cultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Israel lost its protracted war in south Lebanon after 22 years of brutal occupation, from Israel’s “Operation Litani” in March 1978 to its withdrawal in May 2000 (Israel continues to occupy the Shebaá farms, which Hizballah vows to liberate). Of course, it is largely the success of the resistance movement’s armed struggle in south Lebanon, led by Hizballah, that inflicted cumulative loses on a scale so critical as to lead to Israeli withdrawal. Yet in the final months of occupation, south Lebanon was brought to world attention following a series of remarkable events played out in the international media. The media images displayed around the world of Birzeit University students pelting the French prime minister Lionel Jospin with stones (26 February 2000) in retaliation for calling Hizballah “terrorists” and the students’ chants announcing more than solidarity (“from Birzeit to south Lebanon, one people who will not die!”) were followed by declarations in Lebanon and around the Arab world that “we are all Hizballah,” including that of Yousef Chahine (the famous Egyptian filmmaker), who announced in print his fervent support for Hizballah, save ideology. The lionizing of Hizballah in the Arab world also emanates from the movement’s success, particularly since the late 1980s, in developing its profile as a Lebanese and Arab nationalist movement, with a Mao-esque social policy and program for social justice, and as a movement bent on political intervention and participation (in party politics). This has been achieved through increasingly sophisticated and compelling uses of the new media and information technologies. What is new and striking is Hizballah’s innovative uses of new media in adapting and inventing rhetorics, that is, images and video to address conflicting constituencies both local and international. Hizballah’s multimedia spread includes al-Ahd newspaper as well as al-Manar television station",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this essay, we extend conversations around motherhood depictions in popular culture to women inmates on television. Specifically, we explore intersections of incarceration, motherhood, trauma, and power on Foxtel’s Wentworth (2013–2021) through the character of Bea Smith. We investigate her journey to Top Dog status—analyzing how these intersections propel her to that highest authority position in prison, while also unpacking why they contribute to her losing that coveted position. We argue that Bea’s trauma morphs her into what D’Amore calls a “vigilante feminist,” who uses violence to protect herself and others. However, Wentworth shows the complicated nature of how trauma operates with motherhood as it intersects with incarceration and power in that Bea’s journey is not a straight one. Instead, Bea shifts away from the role of vigilante feminist at times, opting in favor of using violence for pure revenge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing importance of images in the age of television has created the conditions for Narendra Modi to evolve his nondiscursive populist mode of political communication as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Beyond television, he has relied on techniques like mobile vans carrying TV sets and 3D holograms shown in many different locations simultaneously. In this type of high-tech populism, the dress codes and the body language have mattered lot, and hence Modi’s obsession with details, including the colors to wear and the length of his kurta’s sleeves. If Indira Gandhi’s brand of populism relied mostly on the radio, Narendra Modi, who has short circuited his party in the same proportion, belongs to the television era. But he has not used this medium only to promote his image (TV has also played a role in preparing the ground for the Gujarat pogrom after Godhra). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Between 1980 and 1995, audience measurement companies, including Audits of Great Britain (AGB), Nielsen, Percy, and Arbitron, competed to develop peoplemeter technologies, ranging from remote controls to ultrasonic motion detectors, infrared body heat sensors, face scanners, and wearable devices. In this article, I argue that the evolution of peoplemeter technologies during this era was shaped by the inconsistent cooperation of viewers in the task of being measured, resulting in a turn away from active peoplemeters and toward passive peoplemeter methods. In particular, it marked a preoccupation in audience measurement with biometrics, and a constant onslaught of technological experiments in search of a seamless body/machine integration. In the process, the body became itself a technology: one that, if properly disciplined and utilized in the process of commodification, could make viewers more reliable consumers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the institutional and textual features of a Lifetime Television series called Weddings of a Lifetime. It argues that the synergistic melding of Disney, ABC, and Lifetime in Weddings of a Lifetime not only typifies media industry strategies in an age of conglomeration but also evidences the complex textual meanings produced through such institutional practices. In this case, Disney’s cross-promotional efforts at once bolster and challenge the company’s vested interests in the ideologies of heterosexual romance and marriage. While the linkages between Disney properties maximize the program’s selling power, those same linkages, along with the series’ blurred generic boundaries and pretensions to “reality,” fracture the idealized fairy tale that its stories of romance and marriage ostensibly relate. The article seeks to extend the discussion of media conglomeration into a specific case study to examine the effects of this institutional development on a media product. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In 1994, one of the major theatre chains in Canada, Famous Players, became part of Sumner Redstone’s Viacom empire when he acquired Paramount. Soon after, Famous Players began to rattle unions, weaken job security, and generally make its employees as mobile and replaceable as possible. For example, the corporation, despite its own and Viacom’s soaring profits, demanded 60 percent wage cuts from its projectionists in Alberta. Similar demands have been made of other projectionist unions across the country, with frequent citation that technological change has altered and cheapened the work projectionists do. A six-month lockout and a (not especially well-respected) boycott of their theatres followed. On one occasion, no doubt inspired by rally speaker William Christopher (TV’s Father Mulcahy from MASH), protesters made their way through a theatre lobby in Calgary using what Famous Players called “goon tactics.” While the projectionist union denied that any of its members entered the theatre, the corporation claimed to have videotape evidence of an assault and property damage. No criminal charges were laid, though a cardboard cutout of Sandra Bullock was indeed trampled in the melee. The corporation unsuccessfully petitioned the Alberta Labour Relations Board for an injunction against picketing at their theatres, though the board ruled that the projectionists must",

Traditional forms of organizations and modes of resistance such as labor strikes that were thought to be effective are now increasingly seen as inadequate against the speed and complexity of contemporary production processes, forcing the workers to devise commensurate responses. In this article, I discuss some of the newer strategies of resistance gaining prominence among industrial workers, especially as they are mediated through digital media. Focusing on online self-work underpinning worker agitations, I argue that contemporary labor movement should devise creative strategies using new media tools, to which the millennial worker has unprecedented access, in addition to their traditional rank and file struggles, to counter contemporary challenges. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes Fox Sports’ depiction of sports gambling following the Supreme Court decision legalizing this activity at the federal level. The gambling personas offered by Fox Sports programming are particularly worthy of analysis, given efforts by media networks and sports leagues to rehabilitate the image of the gambler. Applying a critical discourse analysis of industry trade press, mobile app design, and sports gambling television programming, this article demonstrates how the persona of the “benign degenerate” is offered as a masculine fan identity designed to align gambling with more common social tv practices and interactive “transactional participation.” The introduction of this new sports gambling persona challenges previous depictions of sports gambling that have categorized this behavior as a form of financialized citizenship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the period since Television &amp; New Media’s inception, most of my scholarly endeavors have focused on sports media as a critical everyday site for discussion and realization of “community” in an era that often resists or, worse, actively undermines such a concept. As sports media have proliferated across this period (e.g., athlete/team/league Twitter and Instagram pages are now requisite “texts”), expectations for athletes to both stand in for entire populations’ political voice and to “shut up and dribble” have been amplified. This essay examines the LeBron (James) Family Foundation in conjunction with LeBron James’s public standing as a politicized, irrevocably geographic, and—per George Lipsitz and Ralina Joseph—always “racialized fact” to consider the increased expectation that sport/media icons are now obligated to remedy state failings through their charitable endeavors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article considers historical, political, and sociological explanations for why the United States lags behind the rest of the English-speaking world in the formal delivery of media education. Developments in media education are examined with respect to how media, leisure, and the popular arts are conceptualized in the United States and in contrast with other nations. Among the issues addressed are problems of parochialism and the politics of local schools; the sheer physical geographic size of the United States; and obstacles to teacher organization, teacher empowerment, and limited or nonexistent preservice or in-service training. Attention is given to the limits of federal education and broadcasting policy making. The ongoing conflicts between protectionist and cultural studies approaches are discussed. The research relies on formal documents and newsletters, interviews with leading media education researchers and teachers from numerous nations, and visits to schools and training sites in various countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This content analysis of prime-time news bulletins during India’s election campaign 2014 in seven mainstream TV channels in Hindi and English studied the construction of development, deprivation, inequality, and governance by main political parties and their leaders. The author counters a popular impression that development was a central theme of campaign coverage. The TV channels accorded more importance to star campaigners and to “ticket” distribution rather than to policies concerning development. Sectarian politics and hate speeches invariably got more coverage on TV rather than social sector issues. Hunger, poverty, inequality, discrimination, and displacement were nowhere in the debate. Political parties and politicians, including Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Narendra Modi who got more coverage than all rivals, also avoided defining “development” in precise terms almost as a deliberate choice. Brand Modi seems to have been treated as a proxy for development and good governance. Corruption and inflation came across as non-issues on TV. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Throughout its illustrious history, the journal Television and New Media has made recurrent editorial decisions to keep audiences within the frame of studying television and new media, returning, time and again, to people’s everyday sense-making of the media as both text and object, as Roger Silverstone expressed it, and publishing audience research in ways that articulated its relevance to a range of sectors in communication studies. This special issue, quite fittingly for this journal, brings together a series of articles, which are written by a set of communication scholars who frequently delve into the messy world that is empirical audience research, but who reflect, here, on the very state and status of the field as it navigates a moment in communication studies scholarship where datafication challenges, perplexes, frustrates, enthuses, and, increasingly, engages in some way or another most communication scholars one meets. In this short editorial, I look at the ways in which these articles approach the field of audience research itself, at a point in time when datafication poses an array of new challenges to mediated societies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Lower-than-expected ratings made the 2000 Sydney Olympics an unusual promotional platform and led the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to alter its on-air plans for marketing its fall 2000 prime-time schedule while the event was proceeding. This study assessed the impact of the prime-time promos carried in the 2000 Games on post-Olympics program ratings. A comparison of before-and-after difference scores for each promoted program showed that only one-quarter of its promoted programs rose in the ratings after the event, half stayed flat, and one-third went down, despite NBC’s having the top-rated shows at the time. Ten factors were identified that potentially affected the promos’ collective impact. From a theoretical perspective, the findings suggested two new variables that might be incorporated in salience theory and from a practical perspective, suggested that NBC’s unusual promotional practices led to too little exposure time and repetition for effective promotion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> On popular television, parenting narratives have emerged as a dominant representational paradigm in depicting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) subjectivities as “normal.” However, I argue that the work of normalization in TV programs also operates on figures and relationships related to gay parents. I identify this secondary process as “anxious displacement” in which figures and relationships circulating around gay parents are overloaded with negatively codified social differences and symbolic excesses. This study examines the cultural work of anxious displacement in Modern Family and The New Normal by interrogating how racial excess, cultural capital, queerness, and the extreme are displaced onto characters in the gay parents’ immediate world. Ultimately, anxious displacement instantiates gay parenting as culturally intelligible and legitimate, and in doing so, reproduces potential normative liabilities by reinscribing hierarchies of personhood. At the same time, anxious displacement validates gay parenting, undermines homophobia, and affirms gay masculinities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the ongoing importance of national culture as a context to understand variations in television formats. To this end, it uses the example of the docusoap, a recent addition to the broad category of “reality TV” that crosses the border between fact and fiction and, in particular, between documentary and soap opera. The docusoap conventions have quickly spread internationally, but national variations can be distinguished. To illustrate this point, two “celebrity” docusoaps are analyzed, the American The Osbournes and its Flemish counterpart The Pfaffs. While both shows are superficially similar, they also show many differences, which are partly related to their respective national contexts. Although eccentric, The Osbournes is typically American in several respects, referring to American myths and themes. The Pfaffs, in contrast, are presented as typically Flemish, most clearly through the emphasis on their simplicity and ordinariness. The ensuing differences in tone make the program more authentic to domestic viewers. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Introduction to the special issue Genre After Media",
    "abstract": "A number of “thought-pieces” have recently come out proclaiming with glee that genre, as we know it, is dead; that it has been put out of its misery by algorithmic recommendations, search engines, and a rapidly transforming entertainment industry (de Pontent 2022; Battan 2019; Cooperman 2021; Leneghan 2020; Petrusich 2021). They present genre as the hard barriers that make entertainment boring and suggest that there is a utopian potential in breaking them down. In response, we collectively argue that genre is not only alive and well but is indeed one of the more thought-provoking aspects of contemporary media and media studies, and worthy of continued study. During a period when you can watch television in a theater, see theatrical performances on Zoom, screen a big-budget feature film on your phone, and play a game on Netflix, questions around the relationship between medium and genre have rarely if ever been more salient or more fascinating. Media specificity, the question of what makes one medium distinct from others and what they are uniquely adept at expressing, becomes significantly more complex when exhibitors appear agnostic about how exactly content is shown and experienced. While medium may be the dominant way in which humanities scholars tend to define their fields and objects of study, the essays collected here point to the continuing relevance of genre across both the entertainment industry and the academy. Indeed, the entertainment industry has increasingly turned to genre distinctions to help them to organize their collections and appeal to users. Netflix and most other streaming services go into extreme specifics in their genre categories but hardly focus at all on what medium their content might consist of (a movie?, TV?, or Video game?). And as medium becomes a less salient category, it begins to look more like genre with flexible definitions and squishy boundaries rather than exact specifications. For instance, what exactly is television anymore? And when we call something a film, are we referring to its medium, its genre, both, or neither? Genre clearly still matters to audiences and industries; generic trains and intertextual",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the integral, reflexive, and critical functions that industrial texts play in contemporary corporate repurposing, cross-collateralization, and branding. More than simply practitioner discourses, the article takes as its object what it terms the “low theoretical” tendencies found in “deep” industrial texts to better understand the critical-theoretical competencies and marketing imperatives behind the textual practices of the new media conglomerates. The article reconsiders the tripartite model offered by Fiske and Gripsrud, by showing how secondary and tertiary television texts persistently migrate toward primary textual status in the current American multichannel flow. A close examination of industrial textual practice (programming events, network branding [the NBC-2000 campaign], station IDs, making-ofs, video press kits, promo tapes, TV-web synergies, and ancillary marketing) shows how the industry theorizes its presence in moving image form, even as it teaches the audience at home by publicly circulating (sanctioned) “insider” knowledge about the televisual apparatus. </jats:p>",

Taking the case study of the wildly popular yet universally despised Hungarian Gyõzike show and its national reception, it argues that the aversion to the cultural quality represented by reality TV and the aversion to the ethnoracial quality represented by the Roma and other minorities are thoroughly intertwined. Reality television has disclosed the unspoken role assigned to racial minorities to mark the whiteness of East European nations, a crucial but hardly discussed aspect of belonging to Europe. This study also demonstrates that understanding the role played by reality TV under the particular conditions of postsocialist nationalisms and media globalization requires expanding the focus of reality TV scholarship on post-welfare neoliberalism. </jats:p>",

Based on interviews with professionals involved in scheduling and cross-platform promotion at Norway’s four main broadcasters, a sample study of actual cross-platform promotion, and relevant statistics for the Norwegian TV market, the article explores changes in scheduling with a particular focus on the distinction between commercial and public service television. The transformations in scheduling are addressed in relation to the broader question of how television is developing in the “post-network” era. The article argues that contrary to claims that scheduling has become obsolete, analyses show that it continues to be a central craft within the television industry, one responding actively to times of change, revising its tools and developing new ones. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the promulgation of the “rural revitalization” initiative, China has been promoting the marriage between technology and rurality to chart a digital future for what is christened “a new countryside.” Rural revitalization is not simply a socio-economic project but a profoundly ideological one, which choreographs a socio-spatial order, fashions an aspirational rural subjectivity, and realigns imaginaries of rurality. This article examines the role of short video in fostering an emergent rural performativity in line with official ideology through idyll-icized displays of rural lifestyles and landscapes, which are loaded with affective and ideological connotations. A scopic contact zone is thus carved out between rural vloggers and urban viewers, one characterized by mutual appropriation and strategic differentiation. This article foregrounds the limitations of this urban-rural contact zone and its immanent “cruel optimism,” while advocating a kind of radical utopia to enable imaginations of the alternative futures of digital rurality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "On14November 2001, CNN showed a long, unedited part of Dick Cheney’s speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in which he rehearsed all the reasons that the White House “economic stimulus” package, and its twin bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate, was the right legislation to help make America “great” again after 9-11. Glossing over the legislation’s details, the vice president continued the administration’s policy of keeping Americans in the dark about the stimulus plan’s blueprint for the corporate plunder of the U.S. treasury. Although not “inflammatory” in the way Al Jazeera’s unedited replays of Al Qaeda messages were said to be, CNN’s frame on the “stimulus package” left the looming question of war profiteering well secreted from public view. Indeed, the networks’ blinkered coverage of this plan may be doing more to damage Americans’ understanding of post-9-11 U.S. policy than Taliban or Al Qaeda propaganda. The Bush administration first announced the proposal as part of a post9-11 assistance package for unemployed workers, later adding tax cuts as the primary feature of economic aid for America. On 23 October, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a version of this stimulus legislation, which included a $25 billion tax rebate for a handful of major multinational corporations (MNCs) as well as provisions for greater use of offshore tax shelters by MNCs. The Senate is currently deliberating on the final version. At this point, Senate Republicans have embraced the administration’s tax-",

Despite being a common area of media focus due to decades-long geopolitics, the Arab Spring, as a mediatized meta-event, has led to the reemergence of the region as a discursive territory. The communicative spaces that opened up during and in the aftermath of the uprisings allowed for a multiplicity of topics to reenter public discourse across local, national, and transnational scales. In the process, seasoned debates such as religious sectarianism and democratic institutionalization gained magnitude. More specific debates such as Turkey’s role as a model/antimodel added new discursive aspects to the multitopic ensemble. The purpose of this article is to reflect on the communicative and scalar dimensions in the mediation of the Arab Spring by way of taking the debates on Turkey as a case in point. </jats:p>",

These television programs expressed fantasies of a viable American society during the mid- to late 1970s, a time of uncertainty and flux in American cultural coherence and global political might. Both fantasy superheroine series illustrate the ways representations of America's “progressive” gender politics worked to the economic advantage of TV networks, formulated reassuring messages about the state of the nation, helped manage America's less progressive attitudes about race and other nations, and justified America's imperialist impulses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines Twitter use among the top U.S. Spanish- and English-language television news networks during a significant breaking news event: the Orlando, Florida, shooting at Pulse Night Club on June 12, 2016. The study used a qualitative methodology and used the conceptual framework of ambient journalism to compare how Spanish- and English-language networks used social media to cover both the Latinx and LGBTQ communities, and to what extent these networks attempted to engage with audiences. The study found that Spanish-language media engaged with the Latinx and LGBTQ communities to a greater extent than English-language media. Findings also suggest that despite the advent of new digital that news networks have at their disposal, such as Twitter, their production and dissemination behaviors have not changed in a significant way. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Like other creative workers, videogame developers believe doing what you love (DWYL) brings success and happiness. Drawing on three years of ethnography in a U.S. based studio, I theorize DWYL as a social fantasy, which glues developers to work despite cruelties. Because developers’ attachment to work is not an individual matter of the heart but a powerful relation that is mutually cultivated, desired, and even joyfully dictated, I conceptualize these cruelties through “ludic authoritarianism”, redefined as a diffuse form of workplace regime. In this regime, both the management and developers invest in the DWYL fantasy that normalizes overwork, creates success mythologies, institutes vague performance metrics, and cultivates discriminatory production cultures. Moving beyond “love at work brings exploitation” narratives, I show how authoritarianism is not a deviant political form in non-Western contexts but a diffuse and playful culture across elite workplaces in the Global North. </jats:p>",

I outline the context of factual entertainment and its audience, and the specific experience of watching Big Brother. Seen in relation to factual entertainment as a whole, Big Brother is one of the least popular examples of “documentary as diversion.” Seen in relation to gamedocs, Big Brother is one of the most popular examples of new factual entertainment. The author's research, which uses quantitative and qualitative audience studies, indicates that attraction to Big Brother is based on the social and performative aspects of the program. The focus on the degree of actuality, on real people's improvised performances in the program, leads to a particular viewing practice: audiences look for the moment of authenticity when real people are “really” themselves in an unreal environment. This, the author argues, is the popularity of the gamedoc, evident in its early incarnation, and writ large in Big Brother spin-offs and sub-sequent series. </jats:p>",

For television’s first seven decades, the calculated infliction of severe pain on unsuspecting victims was not deemed suitable for mass consumption. To explain why such broadcasts are possible now, this study analyzes the underappreciated role of entertainment insurers, advancements in social media technologies that allowed the culture industry to circumvent entertainment insurers, and a subcultural turn that valorized sadistic pranking. By offloading risk from the insured and compensated professionals of traditional media to the uninsured and uncompensated amateurs of social media, Pranked inaugurates a fundamentally novel shift in the culture industry: a shift from creation to curation. The article concludes by returning to Horkheimer and Adorno’s original culture industry critique to assess the stakes of the turn from broadcasting distraction to broadcasting suffering. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an era of CD-Rs and MP3 sound files, the vinyl phonograph record has attained iconic status as the quintessential old analog media form. An analysis of the theory and practice of “backmasking” reveals how a discourse of the occult “re-newed” the old medium of recorded sound one hundred years after its invention. Little scholarly attention has been paid to debates in the 1980s about the alleged presence of backmasking: the term given to the process whereby messages were thought to be placed in popular phonograph records such that their full meaning could be discovered only when the record was played in reverse. The backmasking controversy provides an example of the re-enchantment of an old medium, not through the work of avant-garde artists but conservative Christian preachers, anticult lecturers, and high school teachers, whose antimedia discourse was culturally productive far beyond their local origins or narrow intentions. To appreciate the multiple sources and unintended results of the backmasking panic, this article makes use of scholarly work on new media, the sociology of religion, the history of occult discourses surrounding the electronic media, debates about subliminal advertising, and the cultural history of recorded sound. By thus placing backmasking within these various historical and cultural frames, we are better able to understand how vernacular media theory and the grassroots public performances of traveling showmen constructed a sense of astonishment often associated with media technologies only when they are new. </jats:p>",

As developed through original document research built from the Motorola archives, newspapers, biographies, promotional materials, and a range of trade journals, I show how the EVR contributed to ongoing negotiations over the meaning of television and demonstrate the value of threshold format as an analytic lens attuned to formats that boast little or no material existence but which occupy pivotal positions within ongoing experiments into how “old” technologies can be refigured to offer new possibilities and opportunities. Whereas successfully standardized formats tend to obscure the possibilities that came before them, attending to threshold formats redirects our attention to forgotten ambitions and potentials. </jats:p>",

I do so by examining reality singing competitions in the United States, and specifically the NBC show The Voice. In analyzing the development of social media use in the program over the course of its first seven seasons, I identify a participation dilemma. This dilemma results from the fact that in giving viewers influence over aspects of the production to create an emotional investment, producers relinquish control over the contents of the show, which needs to appeal to large audiences. In addition, I classify the applications of social media: promotional, affective, functional, and phatic. In discussing these examples, I show how the “new” strategies of social TV hark back to “old” strategies that predate their use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In their studies of online media, political economists of communication have examined how firms like Google enclose users in a web of commercial surveillance, thus facilitating the commodification of their online labor. However, this focus on enclosure tends to overlook the political possibilities highlighted by autonomist Marxist theory—namely, that users, under certain circumstances, can appropriate these applications to contest conditions of exploitation. This article offers an analysis of Blog Cabin 2008, a cable home improvement show, in order to explore this tension between autonomy and enclosure. Our findings suggest that producers indeed used the show’s blog to exploit fans’ free labor. However, fans also used the blog to form social bonds, to press demands on the show’s producers, and to make connections between the show’s class politics and the wider financial crisis. A concluding section explores the theoretical and political significance of such unanticipated uses of the show’s blog. </jats:p>",

To reify an “authentic” black masculinity, individuals within the hip-hop genre police its boundaries through discourse and behavior. This policing is evident in popular media content like songs, music videos, interviews, television shows, and film. These media depictions can, over time, cultivate the attitudes and opinions of the viewing public about homosexuals and their place within black culture, specifically in hip-hop. Through a quare lens, the study investigates how Fox’s television show Empire helps construct and maintain stereotypical representations of black gay men against the milieu of hip-hop. Empire reifies queer stereotypes and highlights conventions of black masculinity and hip-hop authenticity. </jats:p>",

Rather than staying with what has become an extremely imprecise term, the argument continues, television studies should turn its attention toward generating more located and nuanced observational accounts of the evolving “cultures of use” within consumer households in order to develop a more accurate and usable set of terms to describe what is actually happening in domestic spaces as people watch television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the complex rhetorics of racial authenticity online, intermixing ethnography and critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) to understand African American users’ investments in enacting race in their social networks. The piece uncovers “acting white” as a significant discourse that shapes online identity and group performances. Examining rhetorics of racial authenticity including insider knowledges in relation to “acting white” and “acting black,” I map Twitter users’ negotiations with individual and collective notions of racial ingroup markers. I put forth the finding of “performance in the negative case,” as interviewees discuss their lack of participation in their ingroup based on diverse perceptions of racial authenticity. I argue that a full understanding of racial authenticity, performative participation, and nonresponsiveness opens up identity and race formulations to include complexities of what is and is not expressed via interaction and performance. </jats:p>",

VR’s optical illusions produce an expanded multisensory immersive experience that enhances the viewer’s interior position within new space. This article questions where embodiment and disembodiment lie in VR’s multisensory optical illusion and whether there is a difference produced by the digital environment versus the photographic, live-action environment? It takes into account our present moment in the history of VR during which the fantasy of total bodily engagement and transference into the “machine” has not yet occurred. In doing so, this article considers the way VR uses synesthetic modes rather than direct sensory stimuli to engage more of the senses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "On Monday, 4 July 2011, the Guardian first revealed that an investigator working for Britain’s (then) top-selling Sunday newspaper, the News of the World (NOTW), had hacked into the cell phone of the murdered teenager Milly Dowler. There was immediate public outrage and a huge amount of media coverage. Two days later, corporate lobbyists, public affairs directors, broadcasters, producers and politicians came together in an exclusive Westminster Media Forum to debate “industry priorities for the new Communications Bill.” In the introductory session, leading figures from Britain’s top media companies all agreed that the forthcoming legislation needed to focus purely on strategies for stimulating economic growth and promoting deregulation. There was not a single dissenting voice on the platform. I asked from the floor whether, given the breaking public scandal concerning phone hacking, there were any noneconomic priorities, for example the promotion of ethical behavior, that needed to be a policy focus.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do key players in Bombay’s screen industries—producers, directors, writers, and business developers—understand, imagine, and navigate the dizzying new world of streaming platforms in India? Tracking the emergence of symbiotic relationships between new streaming platforms and established media professionals, I discuss how a restructuring of industry dynamics is elemental to the processes of cultural legitimation of new streaming tastes and the reconfigurations of the relationships between texts, industries, and audiences. Through case studies of a few prominent creative professionals associated in various capacities with global and local streaming platforms, I sketch the multiple linkages between contemporary streaming cultures and the structural histories of both film and television in the subcontinent. Ultimately, this article argues that media workers’ self-reflexivity and theorizations about the industry-in-digital transit help us not only grasp the heterogeneity of this moment, but also trace notions of value and taste in Bombay’s emerging digital media ecologies. </jats:p>",

While elections across the globe today are mediated in the sense of being pervaded by the ambient presence and explicit deployments of varied media, the Indian national elections of 2014 showcase a specific logic of mediated populism that has become globally influential of late. To understand this logic, we examine the contexts and lineages of the present moment of mediated populism, i.e. the wider political-economic dynamics and contexts that shape and embed the Modi phenomenon. We focus on the changing relationship between privatized media across platforms, political elites and conceptions/productions of “the people” that these particular political historical dynamics have effected and enabled. </jats:p>",

We identify structure and narrative mechanisms most common in this type of television fiction: confusion between reality and dream realms, the need for recollection to discern the real from the dream, the series itself as an empty narrative device with the single objective of prolonging the serial structure, the appearance of a temporal twist that turns into a metaphysical twist, and the construction of characters on the basis of their different temporal identities. This model of TV series has the potential to provoke serious ontological doubts in the spectator and to open the series to metaphysical reflection because, as Deleuze suggests in his discussion of Bergson, the essential problem of metaphysics is time. </jats:p>",

Through a critical qualitative study of the Please Explain miniseries, a series of thirty-four short web cartoons produced by Australian far-right populist party, Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, we explore the strategic use of humor in the communicative arsenal of the contemporary far-right. Drawing on critical discourse analysis and thematic analysis, we examine how humor is used to soften articulations of exclusionary and supremacist ideas, including racism, misogyny, and queerphobia. Our findings suggest that the frivolity and irony of the online animated genre works to stretch the boundaries of the sayable, potentially making the content more palatable to non-far-right audiences. We argue that the strategic use of exclusionary humor forms part of a wider project of far-right discursive mainstreaming that simultaneously (re)legitimizes everyday expressions of exclusion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Reality TV is a distinctive mode of television programming that has developed exclusively in the last twenty years, raising the question of how it is of its times. Reality shows have often been described as “neoliberal” in their logic. They typically present participants as self-responsible enterprising authors of their own lives in ways consistent with the valorization of market relations by neoliberal theorists. I argue for and expand on this interpretation, arguing the role of the “ordinary people” they feature largely is to perform competitive entrepreneurial subjectivity without expectation of fair recompense, but in the hope of attaining extraordinary rewards. Hereby media industries construct narrative worlds consistent with the economic basis on which they employ, but also with recent neoliberal political economy that has been marked by the decline of collective social support and rising inequality among citizens. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Online media consumption has been radically transformed by how media companies algorithmically recommend content to their users. Public service media (PSM) have also realized the potential of recommender systems and are increasingly using these technologies to personalize their online offering. PSM are on the other hand required to disseminate diverse content, which can be incompatible with the logics of commercial recommender systems that primarily seek to drive up media consumption. Drawing on previous research on selective exposure and media diversity, this study presents the results from interviews with ten PSM informants across Europe, revealing that data scientists within these organizations are highly aware of the effects recommendations have on media consumption, and design the PSM online services accordingly. This study contributes with in-depth knowledge of how diversity has been interpreted at operational levels in PSM and how recommender systems are being adapted to a non-commercial setting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The taking up of feminist discourses and practices by a violent misogynist on Netflix’s You is an important departure from mainstream televisual engagements with gendered violence. Drawing on Jackson and Mazzei’s methodological work, we examine “threshold texts” as those that radically destabilize incommensurable political stances such as feminism/misogyny and queer alliance/homophobia. What are the implications of this destabilization for social justice projects? First, we argue that Joe’s voice-over re-centers white, heteronormative masculinity. Second, we examine the implicit homophobia underlying the show’s depiction of female friendships as queer danger. Third, we argue the representations of masculinity offer a hopeless landscape for heteronormative female viewers. We conclude by looking at the paratextual context, specifically actor Penn Badgley’s own ambivalent location as a queer, feminist man playing a character that represents heteronormativity’s deadliest outcome. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Starting in New York City in the 1970s, gay men and lesbians created public access television programs to shine a spotlight on their experiences, communities, concerns, and businesses. This article asks, “How did public access programming provide an emerging televisual forum for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people to circulate community affects, experiences, and activism?” Looking to the “AIDS” episode of the 1983 cable access series Our Time, this article traces emerging affective responses to the AIDS epidemic, fear and anger in particular, present in the episode. This article argues that the content and aesthetics of the episode produce a televisual emotional pedagogy about AIDS, making sense of the rising panic to channel these feelings toward collective action. While little research has explored gay and lesbian public access programming, this article reveals that it provides a significant contribution to television history and to mediated archives of feelings in response to AIDS. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay argues that in extending the audiovisual convention of “thinking music” and focusing it on the traumatized mind of the female detective, crime series such as Top of the Lake (2013–), Marcella (2016–), and From Darkness (2015–) present female knowledge as fundamentally emotional, even irrational. In these series, the female detective is victimized, traumatized, troubled, and her thinking music is distorted, discordant, affectively charged. Arguing that the female detective’s “thinking” music moves away from the forensic mode’s “showing and telling” and toward “listening” as an investigatory model, this essay posits a sonic turn that recalibrates the genre’s engagement with the female victim along affective and emotional lines. Analyzing this trope, this essay connects the female detective’s sonically defined emotional investment to transnational crime drama’s self-reflexive strategies of affective legibility. </jats:p>",

Thanks to radio, today we have emerging cultural industries. The radio was also a pioneer in forging new massive cultures, which later became specific segmentations. Contradictorily, it did not let the spontaneous and popular word flow, nor did it facilitate the development of a culture of conversation. Formal newscasting delivered dialogue from rough monologues, which glorified the announcer. It was a vertical symbology, later esthetically softened by commercial displays, without the appeal of shared discourse. So it never promoted the gestation of the “we,” who knows how to reflect and listen, recognizing the “other.” Radio thus did not generate symbolic and democratic commitments with democracy, nor did it respect civil rights. It did not make possible the formation of identities and agreements of a public culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes current debates over search engine regulation and free speech. In these debates, Google and other companies have relied on the “editorial analogy”: that search results are equivalent to editorial decisions, and thus cannot be regulated without violating freedom of speech. These debates largely focus on analogies to earlier media or the nature of algorithmic judgment. The paper argues that this framing misses key issues relevant to how we think about search engines (and algorithmic decisions in general) and freedom of speech. The paper examines the free speech debates that surrounded media in the 1930s and 1940s in order to: (1) clarify the stakes and politics of the editorial analogy being used today; (2) offer an alternate framing of the debate, that highlights conflicts of expressive interest and asks what it means to participate in the public sphere under conditions of rapid technological and political economic transition. </jats:p>",

Considering games as “sociotechnical” environments, this article studies how the usage of external communication technologies in an online video game guild shapes the members’ social dynamics. Based on a one-year ethnographic study of a women’s guild in The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO), the analysis shows that the infrastructure of TESO guards anonymous interaction by default and contributes to the game as a “safe space.” The displacement of guild communication to media platforms outside the game, however, unleashed mechanisms of disclosure: a leakage of information from the private, domestic domain via TeamSpeak and the “sharing” imperative of personal information on Facebook. Such techno-induced forms of personal disclosure act as a double-edged sword: they strengthen the guild’s social bonds but, simultaneously, breed tensions, peer-to-peer surveillance, and social control within the guild. </jats:p>",

To partake in these new toys, fans were encouraged to define themselves in ways most conducive to the network’s sexual, economic, and gendered vision. Through an examination of the sites’ strict reins on identity construction as produced by its texts, interfaces, inclusions, and striking omissions, this article seeks to shed light on the subtle means by which corporate participation in and design of fan spaces can lead to fans (perhaps unwittingly) bending to corporate designs and playing on a field skewed to corporate rather than personal advantage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I discuss the lessons from South Korea’s digital switchover, considering its development in the process and the remaining challenges. South Korea completed the digital switchover on December 31, 2012, but the analogue cable conversion to digital cable has not yet been completed for some ten million households. Furthermore, a mere 2.6% of all households eligible for government support benefitted from the support scheme. Although Korea embarked on its journey toward digital television relatively early, its progress has been slow and the outcome was only a partial success. I examine the national politics leading up to pilot programs for eliminating analogue television signals in two phases: Wuljin, Kangjin, and Danyang during September and November 2010, followed by Jeju in June 2011. Based on these experiences and the diagnosis of the current situation after the switchover, I conclude that South Korea’s digital switchover is a partial success and there is continued need for a centralized hub collaborating between the government, the broadcasters, and the television manufacturers to communicate more effectively and to increase public awareness to overcome the remaining challenges. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Outsourcing Digital Game Production: The Case of Polish Testers",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the experiences of digital game testers working in external quality assurance departments in Poland. As compared with video game developers, testers have received relatively little attention in game labor studies, and there is a particular gap in the scholarship with respect to testers within firms that perform work that is outsourced from game developers and publishers. Drawing on in-depth interviews with Polish game testers, my research reveals that outsourced game testing is characterized by sharp tensions between self-realization and self-exploitation. The article explores three aspects of testers’ response to these tensions, including enduring precarious working conditions, seeking better career prospects, and engaging in resistance in the workplace. I examine testers’ work through the conceptual lens of hope labor, which designates undercompensated work carried out in the hope of gaining more stable and rewarding employment opportunities in future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "F IRST, my congratulations to all of you on what surely must be an occasion of great satisfaction and celebration. Only by individually overcoming a great many hurdles can you have reached this moment, this place. But, in asking a sociologist to speak, you have asked someone who is professionally inclined to reflect on the social framework of individual accomplishment. Neither you nor I reached this point entirely on our own. I am referring not only to the struggles and sacrifices of our families, but to the deeper currents of social change that run through our lives or, perhaps, behind our backs. Coming this far, we are all carried on the shoulders not necessarily of giants, but of ordinary people who gave their effort and sometimes their lives to open up possibilities they themselves could not enjoy. How many of you here today, who are Jewish, or black, or Latino, or Asian American, or female-how many of you would have been able to apply your individual talents to medicine, if you were not able to stand-as I do as well-on the shoulders of our predecessors to enjoy the benefits of the causes that others before us have fought? Half a century ago the major medical schools of this country had quotas that would have barred-at a reasonable guess-more than half of you who are graduating today. Perhaps you would never have been blocked by such a quota; more likely, you might never have even had the ambition to be a doctor, or it would have been suppressed at an early age for being so clearly impractical. Those times are not such ancient history. I assume there are people here today who not only remember them, but who contributed to medical schools like this one to make sure their children would not face the same barriers that may have excluded them. I assume you have fathers-and motherswho might have wanted to be physicians, but who had to rule out those aspirations.",

Through the characters of Antoine Batiste, Delmond Lambreaux, Davis McAlary, and Sonny and Annie, Treme questions how race and class segregation and the outsider tourist consumption of New Orleans music have affected the production and perceptions of jazz. Through these complex depictions that are both fictionalized and historicized, I argue that Treme meditates on the overall nature of authenticity as both pluralistic and subjective, while creating television performances that offer meaningful commentary about social and political narratives in post-Katrina New Orleans. </jats:p>",

I call this the increasingly rapid co-evolution of the formal market and informal household sectors and analyze it through the concept of “social network markets”—individual choices are made on the basis of others’ choices and such networked preferencing is enhanced by the growing ubiquity of social media platforms. This may allow us to better understand sources of disruption and innovation in audiovisual production and distribution in wealthy Western markets that are as significant as those posed by informal practices outside the West. I examine what is happening around the monetization and professionalization of online video (YouTube, for example) and the socialization of professional production strategies (transmedia, for example) as innovation from the margins. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media scholars have begun to examine how masculinities function in the media through exploration of a variety of texts and personas; however, most have sought to do so by using textual analysis. We argue that this emphasis on textual analysis has overshadowed scholarship on media audiences, limiting opportunities to understand how audiences’ gender identities are affected by mediated masculinities. Through interviews with viewers of HBO’s Entourage, we examine how viewers apply their attitudes and beliefs about masculinity to Entourage’s characters and use Entourage’s portrayal of masculinities to think through their own gender identities. We found that participants were drawn to a fantasy version of a powerful, dominant masculinity and felt less favorably about characters who exhibited forms of masculinity that incorporated attitudes and behaviors deemed feminine. Our findings suggest that scholarship on the crisis in masculinity, and theorization of hegemonic masculinity generally, would be strengthened with critical qualitative audience studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The neurodiverse female detective in transnational crime dramas embodies complex ways of seeing the gender-based violence these series frequently contain. This detective both orients and disrupts their narrative and visual fields with what I will argue is her surveilling yet troubled look. She inhabits the longstanding transnational tradition of the male defective detective and derives from two recent Anglo-European generic staples: female-led crime dramas and neurodiverse protagonists. In her, gender trouble in the look and its object meet up with the problem of the norm. Beginning with the example of Engrenages ( Spiral, 2005) and then focusing on autism spectrum detective Saga Norén (Sofia Helin) in Bron/Broen, this article considers how the generic familiars and innovations vested in this character alter the dynamics of the gaze, recast the significance of empathy and justice, and enable violence, gender, and everyday social norms to be unsettled in potentially feminist ways. </jats:p>",

It assumes further that they perceive that persuasive media messages have greater effects on others than on themselves. This study investigated perceptions of the possible effects of alcohol product placement in youth-oriented films on different target groups, thereby extending current third-person effects research to an area of advertising other than the traditional forms. Specifically, this study examined (1) whether and to what degree the third-person effect functions in the special case of alcohol product placement in youth-oriented movies; (2) the influence of selected demographic, perceptual, and attitudinal variables on consumer perceptions of third-person alcohol product placement effects; and (3) the relationship between perceived third-person effects and support for alcohol product placement regulation in youth movies. The authors found a significant disparity between the perceived effect of alcohol product placement in youth movies on oneself and others and offer empirical support for the theoretical link between third-person perception and a procensorship attitude. </jats:p>",

The research is underpinned by qualitative data, drawing on more than 170 participants in interviews, focus groups, and participant observations, with producers and audiences from Northern Europe and North and South America. A case study of The Bridge (FX, 2013–2014) crime drama and its adaptations is used to think through the idea of push–pull dynamics. A key question concerns how power is performed in television itself, referring to work in cultural studies and Williams’s notion of the television experience. The Bridge crime drama and its adaptations underscore the particularities of power for television industries and audiences: this is not a tale of surrender to global industrial forces; rather, this is a story of the reality of power and the struggle over how producers and audiences make sense of global television. </jats:p>",

The relevance of a recently popular “governmentality perspective” is gestured towards, alongside an emphasis on the importance of taking television’s psychosocial dimensions seriously. The essay attempts to provide a nuanced, psychocultural account of televisual “looking,” which engages with both its ideological and affective elements. Parents are represented as in need of help, but the “help” offered by House of Tiny Tearaways, Supernanny, and Honey We’re Killing the Kids is laden with shames and horrors that are as ideological as they are affective. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay comments on the limits of new and social media to change the contemporary landscape of mediated sport in meaningful ways. The first part of the essay speaks to the “limits of the new.” Here, the forces of “monetization” and the transition of new media into mainstream are considered. Arguments are presented that the “game” of new and social media will likely draft of media logics of legacy media rather than structurally change them. The second part of the essay speaks to the “lasting power of the mediasport interpellation.” Here, theoretical strains from the work of Althusser concerning ideological state apparatuses and the nature of “hailing” are melded, on one hand, with the work of Bauman on “consumer sociality,” and on the other, with that of Wenner on the communicative powers of sports dirt in a commodified environment. Consideration is given to the constancy of sport-anchored mediated hailing to establish (1) gender identities, (2) fan identities, and (3) consumer identities in ways that anchor subject position. It is argued that, given the cultural hold and embrace of these identities, new and social media will be more likely to engage them rather than mount structural resistance in ways that will facilitate meaningful changes in “lived experience” relations with contemporary sport. </jats:p>",

The vague but exhilarating promise of good times was not only translated into catchy campaign slogans but also acquired its own fast-circulating hashtags, domain names, and strong everyday presence on social media. In this article, I open up the notion of good times through an account of #acchedin and locate it within the longer trajectory of neoliberal economic reforms. I ask what good times might even mean in a nation that has transformed itself fully into commodity-form to become an attractive investment destination for global investors. The newly crafted Brand Modi, the natural inheritor and prime agent of 1990s Brand India, now works in tandem in anticipation of the long awaited, and ever elusive, transformative epochal threshold of good times ahead. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses the depiction of the serial killer, Paul Spector, in the BBC/RTÉ television series The Fall (2013–2016). It complements existing scholarship on the series’ female detective by considering how Spector’s construction as a Gothic villain and victim of institutional abuse inflects The Fall’s positioning as a transnational genre production. It focuses on the use of Belfast as a setting, taking into account its historical positioning as a “Noir” city, and discusses the series’ spatial politics in the context of the city’s more recent history of sectarian divisions. It places the “explanation” for Spector’s criminal activities in the context of the narrativization of clerical sexual abuse as specifically associated with the Irish Catholic church, and outlines the narrative turns the series is forced to take to reach its generically inflected conclusion. The discussion focuses on seasons one and two of The Fall as the most significant in terms of meaning-making. </jats:p>",

Kennedy over a four-day period in November 1963 as fundamentally a “television trauma.” Using viewer mail sent to NBC news anchors in the midst of the “Black Weekend,” as well as some surveys and interviews conducted at the time by social scientists, the article argues for the centrality of television to the experience. It also explores how the relative “newness” of the television phenomenon required Americans to grapple with the “uncanniness,” as well as the anguish, of what they were going through. The letters show viewers highly conscious of the medium and of television news personnel as workers in an era before television news had become so routinized and conventionalized as to be taken for granted and invisible as a medium. </jats:p>",

Drawing on in-depth interviews with fourteen queer male “sex influencers”—people who capitalize on their erotic practices on Twitter and other platforms for economic and social perks—and a three-month digital ethnography, we probe how Twitter shapes sex media production in China and opens up multifarious modes of monetization. We suggest that Chinese queer sex influencers’ monetization practices not only construct vibrant sexual cultures, but also incentivize heightened cross-platform mobility, which serves as a strategy for coping with China’s precarious legal environment. Consequently, there has been a convergence of domestic and transnational platforms, which we argue showcases the vitality and creativity of Chinese non-normative media production and consumption in a globalized and platformized age. </jats:p>",

Through its inclusion of two Welsh-speaking housemates and consideration of the use of the language on the program, Big Brother 7 provided an opportunity for viewers to deliberate on issues of identity, culture, and nationalism. This article examines the postings that appeared on internet message boards in response to this program, demonstrating the extent to which Big Brother 7 prompted discussions and debate about Welsh culture and language. Significantly, much of the discourse about Wales and the Welsh language was civil, rational, and deliberative, a theme that runs contrary to increasingly accepted wisdom about message board culture. This case also highlights the uses and limitations of popular reality programming for affirming identity and celebrating cultural differences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mediated authenticity in New Zealand’s Country Calendar ( CC) television program is explored from the perspective of its producers, and rural and urban audiences. Paradoxically, CC is understood as both “real” and “honest” television and a constructed, idyllic version of the rural good life in New Zealand. Techniques and devices such as a predictable narrative arc, consistent narration, invisible reporting and directing, and naturalized sound and vision contribute to the show’s predictability, ordinariness, spontaneity and im/perfection, mediating an authentic yet aspirational view of farming life. We elucidate how factual, primetime television contributes to a shared national sense of “who we are” while navigating different audience experiences and expectations. At stake is New Zealanders’ attachment to rural identity, which underpins public policy commitments to the farming sector, at a time when new agricultural politics are increasingly contested. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the communicative structures of UK television news presentation and how these grant characteristic shape and form to today’s mainstream television news ecology. This communicative architecture remains generally underexplored and undertheorized and yet can be demonstrated to be representationally consequential in terms of how TV news programs variously open up and elaborate, or close down and delimit, opportunities for contending views and voices as well as the cultural display of difference. Based on a systematic analysis of mainstream UK television news, the study demonstrates how today’s UK news ecology is (1) communicatively structured, (2) professionally reproduced and differentiated, and (3) representationally consequential. The communicative architecture of television news, we argue, both naturalizes and conditions the public representations of news-mediated contention and consensus, and it does so through an established repertoire of analytical and affective communicative frames. </jats:p>",

I argue that these homosocially segregated environments enforce boundaries against women and shelter intense bromance relationships that foreclose romantic relationships of any kind, acting as physical incarnations of troubling retrograde sexual politics and ideologies. I also assert that the “boys’ clubs” in which these narratives take place, enabled and empowered by the aesthetic dimensions of architecture and design, help establish workplace patriarchy as commonplace, reasonable, and benign. This article reveals that in these television boys’ clubs, problematic gender ideologies are protected and celebrated, misogyny is naturalized, and patriarchal beliefs and behaviors legitimized. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The commercial public service broadcasters (PSBs) in the United Kingdom (UK) make a significant contribution to the country’s public service television system, alongside the BBC. Operating under the UK communications regulator Ofcom, the commercial PSB channels ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 are required to broadcast varying levels of public service content. This places these channels in a different category to all other market broadcasters in the UK. By taking a critical political economy of communication approach, this article examines how the regulatory system functions to secure public service provision in television. A particular focus is placed on the first-run originations quotas, which govern the levels of programming that are originally produced or commissioned by a commercial PSB, and broadcast for the first time in the UK. It is argued that while fulfilling the public service remit, the commercial PSBs gain significant benefits that contribute to the underpinning of their business models. </jats:p>",

We call this celebration a commemoration of memory: a self-justifying memorialization of a particular expression of cultural memory.</jats:p>",

Zhao explores how these students establish boundaries through social media by managing privacy, engaging in disconnective practices, and performing identity. Through interviews and observations, Zhao reveals how students navigate boundaries with fellow migrants, interact with non-Chinese peers, manage family connections, and separate personal and professional identities on social media. While Zhao’s research is deeply focused, the limitations of the study—such as its narrow demographic and exclusion of other perspectives—suggest avenues for further exploration. Nonetheless, Zhao’s work is an important contribution to understanding the social dynamics of young connected migrants in the digital age.\n          </jats:p>",

This article examines this claim by conducting a multimodal interpretative analysis of the show, focusing on the employment of narrative, discursive and audiovisual strategies that register compassion in the representations of rural identities, bodies, and rural-urban encounters. I argue that the show offers a nuanced emotional repertoire of compassion, which simultaneously empowers and disempowers rural people by integrating a humanitarian tender-hearted sympathy with a socialist positive empathy, and a neoliberal philanthropist pity. In so doing, I reveal the ways in which reality television is embroiled in the intricate interplay between state ideology, sociocultural psychology, and neoliberal logic in post-socialist China. </jats:p>",

This study adopts a case study design that focuses on the Chinese digital video producer Zheng Yun, founder of Zheng Yun Studio, using ethnographic participant observations and in-depth interviews. It explains how creative producers such as Zheng Yun struggle to survive in the context of intensified platformization and how they benefit from the digital platforms by employing various commercialization mechanisms, including the Revenue Sharing Program (RSP), Embedded Product Placement (EPP), Franchise Chains, Agent-commission, and Crowd-funding. This research also demonstrates the asymmetrical power relationships between platforms and video producers, which prompt us to rethink the political nature of platforms and the diversified nature of platformization in the digital platform age. </jats:p>",

On the front end, it is the epitome of the postmodern living archive. Its underbelly, however, remains much less explored and theorized. What kinds of servers are required to host such large amounts of “free” information, offering up data so rapidly, across so many platforms? Taken together, these pragmatic questions inform an important theoretical intervention: these dislocated centers—existing in “enterprise zones” and arctic hideaways—not only effectively blind us to the potential environmental costs of our everyday obsession with self-archiving but also demand a serious revision of the preservation ideals that underpin the archive. This article offers up a series of provocations about data storage centers, as the archive’s underbelly, with the intent of reconnecting Facebook to the bodies and machines that enable it and the ideals that inform it. </jats:p>",

Given that the media industries, as any other industry, can be defined as a set of markets, one of which is the leading market, and to which other markets are auxiliary, the question asked is what market is leading in the case of Spotify. What the article describes as the “Spotify effect” is the company’s ability to fold markets into each other: to make disappear an aggressive financial growth strategy and business set-up based on ad tech engineering by creating an aura of Nordic cool and public benefit around its use of music. Spotify’s financial strategy has implications for the digital distribution of cultural content more generally. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article discusses the unique contributions of audiovisual records made by ordinary people during the “June Journeys” protests, which took over the Brazilian streets in June and July 2013. Comparing national TV coverage with the videos made by protestors or by the alternative network Ninja Media, we draw on Jost’s concept of “violent scenes,” on Rancière’s discussion of distribution of the sensible and visibility, as well as Brazilian communication scholarship. We argue that ordinary people’s and Ninja Media’s “violent scenes,” as opposed to the “scenes of violence” shown by the national news, have particularly strong impacts on those who watch them because they spread easily via an engaged, connected audience. At the same time, violent scenes coexist with traditional media narratives, making visible a greater diversity of viewpoints and increasing the likelihood of contradiction. </jats:p>",

I trace a recent turn to humor, irony, and ambiguity in their online communication and the increasing adaptation of stylistic strategies and visual aesthetics of the Alt-Right inspired by online communities such as 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, and Imgur. Drawing on a visual content analysis of memes ( N = 634) created and circulated by the organization, the analysis explores the place of humor, irony, and ambiguity across these cultural expressions of neo-Nazism and how ideas, symbols, and layers of meaning travel back and forth between neo-Nazi and Alt-right groups within Sweden today. </jats:p>",

In response to the issue of fan labor exploitation, the present study addresses fans’ investments and rewards from an affective value perspective, which has rarely been adopted in previous studies. Using participant observation and in-depth interview data from a Chinese real person slash fandom, this study finds that fans engage in affective and digital labor during their activities, creating surplus value in both affective and monetary dimensions for the entertainment industry. In addition, it shows a long tail effect on fan labor exploitation, as they still devote affective and digital labor to the object after their fandom collapses.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a media and philosophical analysis of Carne y Arena (2017), an immersive mixed reality installation by Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Drawing from Chouliaraki’s notion of the “distant sufferer,” the article compares the medium specificity of television with the characteristics of mixed reality to question whether the gap between spectator and migrant can be bridged. The article analyzes how Carne y Arena positions its users not as spectators but as visitors or participants, thereby turning the “distant” sufferer into a “close and proximate” sufferer. To better understand how this immediacy effect is realized, the article introduces the concept of “intuition,” as theorized by the French philosopher Henri Bergson (1859–1941). In its closing section, the article discusses the ways in which Iñárritu’s work is part of a political intervention that proposes to challenge the limits of mediation and to promote social justice through feeling, acting, and knowing otherwise. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article charts new directions in digital media and migration studies from a gendered, postcolonial, and multidisciplinary perspective. In particular, the focus is on the ways in which the experience of displacement is resignified and transformed by new digital affordances from different vantage points, engaging with recent developments in datafication, visualization, biometric technologies, platformization, securitization, and extended reality (XR) as part of a drastically changed global mediascape. This article explores the role of new media technologies in rethinking the dynamics of migration and globalization by focusing in particular on the role of migrant users as “connected” and active participants, as well as “screened” and subject to biometric datafication, visualization, and surveillance. Elaborating on concepts such as “migration” and “mobility,” the article analyzes some of the paradoxes offered by our globalized world of intermittent connectivity and troubled belonging, seen as relational definitions that are always fluid, negotiable, and porous. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "President Dwight D. Eisenhower became famous for his speech in 1960 on “The military-industrial complex” as he was leaving the White House at the end of his presidential term. His message was in short that the alliance between the arms industry, the armed forces, and influential segments of the political elite represented a threat to democracy (Ottosen 2007b). He admitted that he as president was unable to control this segment of the society. Almost fifty years later, the power of the militaryindustrial complex is even stronger, but very few politicians invite the electorate to reflect on the consequences of this power force for the future of democracy. Eisenhower’s frank statement has been supported by findings from peace researchers who predict that the mechanisms at work in the arms race and military spending on a global scale will even be stronger in the future (Gleditsch and Njølstad 1990). According to the nongovernmental organization United for Peace and Justice, the United States, being the most formidable military power, spends more than the rest of the G7 countries combined:",

This new environment requires broadcasting policy and film policy alike to substantially adjust their settings to “speak to” new governmental, industry, and political priorities. Broadcasting and film policy-making frameworks now need to adjust to policy and industry settings stressing the knowledge economy and information society. This both creates a new centrality for audiovisual production as a “content creation” industry and raises new problems for the various local film and television production ecologies (including the cultural policy that has sustained them) that have developed. This article will use Australian developments to suggest ways broadcasting and film policy is both making and not making this adjustment. </jats:p>",

The emergence of such avant-garde intentionality in network and cable television underscores, moreover, a fundamental tension between art and commerce. These finales draw much of their energy by evoking an aesthetic of disruption and subversion not from the outside of the production process but from within the corporate sphere. </jats:p>",

In the United States, race is deeply tied to corporeal signifiers. But, in social media, the body can be obscured or even imitated (e.g., by a deceptive avatar). Without reliable corporeal signifiers of racial difference readily apparent, Black users often perform their identities through displays of cultural competence and knowledge. The linguistic practice of “signifyin’,” which deploys figurative language, indirectness, doubleness, and wordplay as a means of conveying multiple layers of meaning, serves as a powerful resource for the performance of Black cultural identity on Twitter. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Places matter, despite the discursive hype of virtual making or remote locations, in showing the ways that production is a process nested within social worlds. In 2020, global Hollywood promoted a “COVID-friendly ideal” in order to return to work during widespread lockdowns and work stoppages. Yet by focusing comparatively on the stories that film and television workers told about production during COVID, we argue that crisis stories reveal much about the specificity of places in studying production cultures. To illustrate, we compare workers’ pandemic stories as evidence of emplacement in national hierarchies and emplotment in local power dynamics. Drawing on a corpus of seventy interviews conducted in Tel Aviv, Israel and New Orleans, USA in 2020 and 2021, we show that production cultures provide ample critique of normative tales that media industries promote about themselves and their workforces. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using the media industry studies approach, this article examines the acquisition strategies and licensing practices employed by three recently launched niche Jewish/Israeli subscription video on-demand (SVOD) services. Drawing on qualitative interviews with executives and publicly available materials, this analysis argues that these services acquire film and television titles through a combination of traditional and innovative licensing arrangements intended to maximize access to Jewish-themed or Israeli-produced content unwanted by better funded platforms. The findings reveal the ways in which access to specific kinds of content is dependent on executives’ ability to leverage preexisting industry-specific professional relationships as they attempt to maximize the value created from limited economic resources. As such, this article offers insights by contextualizing licensing practices being employed by niche SVODs across film and television industries while also highlighting the limitations of using the mainstream/niche binary to understand streaming distribution. </jats:p>",

Why is this? What are the social and technological processes constructing these avatars? To answer these questions, I propose that human (streamer and audience) and non-human (streaming platform and 3D modeling software) participants interact to produce the cultural experience of the live stream, re-producing common heteronormative, cisgendered, and racialized tropes about bodies and desirable avatars. And so, I take as my object of study the interaction that happens when all of these participants merge, forming what I call a white heteronormative assemblage. I argue that this assemblage is collective, relational, and self-reinforcing. Analyzing the relations between human and non-humans participants helps us turn our analytical lens away from media content or streamer motive, and instead toward the restrictive outcomes of such interactions. </jats:p>",

It is inspired by an ethnographic audience research conducted by the author among migrant teenagers. KIH, produced by Swedish public broadcasting company SVT (2004) is a mixture of realist drama and youth musical depicting life in Swedish multicultural suburb. It is argued that while KIH shares elements of Hamid Naficy?s (2001) concept of ? the accented? thematically and linguistically, the production of the series parts from Naficy?s understanding of the accented as alternative. Produced by the public service broadcasting company (SVT) KIH is situated in the mainstream media influenced by international television broadcasting, most evidently by the BBC. Moreover KIH seems to be berthed in the European public service broadcasting culture as it embraces the shifts in EBU?s multicultural policies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the Belfast-set BBC series The Fall (2013–) as an illustrative example of television noir. It aims to use noir scholarship to investigate The Fall’s complex gender politics and genre position, and, more significantly, to use The Fall to illuminate the complex ways in which noir currently operates across Anglo-American television and culture. The Fall is self-conscious, if not self-reflexive, in its mobilization of noir to aspire to the cinematic. This article argues that the series, and others like it, use noir as a legitimation strategy, often to excuse prurient stories of sexualized violence. The act of labeling something noir, particularly a visual fiction, is a way of insisting on its status as art. I conclude that the system of noir (and its associations with art and authenticity) is unable to contain the excesses of the serial killer mythology and Gothic inflection of its postfeminist investigator. </jats:p>",

It highlights the increasing dependence of the BBC on imported programming and on the export of content to America due to a series of below-inflation increases that left the BBC financially weakened. The article’s main concern, however, is with the management of attitudes toward American television that were exploited by key executive personnel in the United Kingdom for political ends: the campaign for a higher license fee. The author argues that the successive campaigns during the late 1970s exploited fears of Americanization to emphasize the lowering of quality in the output on the BBC, which connected to debates around public service ideals and hence, to the legitimization of the license fee. The campaigns ultimately also affected public attitudes, which increasingly registered American programming in relation to the lowering of standards on the BBC.</jats:p>",

I argue that the recognition and social connections that people obtain through their online practices provide satisfactions that positively impact their offline activities and daily lives. This is how they turn their collaboration into a worthy exchange, challenging positions that underestimate people’s digital engagement as a form of alternative economic activity producing nonmonetary gains. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This project on economic topographies is one of eight thematic ways in which the research group Edmonton Pipelines is remapping the neighborhood of Rossdale. The essay brings together poetry, data visualization, and technologies of mapping to analyze how the twin vectors of capitalism and colonialism have created Western Canadian cityspace. Rather than taking for granted the ups and downs of the built environment, the article muses on the possibilities of using haunting as an urban interface. Working through this metaphorical possibility concretely, this essay traces the contours of haunting in the case of Rossdale, a Canadian neighborhood that has undergone an emblematic form of gentrification. We develop literal topographical maps as a way of conceptualizing metaphorical hurdles to belonging to settler colonial cities. These socioeconomic topographical maps serve as a new form of urban cartography. </jats:p>",

While only recently have fan studies scholars started to theorize the relationship between racism, sports, and fandom activity, their shared history goes back to at least Jack Johnson, the first black boxer to win the heavyweight championship. From this first encounter with the black athletic body, sports fans with white supremacist leanings have employed lynching iconography and rhetoric to discipline athletes who challenged the general perception of how a public black figure out to behave. I argue that not only is racialized fan violence directed toward black athletes a common occurrence, but that the logics of lynching culture are deeply and perhaps irrevocably intertwined with those of sports fandom writ large. </jats:p>",

In doing so, we begin to sketch out a taxonomy of shipping-specific anti-fan practices, extending Gray’s work into different types and modes of anti-fandom to consider the role shipping plays within consumption practices, fandom stratification, and the production of civic discourse online. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How has the creation of neurodiverse female protagonists worked to make women’s anger generically viable, stripped of conventional stigma? The female T.V. showrunners of Crazy-Ex Girlfriend, Physical, and I May Destroy You fashion genres from musical comedy to autofiction, as feminist platforms through their leads’ diagnoses. These diagnoses facilitate serial generic narratives where the distinction between norm and pathology (the basis of feminized stigma, shame, and abjection) is inverted or blurred. What results is an intersectional complexity (of genre world and angry, neurodiverse character) that calls normative social strictures pointedly into question. These shows’ female, of color and queer characters generate intersectional “trouble” from stigmatized affects (shame, abjection, depression, rage) and bad behaviors (stalking, bullying, lying, and deception, vengeance, violence). Their narratives of angry, neurodiverse characters provide trenchant feminist platforms for rewriting cultural norms concerning women’s anger, sexuality, ambition, and appetite. </jats:p>",

This performance of psychoanalysis “outside the clinic” is ethically fraught. After identifying the company’s perspective on the nature and dynamics of the self, we show how Facebook’s attempts to cultivate specific moral virtues like authenticity and integrity are undercut by its commercial imperatives. To the extent that it neglects this tension, the construction of self encoded in Facebook’s platform architecture will continue to reflect a dynamic of socioeconomic privilege endemic to Silicon Valley’s elite subculture and will therefore amplify preexisting social inequities. We conclude with some preliminary suggestions for how alternative architectures could mitigate these issues. </jats:p>",

Utilizing industry interviews to understand this shift, I argue that series include progressive rhetoric, specifically sex positive rhetoric lifted from the popular feminist movement, in their stories of teen sexuality in order to mitigate controversies that inevitably crop up in public discourse whenever teen sexuality is represented. In so doing, such series shape the potential and parameters of teen girl sexuality. This framing provides for a more capacious spectrum of sexuality for girls, namely in more nuanced and more frequent depictions of queer sexuality and sexually agentive girls. Yet it also highlights the dangers their sexuality poses living in a patriarchal world, subsequently upholding framings of caution and boundaries around girlhood sexuality.</jats:p>",

Focusing on Riverdale, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and Charmed, I explore the racialized affective dimensions of female protagonists’ reactions to sexual violence. Textual analysis of the function of female anger—its causes, expression, and consequences—in sexual violence storylines signals the emergence of a new feminist figure within teen drama: the joykill, a postfeminist and postracial version of Sara Ahmed’s feminist killjoy. In these series, anger sparked by sexual violence incites female solidarity and culminates in utopian scenarios of feminist success. This new, celebratory representation of feminists and feminism as a unifying force visually centers diversity, while the intersections between sexism and racism in experiences of sexual violence remain unexplored within storytelling. Despite its intersectional look, this hollowly diverse feminism is thus racialized as white. </jats:p>",

As multiple national space agencies and private entities prepare to return humans once again to the surface of the moon as a precursor to eventual planned missions to Mars, television will continue to deeply shape the perception and politics of human spaceflight. This paper presents a history of the televisual image in human spaceflight through analysis of contemporaneous documentary evidence such as spaceflight transcripts and space agency press kits, with a focus also on the technical developments underpinning the broadcasts. The analysis commences with NASA’s Apollo missions of the 1960s through to the International Space Station (ISS) era.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article employs textual analysis to identify intercultural tensions in terms of parenting practices and gender roles in the reality TV series Where Are We Going, Dad? (2013–present, season 3). This article particularly explores authoritarian and authoritative parenting practices, parenting practices in interracial marriages, and new fatherhood and gender roles in modern Chinese families. I argue that the series is an ideal cultural site to witness the discourse of the changing parenting practices and gender roles in contemporary China and the broadcasting of it helps Chinese audiences understand both the merits and the weaknesses of traditional parenting practices as well as the importance of the father’s role in child-rearing and family construction. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Big Brother and Critical Discourse",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay discusses the critical discourse surrounding the reception of the first season of Big Brother in Belgium. Comments on the show varied from moral outrage, over discussions of the program's intrinsic features, to discussions of the show's cultural resonance. In general, these comments followed a trajectory similar to John Corner's description of a move from use value (social significance) to exchange value (a consumer's product), while at the same time differing from it by still trying to hang onto a separate notion of moral value (what the show should and shouldn't do). Specifically, this essay argues that the reception of Big Brother Belgium consists of three changes: a shift in critical attitude, a shift in the mode of criticism, and a shift in relationship toward the show's format. Together these three changes reflect the critics' move from a focus on moral value to one on the use/exchange value of the show, while also reflecting differences in the use of moral arguments as a link between critics' cultural concerns and their professional attitude. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines how media representations of Palestinian–Israelis differ between broadcast media outlets and their social networking sites, using the “capabilities approach” as the theoretical framework. The study presents a quantitative content analysis comparison of the frequency and context of appearances of Palestinian–Israeli interviewees on all news and current affairs programs broadcast on the five major Israeli broadcast networks over twelve months, as well as the simultaneous appearances of the interviewees on the programs’ Facebook and Twitter accounts. The results suggest that social networking sites of broadcast media are more enabling of capabilities for Palestinian–Israelis relative to the broadcast media themselves. Thus, with changing consumption patterns and technological developments, this analysis points to the importance of examining social networks in addition to traditional broadcast platforms, for a more comprehensive understanding of which capabilities are enabled through traditional mass media as they expand their reach to new technologies. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Unbearable Liveness of News Television in India",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The last two decades in India have seen an enormous growth of satellite television. News has established itself in the meanwhile not merely as a source of information but also of entertainment. Available in all regional languages through several competing channels, and presented elaborately, television news has come to establish a mode of address, which defines one’s sense of time and space, and configures one’s sense of the dramatic situated in others’ stories. This article engages with the implications of “liveness”—as material and as affect—toward convergence of news narratives. Discussing two of the most widely covered recent stories—Aarushi Talwar’s murder and Baby Falak—the article foregrounds the class antagonism and scandalous anxieties of Indian televisual publics, and argues that news television invites us to trade liveness for news. Thus, news media not only liberates itself of the rigor of news production but also entertains us by reaffirming our deepest anxieties and competing with other modes of intertextual entertainment available on rival channels. </jats:p>",

After a quantitative account of users’ patterns of activity during half a TV season, a qualitative methodology is adopted to understand the variety of social TV logics. Thus, a model of four different kinds and meanings of using social TV is developed: from the most engaged (civic-informative use of social TV) to the most recreational (the game use), from the outburst of emotions (emotional use) to the identity-building and awareness use. Each of those represents various forms of relationships among individuals in a social medium environment, and between them and other actors of the wider contemporary mediated public space, such as civic and political groups, and political news media professionals. </jats:p>",

It considers what these developments might mean for the medium’s preservational qualities and for our understanding of television history more broadly. By focusing on the growth of streaming, the increasing “datafication” of the TV industry, and the prominence of interfaces and catalogs, I demonstrate that the ephemerality of television is both intensifying and diversifying, creating a number of methodological challenges in the process. These developments are placed in a longer history of critical debates around the preservation of digital media and the prospect of a digital dark age so that we might learn lessons from the past that can be applied to the preservational challenges of the present. The article concludes by proposing a number of practical steps so that future television historians might be better equipped to avoid a “scholarly dark age.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Terrorism became the most significant issue in Basque media after September 11. Although terrorism has unfortunately been headline news for decades in this northern region of Spain, the colossal dimension of the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center forced Basques to face the broader relevance of terrorism in their lives, from heightened security at airports to the crisis of the new international order and American foreign policy. In general, the media’s relation to terrorism can be described as something of a “marriage of convenience”; that is, as many media scholars have noted, the terrorist demand for recognition via publicity is intimately linked to the media’s appetite for increasing sales with sensational stories. Since 9-11, however, this controversial relation and the role media play in the so-called terrorism spectacle has warranted greater scrutiny. Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA, Basque Homeland and Freedom) was founded in 1958 to carry out an armed struggle for national liberation in the Basque Country. Beginning in 1959, it began using terrorist actions against Francisco Franco’s dictatorship. Throughout most of the dictatorship, the press had very little freedom and generally did not oppose Franco’s response to the ETA’s terrorism and his policies in the Basque Provinces. Not surprisingly, when democracy returned to Spain in the mid 1970s, the relation between the mass media and terrorism underwent an important transformation. ETA’s military wing continued to carry out terrorist actions while its political leadership dissolved into several legitimate political parties during the transition to democracy. At the same time, journalists were experiencing a new freedom to express themselves independent of government censors. ETA’s terrorism could no longer be seen as a war on the dictatorship but as one directed against democratic institutions and citizens, including journalists, who were often victims of terrorist attacks.

Both The Defenders television series (1961—1965) and the Showtime motion picture series (1997—1998) by the same name rearticulated enduring tensions between law's formalism and just desires for compassion and mercy, depicting defense attorneys as men who work both inside and outside of “law” to ensure justice and confront the lack of humanism in “the rule of law.” Such discourses are understood and appreciated in different ways in different times, particularly as the cultural politics of nostalgia are engaged. The Defenders offers clear illustrations of the ways in which popular narratives not only depict juridical roles but also perform them, specifying when and where “law” begins and ends. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the way that social media have given a renewed impetus to TV criticism. Websites like Entertainment Weekly or TVline.com not only offer TV criticism by TV critics but also offer ample opportunity for fans to debate their favorite TV shows, part of what Graeme Turner has called “the demotic turn” in contemporary media. Whereas academic scrutiny of this demotic turn has tended to focus on the issue of democratization and the valorization of subjugated knowledges, relatively little attention has been given to how this has created a “commonification” of TV criticism. An analysis of audience reactions to The Walking Dead shows a protoprofessionalization of TV criticism, with audience members offering increasingly sophisticated analyses of TV shows, informed by standards set by the culture industry. The paper ends with a discussion on what type of cultural knowledge these new televisual commons produce and circulate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Current accounts of the development of the Chinese Internet have provided important analyses of the political economy of telecommunications and the Internet. This study builds on these research to examine how vernacular online practices played a role in enabling political economic dimensions of the Chinese Internet to act as significant shaping forces. With this objective in mind, this article considers vernacular online practices that preceded the rise of commercial online video portals. My specific examples are ‘video spoofing’ and ‘fansubbing’, practices popular in the early to mid-2000s. Led by amateur enthusiasts, these practices were intimately associated with the legacy of cultural piracy in China in the pre-Internet era. My primary concern here is with identifiying and explicating the social energies that encouraged the formation of these online practices, their development trajectory, and finally, how these practices eventually became assimilated within a nascent video industry. In that respect, my argument is that the vernacular cultural forms and practices associated with these phenomena were central, and indeed essential, to the formation of an online video industry in China. </jats:p>",

    "title": "“Insensitivity Training”",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay begins with a brief history of sensitivity training, a therapeutic and organizational protocol for the instrumentalization of empathy that gained traction in the second half of the twentieth century. The reflection on sensitivity training serves as a wind-up to a meditation on the version of insensitivity training that television manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. Taken together, both gestures provide the basis to make a pedagogical call for an alternative, critical version of insensitivity training for contemporary students. The essay then explores how the meanings of in/sensitivity help to set up that pedagogical project and suggest its lineaments, as well as what that project should look and sound like, within the horizon in which the pandemic still very much establishes the terms and conditions for much pedagogical and scholarly work. More generally, the essay considers how the versions of such work altered by the rise and spread of COVID-19 may have made some subjects laboring in higher education become pandemic television—and what sanguine, ingenious responses to that becoming one may embrace. Finally, the essay moves to a concrete television case study that has instructional value for the would-be instigator of insensitivity training: Jann, a series saturated with elaborations and unfoldings of—which is to say, blueprints for—the uses of awkwardness, discomfort, and insensitivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws from ethnographic work in the game industry to challenge claims that digital platforms “democratize” cultural production by supporting small teams. I show how game developers exemplify the New Spirit of Capitalism in their search for creative autonomy outside of the risk-averse blockbuster console industry. Their risk of cultural production is ostensibly reduced by tools that leverage big data. By following one studio making free-to-play mobile games, I test the celebratory claims of democratization against the reality of implementing these now-essential analytics tools. The studio’s experiences demonstrate how mobile production for digital platforms intensifies game labor rather than facilitating its democratization in any straightforward way. It restricts creative autonomy, exacerbates the burden of risk on developers, and reinforces existing market and gender inequities. Rather than creatively liberating developers and expanding access to game development, data-driven design for digital platforms introduces new gatekeepers and literacies of exclusion. </jats:p>",

In Hong Kong, caught culturally, economically, and politically between a reawakening China and its hundred-year-old ties with the West as a British colony, we sense almost as much controversy between the official mass media depiction of the WTC event and an underground public opinion as was the case for Tiananmen.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The TV drama A Love for Dilemma (2021) has sparked widespread debates on motherhood and gender in China. This article explores the intricacy of the show’s representation of “bad mother.” While conventional perspectives often view motherhood as a realm of private intimacy, insufficient attention has been given to the distinctiveness of Chinese-style motherhood and its intersection with family, neoliberalism, and state politics. This article addresses the importance of analyzing the televisual representation of motherhood to gain insight into how the interplay between patriarchy, the market and the state configures maternal subjectivity, particularly under the leadership of Xi Jinping. By examining the emotional meaning of motherhood produced by the TV series, this study unveils the inherent contradiction of mother love as a site of political investment. It argues that the ambivalence surrounding mother love stems from its entanglement with patriarchal expectations, the burdens of emotional labor, and the state’s vested interests. </jats:p>",

Through an analysis of Top Chef and Project Runway, this essay reveals how the narrative of the Asian “technical robot” has emerged as a stock character for Asian Americans in reality TV programs, flexibly applied to a range of fields where Asian Americans threaten to achieve success. By focusing on Asian Americans who have won reality TV competitions, this essay analyzes how supposedly neutral concepts such as talent and skill are racialized in the reality TV format specifically and in the contemporary U.S. context broadly. Such representations illustrate the very narrow ways that racialized minorities are allowed to integrate into the U.S. For the allegation that Asian Americans are technicians who lack creativity is a barrier that not only helps keep them from trantheir racialized labor niches but also serves as an explanation for why people of color cannot make it to the top of their professions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Changes in the ways that audiences use television, and the ways in which such usage can be measured, raise the possibility of a transformation of the audience commodity, and the currency that fuels the audience marketplace. Specifically, it appears at this point that social media analytics are beginning to play a role in how television program success is measured, and in how advertising dollars are allocated across programs. Essentially, then, the emergence of social TV analytics represents the possibility of a new market information regime taking hold in the audience marketplace. Working from an institutional theoretical framework, this article uses trade materials as a window into industry dynamics and discourses in an effort to provide an account of the recent emergence and usage of social TV analytics in the U.S. television industry and thus explore the process of institutionalization of a new market information regime. </jats:p>",

    "title": "“Witnessing” or “Mediating” Distant Suffering? Ethical Questions across Moments of Text, Production, and Reception",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article identifies that the current literature on “distant suffering” lacks a nuanced account of the relationship between televised representations of suffering and the audiences that encounter these in their everyday lives. Text-centered studies overemphasize how news narratives cause compassion fatigue, while audience-centered studies enumerate audience responses with inadequate references to the textual elements and social factors that shape these responses. While recent theorizations about “media witnessing” have provided a guidepost in thinking about the ethical consequences of showing and seeing suffering in the media, it however obscures the normative from the descriptive and universalizes the experience of the “witness” it speaks about. To address these gaps and develop a holistic approach to examine televised suffering, the article proposes the use of mediation theory to account for the distinct ethical questions that arise from the specific “moments” of mediation and how they should altogether inform the ethical critique of media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines ABC’s television comedy Ugly Betty, in particular one episode that explores race-based affirmative action decisions and quotas, to argue that race and racial categories are ever more present in our society and that they need to be. Asserting how and in what ways race “matters” is important in a social and political climate that often suggests race dare not speak its name. Circulating within sociology and education discourse is the notion of a “color-blind society” (meaning that we no longer see color or that the color of one’s skin will not determine his or her life chances). This idea has been has been recently redefined by the media as “postracial” (meaning that we have moved beyond race and that race no longer structures our thinking or our actions). Either discourse silences talk of racial privilege and disadvantage. As a discursive racial project, the Ugly Betty text helps reify notions of race and difference. </jats:p>",

This article examines the way in which the discursive nature of PBS undermined the program's attempt to represent a critique of this controversial procedure. Framing the controversy as a scientific argument about gender determination rather than as an issue of medical ethics, NOVA transformed a political debate about medical policy into a scientific mystery to be solved by medical experts. As a result, Sex: Unknownnot only failed in its stated goal to educate the public about the intersex movement and the controversy surrounding this procedure but stands as an example of public television's limited ability to serve as a forum for political commentary and social change. </jats:p>",

Like its television predecessors—Police Woman (ITV 1975-1979), The Gentle Touch (ITV, 1980-1984), Juliet Bravo (BBC 19801985), and Cagney and Lacey (BBC 1982-1988)—its female detective encounters institutional and personal discrimination in her day-to-day duties; forced to fight both criminals and entrenched male chauvinism in her pursuit of justice and equality. Written by Lynda La Plante and directed by Christopher Menaul, the first Prime Suspect miniseries (consisting of two 2-hour episodes shown on consecutive evenings) was made by Granada Television and originally broadcast in Britain on the 7th and 8th of April 1991. Renowned for its high production values, it continued and developed many aspects of the original police genre while also breaking new ground in its graphic use of realism and its close attention to squalor, violence, and police practice. Beginning her career as an actress, La Plante’s big hit as a writer first came with Widows (Thames TV 1983), a successful British television series about a group of women who turn their hands to bank robbery. Prime Suspect similarly inverted a traditionally masculine story, placing a woman at the head of a homicide team in pursuit of a sadistic serial killer. As part of",

As a locally produced show targeting the international market and later purchased by Netflix, Mr. Sunshine offers an interesting case study of the local industry’s response to changes brought about by global streaming services. This article analyzes how the creators’ acute awareness of the threats and opportunities posed by the increasingly transnationalizing media industry is reflected in the text of the historical drama set in the time of modernization and the approaching Japanese occupation. It argues that Mr. Sunshine’s visual and narrative construction of early twentieth-century Korea, which emphasizes the unrealized potential of transitional times and Korean people’s agency in shaping their own history, indicates a perceived parallel between the setting of the show and the conditions of its creation. </jats:p>",

The tension between production interests, commercial interests, and the self-reflexive desires of participants positions the reality participant in constant negotiation between narrative and performance, agency and commodification. Nevertheless, as this article seeks to establish, the genre’s formal conventions—focusing on the confessional, the reunion, and format rules—allow for textual creases through which participants’ selves gain agency. Examining shows such as The Circle, The Real Housewives, Love Is Blind, Temptation Island, Are You the One?, and Sister Wives, the analyses show how reality TV form, despite being highly produced and controlled, may nonetheless facilitate participants’ reflexive, even resistant self-representation. </jats:p>",

I revisit the history of audience research to show how empirical findings contested the pejorative conception of the audience problematically yet persistently imagined by theorists of media power during the twentieth century. As media studies joins other disciplines in responding to the growing datafication of society, I propose that the circuit of culture model can help theorize media (including platform and algorithmic) power by opening up the hermeneutic and action space between production and consumption. In this way, critical scholarship might more effectively analyze such metaprocesses as mediatization and datafication precisely by recognizing rather than erasing audiences’ relation to both the everyday lifeworld and the public world of citizen action, regulatory intervention, and the wider society. </jats:p>",

Specifically, we identify and investigate a bot-like Twitter network associated with the controversial organization of Iranian political exiles, the Mojaheddin-e Khalgh (MEK). Tracing and contextualizing the Twitter debate around women’s rights within the 2016 Iranian Parliamentary election, our analysis contributes to the scholarship on diaspora and digital media by drawing attention to the often-neglected potentials for non-state actors such as diaspora groups to make use of social media to promote political propaganda that advances militarist violence. We demonstrate how the MEK network’s “online performance of civic participation” is typical of a bot-net of weak influence inside Iran, but that the aims and extent of its influence can only be fully understood by situating it within a historical and transnational analysis of Iranian diasporic media and politics, one that takes complex US-Iran diplomacy dynamics into consideration. </jats:p>",

This heightened rhetoric and dedicated pots of funding referencing the significance of the games talent pipeline may represent the opportunity to cultivate greater inclusion in the workforce, which continues to be largely homogenous in terms of gender and race. Drawing on qualitative research with stakeholders in five case study institutions, this article highlights the ways in which the production of gamesworker subjectivity by institutions, instructors, and students hinders this possibility. Transparency about the exploitative working conditions and exclusionary norms of the game industry instead becomes the grounds for aggressive and conservative performances of labor bravado, foreclosing collective action, moral arguments about addressing inequalities, and creativity. The article closes by addressing the tension between team-based collaboration and competitive individualism as a site of potential intervention. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Game live streaming scholarship has explored how the medium offers diverse forms of self-presentation, increasingly commercialized avenues of promotion, and vivid examples of participatory cultural production. This article focuses on the vibrant Twitch.tv subculture of drag artist game live streamers (or drag streamers) who engage in digital labor and performance, offer a distinct case of queer internet microcelebrity, and highlight tensions concerning the representation of queer identities in the social media age. As more queer people begin developing branded social media selves in spaces of real-time performance, such as the increasing number of drag streamers on Twitch, we contend that their performance of queerness becomes tied up in both potential avenues for monetization and the expectations of their followers. We conclude by developing the concept of “queer mediated liveness” to describe the labor, esthetics, and live content creation of queer streamers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Comedy Central currently attracts the same kind of quality audience that broadcast television networks courted in the 1990s, one that resulted in the sharp increase in gaythemed content on the networks at that time. Yet the parodic mode of address that so permeates the cable network's content makes the different levels of gay cultural competency a heterogeneous viewership brings to a program like Reno 911! an issue of considerable import. A parodic situation-comedy based on reality crime programming, Reno 911! narrativizes an ambiguously gay police detective who, in turn, provides different viewing pleasures for differently situated viewers. As such, the character foregrounds questions about the political consequences of television's use of queer cultural signifiers and the pleasures that viewers take in a parodic representation of queerness on television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> By exploring one case study of a cult TV revival after decades off-air— Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime, 2017)—this article defines and then focuses on generational seriality. I consider how the gap of twenty-six years between 1990s Twin Peaks and The Return has impacted on its resurrection by reading new Twin Peaks for its representations of aging and loss. I further consider how fantastical connotations of dementia via the figure of Dougie Jones/Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) generate a “brand gap” between new and old Twin Peaks. Finally, I address how recap culture has shaped The Return’s generational meanings, separating out “good” subscription TV Twin Peaks from its U.S. network TV predecessor and “quality TV” contemporaries. Although recappers have suggested that Twin Peaks: The Return represents the defeat of TV recap culture, The Return remains equally gothic—marked by doppelgängers and others—in its Showtime text and its recaps. </jats:p>",

Bush regime has made a more systematically intensive strategic effort to mobilize the management and control of media images as a primary mode of governance than any other U.S. presidency we have yet seen.

It also identifies and draws on what we might see as image insurgencies emerging from the internet, the alternative press, and the mainstream media to raise the prospect that the more fully a regime of power seeks to exert control over and through images, the more vulnerable it becomes to the generation of counterimages, counternarratives, and counterspectacles. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although media studies as a discipline has long been involved in various theoretical elaborations of the “post,” it has been concerned far less often with the past that is purportedly posted. In this piece, the concept of postfeminism provides a useful case to highlight how thoughtful engagement with the past has immense value for contemporary media scholarship. I suggest that postfeminist scholarship has typically tackled history only obliquely—via generational tropes—and that a more direct engagement with media history allows an understanding that reaches past the “now” with which postdiscourse tends to concern itself. Patterns of continuity and change have been brought into view through the access to historical media formats facilitated by digital archives. I propose a concept of vernacular feminism as a tool for analyzing historical postfeminism, pointing to the broader relevance for postdiscourses that involve an evocation of the past in the present. </jats:p>",

Drawing on television, media, and surveillance studies, we focus on the power of representations of social relations and diegetic technologies in possible and imagined futures to explore the role of cultural representations in shaping social order. Through the character of the AI Machine representing algorithmic surveillance, we evaluate the show’s critique of algorithmic autonomy and contend that, as a media technology of surveillance, the show participates in the hype of big data as a panacea while banalizing surveillance. We argue that POI could facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the politics of algorithmic surveillance but fails to do so due to its uncritical representation of artificial intelligence agencies in detecting security risks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Major subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services including Netflix and Apple TV+ target a wide range of consumers through catalogs that house a diverse variety of genres. However, as the SVOD ecology has evolved, services have emerged that focus on particular genres, and thus target enthusiasts of specific content types. This article examines the horror-focused SVOD service “Shudder” to highlight how these genre-specific SVOD services curate content in ways that differ from major services like Netflix. Unlike the top-tier generalist SVODs, niche services like Shudder do not appeal to users via personalized algorithmic recommendation of titles from a seemingly limitless catalog: instead, these services are branded around the affective pleasures of and fan cultures surrounding specific genres. Our analysis of Shudder combines interface and genre analysis to illuminate how the platform offers a “phenomenal experience” of generic immersion in ways that reflect on new intersections between SVOD platforms, genre, nostalgia, and cinephilic subcultures. </jats:p>",

A recent example, Non Summit, presents a series of formal “summits,” borrowing the format of an international strategic meeting. The show enables Koreans to consider issues involving cultural differences, racial discrimination, and national hospitality, particularly related to immigrants. Indeed, Korean TV shows that focus on foreigners living in Korea are increasingly popular, which surely reflects changes in the Korean racial imagination along with the increased number of immigrants entering Korea in recent years. Nevertheless, despite their stated purpose of encouraging Korea to be a more harmonious multicultural society, programs like Non Summit seem to reproduce racialized colonialism in the context of contemporary global capitalism, particularly through their selections of participants and their efforts to paper over revealed cultural tensions. </jats:p>",

Though Gadsby was not the first to broach these topics in a public forum, she did so at a moment when audiences were primed to be newly receptive. While there was predictably some backlash from audience members who maintained that the special should not be considered comedy, there was also a fierce outpouring of enthusiasm. Nanette became a text with which one could publicly identify (or dis-identify), particularly around the framing of sexual violence and trauma, reminding us that we need popular cultural touchstones through which to shift the conversation. It may also be symptomatic of a widening of the range of perspectives and subject positions with which mainstream audiences are willing to sympathize. </jats:p>",

Viki uses amateur expert fans to translate media from around the world into over two hundred languages. Global markets and for-profit fansubbing companies encourage volunteers to establish their own work practices. In examining the posts to one large segmenting forum, this article identifies ways Viki segmenters adapt workplace practices to online fan communities as well as ways that volunteers adapt localized community practices to online spaces. Specifically, volunteers adopted localized professional work etiquette to online leisure activities. This research expands understandings of global fan communities, referencing ways localized community practices continue to intersect with understandings of online work and leisure. </jats:p>",

A case study of Canoe Ventures demonstrates that television increasingly employs the evaluative criteria of direct marketing to rationalize the process of producing audiences-as-commodities. The business of commercial television is being organized to verify return on investment and to locate causality between advertising and sales. </jats:p>",

These indie channels allow scholars to see the work of development itself, chronically understudied despite its rapid expansion through net-neutral web distribution and its legacy as the process from which all TV shows emerge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "and equally interiorized (e.g., the darkness of the movie theater, the dream-like nature of identification with screen images, the centering or decentering of a viewer’s imaginary relation to screen space). One contradiction surrounding television criticism therefore concerned how to bring criticism’s conception of space to bear on a potentially more mobile relation of the viewer to the television set, on the broadcasted nature of television that brought signals into homes, and on the increasingly pervasive presence of the video monitor in and outside domiciles. Of course, true critics could simply ignore these features, continuing instead to talk about television as only what appeared on the screen and as if the viewer were always engaged with the TV set—as if every home were the eternally mythic suburban home, as if the TV room were a kind of camera obscura, as if some TV critics weren’t capable of reading, listening to music, and watching television all in the same place. And while reading and movie watching certainly were a part of the reorganization of an environment outside the home or the movie theater, criticism seemed unconcerned with that issue. 12. One of the most vivid examples of this tendency in film studies has been that of Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger (1985). 13. While Harvey generalized the material modalities of aesthetic (“cultural”) mediation, reading in the aesthetics of space what economic theory already explains, Jameson (1991) generalized the economic tendencies of post-Fordism to ground his claims about a postmodern aesthetic/culture. Both saw culture as being determined primarily by economic developments. In certain respects, postmodernist criticism (including that which informs “critical geography”) placed television at the center of postmodernity: television as the metaphor/example par excellence of late-twentieth-century culture, of simulation, and as agent of a global occupation by American pop culture. On one hand, television was implicated in the breakup of rationalism as the organizing principle of culture, subject formation, and space in modernity, and on the other hand, television was the abstract embodiment of an equally abstract concept of social totalization: the networked society. Although treatments of postmodernism that have emphasized the interconnectedness of media and their subjects (or the connection of media to other virtual sites collectively comprising a networked society) have offered a way of thinking about the environmental features of television, in ways not common in earlier criticism, they nonetheless have generalized that environment—seeing a postmodernist aesthetic or “the cultural logic of late capitalism” everywhere or in highly essentialized forms. For instance, it is one thing to suggest that television is a technology that relies on shopping malls to maintain structures of power, and it is another to imply that television = shopping malls = a postmodern environment. 226 Television & New Media / August 2001",

In Germany, the content network funk by the ARD and ZDF represents a change in the thinking of PSM and policy makers. Since platformization affects PSM institutionally and structurally, German media regulators are addressing platformization in the context of the new Interstate Media Treaty. The article aims to discuss the treaty’s orientation toward digital platforms and SMPs as it attempts to subject them to the control of local state media authorities. Algorithms and data-driven content curation are policed in terms of transparency and non-discrimination, and to ensure that public value content is not marginalized. To enforce this, I would argue, the treaty has to acknowledge the importance of platformization as a structural prerequisite that enables PSM to serve its public demand. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The desire to “do what you love” energizes employment and engagement in creative industries such as digital gaming yet drains hobbyists and aspirants by normalizing expectations to sacrifice job security for passionate work. This article investigates how individuals regulate their aspirations through taken-for-granted trade-offs between vocational compromise and compensation. Multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork with players at fan conventions and recruitment events in North America suggests a moral calculus of corruption and sublimation between passion and profit, which can be traced back to industrialization’s cleavage of labor from recreation and its institution of hobbies as productive leisure. Building on existing research about waged labor’s imagined denigration of hobbies, this argument juxtaposes the passion that is corruptible by work and the passion that promises to sublimate work from drudgery. Interrogating this confounding logic cultivates counter-narratives for purposeful livelihoods beyond industrial-era notions of productivity and neoliberal notions of passion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite being a disreputable genre, horror remains a staple in cinemas and has become increasingly prominent on TV, a medium that has, until recently, been considered inferior to film. Now, a maligned genre and a previously discredited medium are producing some of the most original and engaging histories currently seen on screen. Lovecraft Country (HBO, 2020), Them (Amazon Prime, 2021–), and The Terror (AMC, 2018–2019) are experimental histories of the Peak TV period that effectively weave together historical truths with fantasy. The way the audience physically reacts to the “bounded” horrors in these shows shapes their response to the “unbounded” historical horrors with which they appear alongside. While history and horror might be considered unusual bedfellows, adding horror to a period setting does not automatically void an onscreen historical representation; instead, the resulting unorthodox history can complicate the audience’s understanding of the past and their reaction to it. Anthology and limited series formats are particularly suited to this form of history making, as they maintain an atmosphere of dread while allowing ample time for character development and the construction of narratively complex historical storylines. </jats:p>",

In the 1980s, this term was also used to refer to television’s ability to provide access to interactive menus and electronic services, and in the 1990s, it was used to refer to the idea that viewers could potentially alter the content of television programs. This new definition has now become possible due to the rise of streaming and on-demand services, and the sudden resurgence of interest in interactive television demands a revaluation and reassessment of its complicated history. While some critics celebrate interactivity as empowering and liberating, for example, others argue that it enables ever more virulent forms of control and manipulation.

To examine the impact of the ruptures between physical mobility and digital fluidity on the media representation of locality, I analyzed two cases (the Korea Tourism Organization’s Feel the Rhythm of Korea project and BTS’ media performances for “Dynamite”) produced during the pandemic. Based on a textual analysis of the chosen video projects, I identified three social techniques in shaping locality: a mixture of the past and present, the territorialization of cultural references and performed bodies, and the rhetorical dichotomization of cultural space. I thus claim that locality is molded through a social practice of subjectivity that theatricalizes place attachment and spatial imagination, both influenced by border closures and digital adoption during the global crisis. </jats:p>",

This article looks at the case of New Wave Theatre (Theta/KSCI 1979–1983), a Los Angeles–based cable program that featured punk and new-wave bands, performance art, and interviews. It argues that through distinctive performance tactics and production practices, New Wave Theatre developed a form of “subcultural television” rooted in queer “antisociality.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Informal cultural markets are not new. Nor are “pirate” video and software markets as different from formal markets as supposed. They are also markets governed by pricing, providing opportunities for leverage by market participants at the expense of each other. Pirate markets are a variant of a cultural market in which returns for sellers and costs to buyers factor in limited to no formal returns to content owners. Furthermore, in large parts of the world, such informal arrangements facilitate cultural, social, and market participation. This article remembers the disruptions that accompanied the VCR’s introduction to identify longstanding pathways of market formation to which the VCR and our current “digital” ensemble of DVD and downloads conform; and those features common to these and other media technologies which lend themselves to diverse production, distribution, and consumption arrangements globally. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay provides a statistical and qualitative analysis of the hierarchical coverage of politics by UK Television news. It finds that there is a rigidly structured hierarchy of political access and focus, whereby the Prime Minister dominates over the cabinet, the cabinet dominates over ordinary MPs, the governing party dominates over the opposition, the three main parties dominate overwhelmingly over smaller parties, and the political elites dominate over ordinary members of the public. The paper also provides a framing analysis of TV news both during and after an election campaign period, and finds a skew towards `horse race' and personalization coverage which both outweigh `policy' issues. Thus television news is characterised by a hybrid of hierarchical and exclusive coverage of politics, combined with a narrowly expressed `cynicism' or populist antagonism towards politics that is personalized and anti-systemic in its focus. </jats:p>",

The 2016 release of Fuller House, I argue, was driven not only by the possibility to exploit an existing property with ongoing media and cultural presence in times of “peak TV” but also by Netflix’s strategic efforts to revive the bygone days of TGIF-style programming and reinvent family-friendly viewing in the era of complex television and online streaming platforms. In analyzing the Full House revival—its production and reception contexts, its carefully crafted text and paratexts, its position among complex dramas and edgy sitcoms—I will also trace the ways in which Fuller House engages in postfeminist discourse and raises pertinent questions about family values, gender roles, and ethnic diversity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper offers a comparative analysis of the international streaming trajectories of South Korean television dramas (K-dramas) and Chinese television dramas (C-dramas), highlighting their distinct approaches shaped by geopolitical and regulatory contexts. K-dramas have achieved global success through government support, strategic partnerships with platforms like Netflix, and diverse audience engagement, driving waves of Hallyu (the Korean cultural wave). In contrast, C-dramas initially lagged due to restrictive government policies and limited co-production but have gained momentum through the expansion of Chinese streaming platforms into Southeast Asia. Case studies of Kingdom (2019) and Empresses in the Palace (2015) illustrate these dynamics, revealing challenges such as platform imperialism and cultural reception. This analysis underscores the evolving landscape of digital media, streaming, and cultural exchange in East Asia, offering insights into non-Western media ecosystems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Launched in 2013, Amazon Studios’s Pilot Season reportedly offers an alternative to the conventional Hollywood development cycle by soliciting viewer feedback through short surveys and star reviews to determine which projects are developed into original series. However, while Amazon Studios publicly assures us that viewers “Call the Shots,” the company has swiftly navigated away from such participatory discourse. Through a discursive analysis of promotional materials, executive and talent interviews, and responses from trade presses and critics, this article unpacks how Amazon Studios diminished the import of viewer feedback at the first sign of significant attention from the critical community and subsequently shifted to promotional discourses centered on markers of “Quality TV.” This case ultimately demonstrates that, as discursive strategies, participatory culture and Quality TV serve distinctive functions for the industry, with the former often relegated to attention-seeking gimmick and the latter functioning as a powerful tool of legitimation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the uprising that followed the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, black hip-hop artist Killer Mike appeared on television to ask that people remain nonviolent and in their homes. Similar events took place years earlier. James Brown performed a live concert on WGBH to keep Boston peaceful following Martin Luther King’s assassination in 1968. During the 1992 Los Angeles uprising, both The Cosby Show and The Arsenio Hall Show were used to similar ends. These examples demonstrate the ways in which television has activated black identity to quell certain forms of civil rights protest and implicate televisual discourses of liveness, domesticity, and public service. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of digital game labor have tended to document problems in the working lives of developers while devoting relatively limited attention to solutions, or to collective representation as a step toward solutions. An increasing number of game developers are dissatisfied with their working conditions, and dissatisfaction is a necessary condition for workers to engage in collective action to gain the representational power needed to achieve change in the workplace. Noting that the landscape of collective mobilization in the game industry has not yet been systematically mapped, this article documents collective actions over the past five decades, and asks, “Are the collective actions of developers building momentum toward a viable, sustained mobilization?” The article presents a thematic survey of such actions, including the Quality of Life Movement, exposés of working conditions, gender equity struggles, and unionization efforts. In conclusion, the authors revisit John Kelly’s mobilization theory to assess developers’ capacity to engage in collective mobilization. </jats:p>",

As media access is foundational to cultural citizenship, captions and similar accessibility features are essential to forming an inclusive participatory culture, online and off. Drawing on the history of television closed captioning and theatrical film captioning, it argues that captions and deafness have long been associated with the private, complicating their advancement under civil rights laws concerned with the public sphere and facilitating advancement through telecommunications laws and notions of consumer choice. This article cautions that such neoliberal solutions cannot be relied on to meet the needs—and civil rights—of deaf and hard-of-hearing Americans, and might in fact damage the coalitional identity politics on which civil rights for people with disabilities depend, unless such politics can be reinvigorated through emphasis on unification around shared goals. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Seen through the lens of Republican candidate Donald Trump’s reality TV program ‘The Apprentice,’ his promise to American voters that they’ll tire of “winning” under his regime takes on a darker meaning. This article identifies ‘the loser’ as a potent new political symbol emblematic of ‘contestants’ who in the face of mathematical loss become ‘bigger’ losers if they fail to assert their right to a non-meritorious victory. The fact of one’s loss is not as important as one’s reaction to it. To lose is possible, but to be a ‘loser’ is the ultimate humiliation that justifies taking extreme, even immoral measures. Contestants who are willing to ‘do anything’ to win are rewarded more generously often than those who, in reality, are the rightful winners. Such a perspective rationalizes a politics of exaggerations, lies and defamation. Extending Couldry and Littler’s discourse of passion, we identify the mechanism that enables and compels some voters to embrace Trump’s divisive politics of ‘otherism’ as astute ‘game playing.’ In Trump’s world, to win means many more must lose. Just as in the reality TV world, however, Trump alone holds the power to annoint winners and exile losers, meaning there is no guarantee of success for anyone but him. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, South Korea has become one of the largest content providers for Netflix. We analyze the textual characteristics of five Netflix Originals K-dramas – Sweet Home (2020), My Name (2021), Squid Game (2021), Hellbound (2021), and All of Us Are Dead (2022) – to unfold the existing genre conventions and uniquely local factors in the context of transnational television. In the process of transnationalization, genres are continuously and simultaneously evolving in the directions of homogenization and heterogenization. Universal values such as humanism, altruism, and family-oriented solidarity, as expected in the existing genre conventions, were homogenizing factors. However, these homogenizing factors were accompanied by uniquely local, heterogenizing factors arising from traumatic collective memories, political, and economic situations in South Korea. We also found that webtoons played a significant role in the transnationalization of the K-dramas genre. This study contributes to genre studies and transnational television research. </jats:p>",

I argue that both series produce the uncanny in formal ways made possible by conditions of a televisuality characterized by narrative complexity and a pronounced aesthetic. In their first season, both series draw on recognizable conventions of the police procedural genre, but each develops a dialectical narrative structure that rotates between a rational procedural plotline and an irrational, less linear narrative of a secretive community. In my exploration, I conceive of the televisual moment as a form of rupture and draw on Freud’s original sense of “the uncanny” as making strange what was fundamentally familiar. I argue that ultimately each series mobilizes “the uncanny” in distinctive ways, resulting in two endings with very different implications. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The articles in this issue were originally written as articles for a comparative research project on media, citizenship, and democracy between Mexico and Colombia that took place between 1998 and 2000. In Colombia, the project was coordinated by Jesús Martín Barbero under the auspices of a nongovernmental organization, La Fundación Social, in Bogotá. In Mexico, the project was coordinated by Néstor García Canclini under the auspices of the Program on Urban Anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana in Mexico City. The articles selected for this publication are those that emphasized media (other articles did not necessarily highlight media as part of their research). The main preoccupation that runs throughout all of these articles is the contemporary redefinition of the relationship between private and public spheres as it appears in the usage of different types of media (television, radio, printed press, cinema, video, internet) in several sectors of society and through different processes of cultural transformation in both countries. Here, the issue of new media refers not solely to technological innovations but rather emphasizes the new strategies of different social and institutional actors in mobilizing the relations between media and society, and their significance for reimagining and redefining issues regarding citizenship, democracy, and participation in countries where problems such as governmental corruption, class segregation, poverty, and violence have increased drastically.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the number of single women has grown within Anglo-American society, there has been a proliferation of discourses around single women within popular culture. At the same time, there has been a resurgence in female-centered media representations of detectives. This article asks what cultural work the convergence of the single woman with the unconventional figure of the detective performs, and what this means for contemporary feminine subjectivities, exploring how she is constructed in three primetime TV crime dramas: The Bridge, The Good Wife and Fargo. I argue that while the single female detective foregrounds discourses of professionalism, rationality, and sexual autonomy, she simultaneously reinscribes patriarchal discourses of heteronormative coupledom and normative femininity through her social dysfunction, vulnerability and deviance, rendering the single woman a threat to femininity. Yet, at times, her liminal positioning allows her to occupy a more transgressive feminine subjectivity and subversively trouble the gender binary. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the networked, affective, and embodied gameplay and potential of Niantic’s 2016 augmented reality smartphone game, Pokémon Go. Following affective critique in videogame and digital studies (Anable, Hayles, et al.,) and literary notions of the “grotesque and carnivalesque” (Bakhtin), I emphasize the important and often overlooked role of embodiment in hypertext, hypermedia, and digital smartphone technology. By framing Pokémon Go in relation to Shelley Jackson’s 1995 hypertext, Patchwork Girl, I identify a specific transformative moment that reactivates Bakhtin’s carnivalesque through the embodied gameplay of the digital mobile network. Pokémon Go’s digitally mediated gameplay demonstrates how mobile gaming, and perhaps all mobile computing, in general, serves to further expand the transformative implications and uncertain possibilities of embodiment as the digital takes on new forms. This observable, transductive transformation, I argue, demonstrates a reactivation of Bakhtin’s carnivalesque in the digitally mediated mode of the technological carnivalesque. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent events in the broadcast policy-making system of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have raised the question: can public voices effectively participate in the broadcast policy-making process? This paper examines the factors working against public involvement, as well as those that have made recent intervention possible, especially the growth of the internet and its ability to facilitate more public activity. The authors conducted private in-depth interviews with FCC Commissioner Michael Copps and former FCC Commissioner Nicholas Johnson to discuss their exceptional efforts to better involve the public in the policy-making process during their service with the agency. Our analysis shows that the factors facilitating greater public involvement have developed to the point where, at least sometimes, the public and civil society organizations can either block, or at least modify, the demands of entrenched corporate interests. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Producing Television and Reproducing Gender",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a case study of Irish television, gendered production processes are created through the channeling of women and men into different types of roles where they receive differential rewards and opportunities from their work. Gender also impacts in complex ways on the routines of production, where it shapes the perspective applied to media content and expectations regarding the behavior of staff. Gendered production routines and role allocations become embedded over time and eventually form a gendered culture of television production that prohibits Irish women’s equal participation. Despite the reproduction of gendered work roles, routines, and cultures, women offer evidence of sustainable and valued careers in production. However, women’s adaptations to the constraints of gendered work processes and practices are founded on a neoliberal and postfeminist sensibility that denies the gendered nature of their work and refers responsibility for survival in the industry onto the individual worker, who in turn denies the relevance of gender to their careers. </jats:p>",

I argue that mediation of cell towers in newspapers and lifestyle shows as potentially emitting cancer-causing radiation was key to shaping public perceptions about them. Through their disruptive nature, cell towers call into action a technoscience public consisting of a variety of stakeholders, including radio-frequency scientists, cellular operators, journalists, tower builders, activists, municipal corporations, and building owners. Technoscience publics and media publics intersect and shape each other, and this article presents “mediated technoscience public” as a theoretical framework for an ethnographic intervention in media studies. This framework involves the tracking and comparison of media coverage about technological infrastructure as well as the ways humans emotionally perceive and interact with those infrastructures. </jats:p>",

Drawing from industry reports and expert insights, it uncovers emerging patterns in the creation and marketing of Netflix Originals in Arabic. The first section examines regional television and streaming industries, identifying competitors, genres, and production structures. Case studies in the second section reveal insights into series revival and movie remaking. The second section presents two case studies of Netflix Arabic Originals. These case studies offer insights into the revival of a series with popular trans-regional appeal and the remaking of a movie with proven international success. Netflix’s approach highlights a paradox: while claiming diversity and authenticity, Originals often overlook local contexts in distribution and consumption. This analysis sheds light on the complexities of global-local dynamics in Netflix’s content strategy.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The History and Future of Ideas",
    "abstract": "ion of Knowledge The tradition of modern scholarship – now some centuries old – has tended to favor the abstraction of knowledge from action in order to develop explicit rather than tacit knowledge. From the Renaissance onwards, and at a gathering pace after the scientifi c revolution of the seventeenth century (associated with the foundation of the Royal Society), knowledge (in books, libraries, journals; also ‘ objective ’ knowledge in Karl Popper ’ s sense) was radically separated from knowing subjects. This unleashed the growth of knowledge that we call modernity. During that lengthy period there were many instances of such abstraction across the whole fi eld of the economy, society, and culture. In the industrial revolution, for instance, ‘ workers by brain ’ were abstracted from ‘ workers by hand, ’ white collar from blue, art from artisans, design from fabrication, knowing from doing. Without abstraction and specialization there could have been no exponential economic growth; no modernity. The medium through which abstracted knowledge was collected and communicated was of course print. Printing by moveable type was invented around 1450 to serve the interests of religious and business activists in a still feudal middle Europe. Its ability not only to abstract knowledge from the knowing subject (Ong 2004 [1958] ) but also to ‘ broadcast ’ it around the globe made it the fi rst mass medium, and emancipated it from the control of its inventors. It was at this point that it became an ‘ enabling social technology ’ for the growth of knowledge in general. The unintended consequences of socially ubiquitous print literacy could emerge and grow. These consequences proved to be spectacular and included the development of all three of the most important realist textual systems of modernity – science, journalism, and the novel. In the Middle Ages the university library evolved from the monastic scriptorium, but with print it too could be ‘ abstracted ’ – emancipated – from its institutional origins in the church. As a result, even though this process took time and was never uncontested, science was freed from both 18 The History and Future of Ideas religiosity and the authority of ecclesiastical hierarchies. Similarly, spare capacity on printing presses and the growth of a secular reading public allowed for the development of prose fi ction and later the newspaper. ‘ Dispatches, ’ ‘ Intelligences, ’ and ‘ Mercuries ’ about current affairs were ‘ abstracted ’ from the secret dealings of courtiers and merchants and broadcast to the reading public at large. Meanwhile, the development of vernacular printed prose and of middle class leisure enabled the rise of the novel – the form in which psychological individualism (pioneered in Shakespearean theatres) was generically elaborated and socially propagated, recruiting writers as well as readers (especially women) from previously unrecorded origins. In all of these contexts, print was an agent of generative change, not a neutral tool; it carried the modernizing force of realism – science, journalism, imaginative individualism – to that most ‘ abstracted ’ entity of modernity, the reading public. Print was vital to the emergence of secular industrial society; it was the very agent of knowledge. Small wonder, then, that those trained into modern scholarship are children of print and remain wedded to a model of intellectual emancipation based on print. Print was the means by which knowledge could be extracted (abstracted) from its context, from the knowing subject, and from the temporality of its fi rst production. It was then available for archiving and dispersal among a general population that was at least in principle indifferent to birth, rank, or wealth. This in turn allowed experimentation, correction, and expansion of ideas on a scale hitherto impossible to imagine. Print was so suited to the ‘ emancipation ’ of knowledge from its context of production that many came to see it as an agent of rationality; the means by which the ideas of the Enlightenment were disseminated. The technology itself came to be associated with freedom – political, philosophical, religious, and personal. The famous emancipationist slogan of the nineteenth century, ‘ knowledge is power, ’ was routinely shown as the caption to a picture of the printing press. However, the democratic and scientifi c supremacy of print was challenged by ‘ new media ’ during the twentieth century, especially fi lm and broadcasting (radio and then television). These audio visual media were not welcomed by many print based thinkers, including scientists, journalists, and authors, because they seemed to rely not on reason and ideas but emotion, desire, and corporeal attraction for their communicative impact. They may have made millions of people laugh, cry, fear, or even wonder, but they did not seem suited to ‘ public thought ’ as it had been institutionalized since the American, French, and Industrial Revolutions. A The History and Future of Ideas 19 division between print based (abstract) knowledge and audio visual (embodied) knowledge has persisted to this day, and forms part of the institutional setting into which the latest surge of ‘ new media ’ has erupted. Nevertheless, the audio visual media carried all before them in terms of popularity and reach, so a long term process of mutual accommodation occurred, at an increasing pace from the 1960s, whereby news, and thence politics, as well as imaginative fi ction ‘ went over to the other side ’ – from print to broadcasting and fi lm. Science held out longer, maintaining what was increasingly a fi ction: that it is based on ‘ papers, ’ ‘ publications, ’ and ‘ print, ’ even when none of these is used to disseminate its rationalist ideas. Thus, in order to understand the impact and politics of ‘ new media, ’ the fi eld of media and cultural studies needs a better grasp of the history of sense making practices in large scale modernizing countries of the post Enlightenment era (from the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries to today). At the most general level, just as communication has been modeled in a particular, limiting way, so the history of sense making has been narrated as if it is self evidently representative . Indeed, the stories we tell each other in mainstream media involve both a semiotic theory of ‘ representation ’ and a political theory of ‘ representativeness, ’ each infecting and amplifying the other: • Semiotically, the default setting for signifi cation in general is that of representation, where one thing (word, image, sound, phoneme, or ‘ sign ’ ) stands for another (meaning, referent, signifi ed), often in a realist relationship with one another, where a real object leaves a trace of itself in the sign, as in photography. • This realist representation is then caught up in political representativeness , where something stands for something else proportionately , as when an elected politician ‘ represents ’ in one person many thousands of constituents or voters. ‘ Our heroes, ’ on screen and on the page, ‘ represent ’ the supposed readership or audience as a whole, condensing in one celebrity body characteristics, desires, and actions that seem naturally to be representative of those of everyone. Combining semiotic and political representation makes for a powerful sense of realism or naturalism in the spectacle of celebrity culture: our screen gods and goddesses don ’ t just stand for ‘ everyone ’ ; if successful they sum up who ‘ we ’ are on our behalf . 20 The History and Future of Ideas This apparently natural or self evident model of signifi cation is, however, strictly historical. It belongs to a specifi c time – modernity – and a specifi c place – the West. This can be demonstrated both synchronically, by comparing the system of Western modernity with other co present systems, and diachronically, by showing that the system itself is, historically, internally dynamic and changing, such that even as we speak (or write, read, etc.) it is in process of transformation. In both cases it is possible to fi nd systems of representation that don ’ t involve either realist foundations or confl ation with representativeness. Just look at any culture ’ s traditions of classical dance or drama; or at Australian Aboriginal painting; or at verbal dueling and ritual insult in many oral traditions. Here, courtly ritual, place based cosmology, and competitive signaling are abstracted and elaborated, often with secrecy or interpersonal relations playing a more important role than open communication in the reproduction of knowledge within such systems. Nowhere here can you instantly scale up from comic book character to superpower nation (Superman), from fl awed hero to foreign policy (James Bond), from individual personality to universal gender role ( ‘ Brangelina ’ ). Modern Western ‘ representative representation, ’ apparently naturalistic, is contextual, contingent, and contestable. Its realism is conventional. It is not simply that a restless age tires of its representatives quickly or that competitive commercialism requires constant A list turnover and renewal. It is the system that is localized to a particular time, place, and sense making regime – no matter how global and permanent it seems to the gaze of the immersed onlooker – even as it changes under pressure of its own internal dynamics. Representative Realism → Productivity of the Sign → Productivity of the User Thus, my own reconceptualization of the realist ‘ representative representation ’ model of signifi cation replaces the model with a periodization in which the modern Western model is reconfi gured, slowly at fi rst but at an increasing rate, into what I call a ‘ productive ’ model. • Representative representation (realism): modernism; • Productivity of the sign (abstraction and emancipation of signifi cation): postmodernism; • Productivity of the user (socially networked self representation): ",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the role of copyright in production and labor relations within media institutions. Specifically, it examines China Central Television’s (CCTV’s) copyright reform and argues that developmental strategies and market conditions may diminish or promote copyright’s role in commercial media. In CCTV’s case, two factors contributed to the insignificance of copyright in the 1990s, namely, the reliance on advertising as the major revenue source and CCTV’s centralized power in the television sector. Yet the circumstances changed in the 2000s with the slowdown of advertising growth, which brought copyright to the forefront of CCTV’s market reform. During the process, the dominating role of CCTV vis-à-vis non-unionized media workers resulted in copyright reform that was slanted toward corporate interests. The implications of the path of CCTV’s copyright reform are highly relevant for understanding media and copyright growth in contemporary China and in other media systems undergoing contested processes of marketization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been argued that cuteness is emerging as one of the dominant aesthetic categories of the twenty-first century. In this essay, I analyze the star text of actress and singer Zooey Deschanel to trace the impact of cuteness on the political energies of “Millenials,” the generational cohort arguably most affected by the deleterious aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis. Deschanel is a particularly multi-mediated celebrity with an extensive presence in new media, a hit sitcom, and a number of commercial endorsements. I analyze how cuteness facilitates Deschanel’s appeal to both mainstream and alternative modalities, and trace the affective power of a cute aesthetic to harness commercial imperatives and aid in the creation of a juxtapolitical intimate public that utilizes a “restorative nostalgia” to neutralize political energies amid straitened economic and social conditions. </jats:p>",

However, the author questions whether an actual space exists for the representation of marginalized groups. Narrowcasting combined with internet interactivity are currently promoted as important parts of the five hundred-channel environment—an environment that allows viewers to supersede consumerism as they become producers. The economic and social ramifications of this representation, presently inscribed within a subscriber base and computer/modem access, provide a viable platform for questioning global rhetoric. As a case study to this sociopolitical quandary, the author looks at the U.S.-based cable station Black Entertainment Television and internet usage aimed at marginalized groups. By examining these areas and the historical moment in which they proliferate, she offers particular examples of how this new media and its ideas of representation calculate the audience’s role and pander to the future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the Nintendo Wii console’s negotiation of tensions accruing in contemporary developments around “nice work,” “affective labor,” and “hyperindustrialism.” Learning and play have long been considered to “begin in wonder.” Observing that appliances made for us to “enjoy labor,” as one adversary in a recent Nintendo Wii title puts it, have a history, I show that hyperindustrial recreational appliances like the Wii design wonder for learning and play by deploying gestural-technical stylistics first prototyped in human-computer interaction design research. I apply ten stylistics of gestural interaction design to the Wii in order to articulate its differences from other interactive educational, recreational, and health devices. I conclude that the Wii increases bandwidth for player action with two distinct effects. First, it orients “wonder” as gestural-technical conduct, making an ethical claim to differentiate contemporary play and work, while, second, projecting an unprogrammed “signature effect” extended in a range of modifications by researchers and amateurs alike. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes practices of informal digital media circulation emerging in urban Cuba between 2005 and 2010, drawing from interviews and ethnographic research in the city of Santiago de Cuba. The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy. </jats:p>",

Twitter helps Modi directly reach a significant constituency of listeners, and use it as a channel to talk to the main stream media. In addition, the very appearance of his using social media effectively is in itself valuable in reshaping his public image as a technology-savvy leader, aligned with the aspirations of a new Indian modernity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> WarGames (1983), the first mass-consumed, visual representation of the internet, served as both a vehicle and framework for America's earliest discussion of the internet. WarGames presented the internet simultaneously as a high-tech toy for teenagers and a weapon for global destruction. In its wake, major news media focused on potential realities of the “ WarGames Scenario.” In response, Congress held hearings, screened WarGames, and produced the first internet-regulating legislation. WarGames engaged a “teenaged technology” discourse, which cast both internet technology itself and its users as rebellious teenagers in need of parental control. This discourse enabled policy makers to equate government internet regulation with parental guidance rather than with suppression of democracy and innovation, a crucial distinction within 1980s cold war context. Thus, this article historicizes the internet as a cultural text, examining how technology and its regulation shaped and were shaped by cultural representations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes proceedings of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council as a discourse on tensions between creative freedom and social responsibility. While scholarship on censorship emphasizes the productive and constructive dimensions of prohibitive regulation, this article explores the imbrications of a more permissive style of regulation and its targets. The council’s administration of various self-regulatory codes tends to limit the potential overreach of social responsibility provisions. In particular, its reading practices allow remarkable authority to the coherence and integrity of screen realities. Ultimately, this weight on the “realistic” suggests the discursive and institutional complexity of liberalization. Rather than a simple movement from active intervention to passive permission, or a simple recognition of an already-formed creative freedom, the council follows a particular construction of creative freedom— produced in readings that actively exclude specters of regulable irresponsibility, and that resonate provocatively with the “realism” mobilized in producers’ claims to creative status. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Who invented the internet? When he’s not busy claiming the status of a role model for Love Story, Al Gore sometimes includes this achievement in his curriculum vitae. He is not alone; chain bookstores feature memoirs by all manner of men making similar assertions. The truth is out there, however. Because while Al, his girlfriend Tipper, and his roommate Tommy Lee Jones were padding around Ivy-League dorms during late-night ice-cream feasts, the RAND Corporation was busily devising means of waging the Vietnam War. Its consultancy services did not end there, of course. Our friends over at the corporation also addressed the following question: What if the Soviet Union managed to strike at the heart of the domestic U.S. communications system? Asuccessful attack would leave the country disabled, unless a devolved network could be introduced. The packet system of today originated with that desire to decentralize computing through nodal, semiautonomous sites. In keeping with those origins—state-driven Cold War consultancies—the internet, as we all know, grew nested within public institutions of government and education, and the associated warfarewelfare para-bureaucracy of publicly funded but ostensibly independent research by private universities and firms. How, then, did cybertarianism emerge as an origin myth? And what is it?",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article will unpack the consequences of the convergence between hearing aids and mobile phones. It deploys an analysis of the marketing of two hearing and communication apps from one start-up: a smartphone-based hearing test and a music app which tweaks users’ audio to accommodate their hearing profile. This article argues that both apps and the marketing for them can be seen as examples of biomediation. Rather than marketing hearing apps through biomedical categories to people who recognize themselves as disabled or “hearing impaired,” these apps are framed as personalizing music to fit a unique “earprint.” The article draws on two concepts used to understand this “disruption of the non-disabled/disabled binary” (Puar 2017, xvii, xviii): debility and diversity. Finally, the article offers a critical perspective on the political meanings of the term “diversity” and argues that the categorization of apps has important political consequences. </jats:p>",

Through an examination of Cuba’s Bufo theatre tradition, Ramón Rivero’s appropriation of Bufo’s negrito catedráticotype, and a textual analysis of his radio show El tremendo hotel (1948-1956), the article contextualizes the ways in which Rivero’s popularity as a blackface and black-voice performer operated within three intertwined discursive spaces: the translation of Bufo’s negrito catedráticoas a symbol of anticolonialism, the actor’s left-wing nationalist persona and social activism, and the rearticulation of la gran familia puertorriqueña (the wide Puerto Rican family) hegemonic discourse. The article argues that after Rivero’s death, subsequent televisual representations of “Caribbean” negritos during the 1950s and 1960s became racialized figures that reaffirmed the hegemonic “whiteness” not only of the Puerto Rican nation but also of the emerging post-1959 Cuban migrant community in Puerto Rico. </jats:p>",

This article examines trans culture on the website Tumblr during the period from March 2011, when the authors began researching the platform, to May 2013, when Yahoo! paid creator David Karp over a billion dollars for the site. Through auto-ethnographic dialogue about the loose social networks within Tumblr to which the authors contributed during this phase, the article explores ephemeral aspects of self-representation at the intersection of postmodern art practice, sexual politics, and queer subjectivities. From at least 2011 to 2013, people collectively oriented in opposition to dominant discourses of gender and sexuality used Tumblr to refashion straight cisgender norms and to create everyday art in a hybrid media space. </jats:p>",

This arms race enables social networking sites (SNS) to extract large price surpluses, effectively exploiting their customers. </jats:p>",

This popular sitcom, lauded by both audiences and the television industry, joins the wave of minority-led production which started only recently in Canada, despite Canada’s pride in multiculturalism as one of its national characteristics. Emerging within Canada’s unique model of “multiculturalism within a bilingual framework,” Kim’s Convenience, with a story about a third-language Korean Canadian immigrant family, offers a critical site to understand how cultural diversity is communicated in Canadian television today.

In other words, policy’s effect was indirect: it did not cause the production of Little Mosque, but it did provide an impetus for the CBC to take a risk it might not otherwise have taken. </jats:p>",

Since 1997, cutting-edge medications have shared the stage with beer, cars, and fast food. The problem is the treatment of prescription drugs as just another line of products between television programs—a trend that is only escalating. This article questions the place of pharmaceuticals on television by exploring the privileged position of commercial speech, the industrial circumstances behind the integration of pharmaceuticals into advertising, the implications of the advertisements, and the role of the FDA in regulating them. By delving into the dangers of mixing drugs and television, the author hopes to make a strong case for tighter, media-centered regulation of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Starring raunchy Jewish women, Comedy Central’s Broad City (2014–2019) invites feminist comedy theory to better address race and ethnicity. Feminist comedy theory has long used Kathleen Rowe’s model of the unruly woman, which neglects racial/ethnic dimensions of unruliness. When discussing Jewish comedian Roseanne Barr, for instance, Rowe does not mention transgressive stereotypes about Jewish femininity like the “beautiful Jewess,” a historical stock figure depicting Jewish women as racially exotic and masculine-yet-seductive. Likewise, studies of the Jewess have not yet integrated Rowe’s lens of unruly womanhood. Broad City highlights these gaps: the series calls its stars “Jewesses,” and tropes of the beautiful Jewess fuel their comedic boundary violations between femininity/masculinity, whiteness/nonwhiteness, and racism/antiracism. By analyzing Broad City, I clarify how racial tropes of unruliness shape plotlines and social critiques in women’s comedy. This article also invites feminist studies more broadly to address Jewishness as a salient form of difference. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Invisible Roots: Re-examining Soap Opera’s Influence on the Narrative Complexity of Contemporary Television Drama",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the notion that contemporary television is more “complex” than programming made in the past, arguing that such an approach can risk denigrating earlier TV and erasing its impact on current practice. Focusing on the role soap opera has played in influencing recent narrative trends, it will particularly examine the genre’s tendency toward “paradigmatic complexity” and its increasing presence in contemporary long-form drama. Explaining how this esthetic trend has helped to produce increased levels of narrative depth and expansion, it will also show how this is no longer sacrificed at the expense of a forward-moving plot or a profound sense of “syntagmatic determinacy.” Describing this in terms of “ paradigmatic determinacy,” it will conclude that current TV does not offer an entirely new mode of storytelling, but is best understood as the culmination of narrative forms and generic traditions which can be traced back many decades. </jats:p>",

    "title": "“Harsh Realism”",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the aftermath of the 2011 UK riots, two main themes emerged in public discourse: (a) that the riots were criminal and materialistic in intent and linked to the reality television driven “miswanting” of poor youth and (b) that the riots were a manifestation of a national crisis generated by the absence of public and civic responsibility among (female) denizens of public housing estates. The author argues that, far from telling us about the cultures of poor youth, reality television programs, notably those produced by the BBC, elucidate the agenda of political elites driving “Austerity Britain” to “harden” the views of British citizens against the poor and marginalized. She explores the new harsh realism of Neighbourhood Watched identifying a shift from the earlier left-wing concerns of the British social-realist movement, toward a right-wing sensibility, which has coincided with significant changes to state policy toward the most vulnerable segments of Britain’s population. </jats:p>",

In placing this take-over bid in the contexts of broadcasting, politics, and sport, the complexities of this relationship are illustrated through an analysis of a global media corporation’s conflicts with regulations, new technologies, sentiments, and identities in local, national, and regional arenas. This article illustrates the multidimensionality of globalization, both in terns of economics and culture, to argue that any understanding of globalization requires the analysis of the interaction of a number of places, actors, and tensions—not all of which are simply “global” or “local.” </jats:p>",

Echoing Stanley Cohen’s (1972) analysis of moral panics, the article goes on to postulate that trolls and mainstream media outlets, specifically Fox News, are locked in a cybernetic feedback loop predicted upon spectacle; each camp amplifies and builds upon the other’s reactions, thus entering into an unintended but highly synergistic congress. </jats:p>",

Ethics, while crucial, comprise only an indirect response to recent concerns about the political uses and misuses of data mining, AI, and automated processes. If we are concerned about the impact of digital media on democracy, it will be important to consider what it might mean to foster democratic arrangements for the collection and use of data, and for the institutions that perform these tasks. This essay considers what it might mean to supplement ethical concerns with political ones. It argues for the importance of considering the tensions between civic life and the wholesale commercialization of news, information, and entertainment platforms—and how these are exacerbated by the dominant economic model of data-driven hyper-customization. </jats:p>",

It draws on the framework of political economy regarding transnational capitalism and its reconfiguration, employing document analysis and informant interviews as research methods. This study argues that Chinese video game companies have taken a distinctive development path within the transnational capitalist system. Initially, they accumulated experience, technology, and capital at lower tiers of the global industry hierarchy. They then entered the emerging mobile game market and eventually ascended to prominent positions. On the one hand, their development has reinforced the existing system by providing new momentum and sites for capital accumulation. On the other hand, it has contributed to the reconfiguration of this system by rebalancing the Western-dominated power structures and exploring new development patterns. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A Response to Elizabeth Jacka's \"Democracy as                 Defeat\"",
    "abstract": "Professor Jacka, in this issue, has done me the dubious honor of taking my work as representative of the position on democracy and public service broadcasting that she dubs “modernist.” She argues that this position is no longer—if it ever was—a useful way to think about either democracy or the future of public service broadcasting. This is, she claims, because the modernist conception of democracy is ahistorical and no longer suited to “postmodern” societies and because it sees the impact of the media, and especially television, within a high-culture/low-culture optic and as part of the decline from modernity (good) to postmodernity (bad). In its place, she argues for a concept of “radical democracy” (per Chantal Mouffe) linked to John Hartley’s notion of postmodern television and semiotic democracy. And while she is clear that the old arguments for public service broadcasting, of which she takes me as an exemplar, have failed, she concludes rather uneasily that the new, improved postmodern positions have no need of either the concept or the practice. At least this is one less thing to worry about. But I say her conclusion is uneasy because she still seems to be concerned by regulatory questions relating to the structure and content of broadcasting in Australia. Such questions are close to the concerns of those wishing to defend public service broadcasting but that I think would be completely illegitimate from Hartley’s perspective— attempts on the part of the dreaded “knowledge class” to police popular discourses and pleasures. I do not want to waste space or the time of readers defending in any detail positions first articulated more than fifteen years ago and in the very specific context of British broadcasting policy debates. Suffice it to say that I do not recognize my position in Hartley’s “democracy as defeat” description. I do not think television is either bad or part of a history of decline.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the U.S. 2016 presidential election, journalists and news organizations have been forced to confront shifting racial, social and political climates, and re-evaluate practices and norms. However, news coverage of racism is complex, especially because the conceptualization of racism in society is discordant, and the parameters of racism are heavily debated. News coverage can contribute to this debatability, specifically when it presents issues of racism with certain linguistic and topical features. In a content analysis of social media posts from six of the Facebook pages maintained by national broadcast and newspaper organizations, the present study explores contextual and linguistic representations of racism, and how social media users on Facebook engage with news posted by these organizations. Results suggest representations in news coverage signal a public debate about what is and is not racism. Coverage heavily emphasized prominent figures, while social media audiences amplified Trump’s presence in social networks. </jats:p>",

    "title": "September 11, the Media, and War Fever",
    "abstract": "In the followinganalysis, I want to suggest how the images and discourses of the U.S. television networks framed the September 11 terrorist attacks to whip up war hysteria while failing to provide a coherent account of what happened, why it happened, and what would count as responsible responses. In an analysis of the dominant discourses, frames, and representations that informed the media and public debate in the days following the September 11 terrorist attacks, I will show how the mainstream media privileged the “clash of civilizations” model, established a binary dualism between Islamic terrorism and civilization, and largely circulated war fever and retaliatory feelings and discourses that called for and supported a form of military intervention. I argue that such one-dimensional militarism could arguably make the current crisis worse rather than providing solutions to the problem of global terrorism. Thus, while the media in a democracy should critically debate urgent questions facing the nation, in the terror crisis the mainstream U. S. corporate media, especially television, promoted war fever and military solutions to the problem of global terrorism. On the day of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the networks brought out an array of national security state intellectuals, usually ranging from the right to the far right, to explain the horrific events of September 11. The Fox Network presented former UN ambassador and Reagan administration apologist Jeane Kirkpatrick, who rolled out a simplified version of Samuel Huntington’s clash of civilizations, arguing that we were at war with Islam and should defend the West. Kirkpatrick was the most discredited intellectual of her generation, legitimating Reagan administration alliances with unsavory fascists and terrorists as necessary to beat Soviet totalitarianism. Her 1980s propaganda line was premised on a distinction between fascism and communist totalitarianism that argued that alliances with authoritarian or right-wing terrorist and",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the mediation of interethnic cohesion issues in Russian news and discussion programs, exploring the contradictions inherent in media consensus building in a post-totalitarian Russia beset by rising xenophobia. Operating under the theoretical umbrella of Laclauan hegemony modified for the post-Soviet context, it treats issues of framing, voice, structure of dialogue, and the role of the host. The article focuses on coverage of the ethnic tensions awakened in summer 2006 by the Kondopoga riots. In a case study of the political discussion show Vremena, it highlights the difficulties the state encounters in grounding the official tolerance program promoted by evening news bulletins in a consensus position on ethnic cohesion. Consequently, it argues that Vremena becomes both the site for an ill-managed outpouring of xenophobia and a platform for its host’s pseudo-liberalism. Finally, this dual problematic is mapped onto two competing elements in the show’s hybrid format. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Inspector Morse and the Business of Crime",
    "abstract": "Charlotte Brunsdon (1998) proposed a reading of recent crime fiction on British television that drew attention to the parallels between real-life concerns around policing and law and order and the generic “tropes” of fictional texts. “I am suggesting that this genre, in its many variants, works over and worries at the anxieties and exclusions of contemporary citizenship, of being British and living here, now” (Brunsdon 1998, 225). Brunsdon’s (1998) argument attempts to formulate a connection between fictional texts and the wider concerns of a media-literate public. The relationship between popular entertainment genres and the culture in which they are produced are too often eschewed in favor of either narrow analyses of texts or sociological investigation of the audience as if watching television offered no pleasures that were not wedded to a kind of social engineering. The analysis of television crime drama in the context of wider debates that encompass contemporary social and political issues seems to me to be a more useful starting point. However as Brunsdon (1998, 224) herself points out, we must be wary of constructing a hypothesis that offers “too simple a correspondence between crime and unrest on the streets, and crime on television.” I agree with this statement, and yet an approach that broadly interprets the generic productivity of television crime drama as mere evidence of the zeitgeist cannot do full justice to the complexity of television production at a time of enormous political and social upheaval. There is a respectable tradition of television analysis that foregrounds the text as a site of ideological contestation. The semiotics of television representation are well understood by research scholars and students engaged in the analysis of news media and documentary. The location and articulation of discourses pre-",

These shows feature predominantly female participants whose prescribed diet and exercise regimes promote physical ideals that are bound up with notions of discipline, desirability, and belonging, while claiming the vicarious authority of contemporary health discourses on obesity. This article argues that despite Canada’s reputation as a “socially healthy” nation, the gendered depiction of body weight and size on The Last 10 Pounds Bootcamp and Bulging Brides provides a contradictory picture of the treatment of women’s bodies in Canadian society. The article then considers the implications of possible alternative readings of these transformation narratives, which suggest that multiculturalism may be a lens through which more traditional views of gendered national identity can be subverted. </jats:p>",

It shows that the Japanese government's position toward satellite television has changed from “protecting and promoting NHK's interests” as noted in the case of Broadcasting Satellite analog service to “balancing the development of all satellite services.” It argues that the commercial terrestrial broadcasters' less enthusiastic attitude toward satellite television and the lack of clarity (in platform operations) in regulation have largely contributed to the stagnation of satellite television in Japan. </jats:p>",

In the context of deepening inequalities, the cementing of neoliberal rationality and the intensifying centrality of media and communication technologies in public and everyday life, connecting the two realms is a vital task. Drawing on The Sociological Imagination, I argue for and demonstrate the value of connecting what C. Wright Mills famously called “personal troubles” and “public issues of social structure” in the study of current media and narrative. Analysis of how contemporary cultural narratives furnish and condition our most intimate personal troubles highlights that our lives are shaped by social forces not of our own making. Yet, the intersection between media and cultural discourses and individuals’ sense-making of their experiences can open up possibilities for change and even resistance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article traces the evolution of what has become known as the business entertainment format on British television. Drawing on interviews with channel controllers, commissioners, and producers from across the BBC, Channel 4, and the independent sector, this research highlights a number of key individuals who have shaped the development of the business entertainment format and investigates some of the tensions that arise from combining entertainment values with more journalistic or educational approaches to factual television. While much work has looked at docusoaps and reality programming, this area of television output has remained largely unexamined by television scholars. The research argues that as the television industry has itself developed into a business, program makers have come to view themselves as (creative) entrepreneurs, thus raising the issue of whether the development off-screen of a more commercial, competitive, and entrepreneurial TV marketplace has affected the way the medium frames its on-screen engagement with business, entrepreneurship, risk, and wealth creation. </jats:p>",

Raising pertinent issues of race, class, and gender within the context of domestic service in postcolonial South Africa, Madam &amp; Eve follows the interconnected lives of Gwen Anderson, a well-to-do, white “Madam,” and Eve, a younger, working-class, and black “Maid.” Although directly confronting inequalities of race and class by integrating the perspectives of the maid and the employer, and undermining hierarchies of power through the unruliness of mimicry, the comedy confines racial resolution to the individual. By scapegoating individuals for their discriminatory attitudes, and effectively quelling the motivation for collective resistance, the show embodies the larger industrial trend of promoting profitability at the expense of progressive politics. </jats:p>",

In seven focus groups across the country, 52 people responsible for creating internet strategy and/or web content for nonprofit organizations participated. Claims of sweeping improvements in democratic participation through the internet were not supported. Almost no organizations utilized the technology for horizontal or vertical flows of communication, data communality, interactivity, or engaged participation. Furthermore, these nonprofit organizations believed the internet offered little democratizing power but paradoxically provided instant credibility. Those making communication decisions overwhelmingly performed in technical rather than strategic roles as they pushed their message out to the public without any regard to feedback or communication strategy. These individuals also believed the corporate model would drive future internet growth, although they rarely trained internet workers. Possible reasons for these findings and implications for nonprofit organizations are discussed. </jats:p>",

We argue that, as a technology industry and a cultural force, Silicon Valley’s practices and discourses reflect and produce particular social and economic investments in technology as a tool of empowerment and social change. Overall, the issue argues that the ethos of Silicon Valley privileges disruption over sustainability, sharing economies over union labor, personalized access over public health, data over meaning, and security over freedom. We analyze the ways this ethos extends beyond Silicon Valley itself and shapes the way we think about and act toward labor, security, sexuality, and health. As such, Silicon Valley’s technology products—as well as the way we think about them—affect the social, political, and economic conditions of everyday life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "At times, the unprecedented success of and rabid fan loyalty for The X-Files borders on the paranormal. Following FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully’s investigations of strange, often inexplicable crimes, The X-Files has outgrown its initial cult status and become a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Television audiences and critics alike are enthralled by the show’s innovative narrative strategies, wildly improbable story lines, stylish look, and attractive yet enigmatic lead characters (Littleton 1996; Rapping 1995; Reeves, Rodgers, and Epstein 1996). In turn, advertisers find the show’s upscale demographics irresistible: on the syndication market, media buyers pay top dollar for spot advertising in The X-Files (Mandese 1998). In the wake of the show’s popular success, The X-Files has generated the inevitable slew of product tie-ins, from books and soundtrack recordings to video games and CD-ROMs. Furthermore, The X-Files’ fan culture flourishes in cyberspace; chat lines, newsgroups, and hundreds of web sites provide fans—self-described X-philes—with an electronic forum to deliberate on plot twists and character development, debate the significance of program minutiae, and declare their fervent appreciation for the show’s stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (Clerc 1996). All the while, network television producers—a notoriously unimaginative lot—scramble in vain to clone The X-Files’ award-winning blend of police drama, science fiction, and horror in hopes of coming up with a hit (Emery 1997). Not surprisingly, then, explanations of the program’s cultural significance are as plentiful as The X-Files’ (in)famous conspiracy theories.",

It investigates the socio-cultural transactions that marginalized communities, especially women, from above-the-line professions have to navigate as they seek work opportunities on streaming services. Drawing on feminist production studies and media studies scholarships, the article discusses how gendered expectations become the norm in hiring creator labor. Through analysis of the data-set on the gender representation of key creative professionals in the Indian web series produced between 2014 and 2020, semi-structured interviews with creative professionals, and trade press literature, this research offers a nuanced understanding of how and why Indian on-screen dynamic representations and democratic entrepreneurial working structures do not eradicate gendered production norms. On the contrary, gendered interpretation of algorithmic data, the #metoo movement, and newer forms of sexism emerge alongside existing gendered production cultures to hamper the participation of women and minorities. </jats:p>",

Several objectives guide this analysis: first, studying an industry of great importance in the daily life of hundreds of millions of human beings; second, criticizing through a case study the a priori assumptions that globalization processes are both “homogenizing” and “deterritorialized.” The case of the telenovela industry shows that while certain differences are erased from the productions, new ones appear, and that not only do old territorial references continue to be meaningful but that new territorial references emerge (e.g., the city of Miami); third, discussing some tensions underlying the production of telenovelas as a sector of television and other entertainment industries, with particular attention to the tensions related to the production of markets and of representations of identities, especially to the construction of a transnational “Hispanic” identity. </jats:p>",

More specifically, it analyzes documents by key players in this debate during a period when the UK government proposed direct regulation of online harms. The study finds that policy documents construct the internet primarily as a “place” that is separate from offline experience; and to a smaller extent as a “tool” that can be abused if it falls in the wrong hands. The article argues that these constructions obscure any links between online and offline risk, and that they legitimize solutions which may not take into account the social roots of online harms. It also suggests that the discourses of policymakers and SNS companies differ in the degree of agency they attribute to users, indicating a discrepancy in their approaches as direct regulation is introduced in the UK. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite The Wire’s (HBO, 2002-2008) successful, interesting structural analysis of urban politics and problems, its (few) portrayals of African American mothers exhibit a view of black motherhood as irresponsible, irrational, and emasculating, a view that hearkens back to that of the Moynihan Report. In this article, I look at the fourth season of the show to examine how mothers’ desires are presented as being central to the negative outcomes their sons face, as well as unrelentingly and sexually pathological. This aspect has been paid little if any attention in the show’s overwhelmingly positive critical reception; I explore the show’s political economic network context and the effects of The Wire’s self-proclaimed “authenticity” in furthering this discourse among its viewers. The treatment of these characters, encouraging mothers to “help [themselves], but [not] take too much” imbricates The Wire in the discourses of personal responsibility and self-governance that undergird neoliberal regimes it critiques. </jats:p>",

Attending in particular to the ways legitimate participation is policed in this online forum, this article argues that the debate over the social potential of computer-mediated communication demands an attention to actual discursive practices and contexts in and through which online claims to community are articulated. Community must appear not as an already objectified standard against which novel social forms can be judged but a discursive context for the production of social identities and relations. As such, it is to the connections between textual productions of self and community and the online contexts or genres in which those categories are given life that we must turn in addressing the enormous affective investments in internet talk evident today. </jats:p>",

Together, these histories evidence how the widespread private ownership of mass-produced consumer goods has grown increasingly problematic from the standpoint of capitalist production—an understanding embedded in many, if not most, commercially available ebook texts and devices. In addition to showing how the category of “private property” is destabilized in relationship to ebooks and other digital technologies, this article strategizes how best to articulate a vital, progressive politics in light of changing material and economic conditions. </jats:p>",

This paper aims to offer a reflection on the datafication of intimacy, focusing on the social knowledge mobile dating apps produce on the building of close human connections. Drawing on interviews with young adults, I rely on an existential media analysis, exploring struggles with and around mobile dating apps. I argue that the datafication of intimacy is a particular way of experiencing intimacy, going beyond the socio-technological functions of mobile dating apps. I show how the datafication of intimacy is a mathematical mind-set characterized by commercialization and rationalization (predictability, controllability, convenience), building a relationship of interdependency between a data economy and intimacy. I conclude how this interdependency is an emotionally experienced, existential burden for people, it demands reflection on how data-driven technology has become environmental to building close human connections. </jats:p>",

Fandom has traditionally been thought of as progressive, but this has been limited and limiting. Moreover, considerations of the relationship between politics and fandom have especially focused on democratization and new media–enabled participation. However, it is important to expand our understanding to other aspects of politicization. This introduction situates the issue in relation to foundations of fan studies, examinations of political fandom and fannish politics, and growing recognition of inequality and conflict in fandom. These considerations are important in an era in which fandoms have increasingly overtly embraced reactionary politics and reactionary politics has increasingly taken fannish forms. It is this intersection of the reactionary and the fannish that this special issue seeks to unravel. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although it often goes unremarked, digital screens are a key point of commonality across the many different transnational renditions of the story of violence against girls and women found in contemporary TV crime drama. The Fall (United Kingdom, 2013–) and Top of the Lake (United Kingdom/Australia/New Zealand/United States, 2013–) are two striking examples of TV crime dramas that frame their self-conscious interrogation of rape culture through digital media. Considering the mutual imbrication of feminist politics and the deployment of new media technologies on these shows, this essay considers how the digital interface functions as a way of mediating viewer response to violence against women. Resisting a reading of digital technologies as either inherently oppressive or inherently liberatory, the essay explores how these TV series navigate the tension between the simultaneous violence of new media and its investigative/feminist/affective potential. </jats:p>",

Whereas, in the past, content production has been restricted to professional producers, digital media platforms have drastically altered the landscape of content production in India. Through in-depth interviews of ten online content creators, the article describes motivations of online content creation in India. Discussion themes include professional activities, identity construction of creators, and quasi-corporate structures that are taking root in the democratized digital spaces in India. In doing so, the article challenges the notion of creators on social media as mere “amateurs” or “UGC” (user-generated content). Conclusions from this study suggest future research should take a more holistic approach to studying online content creators rather than classifying creators on the basis of platform affordances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper calls for an epistemic disobedience in privacy studies by decolonizing the approach to privacy. As technology companies expand their reach worldwide, the notion of privacy continues to be viewed through an ethnocentric lens. It disproportionately draws from empirical evidence on Western-based, white, and middle-class demographics. We need to break away from the market-driven neoliberal ideology and the Development paradigm long dictating media studies if we are to foster more inclusive privacy policies. This paper offers a set of propositions to de-naturalize and estrange data from demographic generalizations and cultural assumptions, namely, (1) predicting privacy harms through the history of social practice, (2) recalibrating the core-periphery as evolving and moving targets, and (3) de-exoticizing “natives” by situating privacy in ludic digital cultures.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While data is increasingly proffered as the resource that unlocks the promises of the digitalized world, for underprivileged individuals and communities, instead of fulfilled promises, datafication means additional marginalization. Examining these forms of marginalization, this article considers how technological advancements come with ability expectations, and highlights the exclusion and discrimination of disadvantaged segments of the population that result from failing to meet digital ability expectations and reach prescribed data norms. Drawing from critical disability scholarship, we introduce the notions of data ableism and data disablism, which encapsulate privileged ability expectations pertaining to data production and the resulting forms of exclusion that are prevalent in automated societies. Underlining the intersectional nature of data ableism, we discern its two main mechanisms, namely data (in)visibility and data (un)desirability, and document the role of free market ideology in producing and upholding data ableism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an age in which social networking sites have become the preferred way of socializing online, the question of how to think about the contours of friendship in and through these mediated spaces becomes all the more important. In contrast to much existing research on online friendship, this article takes on a software-sensitive approach. Through a close reading of various sociotechnical processes in which friendship is activated on Facebook (i.e., registering, making a profile, finding friends, communicating, etc.), this article suggests that friendships online need to be understood as a gathering of heterogeneous elements that include both humans and nonhumans. Moreover, this article attempts to show how the traditional notion of friendship as something created between equals and free of structural constraints does not apply to the realm of social networking sites, where software increasingly assists users in making certain choices about who will and who will not be their friends. </jats:p>",

The ASMR community struggles with popular perception of the transgressive nature of their shared pleasure, which by its public nature is what Berlant and Warner call “nonstandard intimacy.” In this paper, I investigate the ways in which the whisper works on the viewer through YouTube, drawing on sonic associations between private domestic space and care, as well as the problematic distance of the YouTube-mediated intimate experience that troubles the Whisper Community’s pursuit of pleasure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media discourses—both independent journalism and advertisements—during the 2014 general election in India articulated a gendered focus on a significant aspect of Narendra Modi’s public representation relating to his forceful masculinity. His election campaign—as well as popular discourse that surrounded his pre-prime ministerial persona—significantly focused upon his “manly” leadership style: efficient, dynamic, potent, and capable of removing all policy-roadblocks through sheer force of personality. In this, he is implicitly counterpoised to Manmohan Singh, his “impotent” predecessor, and more generally against an “effeminate” Indian type who is unable to strike hard at both external enemies (Pakistan and China, say) and internal threats (“Muslim terrorists,” most obviously). His “56-inch chest”—able and willing to bear the harshest burdens in the service of “Mother India”—was a frequently invoked metaphor in the election. This article suggests that Modi-masculinity is a reformulation of older versions of Indian masculinist discourse in a time of consumerist modernity and that the media has played a significant role in the re-making. The discussion suggests that Modi-masculinity stands at the juncture of new consumerist aspirations, the politics of “Indian traditions” and gender, and the re-fashioning of masculine identities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2020, hyperpop artist Ashnikko released a remix of her single “Daisy” with virtual idol Hatsune Miku. While the rights to any commercial use of Miku’s voice and likeness are owned by Crypton Future Media, anyone with Vocaloid software can produce songs for her. While scholars have found that fan-produced performances are foundational to Miku’s development as a performer, less attention has been paid to how intercultural commercial ventures have shaped her identity. This paper employs a textual analysis of the “Daisy 2.0” music video and an observation of comments posted on the video’s YouTube upload to demonstrate how the video’s narrative and its surrounding audience discourse both limit and expand Miku’s cultural signifiers. While fluid approaches to identity afforded by the hyperpop and virtual idol subcultures hold potential to liberate these performers from hegemonic notions of gender and sexuality, cultural and commercial constraints still loom large in these spaces. </jats:p>",

Based on a case study of “YG Future Strategy Office” co-produced by YG Entertainment and Netflix, it examines how various expectations of both companies are embedded in this series. On one hand, YG considers co-production as a means of promoting its artists for the global market which otherwise cannot be produced through pre-existing broadcasters. On the other hand, Netflix expects such co-productions to target the Asian market so that it can respond to the entry of incumbent media moguls into the SVOD market. While such co-productions seem to benefit both global platforms and local producers on the surface, however, this relationship may result in deteriorating the position of local actors as potential subcontractors considering the importance of distribution in the mediascape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Between 2019 and 2020, three streaming series premiered on Netflix, Apple+, and BBC One/HBO: Unbelievable, The Morning Show, and I May Destroy You. All three narratively centered sexual violence against women, foregrounding the experiences of the women characters, and were produced within the context of the global movement #MeToo. We offer a conjunctural analysis of these programs within what we call the economy of believability, arguing that these shows should be read as fictionalized real-world phenomena, distilled for television but nonetheless reflective of deeply sedimented assumptions about women, sexual violence, and believability. We argue that the programs examine the struggle for belief as it manifests in three key forms of labor: (1) the affective performance of believability; (2) payment of the costs of believability; (3) entrepreneurially attaching value to believability. Our analysis positions the discourses and narratives of these shows—and of the real-world contexts they speak to—within the broader frame of a mediated, intersectional economy of believability, where contestations about how and when women may be believed play out in and through struggles over visibility, authenticity, and recognition. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Block Booking Migrates to Television",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the recent Hollywood studio practice of distributing international television programming via a bundling strategy, labeled an output deal, and situates the practice as a further iteration of the early Hollywood system of “block booking” feature films. Using Germany as a case study, the authors looks at how Hollywood compelled German distributors and broadcasters to take on large packages of television programming that combined highly desirable blockbuster motion pictures with far less valuable television series. Just as the original practice of block booking exerted financial pressure on theater owners, the burdensome practice of television programming output deals led to a major upheaval in Germany’s entertainment industry, driving the second largest German media company into bankruptcy. The international television output deal persists, however, because transnational media regulations cannot hope to marshal the enforcement powers of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Supreme Court. Market forces within the global entertainment industry have done little to curtail the expansion of global media conglomerates. And yet, even as global power dynamics remain essentially the same, with Hollywood retaining its primary position, this case study points to rising instabilities that threaten an American-dominated international media economy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Y2K bug was a global media event of the twentieth century, only to fade from view after an anticlimactic change of millennium. This article argues that a reexamination of the text of the Y2K bug illuminates the contemporary cultural construction of value in information and networking technologies. Through the examination of a broad range of media reports and articles, this article illustrates how a hegemonic discourse is creating scales of value that have a profound impact on resource allocation. However, the Y2K bug also illustrates how this discourse is subject to its own gaps in meaning, or internal dissociations, as well as to a variety of creative external attacks, including culture jamming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws on the work of Foucault to construct a history of the invention and introduction of media studies in the Australian context through the analysis of two of its epistemological regimes: audience studies and media production. In so doing, it challenges contemporary assumptions about the subject's foundations, purposes, and achievements, most significant the belief that the story of media education is a story of seamless progress marked by the movement from a protectionist philosophy to one that approaches the media as a representational system. Questioning the normative, taken-for-granted history and conduct of a school subject does not necessarily mean that a subject will, or should, be changed. However, there exists at least the opportunity to bring about change when current practices can be located and understood in terms of historical contingency rather than the more common change and reform rhetoric of curriculum developers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Malthus continues to haunt our future as the principle of population continues to define who we are in the present. The governing of procreation through the building of the population apparatus functions as an “othering machine” that differentiates each one of us around the norms and social categories of modern, healthy, and white. Although contributing to the differentiation of populations by allowing the act of reproduction to function as a form of cultural distinction, the population apparatus also territorializes us into a geography of scarcity. To generate forms of mobility that promise an escape from this geography of scarcity, the population apparatus offers the government of our reproductive behaviors. The danger made possible by the population apparatus is that this very promise of mobility works to reproduce the so-called satanic geography of a Malthusian world by coding some populations as worthy of prosperity while pushing others into ever more brutal forms of scarcity with nothing more than a contraceptive.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the political-economic “prehistory” of the “synthespian” by tracing the emergence of the rock and roll cartoon The Archies (1968—78) from the ashes of the live-action sitcom The Monkees (1966—68) through the career of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner. Drawing on original interviews with the producers of The Archies, it argues that early experiments in “fixing” variable entertainment capital through the organization of divisions of nonproprietary authorship contributed to the development of rights-free “virtual labor.” This analysis brings to light the logics and politics that are never far from “purely technical” advances in entertainment production. The trajectory of Don Kirshner brings into relief historical convergences of efficiencies and rationalizations in different but related fields that were fortuitous for entertainment capital in that they allowed the solution of labor problems—the “agency costs” posed by singing, dancing, instrument-playing, rights-bearing persons—with “virtual laborers,” the visible, audible, and agency-free avatars of hidden divisions of creative labor. </jats:p>",

He studies the approaches to the idea of culture in different sections of the dailies—cultural, economic, social—and how they relate to local, national, and global processes. According to him, written press is one place in which dissemination of cultural issues becomes more eloquent. By analyzing the written press, it is possible to note a reformulation of the concept of culture associated with its new role in socioeconomic and political processes. This expansion of culture does not take place in the same way in different sections of the dailies. The hypothesis explored is that differences stem from ways in which the local, national, and global are organized in diverse cultural fields. In so doing, we can better understand the aspects in which Mexican society is globalizing. </jats:p>",

Through a history and analysis of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard, this article argues that the political presuppositions of engineers shaped the representational capacities of television for nearly sixty years. In particular, the test images used to develop a perceptually satisfying image evince assumptions of a leisurely and white United States as the “normal” subject matter of television. In this way, test materials coalesce abstract assumptions about the normal and the exceptional at the level of both form and content. This article concludes that NTSC color served as a model for how normed cultural sensibilities about image quality, perceptual ability, and the representational imaginary have been built into subsequent technical standards.

    "title": "“Alex, DO NOT BACKPEDAL ON SANDY HOOK!”: Reactionary Fandom, Cancel Culture, and the Possibility of ‘Audience Capture’ on YouTube",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> “Cancel culture” has gained tremendous attention in contemporary political discourse. On platforms like YouTube, reactionary ideological entrepreneurs often employ what Ng terms second-order discourses on cancel culture, that is, portraying call-out practices such as shaming public figures as left-wing censorship efforts stifling free speech. This article argues that such call-out practices, generally ascribed to progressive communities, also occur internally within reactionary communities where fans hold ideological entrepreneurs accountable for adhering to potentially extreme political canons. Adopting a fan studies perspective, this exploratory investigation used “close” and “distant” readings on 1.8 million comments from the now-canceled “The Alex Jones Channel” on YouTube (2017–2018). Focusing on Jones’ recantation of the “Sandy Hook Hoax,” the authors show that, akin to traditional fandom conceptions, radical audiences engaged in call-out practices demanding “character” and “narrative” fidelity. This contribution, theorized as “audience capture,” emphasizes the bottom-up efforts of audiences to maintain the radical views of ideological entrepreneurs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Anxiety, depression, burnout and impostor syndrome are frequently reported among those who work in the videogame industry, and are exacerbated among independents and freelancers. The article draws on interviews with four London-based independent videogame developers who have engaged with the production of videogames about mental health. The article argues that conceiving, producing and releasing these games is understood by their makers as a strategy to establish relations with consumers, participants and other developers that could break the invisible barriers that prevent dialogs around mental wellness. More than being concerned with the outcome of their work or its commercial success, developers seek relations with other game workers and players through the process of making, researching, testing, and showing their videogames. The development of videogames about mental health is interpreted by the participants as facilitating exchanges of autobiographical experiences that are otherwise regulated by the norms of professional networking. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article uses the “Celebrities Read Mean Tweets” segment on late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a case study in how television can remediate social media to maintain its dominant position in entertainment. The incorporation of tweets into television appears to demonstrate the power social media has over broadcast media, but a careful study reveals that television and film celebrities use television appearances to denounce “mean tweets” as an example of frenzied and cacophonous social media. Drawing on the history of the televised celebrity roast, I argue that contemporary roasts resemble Internet trolling while segments like “Celebrities Read Mean Tweets” embody the spirit of historical roasts by granting celebrities the opportunity to laugh at jokes about themselves. Thus, the segment reiterates the hierarchical position of “old media”: television as a source of comfort and clarity, and the Hollywood celebrity as the epicenter of culture. </jats:p>",

Such emphasis on short-term stock movement was called into question during the 2008 global financial crisis. However, detailed analysis demonstrates that The Closing Bell did not alter course. I argue that its ongoing focus on incremental movement has worked affectively to shore up a masculinized culture of finance during a period that demanded structural reform. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter highlights, platforms’ affordances extend further than UI choices and content formats emphasized. Extant work addresses that political perspectives are implicated in the affordances of platforms; however, the notion of “ideology as/of affordance” requires more scholarly attention, namely, from a Black feminist position which grapples with the raced and gendered dimensions of how such shaping of affordances is understood and experienced in digital contexts. A Black feminist analysis offers a critical intervention that examines the dynamics between ideology, digital culture, and relational experiences of autonomy. Thus, our article outlines how “ideology as/of affordance” is a helpful intervention for illuminating the power relations by which both “cancel culture” and “platform affordances” are defined. Specifically, we explicate how white supremacist ideology underpins platform affordances, which in turn shape who is “canceled,” and consider the key connections and disconnections between them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media events theory, developed by Katz and Dayan in the 1990s, has become one of the most well-known and cited theories in communications research, well-aligned with television’s central role in social life at the time. However, three decades since, in which events have spilled over to other media spaces thereby reshaping the theory’s underlying concept, sports broadcasts have remained a consistently stable source of media events. Although the original theory addressed media events as a rare phenomenon of a distinct, well-defined nature, the current study describes sports events that globally now constitute a sequence of routine mega media events that effectively function as a key anchor in traditional television programing. In the era of multiple screens, content abundance, and flexible viewing times, media events have become classic linear television’s programing core—instrumental in retaining its viewer base and in exploiting television’s advantage over rival screens and content. As a result, sport has become television’s main resource, thus indicating a need to revise elements of media theory. This study suggests several revision possibilities and what they entail methodologically for researchers. </jats:p>",

By centring the narrative around the emotional life of a woman in her 60s, the show offers older femininity as a site for discussing social and political changes that have occurred in the USA in the aftermath of the election of Donald Trump. Through a close analysis of the four seasons that were released before the Covid-19 pandemic, this article maps the emotional journey of Diane Lockheart through her personal, economic, and political crises, showing how different emotions are connected with Diane’s engagement—and at times disengagement—with politics. Ultimately, the article contributes to the field of feminist cultural studies by exploring the way The Good Fight offers female anger in older age as key to feminist engagement and political change. </jats:p>",

This paper asks whether new forms of complex motherhood, and the means presented to mothers for coping with them in the digital age, should be conceived of as further unpaid labor that sits on top of old forms of exploitation. As mothers increasingly become digital reproductive laborers, the family home is becoming a public and highly economized zone: a workhouse for both standard employers and emerging parties who designate themselves as merely providing online services. In contrast to the frequently posited thesis that mothers are only indirectly drawn into the circuit of capital, this paper argues that the current situation creates the “mother commodity”: a being whose social reproductive labor time is supercommodified via the normative addition of “audience commodity” labor duties. </jats:p>",

    "title": "“Food Porn” as Postfeminist Play",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The styling and online circulation of food photography has become a phenomenon endemic to social media. In this article, I explore this digital “food porn” within the feminized space of food blogs and contextualize it within a postfeminist culture rife with contradictions about women’s bodies, consumption, and sexuality. Drawing on postfeminist and feminist corporeal theory, I historicize the longstanding associations between food and the female body, eating and sex. I then analyze digital “food porn” as a form of women’s media production that draws on conventional representations of the female body in pornography, fashion, and popular culture. It is these qualities that distinguish digital “food porn” from “food porn” on other media platforms, and allow it to offer useful insights into the postfeminist subject’s construction of digital femininity. I maintain that digital “food porn” can be read as a playful, pleasurable, and entrepreneurial response to postfeminist contradictions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The present study aims to examine the pluralistic potential of reality shows, which might allow minorities to shape the program's script and to gain recognition for their particularistic identities. For this purpose, two prime-time reality shows were chosen— The Ambassador and Seeking a Leader—broadcast in Israel in 2005. The analysis of the programs included identification and deconstruction of their metanarratives and exposure of several mechanisms of stigmatization and othering used against minorities. In addition, the authors analyzed the tactics utilized by minorities to maneuver the script and steps taken by the majority to maintain its cultural dominance. The research reveals that the ostensibly pluralistic nature of reality shows is limited a priori by the hegemonic forces. Although the hegemonic discourse in reality shows is highly sophisticated and disguised, the sense of equality and pluralism that these programs inspire constitutes an even more powerful mechanism of exclusion and cultural domination. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on fifteen months of fieldwork with television and new media producers at the transnational “European” public television channel, ARTE, this article describes the ways in which staff are in the midst of reimagining the channel’s “audience.” On the one hand, staff continue to understand television audiences as primarily national, and only nationally coherent; on the other hand, ARTE’s audiences are understood to be fast-dispersing as a result of new broadcast technologies and streaming web content. To reach dispersing audiences, and to better articulate its programming across borders, ARTE has partly shifted its efforts toward regathering its public through international events, festivals, and other off-screen engagements where its viewers become differently coherent and knowable. The article argues that such a strategy re-emplaces “fans and followers” of ARTE in ways that might foster collective identifications in ways that may be literally replacing those engendered by traditional public broadcasting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article traces the history of in-vision announcers in public service television in Flanders and Norway from the public service monopoly days over the multichannel to the postlinear television landscape. The title “Hello Ladies” refers to the everyday nickname for in-vision announcers, used by particularly Norwegian viewers. It analyzes the shifting role of in-vision announcers focusing on four key functions: creating flow, personalization, live-ness, and branding, evaluating their respective relevance—and that of linear, general interest, public service television—in the move to a postlinear television context dominated by digitization, convergence, and trends to time shifting and on-demand services. Although the functions of guide and flow, personalization, and live-ness seem to have taken a backseat, in-vision announcers remain central as part of the unique selling proposition of television branding, indicating the continued importance not just of in-vision announcers but of (public service broadcasting) linear, general interest television channels. </jats:p>",

Focusing on the TV drama Provincial Party Secretary as a case study, the author argues that main melody TV drama reconstructs socialist TV drama with a Hollywoodized creative strategy through which the didactic tradition of socialist TV drama has been transformed from direct propaganda to ideological persuasion. The development of main melody TV dramas since the 1990s indicates that a soft and repackaged propagandistic model has been developed in contemporary Chinese television with the aim of revitalizing the Party’s ideological control over society. </jats:p>",

By showing the hosts engaging in timeconsuming, often clumsy food preparation, the show pokes fun at the flawless professionalism of television cooks, reemphasizing the chaos of the domestic kitchen. Based on viewer letters, textual analysis, and ethnographic participant/observation, this article discusses the way Cookin’ Cheap makes a place for the viewer in the text, reappropriating strategies of earlier television. When the show’s hosts impersonate their aunts in unconvincing drag, they also emphasize the passing of tradition from matriarchal figures to an underexamined form of masculinity: the feminized Southern working-class man. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that the majority of the channels offered limited coverage of the demonstration. The television narratives also minimized the role of citizen agency in the achievement of goals through democratic participation and displayed a depoliticized account. The author argues that the coverage of the march and its consequences resulted in a masking of citizens’ political engagement; far from promoting an understanding of why the march was so massively supported, it instead presented a story on politicians’ strategy. The author relates this case to a wider trend of media coverage of citizens’ protests in a Western, post-democratic context. </jats:p>",

However, its import to American television beginning in 1968 and its reimagining as an AMC miniseries in 2009 demonstrates that the program’s endurance has as much to do with its viability as a commodity as its value as a canonic cult text. By tracing the industrial and press discourses around various incarnations of The Prisoner on American television, this article argues that show’s cult status has been perpetuated, in large part, by the industrial logic, marketing, and branding that has structured the rebroadcast and reimagining of the series. As such, this article builds on studies of cult television by examining how such discourses may be co-opted by the industry, repackaged as a commodity, and sold to advertisers and audiences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Lure of Cultural Authenticity: Netflix and Speculative Koreanness in the Global Media Market",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite Netflix’s status as a dominant global streaming service, it is irrefutable that the platform has facilitated the circulation of media content from different national markets to its subscribers around the world. This increased circulation has been accompanied by the platforms’ exploration of local cultures for global audiences. Specifically, Netflix has sought to represent and repackage local cultures in allegedly “authentic” ways. Drawing on a critical analysis of Netflix’s industry discourses, interviews with Korean content creators, and a textual analysis of the original Korean series Squid Game (2021–present), the article explores how Netflix formulates and disseminates its lore of cultural authenticity as a distinct brand to enhance its international presence. We argue that Netflix’s branding of original Korean series as culturally authentic, further grounded in a particular mode of portraying Korean culture for imagined global (non-Korean) audiences, involves representational practices of what we refer to as speculative Koreanness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the role of Spanish television in preparing children and young people for life in a society moving toward democracy after decades of authoritarian rule. The Spanish government, which had exceptional power over TVE, the country’s sole television network, hoped to use this medium to instill democratic values and convey a sense of normality. However, findings show that TVE’s new agenda was hampered by its programming requirements, responsibility as a monopoly to cater to the entire population, failure to understand the preferences and needs of young audiences, and emphasis on U.S. family-oriented series. Children’s and young people’s programming during the transition was a mix of innovative content and reactionary programs typical of the Franco era. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> New Zealand’s first primetime animated program, bro’Town, ran successfully for five seasons between 2004 and 2009. Described by its creators as a “modern-day non-PC satire,” bro’Town focuses on five New Zealand teenagers of Samoan and Maori ethnicities growing up in Auckland. While the program was promoted as “ The Simpsons of the South Pacific,” its audience, critics, and politicians have celebrated it as a twenty-first-century New Zealand creative success story. This article explores the historical, cultural, and economic forces that have shaped bro’Town in the context of the debates on media globalization using the framework of hybridity as “the cultural logic of globalization” as well as the framework of global television formats. The authors suggest that bro’Town represents a complex case of television program adaptation and provides a unique case study to examine the multilayered nature of contemporary hybrid cultural forms moving beyond the simplistic local—global dyad. </jats:p>",

The first of these was an earthquake in 2010, and the second was the arrival in 2014 of the first Turkish soap opera to the screens of Chilean viewers. In this article, I situate these two events within an historical analysis of Chile’s movement to a postnetwork era. This digital transition has been marked by a much greater transnationalization both in property structure and in the viewing habits of the Chilean public. Although Chile could be considered an outlier in Latin America in terms of its digital access, my analysis emphasizes the importance of highlighting points of individual variation within the region to disaggregate regional-level conclusions regarding the state of “Latin American” television. </jats:p>",

The article introduces the hip/square dialectic and explores the sociocultural construction of nerds vis-à-vis the hip/square dialectic as commodity. The article historicizes the hip/square construct of the nerd or geek on television, assesses claims about the emergence of geek chic, and introduces three reality television case studies: Tranji and reality TV nerd dancing; William Hung, American Idol loser; and the Beauty and the Geek program. At issue is the political-economic factors in the production and circulation of the nerd commodity and the racial and gendered or sexualized politics of the televisual nerd discourses and performances.</jats:p>",

The infamous Dinanath Batra who used the laws to ensure that Penguin withdrew Wendy Doniger’s book is symptomatic of a phenomenon in which laws are used horizontally against other citizens. In the aftermath of the BJP’s electoral victory, we have already seen the law being used against individuals who have been critical of Narendra Modi.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the struggle for cultural authority that occurred in critical and industrial discourse surrounding the so-called “dramedies” that premiered on network television in 1987, The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd (NBC, 1987—88, Lifetime, 1989—91), Frank’s Place (CBS, 1987—88), The Slap Maxwell Story (ABC, 1987—88), and Hooperman (ABC, 1987—89). It situates that dispute in the broader trends of the changing practices and understandings of “quality television” and the erosion of network power.The article builds on the existing scholarship on early eighties quality with a consideration of later challenges to this critical-industrial construct and specific attention to the imperatives and tactics that shaped various parties’ attempts to achieve discursive dominance. A close examination of the attempted linkage of dramedy to established markers of quality demonstrates both the contingency of the seemingly stable discourse of quality television and its reflexive resistance to change. </jats:p>",

A series of focus group discussions with viewers of different social backgrounds, concentrating on the political messages of the telenovela, reveals the complexity of audience responses. The author finds that the telenovela played an “orientation role,” providing interpretive frames that were often applied by viewers to current political issues. Even though they are frequently looked at with disdain, telenovelas have become key to understanding the dilemmas and perspectives of democratic politics in Brazil. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the past decade, the websites of Thai tourist agencies have expanded their offerings to include medical tourism, and medical tourism online has experienced dramatic changes in packaging and marketing. These shifts suggest a move from Thai-style surgical offerings that were defined as primarily cosmetic to tourist-package style sex/gender-related surgeries under the category of sexual reassignment surgery (SRS). The existence of these websites and the changes in the promotion of sex/gender-related medical tourism over time reveal nuanced interplay of discontinuous sex/gender regimes. By examining the changes on a single website during an eighteen-month period, I indicate larger trends in the Thai medical tourism industry online that I have collected in a three-year period. “Trans” theory—translation, transnational, transsexual, transactional, and transitive—is the framework from which I describe these dynamic, discontinuous, dialogic transitions. </jats:p>",

Ubiquitous smartphone use proffers a managerial relationship between subject and device, such that smartphone culture becomes necessary for navigating between different spheres of life. Furthermore, as smartphones occupy a greater role in public life, they have also begun to shape the creation of story in media narratives. I argue that smartphones have become a tool of narrative management for network drama not unlike the ways in which they govern everyday life. TGW’s narrative form and genre—a unique negotiation between episodic procedural and serial melodrama—successfully mirror the management of routine informational and emotional flows, structuring narrative and spectatorial habits while also accommodating for technology’s glitches. </jats:p>",

This study focuses on the independent television production sector, which epitomizes current changes in the Korean cultural industry in terms of greater global integration, increasing commercialization, and digitalization. Qualitative research results illustrate that the “digitalized flexible production regime” of independent production companies exacerbates working conditions and job insecurity. Under this regime, workers see themselves as “creators” and “freelancers” for only a limited period. Findings suggest that an antagonistic relation exists between “the workers’ passion for more creative and liberal work” and “the survival of the industry” within Korean broadcasting. </jats:p>",

She analyzes the complex forms of interaction between journalists, different sectors of society, and armed actors (the guerrillas, the paramilitary, and the armed forces) that go far beyond the media itself and involve different symbolic, political, and military processes in the struggle of hegemony over information. The author calls for a return to a type of journalism that allows for the making of critical connections between events, social actors, and political contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> RuPaul’s Drag Race (Logo TV, 2009–present) tethers drag culture to pop stardom by structuring challenges around host RuPaul’s recording career and eliminations around lip sync contests that promote guest judges’ music. By its fourth season, it began substantially rewarding contestants for using pop music to showcase their own branding and musical skills. By analyzing the program and its surrounding industry discourse, this article identifies a Season 4 infomercial challenge promoting RuPaul’s catalogue as a turning point in the program’s relationship to pop music due to its winner’s ascent as a recording artist. As a result, many white and light-skinned cast members were far better able to mount their own recording careers after appearing on the program than their counterparts of color. Thus, this article argues that Drag Race uses the recording industry as a site for contestants’ professionalization that reinforces pop music’s and reality programming’s entrenched neoliberalism and post-racial politics. </jats:p>",

The analysis draws from observation of Upfront presentations, triangulated with analysis of trade press articles and interviews, to present a comprehensive examination of this component of promotion within the circuit of cultural production. Examining the promotional activities that occur before programming reaches audiences illustrates the dual client nature of the United States commercial television industry, and the different strategies evinced indicate the need to theorize internal promotion distinctly from the promotion of texts and networks to audiences. Additionally, the variant promotional strategies used by different networks in this internal venue reveal institutional priorities in audience composition and brand differentiation among networks. </jats:p>",

In seeking to understand how these shows evolved, under authoritarian rule, to the point where they could host such moments, this article explores the impact of online media on their evolution. Taking account of studies into online–offline media interaction in democratic and nondemocratic settings, the research traces processes behind the rise of oppositional talk on Egyptian television during three consecutive periods. It finds that these had as much to do with particularities of national politics and economics as with transnational digital networks. Indeed, it was the restrictions on mainstream media that pushed political communication online, which validates Kraidy’s theory of hypermedia space, where multiple points of access to digital media are seen to facilitate contestation of the status quo. Yet, unequal offline power relations continue to shape these access points. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the representations of white ethnic identities in Non-Summit, a Korean television show, to disaggregate the generalized perception of homogenous whiteness and argue for a dialectical construction of white power and domination in Korea. Specifically, it focuses on representations of Russianness in Non-Summit in relation to the US Americanness, contextualized within post-Cold War and globalized cultural politics prevalent in Korea. Employing critical textual analysis, this study analyzes verbal and visual discourses constructing Russianness and US Americanness in Non-Summit. The findings suggest, in Non-Summit, Russianness is represented as ideologically and culturally deprived, and it appears as a dispossessed white identity that does not earn hegemony like US Americanness. At times, the marginal representations of Russianness seem to weaken the power of whiteness operating in and through the show. However, an encompassing global white supremacy remains intact when Russianness is fit into the category of whiteness through a re-whitening process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the passing in 2014 of the twentieth anniversary of its debut episode, the iconic millennial sitcom Friends retains a rare cultural currency and remains a crucial reference point for understanding the concerns of Generation X. This special issue, therefore, interrogates the contemporary and historical significance of Friends as a popular sitcom that reflected and obfuscated American fin de siècle anxieties at the time, and considers the lasting resonance of its cultural afterlife. Its abiding impact as millennial cultural touchstone can be seen in its persistent ability to find new generations of viewers and its manifest influence on myriad extratextual phenomena. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the ways in which Irish working-class teenagers utilize national and global discourses in assessing the quality and entertainment value of television talent shows. Viewers’ preference for British shows over the nationally produced show, You’re a Star, indicates an identification with “spaces of celebrity” that are simultaneously geographic/geopolitical spaces with centers such as Britain and the USA and peripheries like Ireland. Viewers valorization of the global and denigration of the national can be understood, it is suggested, in terms of the historical development of urban workingclass sub-cultural taste which demonstrated a preference for ‘foreign’ entertainment and a distaste for aspects of ‘official’ national culture. Arguing against the idea of talent shows creating a national “imagined community”, the author calls for greater attention to be paid to how the differential positioning of audiences within national cultures influences sub-cultural taste and, in turn, reception of specific media texts. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it introduces the notion of “cultural citizenship” into the theoretical discussion and empirical pursuits. In exploring how this concept comes to play at the intersection of television and new media, this article sheds light on the continuing debate within the theoretical camp of “cultural citizenship,” expands the notion of “political talk” in current studies of media and democracy, and pushes the field from normative and instrumental limitations toward a more culturally rich and comprehensive direction. I systematically examine public discourses surrounding a popular talent show in China’s cyberspace and show the connection between nonpolitical media experiences and political expressions. In doing so, I also discuss the internet’s unique potential in lending voice to ordinary Chinese citizens outside the mainstream media. </jats:p>",

Emanating from these media are digital discourses through which young girls are learning not only how to move their bodies appropriately but also how the have to be to fit the mould and “join the squad.” As a powerful and pervasive public pedagogy, “We Cheer” (re)establishes the position of the neoliberal girl norm, that is, a girl whose body is representative of her being (heterosexy) middle class, white, and a young consumer—citizen. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the representations and tonal qualities of British “structured reality” programming. Focusing on The Only Way Is Essex and Made in Chelsea, it investigates their glocalizing of the model established by MTV’s Laguna Beach and The Hills. It argues that while they blur boundaries between docusoap, drama, and soap opera, the British programs also recognize and foreground issues of construction for their reality TV-literate youth audience. It suggests the programs play a key role in their respective channel identities and the ideologies of British youth television, connecting to larger issues of class, gender, and taste. This is articulated through their regional and classed femininities, with the article exploring how the programs draw on classed ideologies surrounding “natural” and “excessive” femininities and of the role of this in their engagement with construction and camp play. This play contributes to the tonal shift offered by the British programs, mixing the melodrama of the MTV programs with a knowing, at times comic edge that can tip into mockery. In doing so, the programs offer their audience a combination of performative self-awareness and emotional realism that situates them clearly within British youth television. </jats:p>",

I argue that the “insulated precarity” of Friends’ protagonists, and their seeming nonchalance about work, marks out the show as a prime example of a Clinton-era “boom” text and as a one that struggles with rising anxiety inherent in neoliberalism. I focus on the role of Chandler Bing, who quits his nondescript office job to follow his dreams, before realizing he does not know what they are, and ends up in advertising. I argue that while Friends’ self-reflexive comic mode facilitates sympathetic treatment of Chandler as a “New Man,” his perpetual crisis of masculinity (his infertility, his periodic reliance on his wife’s income, and the constant questioning of his sexuality) is related to the lack of purpose in his career and, thus, the changing work culture that characterized the period. </jats:p>",

The article presents a multimodal analysis of design in SMS-based television formats, a discourse analysis of their roles and interactions, and a typology of their degrees of interactivity. It also draws on interviews with industry decision-makers and on relevant statistics. The article develops a conceptual interest, introducing some neologisms to account for the original textual features of SMS-based television. Its designs are analyzed using a concept of “zones,” while its roles and interactions are seen as linking these zones by means of “axes.” In closing it is suggested that SMS-based television presents us with interactivity as a realized, albeit mundane, fact rather than as a future promise. </jats:p>",

Bloggers and their communities use satellite and enclave spaces to explore black representation in art and media, black feminism, and class consciousness. I use critical technocultural discourse analysis to explore the affordances and constraints of blogs in creating alternate publics for African Americans online. Capitalizing on African American oral culture, black bloggers can use spaces technically accessible to the masses, yet keep discourse hidden, intentionally opting out of engagement with the dominant group. Expanding sites of inquiry and bringing a historical understanding of offline patterns of communication allow for more rich, useful, and culturally responsible research into the online communication African Americans and other marginalized communities. </jats:p>",

From the News of the World and the Sun, via the Mirror, the Scotsman, the Economist, the Daily Telegraph, and the Times, to the Independent, Guardian, and Observer, we hear that public opinion is “solid” (The Economist, U.S. edition, 22 September 2001), that Britons are “ready for battle” (The Observer, 23 September 2001), and that “Nearly Eight in 10 Britons Support Military Attacks” (The Mirror, 20 September 2001), “Scots Overwhelmingly Back a Just War” (The Scotsman, 19 September 2001), “Two-Thirds of Britons Back Blair Action” (The Independent, 24 September 2001), and “2 in 3 Back Air Strikes“ (The Guardian, 18 September 2001). The News of the World (16 September 2001) reported “overwhelming” support for bombing under the headline “Attack. Attack. Attack.” The Daily Telegraph (20 September 2001) claimed “the poll confirmed that there is virtually no support for peace campaigners.” A Guardian leader (18 September 2001) claimed “there is no disputing the bottom line. On this one, Tony Blair is definitely speaking for Britain.”",

Software applications for music production (music apps) within the iOS app store promise to broaden the potential for musical participation through simple, “fun,” user-friendly interface design. Yet, within the dominant user interface convention, “fun” is synonymous with the experience of instant success and effortless musical mastery. Drawing on semistructured interviews conducted with developers, and an analysis of shared user interface design conventions across three case studies of apps, ThumbJam, iMaschine 2, and Skram, I argue that normative conceptions of human perfectibility are assumed to be what generates an optimal user experience. Exploring theories of “queer fun,” and the importance of “failure” in studies of video gaming, I propose alternative conceptions of “fun,” and consider how, and with what effects, these might be implemented in the world of music apps. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Psychic TV: The Paranormal as Popular Culture in Japanese Television of the 1990s",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> NIGHT HEAD was a science fiction drama that aired on Japan’s Fuji TV between 1992 and 1993. The series arrived during a wave of interest in the paranormal, a trend that was embraced by commercial television in both dramatic programs and variety/infotainment talk shows. This boom of interest in the paranormal happened within the thriving economic and cultural environment of Japan’s Bubble Era, a period that saw a rapid expansion of television in addition to the prosperity of markets in real estate and industry. NIGHT HEAD portrays a darker vision of 90s Japan, using visual effects and moody, intense images and sounds to conjure a desperate sensibility. This article will offer an analysis of the “attractive” paranormal turn in Japan during the 1990s, using NIGHT HEAD as a case for considering the intersection of youth, visual effects, and the desire for an alternative way of understanding the world beyond rationality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> To survive contemporary developments in the TV industry and as a result of international mergers and acquisitions, production companies often form transnational media corporations. In this article, we examine TV production groups as global-local networks that pursue competitive advantages of transnational integration. Combining a critical industry studies approach with management perspectives, and building on different data sources, this article aims to open up the black box of management beliefs, discourses, and material practices within TV production networks. Our analysis shows how the industry’s hunt for profitable, reproducible practices and intellectual property (IP) rights translates into transnational creative pipelines, knowledge flows, and interdependencies. Transnational management practices include surveillance of local production, the installation of information flows, shared practices and procedures, and socialization processes. This article argues that corporate structures, strategies, and management practices coordinate TV production across borders, shape industrial practices, and foster a transnational production culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1990s, conversations about the dearth of women working in the video game industry have centered on three topics: (1) ways to draw more women into the field, (2) the experiences of women working in the industry, and (3) the experiences of those who once worked in the industry but left. Although there has been considerable research on the conditions and occupational identities of video game developers, less scholarly attention has been devoted to women in gameswork, the barriers/obstacles and challenges/opportunities they face, and how they talk about their experiences. This article offers a feminist approach that demonstrates how discourse focused on affect can be reread as intimately related to silences about power and how the rhetorical constraints that public speech imposes upon what can be said about “women in games” aid us in understanding what might remain unspoken, and why. </jats:p>",

Recalibrating the energies of the sitcom to address issues of trauma, memory and witnessing, Unbreakable has helped craft a new esthetic of the genre. The four-season series replicates key features of the historical captivity narrative and the contemporaneous #MeToo movement. Ignoring the slave narrative of captivity and dispossession allows the series to sidestep the racialized dimensions of sexual assault. The narrative’s resolute focus on white survivors permits the series to mobilize trauma for comedic effect. </jats:p>",

Questioning the analytic primacy accorded to film, we develop the concept of televisual drag and argue that bringing television to the fore can reveal different temporalities, modalities, and logics for the evolution of South Asian screen media, both in their past forms and current constitution. We critically engage with recent studies—of Indian women filmmakers, Pakistani comic shows and YouTube videos, and small-town video circulation in India—to illuminate the currents of televisual drag at work in contemporary media scholarship. We conclude by reflecting how how televisual drag might be a critical method for drawing insights from media histories, practices, and environments that do not or will not follow an easily comprehensible path toward a seemingly inevitable digital horizon. </jats:p>",

It is important to examine the production contexts and discourses of formatted programming, and in particular, reality TV formatting, to fully consider how national cultural expression is being reshaped due to changing economic, political, technological, and cultural demands. This article, first, investigates how concerns over formats are implicated in Canadian reality television. Specifically, the formatted reality program So You Think You Can Dance Canada will be analyzed. The article attempts to understand the production context of this program as a cultural product that has originated elsewhere but has been adapted to suit a local/national context. Second, the project aims to investigate how this show engages in discourses of nationhood, or, how Canadianness is discussed, represented, and performed on formatted TV through commercial nationalism. The article raises questions about the place of formats in Canadian television programming, policy, and culture. </jats:p>",

I develop the paper’s argument through a case study of the Rick and Morty episode “A Rickconvenient Truth”—a parodical take on the 1990s children’s TV show Captain Planet and the Planeteers. By applying reflexive thematic analysis to a dataset of &gt;7,600 Reddit user comments, I reveal that the episode prompts fans to question “standard” ways of thinking about climate change and deliberate radical alternatives for combatting the ecological crisis. </jats:p>",

Mediatization refers to the strategic coercion of imperative media coverage of the attacks, and ritualization refers to the focus on sacred life structures in both terrorist attacks and remedial responses. In combining ritualization and mediatization, terrorism aims to introduce maximal chaos through unexpected disruption of the sacred and taken-for-granted in everyday life in the community of the attack and wherever media coverage can reach. The fear and anxiety induced by disrupted life rhythms, including normal media flows, and the compelling footage of the disruption lead to ritualized reactions which both restore and transform the social order beyond the moment of the attack. </jats:p>",

Factors contributing to the original series ending, including creator conflicts about its final year, have led to continued series devotion and, consequently, Netflix’s revival that aimed to court the show’s built-in audience as well as a new generation of viewers. To revive a show that caters to established fans and also appeals to potential new fans requires a blend of self-referentiality and narrative continuation. I argue that while established fans were catered to through A Year in the Life’s reinstatement of original creator Amy Sherman-Palladino’s intended series ending, Netflix simultaneously catered to new viewers through streaming features like archive-access and by co-opting the very ending that established fans desired. </jats:p>",

Studies of the 1991 WSG commonly assert that it received little to no television coverage. This article intervenes to demonstrate that the WSG did receive substantial television coverage on Sky Sports and across the ITV network. The article draws on new archival sources to provide perspectives on the negotiations and interactions between the WSG organizers and the broadcasters, focusing on BSkyB. The article serves as an instrumental case study on how newly available television archival collections can be used to reframe perspectives of television history. In particular, the article considers the early history of Sky Sports, its approach to sports acquisition, its relationship with public service broadcasters, and the impact of satellite television on live-sports coverage and a rapidly changing media landscape in the UK in the early 1990s. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this special issue, we examine the two decades of digital media expansion in India, the world’s second largest Internet user domain, to propose the idea of “millennial India.” Millennial India highlights the processes of digitalization as a distinct sociopolitical moment entailing new conditions of communication, and the stakes of “millennials” who are drawn to digital media to articulate political matters. These processes, we suggest, have led to a democratization of public participation through the self-activity of online users. Qualifying the assumption that participation leads to empowerment, we show that a politics of civic action has grown simultaneously with violent exclusions via digital circulation. Millennial India emphasizes the need to take a contextual approach to global digital politics, and recognizes the continuities in the structures of political action in as much as the disruptions engendered by digital infrastructures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a critique of “data colonialism” as elaborated by Nick Couldry and Ulises Mejias. The main limitation of this theory is the essentialist conception of “colonialism,” “quantifier sector” and “self,” which overlooks historical-materialist roots and hinders a comprehensive understanding of datafication as a socio-cultural process. By recontextualizing some of the authors’ major claims, especially with regard to China, it is advanced the need to think about datafication as emerging out of a complex networked ecology whose founding logic is one of abstracted digital rationality. Some propositions—in the forms of ethnographic research and teachings along the line of data activism—are also elaborated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Family Channel, which evolved out of Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network, created a new brand of family television and redefined the “family audience” in the 1990s. The channel capitalized on the vacuum produced by the major networks’ pursuit of advertiser-friendly demographics, and created a safe space for traditional family television viewing. By promoting “positivity” as its brand and relying on the nostalgic appeal of older television properties, the Family Channel became the first cable channel to build a “values-based” brand and audience. The Family Channel normalized an ideologically conservative model of commercial family television in an expanding cable landscape, and capitalized on social conservatives’ discontent with mainstream television content. This article analyzes the branding, programming, and public-facing statements of the channel’s executives to reveal how the Family Channel implicitly and explicitly connected this new “family audience” with the ideology and politics of social conservatism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing from three sets of literature (critical economy of platformization, labor organization, and digital activism), this article introduces an integrated framework to analyze ideological production in digital intermediation platforms, particularly in relation to the sharing economy. We analyze documents, fieldwork interviews from twenty-eight actors, and observation of events in Barcelona, Paris, and Berlin during 2015–2017. We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: “sharing economy,” “commons,” and “platform cooperativism,” within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons. The actors we interviewed can be seen as part of an intermediate class, dependent on platforms for their survival, and who end up involuntary promoters of their own alienation and exploitation, consolidating the deterioration of the very digital labor conditions they seek to transform. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Windowing—the process of managing the release sequence for content so as to maximize the returns from intellectual property rights (IPRs)—is changing because of transformations in the way that television is distributed and consumed. Drawing on original research into the experience of leading international television producers and distributors, this article breaks new ground by examining how rights owners are adjusting strategies for exploitation of the economic value in their content. Findings show how the rise of digital platforms and outlets whose footprints are diffuse and boundaries are porous is disrupting traditional windowing models. This has necessitated new thinking about how best to organize the sequential roll out of content so as to build audience demand, avoid overlaps, and maximize returns. This article argues that changes in the dynamics of television distribution have altered not just processes for exploiting the value in IPRs but also content and content production, with implications for audiences as well as industry. </jats:p>",

More specifically, with their bid to place the entire notion of stardom at center stage, they raise important methodological and theoretical issues concerning the conceptualization of fame in reality TV. A central emphasis of the article is the importance of considering how reality TV demands a more thorough engagement with existing critical and theoretical concepts if the form is to sustain long-term academic analysis. Taking the British series of Pop Idolas the primary focus, the author explores this with respect to the concept of stardom, drawing particularly on the work of Richard Dyer and John Ellis. Pop Idol also raises crucial questions about the politics of interactivity in reality TV, a power dynamic that is ultimately configured around the program’s mediation of stardom. </jats:p>",

I first historically ground my discussion in an examination of the roots of midcentury modernism and the notion of the home as a curative space. I then discuss “everyday modernism” as a consumerist formation that informs aspirational disposability, particularly through Ikea goods. Finally, I turn to an analysis of the main features of Apartment Therapy that articulate aspirational disposability. Midcentury modernism, and its disposable incarnations from Ikea, allows readers to “hack” material culture to construct an affective domestic space, engaging in therapeutics of the self while substituting taste for class mobility. </jats:p>",

KVOS-TV was one of a few stations on the U.S./Canadian border that sought out a cross-border audience, but it is unique in its efforts to produce programming to bridge these audiences into a unified viewing public that it termed the Peace Arch Country. The station’s international programming constituted its viewing public as translocal citizens in ways that supported the broader global ambitions of the Pacific Northwest region, as well as responded to and promoted the global ambitions of western liberal democracy and capitalism in the fight against Communism. KVOS-TV’s constitution of Peace Arch citizenship shows how television was a tool for creating translocal citizens, educating and governing them from a distance. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Immigrants on Chinese Television and Limitations of China’s Globalist Discourse",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally perceived as a country of emigration, China has in recent years become an increasingly popular subject for immigration and diaspora studies, with an immigrant population that has been growing quietly and steadily since the 1990s. However, media representations of immigrants in China have not garnered much attention. This article provides a critical assessment of how immigrants and immigrant experience are portrayed on Chinese television, using the example of Foreigner in China (2013–19), the first-ever program on a national platform to tackle this topic. It argues that, while the program paints a rather insightful and entertaining picture of contemporary immigrant life in China, its representation of immigrants is restricted by not only the internal contradiction of the Xi administration’s globalist discourse, but also the exclusive, ethnocentric conception of Chinese nationhood, which remains the norm in a more heterogenous and globally conscious Chinese society. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the relationship between conservative discourse, racial politics, and broadcasting policy in the United States. It explores how conservative media personalities, pundits, and activists in 2009 claimed that efforts to increase broadcast diversity were, in actuality, attempts by liberals to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine—a policy that had required broadcasters to air both sides of controversial issues—through “the backdoor.” Reframing media diversity policies as masquerades to silence conservative voices, conservatives both denied the existence of barriers to participation for people of color and extended a narrative of conservative victimization. In contextualizing and analyzing the crusade against the “stealth Fairness Doctrine,” this article demonstrates how media policy discourse has operated as a site where conservative claims of injury occlude the continued existence of structural barriers to people of color and deny the importance of racial difference in the United States. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many scholars have noted that the US video rental boom of the mid-1980s led to a surge in horror production, yet few acknowledge that these features were not in fact films. Direct-to-video (DTV) horror movies like Breeders–The Sexual Invasion and Video Violence were not made for and never received theatrical release, yet they were repeatedly pilloried as failed films. Dispensing with the preconception that DTV movies would or should follow the same genre norms as films, this essay argues that DTV horror movies demonstrate their creators’ exploration and creation of a new medium. The conventions of 1980s DTV horror are not the same as those of contemporaneous US horror films, and contrasting them shows how genre helped DTV creators develop the automatisms of videotape and how DTV horror can help scholars identify the norms and logic of contemporary on-demand culture. </jats:p>",

These narratives became deeply connected to TiVo’s identity in ways that made the PVR appear simultaneously transgressive and conventional—the birth of a new algorithmic culture and the furtherance of the television industry as status quo. </jats:p>",

In particular, it investigates how contrasting forms of British TV documentary visualize “dangerous” mental patients abroad in the community. In constructing the argument, particular attention is given to the role of documentary television in making visible the lives of schizophrenics vis-à-vis changing notions of psychiatric care in the community. By doing so, the article adopts an approach to public representations of madness/mental illness that takes account of documentary television as a cultural form with social responsibility. The article concludes by emphasizing television’s cultural importance as a visual medium capable of promoting or undermining mentally ill people’s symbolic presence within a community of citizens. </jats:p>",

In addition, this essay examines how the closet functions as an organizing logic for the ways black gay characters are imagined within the writers’ room, and the industrial logics that prevent black gay characters from reappearing in subsequent episodes. In addition, I argue that the individual writers’ autobiographies are important to consider when creating black gay characters for black-cast sitcoms, as they bring their positionality as black (and in one instance a black gay) writers to the episodes they wrote. </jats:p>",

The main aim is to identify what the participants do to construct sociable bonds with each other using the technological affordances available, specifically those connected to second screens. Second screening is approached as a thoroughly sociable activity rather than a practice you engage in for primarily instrumental reasons like finding facts or statistics. The analysis shows how users and producers adopt strategies of inclusion oriented to creating a joint sense of “being here together” in the community that is formed around the official hashtag expressenvm. The results indicate that second screen setups of this kind have the potential of displacing the big TV screen and its live sports event, at least for a specific user crowd. </jats:p>",

This is done to move away from the production/consumption dichotomy, a framework on which most media studies analyses are predicated. From here, the story is told of Injustice, a documentary that found itself in unusual circumstances at the time of its release in Britain in July/ August 2001, with the local police attempting to block the screening of the film at various venues. Attempts to place this narration in relation to an existent cultural studies tradition of writing on the media lead us to consider relations of power/knowledge between British cultural studies and the media it comments on. In conclusion, this article attempts to set out a terrain within which a dialogic anthropology of media can work as a critical knowledge practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> CBeebies, the BBC’s brand for young children, has become a successful public service undertaking, lauded by parents and policy makers alike. Nevertheless, it operates in a complex and highly competitive “ecology,” where recent funding crises in commercial television have left CBeebies as the main commissioner of U.K.—originated content. Having outlined the broader industry context of CBeebies, this article examines changes in its organization, target audience, scheduling and commissioning practices, and relationship with the BBC’s commercial subsidiary, BBC Worldwide, to explain how wider commercial, cultural, and technological forces have impacted the Corporation’s strategies for preschool content. It suggests that growing pressures to locate funding for “fewer, bigger, better” programs may have an adverse impact on the range of content and sources of supply. </jats:p>",

To do this, the author proposes an analysis of the transformation of what he has called the ritual chain among the popular sectors, which reproduces, symbolically, not only the change in perceptions of what is real, but it also acts out the new social practices. </jats:p>",

The findings of this ethnographic research and in-depth interviews show that most participants perceive Serbian national identity as stigmatized due to the legacy of the civil war in the 1990s. Most participants hence employ different strategies in coping with the perceived stigma and redefining what it means to be Serbian. These strategies depend on the period of migration, the affordances of social media, and intended publics. Banal nationalism and banal cosmopolitanism are often manifestations of these strategies on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with an aim to correct national identity, by presenting it either as superior or as cosmopolitan and exotic difference. </jats:p>",

Through close analysis of these segments, the series’ YouTube presences, and industry perspective, the article explores how late night’s digital turn has embraced historical qualities of late-night programming that have proven compatible with YouTube as a platform, with these segments prioritizing collaboration common in the YouTube community at large. It goes on to analyze how this content is being “re-ritualized” for online audiences, disconnecting the segments from their linear broadcast context and reframing them for nonlinear audiences in light of this once secondary space of distribution increasingly becoming the primary space of consumption in late-night talk’s “YouTube era.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How does the depiction of female subjectivity and agency change when a Danish public broadcasting serial is adapted for an American commercial network? I compare Forbrydelsen (DR1, 2007–2012) with its remake, The Killing (AMC 2011–2013, Netflix 2014), to draw out the significance of postfeminism and neoliberalism as interpretive grids that limit feminist progress in the United States. Despite similar narrative and aesthetic strategies that center a strong female protagonist, female agency is undermined in The Killing through the postfeminist “bad mother” trope, which supplants Forbrydelsen’s Nordic noir left-wing critique of global capitalism and gender issues. This analysis illustrates that the cultural milieux of societies that are as egalitarian as Scandinavian states convey indirect feminist creative influence on cultural production, even when there is limited direct female creative input, an influence that may outweigh greater direct female creative control in the anti-egalitarian cultural context of a neoliberal and postfeminist United States. </jats:p>",

I argue that Dallas Smythe’s assessment of advertising was made to distinguish his approach from the one by Baran and Sweezy. Smythe developed the idea of capital’s exploitation of the audience at a time when both feminist and anti-imperialist Marxists challenged the orthodox idea that only white factory workers are exploited. The crucial question is how to conceptualize productive labor. This is a theoretical, normative, and political question. A mathematical example shows the importance of the “crowdsourcing” of value-production on Facebook. I also point out parallels of the contemporary debate to the Soviet question of who is a productive or unproductive worker in the Material Product System. </jats:p>",

The Browns practice a form of “progressive polygamy” that both they and the show establish as quintessentially egalitarian, American, and normal, though not normative. Sister Wives indicates that the complex structural dynamics of progressive polygamy create individuals who can thrive in a neoliberal milieu where good choices matter more than governments and where being savvy about the image yields currencies that are monetary, cultural, and, ultimately, spiritual. Surprisingly, the kind of flexible labor modeled on Sister Wives and endemic to neoliberalism authorizes itself through the language and idioms of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) social justice movement. However, while espousing a gay-friendly social justice agenda, the market logics of Sister Wives appropriate LGBT politics in the service of family commercial enterprises. </jats:p>",

Despite the lightweight connotations of the docusoap format, this series put forward a new ethical practice for representing the lives of individual wild animals. Through an exploration of how ethics are implicated in changing conditions of production and evolving media technologies, it is proposed that debates about the ethics of wildlife documentary need to be recentered on the complex ethical relationships between wildlife documentary makers and the animals and ecosystems they film rather than on issues of audience deception. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The monstrosities that took place on September 11 must be condemned unequivocally. There is no apology possible that would excuse the perpetrators, and we must hope those who still live will be brought to justice. But if we are to prevent such atrocities in the future, we cannot rest with condemnations and swift verdicts. We must seek a collective understanding of this atrocious act within its political, historical, and popular contexts. At the juncture of these contexts is a tension that I wish to explore here: the tension between the reality of recent political history in the Middle East, where I grew up, and the image of the Middle East in the popular imagination in America. Let me start with Hollywood. Perhaps I seem untoward in advancing a connection between popular imagination and the political realities that contextualized the most egregious terrorist attack the United States has ever experienced. But consider: among the most pronounced reactions to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United Sates was the degree to which press and public alike said that the events “looked like a movie.” The images of those airplanes slicing the twin towers of the World Trade Center and their implosion looked too fantastic to be real. There are, of course, good reasons that Hollywood images resonate with the horrors of September 11 in the public imagination. New York City has been a favorite disaster site for Hollywood. In contemporary films such as Godzilla, Armageddon, and Deep Impact, Manhattan was the stage for disaster and mayhem. Quite recently in The Siege, major Manhattan landmarks were blown to pieces by a group of Arab terrorists. The image of New York City buildings imploding has enough fictional credibility to have framed the reality of September 11 for many of us. I wish to consider the possibility that the terrorists knew and deployed these cinematic images with frightening efficacy. The “symbolism” involved in their work shows how well they had mastered the power of the image. Is it possible that these terrorists appropriated Hollywood’s disaster blockbuster? One critic suggested that the terrorists illustrated they could “out-",

    "title": "“Art in Motion”",
    "abstract": "“Art in Motion” (AIM), a new, international festival of time-based media arts, opened and closed its temporal window at the University of Southern California (USC) on 28 January 2000. Running nonstop at different sites throughout the campus from 9:45 in the morning until 7:30 in the evening, the event consisted of numerous screenings, an exposition of interactive and new media works, an audience-generated performance, a public reception, and an awards ceremony. The festival was founded and organized by Janet Owen and Jim Keller. Their goal was to attract responses from different media bases and place them together in one overarching context where time rather than media or genre would determine the admission of an entry. To accomplish this goal, they staged a competition offering a first prize in each of the following categories: feature, short, animation, and interactive/new media. The winning entries were selected by a renowned trio of judges: writer, art critic, and curator Bruce Hainley; producer of experimental documentaries on the arts and Director of Exhibitions, Santa Monica Museum of Art, Carole Ann Klonarides; and director, video artist, and writer John Sanborn. All entries were also considered for a $1,000 Intelefilm Award for Creative Excellence, sponsored by Intelefilm. By not limiting the call for entries to the choice of media but to the criterion that the work be time based, the AIM Steering Committee’s final selection, taken from more than 150 works submitted, included features, shorts, CD-ROMs, hand-drawn and digital animation, installations, and web sites. These works originated from Germany, Slovenia, Mexico, Great Britain, and Holland, as well as from all over the United States. To move across the lines that genre and media tend to draw as distinctions, with the lines of those teaching them and distributing them, seemed to be the most important and innovative component of this festival.

    "title": "Dealing With Dissonance: The Appropriation of Temptation Island as a Dissonant Practice Within Media Repertoires",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite being central to the media repertoire approach, operationalizations of interrelations of media repertoire components often remain limited to proportions of use, or the personal relevance of repertoire components. This paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of these interrelations by focusing specifically on one particular operationalization: the (in)compatibility of parts of the repertoire. Recent discussions in newspaper headlines indicate how Flemish reality TV-show Temptation Island might function as one such component, deemed incompatible with the repertoire of higher-educated young viewers. By drawing upon Lahire’s theory of dissonance, and exploring the appropriation of Temptation Island within repertoires through a moral economy of media use, the paper explores how young viewers under thirty-five make sense of “dissonant components” within their repertoire, and alleviate the tensions that their presence can create by adopting strategies that establish distance from the text or by hiding parts of the repertoire in certain social contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Launched in 1970, American Broadcasting Company’s (ABC) Monday Night Football made live prime time sports television viable when most sports broadcasts were relegated to weekends. It did so in part by packaging games for a crossover viewership. To this end, it suppressed racial divisiveness that might splinter the mainstream audience it sought. ABC parlayed Monday Night Football’s widespread popularity into prime time TV events beyond sports broadcasts that grew out of the programming flows it established and reflected its racial politics, including the made-for-TV melodrama Brian’s Song (1971) and the miniseries Roots (1977). Like Monday Night Football, these marquee TV events courted a crossover audience in part by downplaying racial discord. Although overlooked in scholarship that historicizes and critiques network television’s racial politics, Monday Night Football established intersecting representational conventions and programming norms that informed the mediation of race on some of U.S. television’s most visible, celebrated, and influential TV events. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines three major policy issues surrounding the transition to broadcast digital television (B-DTV): digital transmission and programming, interoperability and compatibility, and copyright protection. By examining these issues in the B-DTV transition, this article aims to show the discontinuity between the current B-DTV changeover and the most commonly referred to changeovers in TV history, color television. The comparison points to the transformation of television as an important component in the national and global information infrastructures. The article suggests that the long, complicated journey to B-DTV demonstrates the limitations of broadcast policy in its attempts to reconfigure the technological, political, economic, and cultural features of analog media to reach the digital promise land. With the features of traditional television in flux and the contradictions of global capital quite apparent, the changeover to B-DTV is going to be more drawn out and costly than the transition to color TV. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article outlines a socio-political theory appropriate for the study of the ecological repercussions of contemporary media technologies. More specifically, this approach provides a means of assessing the material impacts of media technologies and the representations of capitalist ecological crises. This approach builds on the work of ecological economists, ecosocialist scholars, and Marx’s writings on the conditions of production to argue that capitalism necessarily results in ecological destabilization. Taking Apple’s 2016 Environmental Responsibility Report as a case study, the article uses the theory to analyze Apple’s responses to ecological crises. The article asserts that Apple’s reactions are emblematic of the capitalist compulsion for increasing rates of productivity. However, unless the matter/energy savings achieved through higher rates of productivity surpass the overall increase in the flow of matter/energy in production, ecological crises will continue. Ultimately, capital accumulation ensures continued ecological destabilization. </jats:p>",

The author searched for seventeen important television programs, identified in a previous research project, to compare what was available in the two archives and how easy it was to find. The analysis focused on differences in curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloguing. NFSA is stronger in current affairs and older programs, while YouTube is stronger in game shows and lifestyle programs. YouTube is stronger than the NFSA on “human interest” material—births, marriages, and deaths. YouTube accessioning more strongly accords with popular histories of Australian television. Both NFSA and YouTube offer complete episodes of programs, while YouTube also offers many short clips of “moments.” YouTube has more surprising pieces of rare ephemera. YouTube cataloguing is more reliable than that of the NFSA, with fewer broken links. The YouTube metadata can be searched more intuitively. The NFSA generally provides more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2012, the Aam Aadmi (common man) Party (AAP) made its debut on the Indian political scene on a platform promoting ethical politics, anticorruption action and active citizenship. Inspired by the AAP’s call to “change politics,” many nonresident Indians (NRIs) in the U.K. Indian diaspora joined an international network of groups that provided support for the party in subsequent successful election campaigns. This article follows the ways in which digital media played a key role in the formation of intense individual attachments to the party, and how, for some, it became the means through which disillusionment with the party and its project was expressed. By attending to digital politics in the Indian diaspora as it plays out in this relatively recent political formation, we can gain a new perspective on the circulations, connections, and class values through which postliberalization projects to reform the nation are worked on from beyond its borders. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The burgeoning field of learning analytics (LA) is gaining significant traction in education, bolstered by the increasing amounts of student data generated through educational software. However, critical discussions of LA are in short supply. Drawing on work in the cultural studies of data and critical algorithm studies, this paper begins by examining three central issues: the distancing and “black boxing” of LA disciplinary practices, the mythologizing of objective data, and the concern for future prediction. The second section describes the design and implementation of the “Learning Analytics Report Card” (LARC), a pilot project that sought to develop experimental approaches to LA. As such, rather than seeking to simply produce analytics, the LARC attempted to foster critical awareness of computational data analysis among teachers and learners. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rip It Up and Start Again: Creative Labor and the Industrialization of Remix",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Creative industries rely on workers who use sampling and remix to produce new content assembled from existing materials. In the process, remix cultures are commodified and reshaped by industrial logics. Rip-o-matic videos provide an example. These scissor reels are used as visual storyboards for television commercials. They are produced by video editors who cut and paste clips found on video sharing platforms. Interviews with rip-o-matic producers show the impact of the industrialization of remix on creative workers who face challenges to their ability to assert their creativity, content ownership, and reputation. Other examples, such as social media and fast fashion, nuance the picture. Industrialization also paves the way for automation by generative “AI.” These software tools are based on processes of appropriation and remix that mirror those used by rip-o-matic producers. Remix is in sum at the center of today’s corporate cultural production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The increase in video-based communication has made different caption styles more apparent to audiences, including hearing viewers who watch social media videos with colorful open captions. To explore how viewers respond to a variety of caption styles, this article shares findings from three focus group discussions with twenty deaf and hard-of-hearing college students. This article begins by discussing the accessibility of captioned television and digital media and how captions can influence the viewing experience. This article then analyzes deaf and hard-of-hearing focus group participants’ statements about their viewing experiences, reception practices, and critiques of aesthetic and accessible caption styles. The analysis of viewers’ feedback reveals how the tension between various approaches to captions contributes to the reshaping of television and online media: a reshaping in which captions are coming to the forefront of the viewing experience for deaf, hard-of-hearing, and hearing viewers. </jats:p>",

This article argues for consideration of VCR usage by the TV collector, for whom the pleasures and practices of video collecting are regularly decoupled from discourses of “home theatre” and articulated to a range of aesthetic and ideological preferences that challenge media scholars to think beyond the domestic viewer-consumer model of television fandom. In addition, as new media technologies usher in the “postvideo” age, TV collectors speak to the continuing cultural and symbolic power of video as an archiving tool, fetish object, and medium of exchange. </jats:p>",

This is often done implicitly, or out of habit, with a specific model becoming established in any given research tradition. This presentation argues that different theories of the subject can have different implications for our understanding of citizenship and democracy. The text surveys a number of versions, deriving from a large and heterogeneous literature, and organizes them under the themes of rationalism, reflexivity, transparency, and contingency. No one version is offered as the ultimate one, since all have something to offer and at the same time have their limitations. However, it is suggested that greater awareness should be put on how we conceptualize the civic subject in our research, no least in regard to issues having to do with affect, the limits of reflexivity and self-transparency, the role of the unconscious, and the importance of contingency. </jats:p>",

Through examination of the context leading to those series and an in-depth analysis of two series, Adventures in Paradise and Hong Kong, it demonstrates how American expatriates served as liminal and transitional figures in geographic settings that themselves were also liminal. As such the series fit into a niche unique to the time of the late turn of the 1960s, when broader social attitudes were also in transition. Drawing upon Victor Turner’s work and Bjørn Thomassen, who has brought a reevaluation of Turner and the concept of the rites of passage as developed by Arnold van Gennep, the article documents how turn of the 1960s adventure dramas already contained disruptive storylines undercutting existing social attitudes even while continuing to reinforce systemic racism and fixed sexual identities. </jats:p>",

While prior scholarship on captions tends to emphasize policy and regulation, streaming video lacks the legislative framework for disability access seen with televisual captions in the United States. Drawing on disability studies and fan studies, this article shifts focus to fan campaigns, which become a central site for renegotiating industry accessibility practices in the absence of regulatory oversight. Using Netflix as a case study, it chronicles how audience campaigns contribute to both the company’s initial provision of streaming captions and the ongoing work of captioning quality control. It then argues that fan-driven access victories in the era of global streaming are uneven and contingent: a successful captioning campaign in one context has no necessary impact in others. </jats:p>",

It was, in many ways, a “Very Special Episode,” and not least because it was the first new episode of the series to be seen by audiences for four months. Set during spring and summer of 2020, the episode begins with a title card that reads “June 2020. Days into the lockdown: 90.” This article takes the position that this first episode of Casualty to screen on UK television following the March 2020 production shutdown (Ritman 2020) is productively understood as a “Very Special Episode” (VSE), with a view to arguing for its status as quietly radical television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses the working lives of individuals working in the British independent television production sector. It focuses on the material reality of their individualised, precarious working environment, investigating the disjuncture between the precarious, insecure nature of creative labour within this industry, which engenders stress and anxiety, and the intense emotional pleasure associated with such work. While the tension between ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ within creative occupations has been well documented (e.g. McRobbie, 2002b; Ursell, 2000), this article argues that in order to fully understand the subjective responses to creative work we need to look beyond the dominant post-Foucauldian approach in this field and attempt to understand cultural work as a site for moral work (Banks, 2006). Creative occupations are sites of exploitation and intense insecurity fuelled by the desire for self-actualisation.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is based on a small pilot project exploring the role, function, and meanings of second screens and companion apps for TV audiences that is contextualized by existing academic audience research. This is mapped alongside industry research and academic debate about second screens. The results illustrate some disjunction between industry expectations of usage and viewers’ everyday experiences. I argue that industries’ tendency to conflate “viewer” with “fan” indicates a less than nuanced understanding of the television/companion app audience. Further, the lean forward/lean back binary applied to digital media users and television audiences respectively points to a problematic not addressed in much industry literature, while the respondents for this research indicate a complex interplay between the pleasures of viewing that incorporates the social and the personal with the second screen and the TV text. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Shonda Rhimes is one of the most successful and celebrated black female American television producers. With such hits as ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy, Private Practice, and Scandal, Rhimes has established herself as a showrunner with a passion for women’s stories. However, as much as Rhimes is touted for her narratives of strong women, she is equally touted for recirculating a casting practice called blindcasting back into public discourse. Blindcasting, the process of not writing race into the script, is often considered a progressive step toward actors’ equality. However, the pitfalls of blindcasting as well as its larger purpose in the process of reinforcing a colorblind, post-race society need to be unearthed. The aim of this article is to unpack how blindcasting operates in Grey’s as well as in Rhimes’s politics through a discursive analysis of her self-fashioning, interviews with her cast and a close reading of her characters. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> According to previous research, contemporary journalism is undergoing a quantitative turn. The uses of data and metrics have started to permeate digital news websites in various ways. However, there is a lack of research on how gamification is applied to journalism practice. This article examines how the quantification of news production, readers’ interactions, and use of game mechanics have started to permeate journalism practice in digital outlets. Methodologically, this article focuses on the sports news website Bleacher Report as case study, drawing data from an analysis of the gamified system in which journalists are quantified and rewarded with points and badges according to their writing metrics, and a set of interviews with journalists who work for Bleacher Report. The results show that while data and metrics become the main component to assess journalists’ capacities, the process of automated quantification and the competitive playfulness of leaderboards are perceived as motivating affordances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the fundamental issues in the relation between television and sports has been the transference from watching a game or a sport in the field (the stadium) to the viewing experience through a proxy (the medium). The present article argues that sport broadcasts on television in the twenty-first century do not merely provide a sophisticated view of what takes place at the stadium but a new creation with unique characteristics. By using the latest technology-driven examples and assuming that other ones are already being used such as the “second screen” combination of watching TV and simultaneously using a smartphone or tablet for better statistics or social interaction, it is asserted that “being there” has become less imperative, as alternatives to watching matches live and in person at many sporting events have become in many cases better options. </jats:p>",

The show promotes cooperation and national unity among Kenyans through the metaphor of Kenya as a football (soccer) team. The focus of this article is twofold: viewers’ identification with and reaction to certain morally ambiguous characters and audience members’ interaction with the program through the online social networking site Facebook. We argue that the producers’ attempt to create less didactic storylines and more complex characters resulted in unanticipated audience opposition to the death of a character the producers understood to be negative but audience members viewed as sympathetic. Second, the adoption of social media resulted in less controlled discussions in which Facebook users occasionally questioned, challenged, and sought to reshape the producers’ goals and strategies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> From 2018 to 2021, the “egirl” witnessed a radical shift from her origins as a sexualized slur in online gaming. Through critical discourse analysis of news media of this period, this paper interprets this transformation within two primary phenomena: (1) the growth of women game influencers who reclaimed “egirl” slurs in their self-branding and (2) the launch of “Egirl.gg,” a platform for paid gaming companions. I argue that live streaming platform Twitch.tv, and the expansive ecosystems of labor its demand from streamers, were integral to this re-authorization of who can play as themselves in a patriarchal gaming culture. Here, I extend Ergin Bulut’s framework of “ludic authorship” to delineate how stakeholders in game streaming industries masculinize the cultural labor of “authenticity.” The ambivalent embrace of “egirling” via streaming cultural logics further complicates the work of women gamers who must work harder to realize careers in platformed entertainment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Corresponding to and partially driven by economic and technological convergence in the postnetwork era, American television programming in the past decade has produced a form of ethno-racial convergence in an array of prominent dramatic series such as Boston Public, Lost, Heroes, Grey's Anatomy, and Ugly Betty. Featuring multiracial and multigendered casts, prime-time soap narrative structures, and, most significant, interracial romance, these popular shows are clearly responding to global economic forces, sociocultural changes, and media monitoring pressures. They also have antecedents in the platoon films of World War II and the platoon sitcoms of the 1970s, extending their forebears' capitalist realist tendencies to the point of capitalist surrealism. Offering personal and industrial solutions to the postmodern dissolution of identity and the breakdown in network hegemony, the “neo-platoon” shows present a multicultural and transnational universe in which not only everything is interconnected but also interconnectedness provides the key to salvation. </jats:p>",

By exploring the nature of segregation patterns that have given shape to the present expansion of movie theatres, the author shows that the regaining of audience is restricted: although it is true that at the birth of the new century audiences can be considered multimedia (attending movie theaters, using video, as well as open and restricted TV), the exhibition of movies turns out to be more accessible to high-and middle-class populations as an experience of public sociability. Lower sectors have less opportunities to experience public entertainment and have to rely on open television and video as means of amusement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The question of whether public broadcasting should be sustained and protected is at the heart of current media policy debates in Europe. The main issue is whether traditional forms of regulation, including regulation protecting public communication and the media's social and cultural functions, are still relevant in the emerging digital media system. In this article, the situation of public television is discussed with reference to the Norwegian experience and the media policies emanating from the European Union. In the article, it is argued that the momentous changes associated with convergence, globalization, and privatization have produced a new set of challenges to public broadcasters and policy makers. Although the range of possible responses is curtailed by an ideological climate that favors market regulation over more traditional forms of cultural policy, it is argued that the situation also creates space for new policies destined to protect and defend public broadcasting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Hallmark movies are a hit. While most broadcast networks in the United States and Canada are struggling to maintain an audience, Hallmark has launched three additional cable networks and services in the past four years. Much of this success can be attributed to Hallmark’s investment—both ideological and economic—in the made-for-TV movie, a form of programing that Hallmark has re-popularized and re-branded—and transformed into a genre. To work through my suggestion that we consider the Hallmark movie as a genre, in the same way we can speak productively about the Western or the buddy cop film, I examine: the structure and content of the Hallmark movie formula; the movies’ use of studio system-style production practices; and fan discourses and fan-made content. In re-visiting the Hallmark made-for-TV movie as a genre, we can gain greater insight into how both genres and media companies are navigating the digital media environment. </jats:p>",

I suggest that whereas for Frank’s Place, media scholars’ emphasis on the show’s representational practices of race and place was entirely appropriate, these questions are not sufficient to make sense of Treme. The latter enjoins media scholars to ask a different set of questions that examine both the show’s practices within the city as well as the city’s practices that implicate the show. Specifically, I suggest that the show requires an analysis of labor and hiring practices, tourism, and corporate social responsibility in the city. In so doing, I propose considering Treme not in terms of its representational practices, but rather, as a set of spatial practices bound up with the material production of city space as well as its citizen-subjects. </jats:p>",

Although the study shows some similarities, there are notable differences between the two. VRT has significantly higher production volume and commissions most productions externally, thus supporting the sustainability of the wider Flemish TV production market. DR has lower production volume and produces largely in-house, enabling larger budgets per series and, hence, higher production values, which in turn has contributed to an upward global export spiral for DR, thus supporting the sustainability of DR’s drama content itself. </jats:p>",

Despite the progress researchers have made across different areas, a grounded conceptualization and definition of binge watching is still lacking. In this article, we conduct a transdisciplinary literature review to identify continuity and viewer autonomy as the two fundamental attributes underlying binge watching. Then, using these attributes as conceptual anchors, we offer a convergent definition and categorize the existing binge-watching definitions in the literature. The results of this categorization reveal that the vast majority of the definitions used in the literature fail to distinguish binge watching from other viewing practices such as casual viewing, single-episode appointments, and marathon appointments. We discuss the implications and, to move the binge-watching research forward, conclude with recommendations and an agenda for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The interacting social forces that have shaped the development of the electronic media constitute complex and contrary developments. Television technology, unlike that of the cinema, took a long time to grow from a technological possibility in the 1930s to maturation in the 1970s. Mega-events such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup have both a centripetal and a centrifugal character. They suck in global attention in a vortextual fashion, and yet the spectacle is not so much local and embedded as it is dispersed around the globe. Live sport, dispersed across platforms, is part of a bifurcation of social life—people are half present and embedded, half engaged in virtual interactivity. Technology has typically developed in two directions—producing the giant screens of public viewing spaces and also of the living room, and producing the miniaturization that enables live sport on mobiles, watches, and the Google Glass. Finally, media sport is ubiquitous yet is all but invisible to many others who simply filter it out. </jats:p>",

The platform’s documentary series offer a unique window into this new era of the Disney empire, usefully demonstrating the careful navigation of corporate legacy and history in the creation and maintenance of what I term brand futurity. Thinking critically about the concept of collective imaginaries in the context of the digital and streaming economies, this article argues that these docuseries illustrate Disney’s digital corporate strategy as a narrativization of wonderful work and ever-expanding value. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital racism and the online experiences of Black people have been foregrounded in vital contemporary research, particularly Black scholarship and critical race and digital studies. As digital developments occur rapidly there is a need for work which theorizes recent expressions of digital anti-Blackness, including since increased marketing industry interest in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020. This paper explores digital racism related to online (re)presentations of Black people and associated racist marketplace logics, digital practices, and (re)mediations of Blackness in the service of brands. Focusing on computer-generated imagery (CGI) racialized online influencers, the spectacularization of Black pain and lives, digital marketing approaches, and digital Blackface, this work contextualizes anti-Black digital racism by reflecting on its connection to centuries of white supremacy and often under-investigated racial capitalism. Overall, this work examines the shape-shifting nature of anti-Black digital racism and commercial components of it which are impacted by intersecting oppressions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Data assemblages amplify historical forms of colonization through a complex arrangement of practices, materialities, territories, bodies, and subjectivities. Data-centric epistemologies should be understood as an expression of the coloniality of power manifested as the violent imposition of ways of being, thinking, and feeling that leads to the expulsion of human beings from the social order, denies the existence of alternative worlds and epistemologies, and threatens life on Earth. This article develops a theoretical model to analyze the coloniality of power through data and explores the multiple dimensions of coloniality as a framework for identifying ways of resisting data colonization. Finally, this article suggests possible alternative data epistemologies that are respectful of populations, cultural diversity, and environments. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Netflix &amp; Big Data: The Strategic Ambivalence of an Entertainment Company",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Netflix actively fueled what is known as the myth of big data, promoting their recommender system and data-driven production as cutting-edge, all-seeing, and all-knowing. Today, however, the company is increasingly acknowledging the role of human expertise and creativity. In this paper I explore the strategic repositioning of Netflix from technology company to entertainment company, enabling them to be understood as both “data” and “gut.” This transformation is discussed as motivated by the increasing public criticism of data and algorithms and the company’s foray into original programing. More specifically, I examine how Netflix, in public-facing materials, discusses big data and how those ideas are taken up in public discourse. These sources disclose an assumption of opposing characteristics between data and human expertise and creativity. As a point of a larger critique, I comment on the limitations of this data and human opposition for thinking about Netflix and technologies at large. </jats:p>",
