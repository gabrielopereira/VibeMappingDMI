    "abstract": "This article considers how, and why, “Topic Modelling” tools can be used to analyse historical newspaper archives. While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to “distant read” the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other projects that might make use of newspaper archives. As well as demonstrating the investigative potential of topic modelling, the article also highlights the practical and technological barriers that currently undermine its effectiveness, particularly when it is applied to archives of historical material.",

    "title": "Boundaries of Journalism: professionalism, practices and participation",
    "abstract": "Journalism as a profession, as a commercial endeavour, and as a sociotechnical phenomenon has long been evolving, leading to a multifaceted journalism shaped by these many transformations. In the last two decades the acceleration of change has been outstanding, affecting and affected by several practices of everyday life. Against this backdrop, a thorough reflection going beyond a simplistic study of change is needed to identify the essence of the “what”, “who”, and “how” of journalism. This is precisely what Matt Carlson and Seth Lewis attempt in their new edited volume, Boundaries of Journalism: Professionalism, Practices and Participation. Bringing together 16 scholars, this book reflects upon a diverse range of journalistic boundaries. Exploring intersections and interactions of newswork across increasingly blurred edges of journalism, this book explores tensions between journalistic norms and values, as well as with the performance of news-related actors. Only by looking at these boundaries, Carlson and Lewis suggest, can we make sense of what journalism is and understand who we can call journalists. Formally, the book is structured into an introductory chapter, 12 chapters, and a final epilogue. Carlson’s introduction provides an explanatory view on how the boundaries in journalism are conceptualized; based on Thomas Gieryn’s generic types of boundary work—expansion, expulsion, and protection—and three areas of journalism around which boundary work occurs—participants, practices, and professionalism (p. 9). The first part, titled “Professionalism, Norms, and Values”, contains seven chapters that delve into the core of journalism as a trade, discussing the increasingly difficult task of delineating what journalism is and what it is supposed to be, approaching this consideration of journalism studies from various angles. In Chapter 1, Jane Singer illustrates how journalists herald professional norms as boundary devices to legitimize their professional authority against the challenge posed by new forms of practice such as social journalism or entrepreneurial journalism. Similar totems of journalistic values and their use as boundary markers are discussed in chapters on verification and allegiance to the truth by Alfred Hermida, and by Adriana Amado and Silvio Waisbord who write about the lack of a homogenized professional culture in the Argentinian media system (leading to a weak boundary that does not provide adequate defence against the incursions of political powers). Also included in this section are chapters by Mark Coddington, who revisits the editorial and commercial divide of journalism and how contemporary approaches such as native advertising are increasingly eroding this boundary, and by Mike Ananny on the ways “Google Glass” and forms of witnessing are used as proxies for journalists and how the constant evolution of technology",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent research concerning alternative media has provided some insight concerning the increasing role of those media in mainstream political communication. In this study, we conducted interviews with key leaders in local level Democratic and Republican Parties in the United States Midwest. These were the individuals who chaired the parties and executive committees, maintained the social and interactive media platforms for the parties, and managed high-profile campaigns. Our interviews revealed that there were leaders in the community who made use of alternative media in some ways. What is more, we found that there were key individuals across both parties who included alternative media content in their political work, or included links or content from such media in their social media feeds. Such findings demonstrate the increasing fusion of activist and mainstream politics, which hold important implications for political communication in that Midwestern county.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The visibility of news on social media platforms is now as much mediated by opaque algorithmic power as quantifiable social news sharing. As public interest journalism has been transformed and even held to ransom by platformization, and its metrification of news value, there are ways for the news media to reassert their significance and independence, while building the post-scale engagement necessary to sustain its move from advertising to audience-based revenues. Regulatory activism, engagement re-orientation, and deeper research into commendary cultures offer avenues for journalism to reconfigure its relationship to platform power in an age of social news sharing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As news organizations continue to explore the opportunities and challenges presented by engagement with audiences across digital and social media platforms in the creation and sharing of news and in the development of news-oriented products, they also offer up uniquely personal investment pathways and emotional ties for their audiences. This commentary considers conceptualizations of emotion and individual agency in engagement with journalists, news organizations, and the process of newsmaking. We suggest that exploring more forms of engagement and accepting them as part of the news process can encourage the sharing of emotion and the development of positive emotional connections to journalists and news content and products. This is important to consider as audiences move from influencing the profession of journalism to becoming one of its indispensable creators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given growing concerns regarding the spread of medical misinformation, the current research set out to assess the message effects of social media news on reader veracity assessments. A 2 (news report with hedging vs. without hedging) by 3 (uncivil vs. civil vs. no comments) between-subject experiment on Facebook users was conducted (valid N = 824). Results reveal that news hedging was more predictive of perceived credibility, news sharing, and fact-checking tendencies than was comment incivility. Hedged reporting was also found to elevate perceived news credibility, which in turn predicted a greater likelihood of news sharing. Moreover, perceived credibility increased fact-checking tendency only when the news was reported with hedged messages. These findings indicate that when readers encounter an unfamiliar health news issue, the content of news played a more important role in veracity assessment than the style of reader comments.",

The results also found differences between citizen news sites and citizen blog sites. Few citizen journalism sites outside of large metropolitan cities covered local government.",

    "abstract": "Storytelling is hyped as an instrument to attract audiences, but its potential to engage simultaneously makes it a source of criticism and concern. The debate seems stuck between what the profession of journalism is supposed to be about (facts, objectivity, truth-telling), and the way these ideals are threatened by the trend of engaging users. In this article we explore how it is possible that the discussion about journalism and storytelling seems to have made little progress over many decades. The problem, we argue, is that the discussion appears to take place in the same discursive space, but in actuality takes its cues from several distinctive repertoires, which are in themselves coherent and make sense but when played off against each other create false oppositions that do little justice to the arguments made on both sides. We will try to open up and enlarge the discursive space to talk about storytelling in the context of journalism by showing how both terms function differently in seven distinct repertoires. This maneuver should enable us to move forward the analysis, the value, the function, and the conceptual development of journalistic storytelling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Observing the limitations driven by a certain path-dependency in most scholarship on digital journalism, we argue for favouring a direction that privileges “digital” over “journalism”. Rather than seeing it as a digital iteration of journalistic principles, as has been a persistent theme in academia to date, it would see consider journalism as an embodiment of digital principles, one of the many domains of social life which is increasingly restructured around digital technologies. Digitisation sets the agenda for journalism to follow, rather than journalism setting the agenda for its digital incarnation to live up to—or not. Such an approach is a continuation of existing but limited scholarship which could open up new paths and expand current avenues of research, and reflects an emerging paradigm where digitisation is the dominant partner.",

    "abstract": "The use of information has changed in recent years—particularly among young adults, for whom social media are now the most important gateway to engage with news and various other types of information. Focusing on Instagram, this multi-method research project takes an audience-centered approach and investigates how young adults use the platform for (which kind of) information, the information needs that guide their use, and the contextual dynamics that shape their understandings of ‘information (use).’ Empirically, the study builds on a combination of a seven-day diary study with semi-structured qualitative interviews with 48 German Instagram users aged 18 to 24. Analyzing the diaries in conjunction with the interview transcripts allowed us to gain rich insights into information usage practices and how these are influenced by the characteristics of (audiovisual) social media platforms as well as the motives and needs of using them. The findings suggest that Instagram is an integral part of young adults’ information repertoires, although information is usually not actively sought. Moreover, platform characteristics and affordances not only shape possible and actual information behaviors but also matter for whether participants understand their Instagram use as information use.",

    "abstract": "Whereas studies on churnalism have mainly focused on how public relations material and wire copy is recycled in newsrooms, this study switches perspective and concentrates on the wholesale side of news production. News agencies are a major news source especially with regard to foreign news, yet little is known about their news production practices. Against this background, this research project investigates how agency journalists produce news about the European Union (EU). Particular interest is given to the relationship between journalists and their sources. Applying a qualitative approach, 36 semi-structured interviews were conducted with agency correspondents and bureau chiefs in Brussels from 27 national and international media organisations, accompanied by think-aloud protocols. The interviews reveal that agency journalism in Brussels is centred on the EU institutions. Due to time pressure and poorly staffed newsrooms, correspondents rely heavily on material provided by the political institutions. Many concede that they lack time for in-depth and investigative research. Further, it becomes evident that the topics covered are initiated largely by the EU, revealing the latter’s extensive agenda-building capacity. Hence, the question arises whether agency correspondents are merely churning copy or whether they can uphold their journalistic autonomy vis-à-vis the EU’s vast public relations machinery.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of co-creation on magazine journalism by drawing on data from a structured, sequenced online co-creation process in an established consumer magazine. Co-creation is examined as a method for open journalism. Co-creation surprises and even shocks journalists, as they face the “real” reader, in intensive online reader engagement, instead of the imagined “ideal reader.” Journalists compromise quality, feature journalism to comply with readers’ wishes, thus breaking the reader contract and consistency in the magazine concept. Co-creation created a strong feeling of ownership over the magazine among readers; however, the end result was disappointment for both journalists and readers due to the failed content-integration process. Co-creation established a connection between the readers, which strengthened the magazines’ community-creator function. The findings indicate that co-creation is a more challenging method in journalism than crowdsourcing. This article contributes to the study of open journalism and the digital future of magazines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Disinformation and infodemics have been central for the media policy agenda in most countries and in particular in Europe. Yet, the European Commission has had a soft law approach centralizing obligations to handling information disorder on a content level. This commentary argues that by focusing primarily on the content level we miss the bigger picture where disinformation and infodemics are only symptoms of something more important on a media infrastructure level. The commentary suggests that we need to reconsider regulation on the infrastructure level instead that supports the democratic need for better access to verified content by looking at how the current legal structure across regulatory silos is benefitting the exact opposite. Furthermore, the commentary suggests to specifically address influencers (defined by number of followers) in the context of moderation, and lastly suggests that user data is ideally stored and governed outside privately owned companies in Europe in order to benefit users and society at large.",

    "abstract": "By reconsidering the complexities of the journalist–politician relationship, the study pursues the metaphor of tango introduced by Herbert J. Gans and analyses the online interplay in Twitter conversations between journalistic and political actors. Various types of conversations emerged through the quantitative analysis of the tweets, which ranged from seeking mutual affection, through monitoring–advocating connections and information sharing to unbridgeable advocacy. According to the interviewed journalistic and political actors, such tweets were shaped by their subjective considerations of boundaries in their Twitter repertoires as the principles of social media networking have not been institutionalized in either Slovenian newsrooms or parties. The results revealed that neither journalists nor politicians led the Twitter tango, but instead whether these actors engaged in Twitter conversations as either initiators or respondents. The identified boundary dynamics of the Twitter tango indicate that social media are a particular venue for the articulation of journalist–politician relationships, which in some cases are shaped by offline relations. The findings imply that in Slovenia contemporary journalism’s relation to politics is paradoxical because it is shaped by the liquidity of late-modern social communication and the compactness of an elite culture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently leaked Facebook data included material from the platform’s internal social science research units. Given its character—and the likelihood of future whistleblowing—this case presents an opportunity for reflection on current and future academic engagement with leaked data. This contribution is grounded in the experiences of some members of a small, international team of journalism scholars, after being offered access to the leaked data by a media organization. It also describes other academic-involved initiatives—their similarities, differences, and efforts—working toward expanded access to and/or usage of this data. Rather than take a general or hardline stance on use of leaked data, this contribution emphasizes critical engagement—ethical, legal, practical—with the particulars of individual leaks. It also emphasizes the need for guidelines and mechanisms for working with leaked data, and the concomitant importance of transparency within academia about current practices. Such critical engagement should also include consideration of the positionalities, divisions, and marginalities of involved researchers and regions.",

    "abstract": "strates how interlopermedia claim a belongingness to the field of journalism inWestern societies and bring about new ways of understanding the profession of journalism. The concept of interloper media, while appropriately broad here, is a useful way of analyzing how external actors to journalism (e.g., web analytics companies or coders) have shaped and continue to shape the profession of journalism. Eldridge’s layered definition of media interlopers also takes time to recognize that journalism is complex and intertwined with in-group and out-group dynamics that should be considered at holistic rather than individual contributors to changes in the news process and journalism culture. Eldridge’s definition(s) of interloper media is a helpful starting point to categorize the range of actors that do not necessarily define themselves primarily as journalists or deploy some of the norms and practices from news production. These interlopers, emerging as a result of the internet and social media, as Eldridge accurately describes them, do not fit typical definitions of journalists and often work well outside of journalism’s professional norms. They also raise questions of what journalism has become and whose audience or public these actors serve while challenging the epistemology of journalism. Eldridge notes that interloper media’s positions in journalism remains influenced by the nature of the interactions they have with journalism as institution, epistemology, practice, and ethics. These agents of change may be conceptualized as media interlopers, though there may exist new sub-categorizations of what interloper media can be whether they explicitly claim to be part of journalism or reject taking part of the cultural change brought about by digital media in journalism. These include the fluidity of roles ranging from journalists-programmers, bloggers to non-governmental organizations communicators. Eldridge’s skillfully crafted call for more study on the role interlopers in digital journalism could potentially spur rich analyses on the future of journalism as bounded by the increasing role of fluid non-primarily journalistic roles in news production and outputs.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we argue that digital media pose such challenges for analysing media content adequately that the established approach does not work as intended, reflecting underlying assumptions inherited from analogue media formats. We review two relatively new forms of the content analysis method—big data and liquid content analysis—and juxtapose these with established content analysis. In addition, we detail how these two methods tackle content analysis pillars such as mode of analysis, sampling, sampling size, variable design, unit of analysis, measuring point(s), access/capture/storing, conclusions/generalizability and the key agent doing the actual work. We summarize the article by arguing that established content analysis is insufficient for digital media but that common standards, protocols and procedures are yet to be developed for these new approaches to digital journalism research.",

A survey finds that in pluralistic communities, where power is shared among more groups, journalists place fewer restrictions on online comments than in more homogenous communities, where power is concentrated. Journalists at small, independently owned news organizations are also more likely to uphold traditional networks of social control by choosing not to allow comments on their websites.",

    "abstract": "The audience plays an important role in the journalistic context. The audience implications of journalistic work and output, business matters and policy making requires knowledge of public preferences and whether and how they take part in the news. Mixed-mode survey designs including Web and mail are becoming increasingly common in audience research, but it is unclear how mixing the survey modes affects the results. With the possibility of increasing response rates, is the risk of degrading the quality of answers. As audience research constitutes an important cornerstone of journalism studies, and because survey design including the Web is becoming more and more attractive, it is relevant to study the implications of merging audience data from different collection modes. This large-N survey provides a unique opportunity to analyse representative data on the matter. Altogether, 6603 respondents completed the survey, of whom 7.5 per cent chose the Web mode. Both habitual questions and opinion questions on different media were included in the study. The largest differences were found for item non-responses, whereas response distribution among respondents only differed to a small extent due to mode. There is no urgent need for caution when combining mail and Web responses in one data-set. However, thorough analyses of item non-response are necessary to control measurement errors when surveying media audiences and habits of using digital and other media in mixed-mode designed surveys.",

    "title": "News and Politics: the rise of live and interpretive journalism",
    "abstract": "At first sight, this volume might appear a backward-looking contribution to the debate about the media’s role in politics. This is because Cushion focuses his energies on a very traditional media form: scheduled television news bulletins. In a world where academic energies are focused on 24-hour news, social media and the hybrid news environments created by these communication channels, this might seem like a strange choice. Cushion’s justification is convincing though. He is not studying news bulletins to the exclusion of these new modes of communication, but rather using a longitudinal data-set (the sort that can only be created if a particular media form has been around for a prolonged period of time) to understand exactly how the content of more traditional forms of news has been infused with the values of newer media forms. Essentially, his aim is to study the mediatization of the media or, put another way, the interaction that is occurring between multiple and distinct media logics. As such, this volume sits within an intellectual approach which seeks to complicate the idea of mediatization, moving it away from a monolithic position. The challenge for any project of this kind is to ground an abstract and contested concept—in this case mediatization—within a measurable, empirical reality. Cushion does this by arguing that particular news genres prioritize certain types of content. Traditionally, evening news bulletins used edited reporter packages, or a news anchor talking directly to camera or narrating a news story over still or moving images. In contrast, 24-hour rolling news employs conversations between the news anchor and reporter, live outdoor broadcasts from a reporter, or studio discussions (p. 27). Cushion’s hypothesis is therefore that, faced by the advent of 24-hour news since the 1990s, scheduled news bulletins have gradually adopted a style more reminiscent of rolling news. This has made scheduled news more “live”, usurping its previous role as a recap of the day’s events. Furthermore, this model of news changes the level of journalistic intervention in news coverage, providing more space for interpretative commentary. It is possible to quibble with Cushion’s operationalization of 24-hour news values. His focus on the journalistic interventionism, for example, neglects the increased scope that rolling news provides for politicians to speak to the public directly, through coverage of speeches and press conferences. Arguably, this type of content also defines the rolling news genre (albeit almost always followed by exactly the type of real-time journalist commentary that interests Cushion). Cushion’s analysis generates some interesting findings, which contradict some accepted wisdom about the evolution of television news bulletins. Soundbite quotes from politicians and others in news bulletins have, for example, not got shorter in recent years, as might be expected. Also in contrast to what might be expected, the",

    "title": "Paying for Online News",
    "abstract": "Private news media across the world are trying to develop pay models for news. Our understanding of what drives behaviour and attitudes to paying for online news, however, remains limited. We use survey data from six countries (France, Germany, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States) to investigate three hypotheses: (1) those who use public service media for online news are less likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay because they have a reference price of zero for online news, (2) those who pay for print newspapers are more likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay for online news because they have a reference price above zero for offline news, and (3) that younger people are more likely to pay for/express a willingness to pay for online news because they are more likely to have a reference price above zero for other digital content. Our analysis supports Hypotheses 2 and 3, but not Hypothesis 1. Therefore, paying for offline news increases the likelihood of paying for online news because it helps create a reference price above zero. However, consuming free online news from public service media does not by itself create a reference price of zero for online news.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an evaluation of three different types of geographical news classification methods: (1) simple keyword matching, a popular method in media and communications research; (2) geographical information extraction systems equipped with named-entity recognition and place name disambiguation mechanisms (Open Calais and Geoparser.io); and (3) a semi-supervised machine learning classifier developed by the author (Newsmap). Newsmap substitutes manual coding of news stories with dictionary-based labelling in the creation of large training sets to extract large numbers of geographical words without human involvement and it also identifies multi-word names to reduce the ambiguity of the geographical traits fully automatically. The evaluation of classification accuracy of the three types of methods against 5000 human-coded news summaries reveals that Newsmap outperforms the geographical information extraction systems in overall accuracy, while the simple keyword matching suffers from ambiguity of place names in countries with ambiguous place names.",

This study follows a panopticism framework, which states that those under real or perceived observation will alter their behavior to be more subservient to authority. Through a series of seven in-depth interviews with journalists, using a constant comparative method, journalists who participated in this study reported that the way they work has changed under a real or perceived threat of mass government surveillance, making their work more difficult and potentially damaging their communications with sources. Many potential interview subjects refused to participate on the record because of the sensitivity and potential risks involved in the discussion of the subject matter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How do people make sense of, and deal with, a changing media landscape perceived to be filled with misinformation and fake news? To answer this, we draw upon data from seventy-one in-depth interviews in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Miami. We found that perceptions about the overall media ecosystem were characterized by a: a) negative view of the current quality of news reporting, b) particular distrust of news circulation on social media; and c) concern about the effects of these trends mainly on the information habits of others. To counter these perceptions, participants indicated to rely on: a) traditional fact-based media, accompanied by a rejection of opinionated outlets; b) personal experience and knowledge; c) repetition of information across outlets; d) consumption of cross-ideological sources; e) fact-checking; and f) trust in certain personal contacts on social media, who are perceived as assessors of news quality. Our findings suggest that: a) news consumption is being ritualized in new and more personalized ways; b) social media is seen as a gateway to news partly because audiences find opinion leaders in terms of their skills as credibility assessors; and c) journalism could cater more to audiences’ demands for more fact-oriented and less discussion-based content.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using the Egyptian Revolution as a case study, this article studies journalistic sourcing and verification through in-depth interviews with journalists in the United Kingdom. While the coverage of the event in the British media was dominated by civic, unofficial sources, interviews conducted in 2014 revealed that journalists only included these if no other sources were available. In fact, journalists voiced concern with regards to verification of online sources, and rarely included these as direct, first-hand accounts. Follow-up interviews conducted in 2020 point to developments journalism practice has undergone since, particularly in relation to open-source content verification. Overall, the picture we paint of British journalists’ handling of content sourced from social media is one wedged between expressed enthusiasm and cautious scepticism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examined what type of response to commenters who disagree led to more positive attitudes toward a news organization’s Facebook page. Results of two experiments, one in Germany (n = 764) and one in the United States (n = 763), found that a high-person-centered (HPC) response, which acknowledges people’s emotions, led to more positive attitudes toward the news organization’s Facebook page, compared with a low-person-centered (LPC) response, which dismisses people’s feelings. This held true for both German and American participants, regardless of whether the comments were civil or not. In both countries, positive evaluations of the organization’s Facebook page were heightened if journalists, rather than news users, responded to the commenters. Results are discussed in relation to the verbal person-centered (VPC) theory of social supportive outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Applying theoretical concepts of collective action framing and the mediation of protest movements by grassroots political communication scholars, this article takes an in-depth look at the political communication strategies surrounding two major anti-surveillance protest events in the early post-Snowden world: the “Stop Watching Us” event and “The Day We Fight Back” online protest day. A close reading of the two campaigns with a special focus on organizers’ and participants’ choice of frames, narratives, and iconography reveals how privacy activists have tried to exploit the political opportunity structures of the Snowden leaks and receive media attention. Through the use of historical, cultural, and global framing devices, as well as a particular focus on the actions of individual celebrity activists, organizers have sought to mobilize the public against surveillance. As a thorough look at the subsequent media coverage of the campaigns reveals, the framing activities opened discursive spaces in the contemporary debate about the effects and consequences of mass surveillance. Thus, these two case studies offer important insights both into the grassroots political communication tactics of privacy advocates and the representation of anti-surveillance sentiments in the mainstream media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How do news organizations design and implement algorithmically personalized news services? We conducted 16 in-depth interviews with professionals working in European public service broadcasting and commercial quality news media to answer this question. The news business is undergoing rapid transformations regarding how news production is financed, how news is produced and delivered to audiences and how citizens consume news. In all of these changes algorithmic recommender systems play a role. We focus on news organizations’ own personalized news services, and analyze how they define the role of personalization in contributing to the financial success of the organization, in reaching and retaining audiences, and in fulfilling their editorial mission. We interviewed editors, journalists, technologists and business intelligence and publishing professionals to gain a structural understanding of the often conflicting goals of personalization. We found that rather than focusing on increasing short-term user engagement, European quality news media try to use news personalization to increase long-term audience loyalty. In distinction to the “platform logic of personalization”, which uses personalization to produce engagement and sell audiences to advertisers, they have developed a “news logic of personalization”, which uses personalization to sell news to audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conspiracy theories about the ‘real’ origins of the coronavirus have co-evolved with media coverage of the COVID-19 crisis itself; the World Health Organization now warns about a global “infodemic” paralleling the viral pandemic. Covering these conspiracy theories presents difficult editorial choices for news organizations. This article examines how diverse news outlets chose to report on one key COVID-19 conspiracy theory: the (entirely unfounded) claim that 5G telecommunications technology severely worsened or even caused the pandemic. We draw on online article data from the global news database GDELT to examine the coverage of COVID/5G conspiracy theories: we trace the changing nature of conspiracist claims; chart the expansion of coverage from fringe media to respected mainstream outlets; and pay particular attention to key stories that significantly increase the reach of reporting about this conspiracy theory. Arising from this analysis are new questions for journalists: what role does their coverage of such conspiracy theories play in amplifying them? Are there newsbeats that are particularly vulnerable to problematic information? Can they adjust their reporting to avoid aiding the circulation of conspiracist ideas?",

    "abstract": "Abstract Collaborative journalism has drawn mounting interest from both practitioners and researchers over the last decade. Partnerships among news outlets, and between journalists and civil-society groups, have been heralded as ways to leverage digital tools and technologies to produce in-depth, impactful reporting in the face of economic and professional challenges besetting the news industry. While collaboration is widely seen as a way to do more with less, few studies have focused on the mechanisms that allow successful collaborations to overcome competitive friction, particularly at the local level, where resources are most constrained and economic pressures most intense. We used qualitative case-study research, including in-depth interviews (N = 29) with leaders and participants involved with collaborations in three European countries, to examine the ways they minimize competitive friction through their approaches to developing reporting projects, coordinating activities, and distributing benefits in pursuit of producing high-quality local news. We use these findings to propose three ideal types of collaborative practices —here termed the co-op, contractor, and NGO models — which are specific to local news provision and potentially applicable to similar efforts around the world.",

    "title": "Sourcing the BBC’s Live Online Coverage of Terror Attacks",
    "abstract": "The live blog or live page has emerged as a bespoke format for covering breaking news online and represents an important “site” to investigate the impact of social media on news sourcing. This article assesses whether the adoption of live online coverage has facilitated a more “multiperspectival” journalism through the inclusion of “non-official” sources. The article is based on comparative content analyses of the BBC’s coverage of Anders Behring Breivik’s killing spree in 2011 and the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008. The article is strengthened by “triangulating” data from interviews, access to BBC documents and observation work at the BBC. The comparison reveals that the incorporation of eyewitness accounts has driven an increase in the inclusion of “non-official” sources in the BBC’s live online coverage, but it suggests that further significant increases are unlikely. In particular, the use of Twitter was becoming normalised by 2011 both in the range of actors who use the microblogging tool and the BBC’s approach to sourcing content from Twitter. The article suggests that journalists’ approach to sourcing continues to depend as much on conceptions of news values and editorial approach as it does on the live blogging platform through which the news is disseminated.",

    "title": "Is Journalism Gender E-Qual?",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the role of digitalisation in shaping and reproducing gender relations in journalism. It builds on the concepts of Bourdieu’s field theory and its feminist appropriations to study how journalists construct the value of digital capital in this rapidly changing professional field. The journalistic work environment has been changed dramatically by digitisation, while mechanisms of gender bias remain rather constant throughout these developments. The aim of our study is to gain insight into whether and how digital capital is gendered in journalism. The central research question focuses on the value of digital capital in the journalistic profession and how this relates to professional opportunities for female and male journalists. We conducted 24 qualitative interviews with a cross-national sample of journalists who had varying levels of digital proficiency. The results suggest that gender permeates both the evaluation and the accumulation of digital capital in journalism. There was a strong connection with other forms of capital such as gender capital and social capital. The participants also described strategies related to digital capital that could increase the status of women in the field of journalism.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a conceptual and methodological outline for studying the social and political implications of digital surveillance, as it opens itself to journalists and media researchers. Digital surveillance yields a profound social transition, which can be tentatively called as “structural transformation of privacy”. We propose that the empirical analysis on this gradual and abstract process can proceed in two phases. Firstly, attention should be paid key stakeholders and their deeply conflicted positions on the issue of digital surveillance. Secondly, an analytical focus should be set on the dominant discursive principles and justifications that inform the suggested public solutions. This framework is illustrated by some empirical findings from a transnational empirical study that analysed opinionated journalism on Edward Snowden’s revelations from June 2013 to the end of 2014.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents the results of an in-depth ethnographic study of the development of a personalization algorithm in a large regional news organization in Denmark. Drawing on the concept of sociotechnical assemblage, we argue that in the process the news organization moves from distributing news to the users as segments of consuming collectives to algorithmically constructing individual users as aggregated data points. Second, we show how personalization disassembles the constitution of “the news” as a finite arrangement of articles, replacing one structural organization and routinization of news distribution with an algorithmic and numeric form of organizing the distribution. This disassembling leads to negotiations over loss of control, as editors realize that their publicist and democratic mission is at stake and as they struggle building news values such as timeliness and localness into the algorithm, thus “translating back” the agency from the algorithm to the journalistic staff. Finally, we discuss how the negotiations involved in this concrete case study has far reaching implications for the future of journalism, as this transformation further emphasizes the economic value of news for the individual, while putting the societal value of new journalism and audiences as democratic collectives at stake.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A high proportion of non-users of news is considered a concern for a functioning democracy. However, existing empirical assessments on the share of news avoiders rely exclusively on survey data and the results vary drastically between studies, making it difficult to evaluate the severity of the issue. This study relies on tracking data of Swiss Internet users and applies and discusses two computational methods, identifying news at the domain and article level, to realistically assess the extent of non-users of online news. Results indicate that at least 14.2% of Internet users do not use news online. Furthermore, this study suggests that identifying news use solely based on tracking data at the domain level is distorted by a faux news effect, i.e., non-news use on news domains, and an invisible news effect, i.e., news use on small and unknown news domains. The parallel use of tracking data and supervised text classification allows to dissect and discuss these effects systematically. Similarly, it is found that not accounting for news use via apps overestimates the extent of non-use of online news. The findings provide valuable insights for future applications of these methods in similar contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The popularisation of digital media technologies, from the Internet to diverse social media networks, has enabled ordinary citizens to become digital hyperlocal media participants in various localities. The current study examines digital hyperlocal media practices in Seoul from an ontological, ethical and political perspective of care. There is convergence in how digital hyperlocal media constitute a singular form of caring-with, particularly by practicing truth by, for, and of themselves in a locality. In our analysis, care-of-us ethics featured in digital hyperlocal media are actualised in five interrelated elements of ‘space, collectivity, communication, work, and product’—that is, (1) creating and dwelling (space), (2) hosting and joining (collectivity), (3) listening and speaking (communication), (4) shifting and overlapping (work), and (5) versatility and vernacularity (product). Digital hyperlocal media is an incubation (not perfection) of the local public sphere, in which participants, both producers and audiences, are connected as immanent (not established) members of the public, and create threads of potential (not completed) public opinions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Right-wing populists’ online communication relies heavily on images and their emotional appeal. In this article, we study how images of human actors are deployed to engender emotions in their viewers in an example of Finnish-language right-wing alternative media—MV-lehti. We focus on three news cases in the publication’s immigration coverage over 2015–2017. We understand emotions as part of a larger societal meaning-making process that is consciously, culturally and socially produced. Using methods of visual content analysis and critical close reading, we find that the most exclusionary emotions evident in the imagery of people are fear, disgust, hate and distrust. Through these negative emotions, each group of people is represented as a scapegoat for the “distress of ordinary people.” By excluding these groups from “us,” MV-lehti identifies them as representations of Otherness. This goes hand in hand with a distinctive populist style arguing that society is separated into two antagonistic groups—“the pure people” versus “the corrupt elite.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Traditional news factors are still widely recognised as explaining the functionality of news. However, the recent development of social media forces us to consider new news factors and a news genre. Building on the social media logic applied in journalism, we argue that the specificity of social media news may differ from that of traditional news. By applying the notion of shareability and its factors, we investigate the content-related features of social media news, aiming to characterise how traditional and shareability news factors are adopted in popular Facebook posts published by professional journalists. Using a mixed-methods approach and a selection of 29, 141 Facebook posts (2014–2018) from five European countries, we found a significant dominance of visual content (frequency analysis) in social media news from both opinion-leading and tabloid press. Qualitative content analysis of the “top 100 social media news” revealed that social media editors effectively merged the traditional and shareability factors. We distinguished ten groups of factors in which news factors and shareability factors entered into relationships to form attractive textual and visual social media content.",

Through affordance theory, we argue that interfaces of technological artifacts are manifestations of their implicit politics and ideology, given that affordances entail normative claims about what users should do. Our study draws from Google News Initiative and Facebook Journalism Project to explore: how the affordances of FJP and GNI tools allow particular behaviors and encourage certain journalistic norms to emerge? We analyzed nine journalist-oriented tools from FJP and GNI, by performing a discursive interface analysis. Findings indicate that FJP and GNI tools affordances can encourage four distinct journalistic norms: (1) successful journalism should circulate widely on platforms, (2) successful journalism should be aware of the ways competition is measured in FJP and GNI, (3) successful journalism should attract loyal readership as defined by platforms and (4) successful journalism should make money through platforms. We argue that FJP and GNI tools affordances can facilitate a form of platform schooling which, in addition to journalism schools and work environments, can might dictate what is and what is not “successful journalism.”",

    "title": "Social Moments in Solo Videojournalism",
    "abstract": "Solo videojournalism has grown from a practice on the margins of journalism into the mainstream at many television broadcast and online newspaper companies. This qualitative study asks the question: How does a solo videojournalist use digital technology to create visual and social meaning? The study applies medium theory and social semiotics to analyze both the content and the form of one award-winning solo videojournalist production. The solo videojournalist, Dave Delozier, uses technology to serve his personal editorial vision as he depicts how war veterans at a funeral construct their social reality. Thus, the production functions as a social, as well as a visual, medium. The storytelling strategy reflects the photojournalistic conventions of realism and empathy, combined with a professional awareness of the communicative potential of the medium environment. I argue that this multimedia tool can bring a more experiential style of storytelling to journalism, at a time when media audiences expect emotional qualities and authenticity.",

    "abstract": "Journalists at major media houses in South Africa use Twitter as a journalistic tool for crowd sourcing, breaking news events, live blogging and to balance, check and cultivate sources. This paper analyses the use of the social network platform by the top 500 South African journalists. The findings suggest that pluralism and openness are important characteristics of the South African Twitter network. Although two strong sub-networks can be detected, we conclude that they give structure to the network and enhance the role of journalists in public debates and democratic decision-making. This is shown in the analysis of three trending news topics related to politics and crime. The last trending topic of the study questions the process of the individualization of journalism through Twitter. The paper concludes by confronting its generic findings from the perspectives and opinions of leading journalists and editors.",

    "title": "New Media Technologies and Internal Newsroom Creativity in Mozambique",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses the various ways in which a community newspaper in Mozambique is creatively appropriating new media technologies to enhance its news production and distribution practices. Far from being backward, the case of @Verdade demonstrates that despite being under-resourced, community newspapers in Africa are catching up in terms of creatively appropriating new media technologies. Besides spawning new ways of practising journalism, this article argues that the pervasiveness of new media technologies in the routines of the @Verdade newsroom has engendered collaborative storytelling while at the same time destabilizing traditional journalism’s ethical practices. Using data drawn from qualitative research, the study discusses how the use of social network sites, the mobile phone as well as the internet in general are aiding @Verdade to generate and engage with news sources as well as deliver content to diverse audiences. Drawing on structuration theory (as modified by Orlikowski) and the sociology of journalism approach, the paper argues that the disruptive impact of new media technologies needs to be understood as a duality of influences—the human agency of individual journalists and owners (internal newsroom creativity) vis-à-vis the wider context of news production (restructuring of journalism practice).",

    "abstract": "Abstract A number of mobile news apps deploy push notifications that appear on users’ locked screens and alert users to breaking news. Push notifications are theoretically important because they transcend the traditional divide between purposeful and incidental news exposure. We analyze whether push notifications affect people’s reported use of a news app and what people learn about the news. In this paper, we report on the results of a 2 (install the CNN or BuzzFeed News app) × 2 (allow notifications, do not allow notifications) experiment. Approximately two weeks after installing the app, study participants were asked to answer questions about their news use and the topics covered by the mobile notifications. Results revealed that notifications increased self-reported use of the app. There also was evidence of learning from the notifications in some instances, but not all. The research provides empirical evidence of the effects of push notifications, adding to a growing literature on mobile news effects.",

    "title": "From Public Spaces to Public Sphere",
    "abstract": "This study examines how journalists and technologists are re-imagining the construction of networked, dynamic spaces for online news discussion through a qualitative study of 126 idea submissions to a popular news innovation contest. We consider these submissions in the light of the concept of the public sphere, with a specific focus on how these submissions might address shortcomings identified in the literature about the ability of the internet, but of news commenting forums in particular, to serve as an extension of the public sphere. Four main themes emerged in the submissions: a need to (1) better organize content, (2) moderate content more effectively, (3) unite disjointed discourse, and (4) increase participation while promoting diversity. We find in these proposed solutions the possibility for relatively low-cost, easy-to-build systems that could moderate comments more efficiently while also facilitating more civil, cohesive, and diverse discourse; however, we also find the lingering danger of designing new systems that could perpetuate old problems such as fragmentation, filter bubbles, and homogenization. Ultimately, it remains to be seen how technological innovations might help or hinder the ability of the internet, and of news commenting spaces in particular, to serve as an extension of the public sphere. More broadly, by studying how these innovation-contest submissions sought to transform the discursive systems of news websites, we can begin to grasp how the evolution of digital journalism, technologically, might facilitate a broader rethinking about how news institutions could better serve the ideals of deliberation in a changing media environment.",

    "abstract": "Online commenting has become a popular form of audience–journalist interaction. However, journalists have become frustrated with commenters who use forums to attack and make assertions. As journalists look for ways to reign in commenters, it becomes important to consider how journalists make decisions about moderation policies and practices. This study used gatekeeping theory to consider how one organization approached moderation and related issues of content management. The researcher conducted a one-month ethnography of a large news organization and their online forums and discovered that journalists set high expectations of commenters, but willingly accept low-quality content. Journalists appear to struggle with how to institute policies that promote high-quality discourse without engaging in intense battles with the audience and having to devote more resources to moderation. Journalists focus on establishing balance between allowing the audience to have a conversation without allowing that conversation to disrupt the traditional practices of journalism.",

    "abstract": "“Media accountability is back on the political agenda”, this book proclaims. Based on comprehensive empirical studies and with a reference to the News of the World scandal, Journalists and Media Accountability argues that media accountability and transparency remain vital in theory and in practice. Accountability and transparency can be a competitive advantage for quality journalism in a context with many new voices online fighting for our attention. The book presents results from a European Union-funded project called MediaAcT (Media Accountability and Transparency in Europe). A survey of 1762 journalists in 12 European and two neighbouring Arab states (Tunisia and Jordan) provides a convincing factual foundation for the debate on media self-regulation and other media accountability instruments (referred to as MAIs). This empirical-driven study engages in a thorough dialogue with Hallin and Mancini’s (2004) seminal Comparing Media Systems, and endeavours to go beyond Hallin and Mancini. We are reminded by some of the authors that MAIs play only a marginal role in Hallin and Mancini’s approach. In their summary, the editors maintain that Hallin and Mancini disregard a parameter that the present book considers pivotal: the degree of “accountability and transparency” that",

    "abstract": "Abstract Design is a discipline that gives form to alternative futures. Through a process of material exploration, it explores novel configurations of technology, people and values, and in doing so, seeks to understand the implications of new designs. It is this practice of making and creating that is valuable to journalism as it grapples with how to respond to communication technologies that are increasingly subtle, physical and sensuous. In this article we examine the theory of materiality as it has been discussed in communication and design literature, proposing a conceptual approach for a design-led view of materiality in journalism studies. This view sees materiality from a form-giving perspective in which technologies and journalistic principles are materials to shape in order to explore potentials and possibilities. This article extends the concept of journalism design by examining how journalistic values can be incorporated into the design of public interest technologies. In doing so, it frames journalism as a process of designing things that respond to public concerns.

    "title": "The Three “Cs” of Digital Local Journalism: Community, Commitment and Continuity",
    "abstract": "Abstract In a rapidly changing digital world, scholars have focused on new technologies, communication trends, and have re-imagined new ways of doing or transforming journalism. In these endeavours, however, local journalism has received relatively little attention despite the sector going through fundamental changes. In this introduction to the special issue Disrupting and resettling the local in digital news spaces, we suggest that while the practice of local journalism has been shaken, even decimated in parts of some countries, it is beginning to resettle with renewed clarity about its role and purpose. Articles in this issue suggest there are three interconnecting elements of local journalism in a digital world: community, commitment and continuity. Local media practices orbit around a connection to certain geographies and physical spaces. Audiences expect journalists to reinforce and represent a sense of community (and care) and this develops through a commitment to a place and its people that is established over time. Tensions then, can emerge between “old” ways of doing things and how digital technologies and practices can best complement, recreate, immerse and/or reinforce this relationship. Rather than view digital as a “shiny” superior way to do “local” journalism or as simply a way to reduce costs, we must find an in-between.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sharing and discussing visual images in WhatsApp groups functions as a form of phatic news sharing to achieve a sense of togetherness and sociability. We explore how visual media content shared in personal WhatsApp interactions during the first strict lockdown months of the COVID-19 pandemic functions as phatic news. Our study addresses a gap in journalism studies in researching news-related and visual content from user perspectives. Our article provides insights into how the “semi-private” space of WhatsApp offers people a digital communication space to deal with becoming a news subject during the crisis: people appropriate news by shaping it into different visual forms which can be attractively shared on WhatsApp. We focus on working adults (aged 25–49) in urban areas in Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. Visual phatic news sharing on WhatsApp combines public and private aspects, especially how people address issues of public concern through their private WhatsApp communication. Our conclusions reveal how WhatsApp functions as a sense-making practice and vehicle for ontological security in dealing with the fearful and unsettling crisis situation. The visual images shared are a hybrid form of communication, blurring boundaries between private life and public concerns presented on the news.",

    "abstract": "Internet centrism, the notion that online tools play substantial roles in social and political processes, is frequently invoked by journalists, pundits, and academics. Existing research has explored this idea directly in the case of protest, attempting to discern the actual magnitude of the internet’s role in protest organization and mobilization. Taking a different approach, we conduct a content analysis to examine the extent to which internet centrism is discussed in articles about the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring in mainstream US newspapers and technology blogs. Our main findings are that the role of publication type in predicting internet centrism depends upon which protest is being discussed, and the role of protest type depends upon publication type. This study lends a theoretical perspective to an under-studied journalistic phenomenon with the potential to influence how audiences think about the causes and consequences of protests.",

    "abstract": "Growing concern for the future news consumption of young people and millennials has left journalism scholars and educators with the interesting challenge of engaging youth in news. Rendered “newsless” by one Pew Research report, this study examines news organizations’ publication practices in the largely under-researched and youth-oriented social network Tumblr. Results suggest that while news organizations have become increasingly involved in social media networks, many have created a digital presence on Tumblr and failed to maintain their accounts. Of the few that do consistently post, content appears to be tailored to adhere to the culture of the Tumblr platform, and posts are diversified in terms of format and topic. Surprisingly, though the majority of Tumblr users are considered to be young people and young adults, audience activity totals indicate that user interests may stretch beyond entertainment, widening assumptions that youth are primarily interested in entertainment, sports, and trivial news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The tension between health and economic considerations regarding COVID-19 has resulted in a framing contest, in which proponents and adversaries of strong containment measures hold oppositional frames about the pandemic. This study examines the effects of competing news frames on social media users' policy preferences and the moderation of framing effects played by melodramatic news treatment. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment in Chile (N = 518) show that participants exposed to Facebook posts with an economic frame were significantly less supportive of measures that restrict mobility (e.g., quarantines) than participants in the control group. Contrary to expectations, exposure to a public health frame also reduced support for stay-at-home orders, and the presence of melodramatic features had no significant impact on users' preferences. Other variables, however, did alter these framing effects, such as fear of COVID-19 and frequency of social media news use. These findings paint a rather complex picture of framing effects during the pandemic in a digital media environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to digitization, traditional media brands are facing hypercompetition. For one thing, media outlets offering journalistic content no longer compete just with each other but also with all sorts of content from various sources, such as corporate publishers. This particularly applies to the information space provided by Google and other search engines. This leads to the question of how traditional media brands prevail in this information space: do traditional media brands have a competitive advantage because users perceive their journalistic content as more valuable in terms of credibility and reputation? Accordingly, this study investigates competition and user selection on Google. Drawing on a representative, experimental selection study of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 1,100), search engine selection behavior was investigated. Results show that selection preferences do not differ between traditional media brands and other competitors, such as corporate publishers. This poses a major challenge for media brands. However, credibility and reputation significantly influence selection preferences. Thus, media managers should focus on effective branding activities in order to maintain a strong position in the digital information market.",

    "abstract": "In order to examine how the same types of social media are perceived and utilized in different national contexts for journalism and news media, we studied mainstream newspapers in three countries where both newspapers and social media are viable: Japan, Korea, and Finland. Our in-depth interviews with journalists indicate both similarities and differences in the three countries. The most outstanding similarity is that newspapers have not fully incorporated cross-level communications available on social media platforms. Factors related to organizational structures, goals, policies, and procedures served as filters for the incorporation of social media into the news production and distribution system. On the other hand, differences were influenced by socio-economic factors in the three countries. Japan revealed a presence of strong offline networks of journalists and social systems; a strong online intermediary and corporate structure was found in Korea; while sparse resources were found to limit online activities in Finland.

    "abstract": "This study offers a content analysis of Twitter activity by 16 American political opinion magazines during the month before the 2012 presidential election. The study attempts to operationalize aspects of tweets that may contribute to frame alignment processes and mobilization among Twitter users. The analysis identifies these components and examines how political magazines’ Twitter activity may demonstrate aspects of this process. These magazines must consider both the normative goal of achieving specific political gains by mobilizing readers and the pragmatic goal of remaining sustainable as publishing enterprises. The degree to which their Twitter usage reflects frame alignment processes may not only reinforce political mobilization, but also affect the longevity of their publications. This analysis offers practical and theoretical insights into the changing role of political magazines in an increasingly digital era of political engagement.",

It is much less a critical evaluation of the technical and economic mobile ecosystem for news and its implications for media, journalists, and the audience. Further, from a broader perspective, most of the book is not specifically about mobile phones or social media but about the Internet itself. The second concern is the epistemic progression of shared knowledge: tenor fifteenyear-old research from the emancipatory era of the “Arab Spring” is mixed with more recent academic work in which the view of social media is much more critical, to the point of framing Facebook as a threat to democracy. The decoupling of media and journalism from platforms – deplatformisation – is becoming more than a distant dream and the ecosystem of smartphones is a central issue in that process.",

Based on a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with nine TV news and LiveU’s professionals, the findings point to various interconnections between LiveU’s technology and certain professional actors through a variety of editorial, business and technological decision-making processes and activities that constitute live-news broadcasting. Essentially, the case of LiveU and its implementation in professional TV live-news broadcasting illustrate the intersection of news mobility and the production of news from a socio-technical standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies of hyperlocal journalism and news have not adequately taken into account audience members’ everyday experiences of their own hyperlocal communities and the ways in which audiences’ everyday information environments are integrated with their social and affective community environments. In this focus group study (six groups, 5–7 participants/group, total N = 38) of neighbourhoods in Rivertown, Sweden (a mid-sized Swedish municipality) we combine Henri Lefebvre’s theory of rhythmanalysis and his idea of “the media day” with Ray Oldenburg’s concept of third places to analyse the spatiotemporal aspects of hyperlocal information environments. The focus group participants created individual “media day” timelines and then discussed them, and their neighbourhoods, in the groups. Our findings are in line with other recent studies on digital and local news and information consumption, but also highlight how the media context has changed since Lefebvre’s and Oldenburg’s studies. In particular, we found that their juxtapositions of “authentic” interpersonal communication and “inauthentic” mediated communication still have some relevance in the contemporary media landscapes (particularly as related to the existence of neighbourhood third places) and that some hyperlocal digital information sources (Facebook groups) appear to contribute to dressage in Lefebvre’s sense.",

    "abstract": "This study is concerned with the news values and working practices that inform the creation of interactive infographics in UK online news. The author draws upon organisational theory in journalism studies, and considers how conventional journalistic news values compare with best practice as espoused in different literatures within this field. A series of open-ended, depth interviews with visual news journalists from the UK national media were undertaken, along with a short-term observation case study at a national online news publisher. Journalistic and organisational norms are found to shape the selection, production, and treatment of interactive graphics, and a degree of variation is found to exist amongst practitioners as to definitions of quality in this field. Some news stories are considered to be better suited to rendering in interactive form than others. The availability of “big data” does not drive decision-making in itself, but some numbers are considered more newsworthy than others. Budgetary constraint drives practice and limits potential in this field. Risk aversion, embodied in various forms; from the use of templates, to a perceived need to avoid audience complaint, is found to dampen experimentation. Detailed audience research was found to inform the choice of methods used in data visualisation at one national news producer. This warrants further investigation as to how audiences engage with news interactives, and what the framing of news in certain (preferred) data visualisation formats means in terms of how news is understood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Although the intersection of social media usage and journalism practice enjoys a prominent place in many scholarly inquiries throughout the field of journalism studies, a comprehensive understanding of this body of literature is lacking. This study attempts to alleviate this problem. Through a systematic analysis of more than 150 studies primarily focusing on how journalists utilize social media in newswork, this article first classifies social media usage into three broad categories: news construction, news dissemination, and branding. Next, this study introduces a typology that visualizes and explores three dimensions of social media use: motivation (self vs. organization), prevalence (sporadic vs. prevalent), and disruption (disruptive vs. normalization). Our findings illustrate potential future research areas.",

    "abstract": "Scholars conceptualize journalism’s transformation and explain the changes occurring at different levels under the rubric of convergence. Contrary to optimistic views of convergence, claiming for its potential to satisfy both good journalism and good business practices, the paper argues that at times of economic uncertainty, hyper-competition and diminishing accountability levels, convergence is used as a cost-effective strategy fostering low-cost and spreadable news production. Engaging in quantitative analysis, the article provides empirical evidence showing that the recycling of news content from established elite sources and across popular news sites has increased between 2013 and 2016, posing serious threats for content plurality and independent reporting. Despite online journalism’s development as a field, and the appearance of social networks and user-generated content as alternative and easyily accessible sources, a pervasive survival and monetization culture has turned churning into a mainstream journalistic practice.",

    "abstract": "Amid the rise of computational and data-driven forms of journalism, it is important to consider the institutions, interactions, and processes that aim to help the social worlds of journalism and technology come together and collaborate around a common cause of news innovation. This paper examines one of the most prominent such efforts: the transnational grassroots organization called Hacks/Hackers. Through a two-year qualitative case study, we sought to understand just how journalists and technologists would engage through this organization: what kinds of interactions would occur, and what factors might facilitate collaboration? Drawing upon the science and technology studies concept of “trading zones,” we examine how Hacks/Hackers functions as an informal and transitory trading zone through which journalists and technologists can casually meet and coordinate. The level of engagement between the two groups, we found, depends on a set of social and structural factors, including institutional support and the leadership of key volunteers, and the depth of that engagement depends on sufficient mutual understanding among journalists and hackers. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the challenges and opportunities presented through the intersection of journalism and technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Media scholars exploring online harassment of journalists have described it as a form of ‘mob censorship,’ a type of citizen vigilantism aimed at delegitimizing and silencing journalists. Arguably, this trend is most pervasive in India, where online supporters of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) troll and abuse journalists critical of the Narendra Modi government. Over the years, the BJP has harnessed the digital work of these online Hindu nationalists for agenda setting, spreading their political ideology, and influencing public discourse. Such a symbiotic relationship between the mob and the state has put to question the argument distinguishing mob censorship and state censorship of the press. Through a qualitative textual analysis of tweets posted by online Hindu nationalists, this article explores the discursive strategies employed by right-wing activists to influence the BJP government in its censorship of the press. This study finds that through tactics such as calls to ‘cancel’ journalists, intimidation of foreign correspondents, and digital surveillance of news reporters, online Hindu nationalists aid the BJP government in the suppression of dissident reporting in India.",

    "title": "The Invisible Infrastructures of Online Visibility: An Analysis of the Platform-Facing Markup Used by U.S.-Based Digital News Organizations",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study analyzes and compares how the digital semantic infrastructure of U.S. based digital news varies according to certain characteristics of the media outlet, including the community it serves, the content management system (CMS) it uses, and its institutional affiliation (or lack thereof). Through a multi-stage analysis of the actual markup found on news outlets’ online text articles, we reveal how multiple factors may be limiting the discoverability and reach of online media organizations focused on serving specific communities. Conceptually, we identify markup and metadata as aspects of the semantic infrastructure underpinning platforms’ mechanisms of distributing online news. Given the significant role that these platforms play in shaping the broader visibility of news content, we further contend that this markup therefore constitutes a kind of infrastructure of visibility by which news sources and voices are rendered accessible—or, conversely—invisible in the wider platform economy of journalism. We accomplish our analysis by first identifying key forms of digital markup whose structured data is designed to make online news articles more readily discoverable by search engines and social media platforms. We then analyze 2,226 digital news stories gathered from the main pages of 742 national, local, Black, and other identity-based news organizations in mid-2021, and analyze each for the presence of specific tags reflecting the Schema.org, OpenGraph, and Twitter metadata structures. We then evaluate the relationship between audience focus and the robustness of this digital semantic infrastructure. While we find only a weak relationship between the markup and the community served, additional analysis revealed a much stronger association between these metadata tags and content management system (CMS), in which 80% of the attributes appearing on an article were the same for a given CMS, regardless of publisher, market, or audience focus. Based on this finding, we identify the organizational characteristics that may influence the specific CMS used for digital publishing, and, therefore, the robustness of the digital semantic infrastructure deployed by the organization. Finally, we reflect on the potential implications of the highly disparate tag use we observe, particularly with respect to the broader visibility of online news designed to serve particular US communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Through a mixed methods research design, we address normative aspects of news recommendation engines by examining whether search personalisation and news diversity are evident on Google News in the UK. First, in a quasi-experimental design, we asked a diverse set of participants (N = 78) to search Google News using four search terms and report the first five articles recommended for each term. We found little evidence of news personalisation, which challenges the claim that news search algorithms contribute to weakened viewpoint diversity. We also found a high degree of homogeneity in news search results, with legacy media brands dominating. Second, we conducted a manual content analysis of the articles recommended by Google News for our search terms (N = 192), focusing on favourability towards each term. We found that while there was little relationship between the favourability slant of the articles and political leanings of participants, there were two exceptions: self-identified right-wing participants were more likely to see unfavourable stories about 1) immigration, and 2) a left-wing politician. This reopens the question of news search engines’ contributions to polarisation and viewpoint diversity for certain news consumers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we used a multimodal method to examine a visual dataset posted on Instagram that references #CNN and #FoxNews. Using visual analysis, we inductively categorized the memes into nine major types and identified the most referenced hashtags associated with these memes. Our method provided more insight into the different meanings of memes. Building on the theoretical concept of networked flak, the findings indicate that Instagram memes which mention CNN and Fox News are often politically polarizing and largely critical of these two news channels, especially CNN (25.4%) and to a lesser extent Fox News (15.6%). We argue that routinely trolling news channels creates a polarized political environment and is meant to put pressure on journalists which, if successful, could potentially influence them.",

    "abstract": "Digitalisation has changed journalistic sourcing techniques and affected the way journalists approach sources. This study examines how new information channels change the relationship between journalists and their (potential) sources in this evolving environment and analyses the role of these channels. We are not only interested in the sources that make it into the news, but study the broader networks of people and institutions journalists rely on to help them monitor and gather information. We combine online Twitter network analysis with in-depth interviews to create a detailed mapping of the professional source networks of 33 economic journalists in Belgium. Our results identify that the Twitter networks of economic journalists to a large extent reflect their broader sourcing practices. Overall, the same actor groups are important in both the online and the offline source networks with the exception of the more prominent presence of other journalists and media organisations in the Twitter network of journalists. We conclude that Twitter is implemented within existing sourcing practices without fundamentally changing the news production process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the impact of social media on journalistic identity presentation in China. We empirically link micro conceptions of journalists and macro changes in media ecology through ethnographic observations of daily routines in a party press. Specifically, our scrutiny of Chinese journalists’ use of WeChat Moments, an equivalent of Twitter, uncovered patterns showing that media organizations’ increasing dependence on state subsidies has resulted in the decline of professional ideals and forced journalists to gravitate to utilitarian values in their professional and commercial pursuits. The resulting precarity of malleable multiplicity identity creates tensions between self-branding and propaganda goals. Findings point to a change in the direction of Chinese journalism toward an increasing yielding to the influence of new media technology and the tightened grip of ideological control. This study enriches existing discussions on multiplicity of social media and liquid identities in information industry.",

Given the dire situation for Mexican reporters covering the northern part of the country, and the continued responsibility of US journalists to report on the area just south of the border, this qualitative study addresses the overarching research question that examines how Mexican and US journalists who cover northern Mexico are using social media, given the heightened levels of violence in the region. The authors utilize a modified version of the conceptual framework of scale-shifting to investigate how journalists in a specific transnational environment of conflict are using social media. The study is based on a qualitative analysis of 41 interviews gathered in fall 2011 in 18 cities with news media outlets along the United States–Mexico border. Findings describe the innovative ways that journalists are circumventing online security risks (what the authors call scale-shifting) and how social media are used to build cross-border relationships.",

Journalists use these vox pops to give an impression of public opinion. With the coming of social media, access to people’s opinions has never been so easy. Little research exists about how social media (Twitter in particular) are used by journalists to describe public opinion. This is the question this research aims to answer by using a combination of a qualitative and a quantitative content analysis of Dutch and Flemish news websites. We found several patterns regarding the use of Twitter vox pops. First, we found Twitter to be regularly used as a representation of public opinion. Second, many items generalised these opinions to larger groups with strong—mostly negative—emotions. Third, when referring to Twitter, the articles used (abstract) quantifiers and hyperbolic terms (commotion, explosions) to imply an objective basis for these inferences about the “vox Twitterati”.",

    "title": "Why Do People Share Political Information on Social Media?",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates factors predicting political information sharing on social media in the election context. Specifically, the current study examines how users’ six motivations for political information sharing and exposure to political disagreement on social media predict their political information sharing behaviors. Analyses of national survey data collected before the 2018 U.S. midterm election suggest that criticism, informing, and socialization motivations, but not expression, awareness, and self-promotion motivations, positively predict political information sharing on social media. Individuals are more likely to share political information when they are exposed to information that is disagreeable. This relationship is stronger among individuals with higher epistemic political efficacy and lower political knowledge.",

    "title": "To Nudge or Not to Nudge: News Recommendation as a Tool to Achieve Online Media Pluralism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Recent policy documents propose the use of recommender technology to realise online media pluralism goals. Specifically, they may enable citizens to access a diversity of viewpoints concerning matters of public interest via digital means (“public service recommender systems”). On the basis of Article 10 ECHR, States are arguably required to guarantee such “online access diversity.” At the same time, they must, pursuant to that same provision, at all times ensure that individuals maintain autonomy and freedom of choice as regards whether or not to consume certain content. In that context, this contribution argues that policymakers may consider “nudging” people toward reading diversely through recommendation (libertarian-paternalistic approach). Additionally, it points to the possibility of merely offering users the tools to do so, thereby allowing them to make an (informed) choice as regards whether to use them or not (libertarian approach). The first approach presumably best mitigates chances of selective exposure, whilst the second is more “liberty-preserving.” In either case, States comply with their positive and negative obligations stemming from the freedom to receive information and ideas (without interference by public authority) and the freedom to hold opinions.",

    "abstract": "Digital technologies and big data are rapidly transforming humanitarian crisis response and changing the traditional roles and powers of its actors. This article looks at a particular aspect of this transformation—the appearance of digital volunteer networks—and explores their potential to act as a new source for media coverage, in addition to their already established role as emergency response supporters. I argue that digital humanitarians can offer a unique combination of speed and safe access, while escaping some of the traditional constraints of the aid-media relationship and exceeding the conventional conceptualizations of citizen journalism. Journalists can find both challenges and opportunities in the environment where multiple crisis actors are assuming some of the media roles. The article draws on interviews with humanitarian organizations, journalists, and digital volunteer networks about their understanding of digital humanitarian communication and its significance for media coverage of crises.",

This paper argues that the “reactive” approach to source protection that seeks to build a legal defence if required, is no longer adequate in the context of workforce monitoring, and that publishers need to update their policies and practice to address ongoing change in the environment for journalists and sources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The coronavirus pandemic has had a profound impact on all spheres of society, including journalism. It has brought about dramatic changes in journalistic routines and working practices, as well as in audience behavior. In this introduction to a special issue of Digital Journalism focused on the impact of the pandemic, we make the case that it should be seen as a critical moment for journalism – a moment of significant importance and reconsideration of past, present and future. This view of the coronavirus crisis as a critical moment can reveal multiple co-occurring, partially overlapping and, in some cases, also paradox developments: it can be (a) a turning point, (b) a transformation, (c) an amplifier, (d) a starting point or (e) destruction. The articles included in the special issue reveal the multitude of profound effects the coronavirus crisis has had on journalism in a very short time span and elaborate on the potential upheaval this may bring in the future. Ultimately, the crisis represents an opportunity to rethink the meaning and practices of digital journalism. It invites journalism researchers to explore new and innovative methods, as well as the reassessment of existing categories, concepts and theories.",

    "abstract": "The notion of the “blurring boundaries” has become a flashy label to characterize the way journalism is manifestly changing in the age of the internet. This article explores this idea of de-boundedness and discusses the question whether there is anything more behind it than a catch-all diagnosis for the processes of change and transformation in the circumstances of communication in society, in general, and for journalism, in particular. To this end, de-boundedness as a proposition initially receives a more concrete definition. Its foundations in theories of differentiation and especially in the theory of social systems by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann will be discussed, where differentiation, that is, drawing lines of demarcation, is the essential factor. It is shown that systems theory provides different possibilities for characterizing forms of de-differentiation or “blurring boundaries”. Within systems theory they can be interpreted in terms of the evolutionary emergence of new forms of journalism, the co-evolutionary processes between journalism and its environment and/or as interpenetrations of journalism with other societal systems. It is demonstrated that changes in journalism oscillate between differentiation and de-differentiation, so that it can be described as a (de-)differentiated phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extant research on how innovations diffuse among news organizations over time has largely focussed on democratic contexts. By contrast, this is the first longitudinal study to investigate the spread of a participatory newsroom innovation under authoritarian rule. Adopting a multiple case study design, the article reconstructs the histories of comment sections on the opinion-leading online media in two authoritarian contexts, which varied maximally with regard to the outcome of the diffusion process. In Belarus, the diffusion process followed a classic S-shaped curve of adoption, whereas in Azerbaijan adoption rates remained low during the studied period. The study identified primarily three factors that obstructed the diffusion process in Azerbaijan: (1) the restrictive policy of the authoritarian leadership specifically towards audience participation on news websites (social system), (2) the low intensity of communicative exchange between local and foreign news organizations (communication channels), (3) the advent of the successor technology in 2010 (time).",

Drawing on in-depth interviews with journalists working in six alternative media projects, we inform on the news production process, the news values and normative ideals adopted by these journalists while covering the news and explore if they make use of similar or different organizational structures. Our research invites a rethinking of alternative media to focus on their unique features and the differing experiences and values of their journalists. Our findings indicate that, alternative professional journalists’ news production routines in both countries vary based on their organization’s scale, normative ideals, the political and media contexts in which they operate. In this study, we reflect on what these different news production routines accomplish or fail to, and their broader implications for journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The contemporary high-choice media environment, characterized by information abundance, makes it increasingly difficult for media outlets to capture audience attention. This concern is particularly pressing for social media, and more specifically for Facebook. Because user engagement is a crucial input factor for the algorithm, fears have risen that journalistic content on digital news media and especially on social media is becoming softer to help adjust to news consumer’s interests. A content analysis was conducted on four consecutive weeks of all news items published online by five market-leading Belgian media outlets (N = 10,579) in order to analyse whether the news supply is adapted to “what the metrics say” and, subsequently, to what extent that metric data is used to promote a “softer” supply of news on Facebook. To measure audience engagement, we used unique metrics provided by the news organizations themselves. The results show that audience metrics support and enhance news softening on the Facebook pages of mainstream media outlets.",

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of social media as news sources, a new common format element for presenting news has emerged: in addition to the classic headline, lead and picture, news organizations add a status message when they share their news articles on social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Based on media logic theory, we argue that the communication style of these messages is likely to be more interpersonal and subjective. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to compare status messages to headlines and leads, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years. We conclude that newspapers use status messages to add a subjective expression to news on social media, and call for research into how this takes shape and affects the audience.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How issues are framed in journalism in terms of problems, solutions, and levels of responsibility is of great importance in order to engage and lead toward individual and collective action. Data journalism has been acknowledged as a practice that often features a high level of interactivity, with the potential to engage the public. In this study, we investigate the content and production of climate change reporting in Swedish public service data journalism and discuss how frames are used in this alternative form of moderated science communication. Our results indicate an unconventional merger between science communication and data journalistic practices where motivational framing is used only to some extent as a way to increase public engagement with climate change. We also found that producers focus on educating and raising awareness rather than engaging the public and that they are guided by the ideal of objectivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To capture audiences’ attention on social media, news outlets may disseminate journalistic content in line with platform instead of mass media logics, indicating a platformization of news. Taking a cross-platform, multi-modal approach, we analyze how German outlets select and adapt existing stories for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. We combine a computational and a manual content analysis of articles and social media posts (N = 4,412), including related images/videos (N = 6,850). Overall, evidence for outlets following platform logics on social media is limited: News outlets select and adapt news on a technical level, for instance by distributing more content on news-centered platforms like Twitter or by fostering on-platform engagement by excluding external links on Instagram. However, they do not systematically select or adapt news on a more communicative level, for instance by preferring specific topics for social media or by using more engaging language on platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In order to better understand alternative news media, we need to focus more centrally on the audiences that regularly consume them. This special issue, entitled “Contesting the Mainstream: Understanding Alternative News Media,” advances such an audience turn. In the introduction, we outline how scholars have understood and characterized alternative news audiences. These have ranged from seeing them as (i) ideal participants and activists; as (ii) being misinformed and manipulated; and as (iii) being critical users. Drawing on studies published in this special issue, we highlight how these studies provide new and revealing empirical insights that advance all three perspectives. Taken together, the articles make a strong argument to move beyond binary ideations of normatively “good” or “bad” alternative news audiences. In our view, they signal the need to better understand the complexity behind audience engagement not just with alternative news media but mainstream journalism more generally. Based on this argument, we identify several starting points for moving the field forward with such an audience turn in mind.",

    "title": "Studies in the Efficacy of Motion Graphics",
    "abstract": "Contemporary digital news packages (packages) frequently embed media elements such as motion graphics alongside the story’s primary content. A motion graphic uses animated two- and three-dimensional computer-generated imagery and typography to present visual explanations of the topic(s) covered by the feature. Graphics editors and other newsroom personnel alike have been increasingly critical of motion graphics because, according to Viera, “many motion graphics are nothing but a set of visual metaphors strung together to support the hypothesis voiced by the narrator”. Using a mixed design study, this paper examines how narrative structure can be imposed upon motion graphics according to the theory of visual narrative grammar in order to provide viewing experiences that resonate with an audience. The findings of the study are capable of advising newsroom personnel of the circumstances under which the narrative structure of motion graphics can be manipulated or maintained for maximum effectiveness within a package.",

    "abstract": "Many studies and their findings are available concerning most aspects of online user comments and their effects. But there are few data regarding the question of whether user comments have an impact on an audience’s assessment of journalistic quality, and regarding the question of how user comments and the actual journalistic quality interact. Therefore, two experimental studies were conducted. In both experiments, the quality of a journalistic product and the valence of user comments were manipulated. The results indicate that, overall, high-quality journalistic products were evaluated as (slightly) better than low-quality versions. Furthermore, users evaluated the quality of journalistic products with positive user comments as better than the quality of identical products with negative comments. Considering that, in reality, user comments are predominantly critical, it is worrying that these comments have rather negative effects on the evaluation of journalistic work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite it being somewhat of a niche project back in 2009, at this stage of its evolution, data journalism has gained significant traction to grow into a maturing field. However, little is known about the intersection of data journalism and collaboration in the news organizations’ business models from an infrastructure perspective, that is, key activities, key resources, and partner networks. These elements play an important role in the business model as they outline how an organization can optimize the efficiency within the business to provide the public with the best value proposition, in this case, data storytelling. Therefore, through a systematic literature review, this study aims to identify research trends and gaps in the field, conceptualize current paradigmatic views and therein provide clear propositions to guide future research in the entanglements of data journalism, collaboration, and business models. The originality of this study is rooted in the comprehensive search and systematic review of studies in the discourse around data and collaborative journalisms as part of the news organizations’ business models, which have not been unified to date, although both practices became popularized with the digitization of news organizations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Assessments of the trustworthiness of news outlets necessarily implicate visual design. The design of the newspaper has been a hallmark of its credibility; a newspaper looks trustworthy. But the relationship between design and trust is more complicated in a digital era. Agents of mis- and dis-information produce “fake” news outlets that look trustworthy, appropriating the design qualities of credible news outlets. This article brings together literature on trust in journalism, political esthetics, and pragmatist semiotics to analyze how fake news outlets seek to achieve trust. We conduct a visual analysis of both mainstream and “fake” news websites, identifying how “fake” news websites employ specific design elements in patterned ways that simultaneously (1) establish themselves as legitimate claimants to the label of “news outlet” and (2) differentiate themselves as outlets that can be depended upon to provide a certain class of political information that falls outside the mainstream. We argue that the news website is best understood as a design genre, within which there can be variations in design style. Fake news outlets must conform to the genre expectations of news websites. Beyond this, fake news websites must also employ design elements in ways that convey political ideology through style.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents a longitudinal analysis of the resource exchanges between news organizations and third-parties in the use of mobile news apps. As user data constitute a critical strategic resource in the digital economy, third-party capture of user data challenges the governance of news organizations. Analyzing the prevalence and distribution of resource exchanges, the article maps connections between an international sample of mobile news apps (n = 24) and external third-parties in 2016, 2017, and 2021. Consistent with earlier studies, the analysis shows that all news organizations engage in resource exchanges, but also that while the extent varies between organizations, the extent and complexity of the general network increases over time. Furthermore, an ownership analysis of the third-parties reveals the network dominance of Google. These findings contribute to the understanding of the digital transformation of news organizations and of the digital economy of the news industry, emphasizing the network power of third-parties and discussing the organizational, democratic, and privacy-related implications of resource exchanges in the digital news industry.",

    "title": "The Business of Slow Journalism",
    "abstract": "This study examines the commercial viability of Slow Journalism in light of its recent efforts to reinvent the business model in the news industry today that relies heavily or exclusively on display advertising for revenue. Some Slow Journalism companies, such as De Correspondent and Delayed Gratification, have defiantly positioned themselves in opposition to advertising’s prominent role in mitigating free online news production and consumption, which they argue is both philosophically and financially anathema to the intimate journalist–reader interface. Still others, such as Narratively, have also eliminated display advertisements, but openly embrace brand sponsorship through events, creative agency, and native advertising. Touting visually pleasing high-end production values for immersive reading environments free of distracting display advertisements, many publishers promote a relation in which supply meets demand without undisclosed, conflicting third-party or corporate interest. This research explores the methods by which several prominent Slow Journalism organizations have mobilized a critique of corporate media to strategically communicate their maverick missions. The case studies examine Delayed Gratification, De Correspondent, Narratively, and The Big Roundtable as expressions of Slow Journalism’s experimental approaches to for-profit enterprise through alternative media business models.",

    "abstract": "Data visualisation is an area developing strongly in sports journalism. Via the example of football in Germany, this article presents a survey of current potentials of data journalism in sport. We have analysed the challenges of assessing and publishing data in professional online sports journalism. By means of five interviews with experts and an analysis of the content of three special-interest blogs, trends in the use of data in sports reporting, as well as the potentials and dangers, were shown. Here, we can identify, above all, the complexity of football, the incorporation of data without any context, the danger of tailoring data to a topic, as well as mistakes in entering data as problems. For sports journalists, relevant are a lack of (technical) knowledge, the increasing time pressure and growing expectations of recipients. Our analysis reveals that data must not be seen as the equivalent of objectivity. It does not seem possible to capture an entire sporting competition with data-driven journalism. It has become clear that the demands on sports journalists will grow in future, if they want to add value for recipients by applying data.",

    "title": "Comparing Risks to Journalism: Media Criticism in the Digital Hate",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines digital media criticism—publicly shared evaluations and judgements of journalistic text and actors on various digital platforms—as a risk to journalism. It specifically interrogates how journalists negotiate the diverse nature of criticism in digital spaces and in a comparative context. Through qualitative interviews with practising journalists, the paper identifies the following four main journalistic responses to digital media criticism: consolidation (ringfencing journalistic discourse); filtering (cleaning up journalistic discourse); rationalisation (acknowledging criticism or non-responses) and counter-discourse (counteracting anti-media discourses). These responses, referred to as forms of digital discursive resistance, show that journalists are both defensive against and accommodating of risks to journalistic authority, but usually aim to reinforce and expand journalistic discourse in digital spaces.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge of scholarly interest in citizen photojournalism is part of a wider paradigm shift in journalism studies involving the bringing into the foreground of the hitherto marginal issues of non-corporate media forms and citizen journalism. This paper aims to contribute to current debates about citizen photojournalism by focusing on the still inadequate and often quite problematic conceptualization of the history, role and functions of non-professional photography in the modern public sphere. Following a critical review of some of the most problematic terms and biases found in the current literature about citizen photojournalism, particular attention is given to the implications that the ambiguous cultural status traditionally ascribed to photojournalism has for the still contentious character and significance of citizen photojournalism.",

    "title": "The Role of News Brands and Leads in Exposure to Political Information on the Internet",
    "abstract": "Today, the internet serves a wealth of news sources that encourages selective exposure to attitude-consistent and likeminded information. Several cues have been proposed to influence selective exposure, including partisanship, familiarity, and differential framing techniques. This study investigates the effects of news brand partisanship and news lead partisanship on selective exposure behaviors to internet news stories. With online news, it is possible that news brands believed to have a particular partisan bias may feature stories with an opposite partisan bias. This paper asks which of the two tested selective exposure cues used in this study participants respond to in an online news search environment. Using a non-college adult sample of 382 participants, this study confirms that selective exposure behavior is robust in a simulated news search environment and that news brand partisanship is a more powerful predictor of exposure than is news lead partisanship. The study finds, however, that the news brand effect on selective exposure is diminished when the news brand partisanship and news lead conflict with one another. The implications of the findings are discussed, and future directions for research are proposed.",

    "title": "Readers Comments on Zimbabwean Newspaper Websites",
    "abstract": "Using qualitative data drawn from in-depth interviews with journalists, this study investigates how leading print newsrooms in Zimbabwe are adapting to the wave of changes spawned by readers’ comments on their websites. It specifically examines how newspaper journalists are handling the “new” context in which strangers contribute and respond directly to something they alone once controlled. The paper further explores the professional and ethical dilemmas emerging with the volumes of user-generated content posted on the websites and the approaches taken by newsrooms in managing and “gatekeeping” the content. The study generally observes that while newsrooms are still broadly adjusting to the influx of readers’ voices in their territory, the comments are increasingly shaping and contributing to the dynamics of newsmaking in ways that point to an emerging ecological reconfiguration and recasting of dimensions of news production. In the same way, the comment forums embody spaces for public deliberation. However, the lack of clear gatekeeping strategies has opened floodgates of abuses and extremist views that pose serious threats to the core values of news as well as the normative ideals of traditional journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite rising scholarly interest in online violence as an “occupational hazard” for journalists, we know little about the dynamics that shape the often-limited support given by media organizations to media workers affected by online violence. In this study, I explore how the working environment of journalists constrains opportunities for addressing gendered online violence. Through a total of 27 interviews with experts and media workers in the United Kingdom and India, I find that these structural barriers play out through three main dynamics: stratified access to support resources, workplace norms that punish reporting online violence as signs of “weakness,” and precarious conditions that leave journalists with little control over their work. Adverse press freedom conditions also appear to exacerbate the impact of these dynamics. Relating these findings to broader inequality regimes in the contemporary working world, I argue that online violence both reinforces and is reinforced by inequality regimes within media organizations. In the same way that organizations often fail to adequately address other forms of workplace harassment, structural barriers complicate newsroom responses to online violence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Subscriptions are an increasingly vital part of newsrooms’ business models as the industry experiences sharp declines in advertising revenue. To date, research has not examined how digital subscription appeals affect news subscription intentions. The current study investigates the effectiveness of gain- and loss-framed messages on clicking on subscription appeals, connecting literature on prospect theory and investigations into why people use news. In collaboration with three U.S. newsrooms, we conducted 11 experiments with 222,385 users, varying whether the message included a gain-framed appeal, a loss-framed appeal, or just stated the cost of the subscription. Across the 11 tests, we also varied the call to action (subscription to newsrooms’ newsletter or paid access) and the medium used to distribute the subscription appeal (Facebook Sponsored Posts or direct email). In several tests, loss-framed messages yielded fewer clicks on subscription appeals compared to gain and control messages. Frame performance was moderated by the medium used, with greater effects for email than Facebook. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for how prospect theory can inform our understanding of why people pay for news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract When comparing media coverage or analysing which content people are exposed to, researchers need to abstract from individual articles. At the same time, aggregating them into broad topics or issues often is too coarse and loses nuance. Both theoretically and methodologically, the analysis of an appropriate intermediate level of aggregation is underdeveloped. This article advances research in various areas of journalism studies by developing a theoretical argument for introducing the “news event” as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide two approaches: One based on traditional tf·idf based cosine similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events. We apply this method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the events they cover.",

It explores what has changed in people’s news consumption by comparing patterns in news use between 2004–2005 and 2011–2014. While new, social and mobile media technologies did not unleash a revolution in people’s dealings with news, they have facilitated, deepened and broadened user practices we already found in 2004–2005: monitoring, checking, snacking, scanning, watching, viewing, reading, listening, searching and clicking. In addition, these forms of news usage appear to increasingly order, control, organize and anchor other practices and the experience of time and environment in which they occur. Meanwhile, new and mobile news practices like linking, sharing, liking, recommending, commenting and voting have not become as central to news consumption as often assumed.",

    "abstract": "Immersion is a state of altered consciousness—not the prim suspension of disbelief, but its joyous capsizing. Since approximately 2012, a new ecosystem of immersive virtual reality technologies and experiments has emerged. In this emerging ecosystem, journalism is still a minor component. Nevertheless, media outlets such as The New York Times, BBC or ABC News have been producing virtual reality news stories. This led to the advent of immersive journalism, not only as a media phenomenon, but also as an academic concept. Drawing on some notions and concepts like the definitions of immersive journalism, immersion and presence, as well as some examples of the relation between journalism practices and visual media, we analyse, reflect and provide a general overview about the main concepts, uses, opportunities and limits of immersive journalism. Thus, the main goal of this article is to provide a theoretical and conceptual gateway that serves as a starting point for immersive journalism future academic and industry endeavours.",

    "abstract": "Prompted by the ongoing development of content personalization by social networks and mainstream news brands, and recent debates about balancing algorithmic and editorial selection, this study explores what audiences think about news selection mechanisms and why. Analysing data from a 26-country survey (N = 53,314), we report the extent to which audiences believe story selection by editors and story selection by algorithms are good ways to get news online and, using multi-level models, explore the relationships that exist between individuals’ characteristics and those beliefs. The results show that, collectively, audiences believe algorithmic selection guided by a user’s past consumption behaviour is a better way to get news than editorial curation. There are, however, significant variations in these beliefs at the individual level. Age, trust in news, concerns about privacy, mobile news access, paying for news, and six other variables had effects. Our results are partly in line with current general theory on algorithmic appreciation, but diverge in our findings on the relative appreciation of algorithms and experts, and in how the appreciation of algorithms can differ according to the data that drive them. We believe this divergence is partly due to our study’s focus on news, showing algorithmic appreciation has context-specific characteristics.",

It found that while public relations staff in Australian sports organisations still value traditional media coverage, they also signalled that their own platforms were increasing in value as distribution channels. The case study of the professional AFL club found that the club selectively chose to distribute some stories on their own platforms instead of through traditional media. These stories were not simply delivered on the club’s own platforms, but the public relations staff actively framed the narrative of these stories for strategic benefit. These results have significant implications for sports journalism, as it suggests the rapid development of sports organisations’ social and digital media platforms has the potential to irrevocably alter the once symbiotic relationship between sport and media.",

    "abstract": "Personalization algorithms, widely used by digital media sources, filter and prioritize news in ways that may not be apparent to users. Savvy media consumers should be aware of how this technology is used to tailor news to their tastes. This two-part study examines the extent to which US college students are aware of news personalization, and the actions and criteria that affect news selection and prioritization. Interviews with one set of students (N = 37) focus on the news sources they use most often to begin a news search. A subsequent survey given to a second set of students (N = 147) focuses on Google and Facebook, two influential gatekeepers. Results show that students are largely unaware of whether and how news sources track user data and apply editorial judgments to deliver personalized results. These studies identify aspects of news personalization that warrant greater attention in college curricula.",

    "title": "The Reinvented Journalist",
    "abstract": "Today, there is much academic discussion about how journalism and journalists are affected by rapid change and convergence in the work context. Considering the fundamental transformations of the media ecology brought about by digitization and the advent of social media, it has been assumed that journalists are more or less compelled to reinvent their professional role and identity. We know a good deal about how social media is adopted by journalists, mostly through survey and interview studies investigating self-perceptions of identity in terms of norms and values. There are also some case studies, predominantly in the form of (quantitative) content analyses, exploring the (innovative) uses of Twitter. However, we still have little knowledge about how the professional identity of journalists is discursively constructed—how, in specific detail, traditional norms and ideals are discursively reinforced or challenged—in the Twitter flow. With a discourse theoretical and methodological approach, this article aims to contribute to our understanding of the discursive construction of professional identity on Twitter by qualitatively analyzing tweets from the most widely followed journalist in Sweden. The analysis of the most active j-tweeter can yield important clues as to what journalism may be in the process of becoming. The article identifies discourses that (1) reinforce the watchdog identity, (2) challenge the watchdog identity, (3) reinforce the disseminator/explicator identity, and (4) reinforce transparency but challenge professional identity. It concludes that the reinvented journalistic identity includes discursive processes that both shape and are shaped by Twitter in a dialectical relationship.",

    "title": "Human Still in the Loop",
    "abstract": "Abstract The study investigates how automation novelties in the newsroom both challenge and maintain the core values of journalism’s professional ideology. Building on semi-structured interviews with editors of legacy news institutions in the United Kingdom and Germany, the study reveals the rationales behind the changing journalism–technology relationship and the dynamics of the re-articulation of the core ideals of journalism. In discussing automation with respect to strategic newsroom development, the interviewees see journalism’s professional ideology as being in a state of flux. They identify contradictions between automation and some of journalism’s core ideals (public service, autonomy, and objectivity) and acknowledge both the potential and limits of technology with regard to others (timeliness and ethics). Despite the growing relevance of automation for news production, human journalists are still regarded as the dominant agents in news production and its continuous reinvention. This human-still-in-the-loop perspective highlights the idea that journalism is undergoing a profound yet long transformation where new technologies are not simply appearing and changing everything, but are innovations developed and embedded in established relations of the news production process. This perspective both reiterates and challenges the prevailing meanings of journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyses the characteristics of digital journalism studies through an empirical investigation of all articles published in the journal Digital Journalism, from its launch in 2013 to issue 6, 2018. The aim of the analysis is to identify dominant themes and degrees of diversity and interdisciplinary in digital journalism studies, and to identify biases and blind spots. The article is based on analysis of keywords, abstracts and references used in all articles published in the journal. The findings suggest that while the research published in Digital Journalism is firmly situated within journalism studies, it has a stronger emphasis on technology, platforms, audience and the present. The article also finds that digital journalism studies, as seen in Digital Journalism, is dominated by perspectives from the social sciences, while largely ignoring digital journalism as a meaning-making system, and that the field of research could benefit from the application of theories and perspectives from the humanities and to some extent from theoretical computer science and informatics. Finally, the article argues that digital journalism studies suffers from a lack of connections between empirical research and the many conceptual discussions that dominate the (sub)field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People’s threat perceptions inform their coping strategies. However, no prior research explicitly addresses threat perceptions of fake news or how people cope with it. To address this pertinent research gap, the current article proposes a theoretical framework of the process by which people perceive and cope with the threat of fake news. The framework supports three research objectives. First, this study identifies triggers (i.e. information availability and experience accessibility) of threat perceptions (i.e. prevalence, severity, and susceptibility) in relation to fake news. Second, it aims to specify how people cope, once a threat perception is triggered, by exploring their acts of authentication and acts of correction, which represent concerted coping strategies in response to fake news. With these two behaviours as input, a latent class analysis classifies audiences according to the concerted coping strategies they adopt. Third, this study explores why people adopt unique patterns for their concerted coping styles. With a survey of a representative sample in Taiwan, the authors test and confirm the proposed theoretical framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two experiments investigated when and how user comments on news websites affect individuals’ personal opinion. In Study 1 (N = 596), opinion-reinforcing (vs. opinion-challenging) user comments led participants to perceive both (a) public opinion and (b) the news tone to be more congenial to their own position, which induced opinion polarization. When user comments were presented within the news article as direct quotes, however, their influence on perceived public opinion was attenuated, with no corresponding change for perceived news position. Poorer message recall partly accounted for the reduced influence of quoted (vs. as-is) comments, but perceived manipulability did not. In Study 2 (N = 261), those with higher need for cognition (NFC) were more likely to infer public opinion from the user comments in their original form than those quoted in the news, but the opposite was true for low NFCs. Results suggest that neither priming nor consensus heuristic fully explain the effects of user comments on personal opinion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An important part of journalism is the capacity for continuous development and learning. Today, this mainly concerns technological innovation, and, for newspapers, it means the digital transition. This article explores how local media journalists perceive innovation in their newsrooms and, more specifically, how they handle the challenges of digital transition. The main angle is focused on individuals’ responses to innovation with a qualitative approach that uses in-depth interviews with local journalists in the Czech Republic. The findings, which are based on the typology of individual responses to the existential insecurity of technological innovation, resulted in similar findings as those of other scholars in terms of the characteristics of the types. Nevertheless, most of the responses from journalists at the Czech local newspapers ended in a rejection of the digital transition and nostalgic reminiscence for the old times.",

    "title": "Funding Intermediaries: Google and Facebook’s Strategy to Capture Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract With more and more governments around the world considering or having already passed laws aiming to regulate the relationship between news publishers and online platforms, primarily, by ensuring a form of remuneration of the former from the latter, we ought to understand the current situation. This article seeks to inquire who platforms fund, how and why. We created a dataset of organizations that have participated in Google News Initiative or Facebook Journalism Project by gathering data from communicative and informative material found on the websites of platforms and beneficiaries. Through our analysis, we identified stakeholders that play a crucial role in the realization of platforms’ funding programs, whom we call funding intermediaries. Therefore, this article contends that the platforms’ strategic decision has not only been to distribute money through a complicated governance structure, but also to target parts of the industry that have been hurt by an ongoing crisis, aggravated by the platforms’ dominance of the advertising industry. However, funding journalism ensures neither media capture, i.e., positive or lack of critical coverage, nor regulatory capture, i.e., avoiding or adjusting regulation. As a result, we ultimately propose to approach capture as a political-economic concept to study platform power.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Why would people share news they think might not be accurate? We identify a factor that, alongside accuracy, drives the sharing of true and fake news: the ‘interestingness-if-true’ of a piece of news. In three pre-registered experiments (N = 904), participants were presented with a series of true and fake news, and asked to rate the accuracy of the news, how interesting the news would be if it were true, and how likely they would be to share it. Participants were more willing to share news they found more interesting-if-true, as well as news they deemed more accurate. They deemed fake news less accurate but more interesting-if-true than true news, and were more likely to share true news than fake news. As expected, interestingness-if-true differed from interestingness and accuracy, and had good face validity. Higher trust in mass media was associated with a greater ability to discern true from fake news, and participants rated as more accurate news that they had already been exposed to (especially for true news). We argue that people may not share news of questionable accuracy by mistake, but instead because the news has qualities that compensate for its potential inaccuracy, such as being interesting-if-true.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Automation of journalistic tasks is growing with the development of increasingly sophisticated software for newsgathering, production, and distribution. Bots are one form of algorithmic technology that has found a place in the modern newsroom, with chatbots leading the way as news organisations seek to attract new audiences using conversational forms of journalism. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have fuelled increasing experimentation with machine autonomy and there has been much hyperbole in the press about the extent and impact of this on journalism. Looking at on-the-ground trials in audience-facing bots at the UK’s largest public broadcaster, we find a significantly more restricted picture. News bots at The BBC to-date have been basic, do not use ML, and have rarely been integrated into news production. The organisation is laying groundwork for development of more interactive news formats with an increasingly conversational tone and individual mode of address as part of a strategy for increased personalisation, which is likely to involve growing levels of ML. In the process, bots are reconfiguring working practices and infrastructure, posing new editorial and technical challenges, and redefining relationships with audiences. We discuss the implications of this for public service media.",

The purpose of this commentary is hence to discuss this question, focusing specifically on whether political alternative media are likely or not to contribute to a more informed citizenry. Although there may be great differences between political alternative media, the overall conclusion is that political alternative media from a democratic perspective represent a problem rather than a solution to democracy’s problem, and that this is due both to the content in them and the motivations people have for using them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the potential contribution of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to the study of digital journalism. It argues that current usage of ANT within digital journalism studies tends to centre on the symmetry principle, or the idea that humans and nonhumans may be actors in an actor-network. In a review of the broader theory, the essay shows that the symmetry principle is one tool among others that may benefit the study of digital journalism. It then suggests that ANT’s non-spatial understanding of society may be especially helpful. ANT’s conception of social space has four principal advantages. It imagines news production as a series of news assemblages rather than a unified profession; it allows that not every actor in a news assemblage is a journalist; it does not equate proximity with meaning; and, it encourages assessment of the relative “strength” of a news assemblage in terms of recruitment and dissemination rather than cohesion and agreement. The essay concludes with a brief discussion of common criticisms of ANT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The insular usage of media sources is a common tool for populist actors to position themselves in relation to the social mainstream and to hold up their claim of creating a counter public. In this article, we traced these dynamics by analysing differences in the insularity of right-wing populist parties’ source repertoires compared to other parties, i.e., the exclusivity of the sources used by populist politicians. By analysing the linking practices of parliamentarians in seven EU countries and Switzerland on Twitter we were able to test the impact of political and media context on these practices. In a second step, we asked to what extent the insularity of sources allows us to draw conclusions on the insularity of topics, i.e., whether right-wing populists used a broad or narrow topic agenda. Our key findings: In countries with high levels of media trust and low levels of polarization, the populist source repertoire features a comparatively low insularity, except for politically marginalized populist parties that use more insular sources. Regardless of the insularity of source use, right-wing populist parties in almost all countries feature a high degree of topic insularity, making a narrow topic agenda the cross-national characteristic of right-wing populist communication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has since been eleven years since the rise of the “Arab Spring”: a series of anti-government uprisings that spread across the Arab world, ultimately leading to regime changes in several countries including Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Using social media and other digital platforms to communicate and strategize, pro-democracy activists demanded increased transparency and freedom from their long-serving leaders. This special issue has sought to probe ways through which journalism is evolving in non-Western societies over a decade since the protests began. Articles accepted in this issue adopted several methodological and theoretical approaches to appraise the current state of journalism in the “developing” world questioning what influences, if any, the protests had. We sought to contribute to knowledge on ways through which the “Arab Spring” was impacting journalism practices in the Arab world and beyond. It’s our hope that findings presented in this issue will enlighten new insights and inspire new research endeavors on the transformation of journalism in the Arab World and indeed other “Southern” nations particularly as it relates to digital realms.",

    "title": "Debunking False Information: Investigating Journalists’ Fact-Checking Skills",
    "abstract": "Abstract The study presented in this article demonstrates journalists’ abilities to debunk mis-, dis- and malinformation in everyday work situations. It shows how journalists use core skills and competencies to verify the information and it describes why false information evades the journalistic filter and gets published. We combined semi-structured interviews with a think-aloud method in which 20 Estonian journalists were shown constructed episodes of false information and then asked to discuss them. Based on the results, we argue that journalists use traditional fact-checking skills in specific combinations, which is usually sufficient to validate the information. However, when under time pressure, journalists tend to trust their professional experience and take the risk of publishing unchecked information. This risk is even higher when the source seems to be trustworthy and the information is presented on an official social media platform or on the journalist’s personal social media page, or if the journalist lacks more in-depth knowledge about a specific topic. Video manipulation (e.g. deep fake) and decontextualised photo presentations are the most difficult for journalists to verify, and that is similar regardless of the platform the journalist specialises in. The results of this study are useful for training journalism students and practicing journalists in how to debunk false information.",

    "title": "Advancing a Radical Audience Turn in Journalism. Fundamental Dilemmas for Journalism Studies",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite its increasing attention for audiences, journalism studies remains an inherently production-focused discipline. Consequently, studying the perspective of audiences tends to automatically start from questions relevant for and benefitting the news industry. In this introduction, we argue for a more radical audience turn that pushes journalism studies forward beyond normative and industry concerns, and starts from the perspective of audiences themselves. We formulate four constructive starting points for advancing the audience turn in journalism: 1) further decentering journalism by also focusing on non-news and employing non-media centric approaches; 2) broadening who counts as audience by including audiences considered commercially unattractive; 3) shifting the focus from what counts as news use to what is experienced as informative; and 4) positing audiences as active agents. However, such a radical audience turn also creates fundamental dilemmas for journalism studies, raising questions about the field’s object of study, the spaces and contexts of news use considered, and the objectives of journalism studies as a field. With this special issue, we call for further reflections on how news and informational needs may be conceptualized from an audience perspective and how to theorize what this means for journalism’s role in society and everyday life.",

    "title": "Between Personal and Public Interest: How Algorithmic News Recommendation Reconciles with Journalism as an Ideology",
    "abstract": "Abstract Throughout modern history, the introduction of new technologies in journalism has challenged journalistic roles and the normative landscape of journalism, and the emergent use of personalised news recommender systems seems no exception given personalisation’s inherent democratic risk and commercial nature. However, current literature offers limited insight into how these technologies reconcile with the shared ideological norms and beliefs of journalists. This article identifies recurring tensions between journalism’s ideology and increasing commercial pressures in existing literature focusing on illustrative examples of digital technology implementations in journalism, and discusses how personalised news recommendation may recreate or mediate these tensions. The findings suggest that personalised news recommendation can facilitate journalism in service of the public by using value-sensitive algorithmic design that incorporates editorial input and nudges users to view diverse and serendipitous content. The findings additionally emphasise the importance of algorithmic transparency as a constituent element to distinguish nudging that prompts reflective behaviour from manipulation of choice, thus mediating tensions with journalism’s ideological aspirations to be fair and objective. Lastly, the paper calls for a higher level of understanding and interaction between journalists and algorithmic designers to mediate the impact on journalistic autonomy and ease the inherent transfer of editorial authority over distribution.",

    "title": "Uneasy Bedfellows: AI in the News, Platform Companies and the Issue of Journalistic Autonomy",
    "abstract": "Abstract Platform companies play an important role in the production and distribution of news. This article analyses this role and questions of control, dependence and autonomy in the light of the ‘AI goldrush’ in the news. I argue that the introduction of AI in the news risks shifting even more control to and increasing the news industry’s dependence on platform companies. While platform companies’ power over news organisations has to date mainly flown from their control over the channels of distribution, AI potentially allows them to extend this control to the means of production as the technology increasingly permeates all stages of the news-making process. As a result, news organisations risk becoming even more tethered to platform companies in the long-run, potentially limiting their autonomy and, by extension, contributing to a restructuring of the public arena as news organisations are re-shaped according to the logics of platform businesses. I conclude by mapping a research agenda that highlights potential implications and spells out areas in need of further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Conventional business advice says that for any firm, many sources of revenue are better than a few or just one. The logic is that by diversifying its revenue, the firm could improve its financial performance and in turn, its chances for survival. This study tested that with independent Web-native news ventures. These entrepreneurial ventures are an emerging facet of digital journalism, and they matter to the communities they serve and to journalism generally. However, data gathered in a survey of 127 independent news sites in the United States do not favor the logic of diversification. For-profit news sites performed the best with scant revenue diversity. Non-profit news sites did not perform any better with diversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Journalism and other institutions clash over automated news generation, algorithmic distribution and content ownership worldwide. AI policies are the main mechanisms that establish and organise the hierarchies among these institutions. Few studies, however, have explored the normative dimension of AI in policymaking in journalism, especially beyond the West. This case study inspects the copyright law’s impact on AI innovation in newsrooms in the unexamined Chinese context. Using neo-institutional theory and policy network theory, the study investigates the Third Amendment to the Chinese Copyright Law, exemplary court cases regarding automated journalism copyright disputes (such as Tencent v. Yingxun and Film v. Baidu), and other supporting documents. The findings show how China’s copyright legal framework separates authorship and ownership; defines “originality” and “creativity” in human-machine collaboration; and prioritises tech companies while undermining journalistic autonomy. We argue that the law’s eager embrace of AI may give tech companies an advantage over news organisations that do not necessarily have a strategy to adopt AI. Moreover, it favours state-owned, resource-rich official media over the private sector. An implication of this shifting power dynamic is the possibility of privately owned news media being marginalised, resulting in even stronger state control over media production and information flow.",

    "title": "“Citizen Curation” in Online Discussions of Donald Trump’s Presidency",
    "abstract": "In an era of fake news and concerns about “social-media bubbles”, we consider how participants in online discussions on the UK parenting website Mumsnet assess the validity and potential subjectivity of news information sources. Building on previous work on the phenomenon of “social media curation” and “news curation”, we argue that there is evidence for the development of a theory and practice of “citizen curation”—the subjective and non-professional collection, assessment and criticism of information by participants in online discussions for the benefit of the group. Participants on Mumsnet collaborate to source, present and curate information from a variety of news sources, and impose a clear hierarchy with reference to these sources’ veracity. Information garnered from mainstream, liberal-leaning news sources is given the highest level of trust, often being used to support information from other sources, which are seen as less trustworthy. Information might also be presented from conservative-leaning news sources, but only when it supports the overall anti-Trump tone. Having acknowledged the selective subjectivity of the curatorial process performed by our participants, we then ask how far this contributes to the creation of a “liberal bubble” effect, and how far our participants are willing to go to validate news stories shared in this way. We argue that our participants demonstrated a clear awareness of the veracity and potential subjectivity of their sources, worked collaboratively to verify news items, and were proud of their ability to “scoop” the mainstream news media on occasion. Given that earlier work on such groups of news-absorbed users has suggested that they tend to be male, the identification of such a group on a female-dominated website also expands the literature and suggests that such gender differentiations should be made with care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article comparatively examines news avoidance in a rapidly changing media environment. We utilize findings from a large dataset of 488 in-depth interviews with media consumers, conducted in Argentina, Finland, Israel, Japan, and the US. We aim to make a contribution to the study of news avoidance by providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the drivers, practices, and patterns of news avoidance as they occur in and are shaped by a variety of national contexts. We argue that news avoidance is shaped not only by individual characteristics, but is also manifested and performed as part of specific time frames and socio-cultural factors. We distinguish two drivers of intentional news avoidance: cognitive and emotional. The cognitive drivers are accentuated by distinct country-level contextual factors, whereas the emotional drivers for news avoidance are shared across diverse national contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facing budget constraints, many traditional news organizations are turning their eyes on automation to streamline manpower, cut down on costs, and improve efficiency. But how does automation fit into traditional values of journalism and how does it affect perceptions of credibility, an important currency valued by the journalistic field? This study explores this question using a 3 (declared author: human vs. machine vs. combined) × 2 (objectivity: objective vs. not objective) between-subjects experimental design involving 420 participants drawn from the national population of Singapore. The analysis found no main differences in perceived source credibility between algorithm, human, and mixed authors. Similarly, news articles attributed to an algorithm, a human journalist, and a combination of both showed no differences in message credibility. However, the study found an interaction effect between type of declared author and news objectivity. When the article is presented to be written by a human journalist, source and message credibility remain stable regardless of whether the article was objective or not objective. However, when the article is presented to be written by an algorithm, source and message credibility are higher when the article is objective than when the article is not objective. Findings for combined authorship are split: there were no differences between objective and non-objective articles when it comes to message credibility. However, combined authorship is rated higher in source credibility when the article is not objective than when the article is objective.",

    "abstract": "With the institutionalization of algorithms as content creators, professional journalism is facing transformation and novel ethical challenges. This article focuses on the concept of Algorithmic Journalism on the basis of natural language generation and provides a framework to identify and discuss ethical issues. The analysis builds on the moral theories of deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and contractualism, and remaps the ethical discussion for Algorithmic Journalism at the intersection of digital media ethics and cyber ethics. In order to capture the whole range of potential shifts and challenges in journalism ethics, the article combines the ethical multi-layer system of responsibility by Pürer with the classification of journalism by Weischenberg, Malik, and Scholl on an organizational, professional/individual, and social/audience sphere. This analytical framework is then complemented with attributes derived from the technical potential of Algorithmic Journalism. As a result, the analysis uncovers new ethical challenges and shifts of responsibility in news production for journalism practice and journalism research at the levels of objectivity, authority, transparency, and at the level of implicit or explicit values.",

Not only does it obscure the incremental nature and detrimental effects of change in journalism, but it sidelines the recognition of what stays stable in journalism across technological change. Tracing the advantages and shortcomings of expectations that digital journalism is more democratic, transparent, novel and participatory, the article argues that it is journalism that gives technology purpose, shape, perspective, meaning and significance, not the other way around.",

    "title": "AI ‘Everywhere and Nowhere’: Addressing the AI Intelligibility Problem in Public Service Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Growing prevalence of algorithmic systems and artificial intelligence in news production has prompted concerns over journalists’ ability to understand and engage with them in ways that do not compromise journalistic norms and values. This ‘intelligibility’ issue is particularly acute for public service media due to the risks such complex and opaque systems pose for disrupting accountability, decision-making, and professional judgment. This article draws from document analysis and interviews with fourteen journalists to outline where AI is deployed in BBC news production and analyse how journalists make sense of AI and algorithms. We find a disconnect between increasingly pervasive AI and the level of understanding amongst BBC journalists, who are using guesswork and imagination in place of accurate conceptions of these technologies. This could limit journalists’ ability to effectively and responsibly use AI systems, to question their outputs and role in news production, or to adapt and shape them – and could also hinder responsible reporting on how AI impacts society. We recommend PSM develop strategies for fostering AI intelligibility and literacy on three levels: individual, organisational, and community, and we reframe the AI intelligibility problem in sociocultural rather than solely technical terms in order to better address normative considerations.",

    "title": "What Explains the Spread of Misinformation in Online Personal Messaging Networks? Exploring the Role of Conflict Avoidance",
    "abstract": "Abstract Online personal messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are now hugely popular around the world. Yet their role in the spread and social correction of misinformation remains under-researched. We carried out in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the UK public (N = 102) to explore how social relationships and technological design interact and foster norms regulating how people respond when their everyday social ties share misinformation on these platforms. Conceptualizing messaging as hybrid public-interpersonal communication, we develop a framework that situates online political talk in the context of everyday social interaction. We show that, among our participants, a norm of conflict avoidance is particularly powerful on these platforms and makes people reluctant to speak out. Conflict avoidance should therefore be taken seriously as a contributor to the diffusion of misinformation in everyday life. Policymakers and other stakeholders, including news organizations, should explore new, tailored ways to empower citizens to challenge misinformation in these important online spaces, where automated and algorithmic interventions are impossible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As journalism has grappled with the potentials and boundaries of AI within the industry, journalists have produced plentiful articles detailing experimentation and potential consequences of AI-driven journalism (see, Peiser, 2019; GPT-33, 2020). Accordingly, this article analyzes media coverage (N = 95 articles) of AI in journalism over a 5-year period, starting in 2016 and ending in 2020, to examine prominent themes related to uses, roles, and concerns regarding AI in the newsroom. We sample coverage from 20 US and UK news media outlets representing a diversity of media with regards to media type and partisan leaning. We employ a thematic analysis on the media coverage of AI as it relates specifically to its use and application in journalism. Our exploration uncovers a tension between the industry and profession of journalism in highlighting the hopes and pitfalls of AI. It also allows for a discussion on assessing the place of AI in news making, especially with regard to the economic and contextual complexity in which news stories operate and the normative ideals of journalism in the digital era.",

    "title": "The One Thing Journalistic AI Just Might Do for Democracy",
    "abstract": "Abstract A recent wave of enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has seen many observers focus on its potential to transform journalism, as with other forms of knowledge work. This conceptual essay, however, attempts to steer the conversation away from a technocentric emphasis on applications and instead pivot to the fundamental but overlooked issue of normativity: in this case, what should AI actually do to help fulfill journalism’s broader democratic aims? Building our analysis on Rasmus Kleis Nielsen’s approach that emphasizes one essential thing that journalism just might do for democracy—namely, provide accurate, accessible, diverse, relevant, and timely news about public affairs—we argue that journalistic AI could be normatively imagined and evaluated with a similar focus on simplicity and dose of democratic realism. In connection with three primary stages of newswork—information gathering, selection and production, and distribution and consumption—we explain how journalistic AI not only can work but also should work in the service of accuracy, accessibility, diversity, relevance, and timeliness. Ultimately, by placing normativity at the center of this analysis, our goal is to explore how AI might be oriented to enhance how news performs in each of these domains and thus make a pragmatic difference for journalism and democracy.",

    "title": "Antecedents of News Avoidance: Competing Effects of Political Interest, News Overload, Trust in News Media, and “News Finds Me” Perception",
    "abstract": "Abstract Recent changes in the media environment make it easier than ever for people to actively shape their news repertoires according to their habits, needs, and preferences. As convenient as these practices seem, they may favor the development of misperceptions such as “news finds me” perception (NFM) and make it easier for some people to disconnect from news and political content. Building on the conceptualization of news avoidance as a general disposition and its consequential behaviors, this study jointly examines key individual-level predispositions that may motivate intentional news avoidance. Based on a two-wave survey collected in the United States, our results largely corroborate previous work showing the association of political interest, news overload, and trust in professional news with news avoidance, and stress the importance of including the NFM in the theoretical and empirical modelling of news avoidance. Our analyses also suggest that the linkages between these individual-level antecedents and news avoidance are contingent upon the design and robustness of the empirical tests, with NFM yielding the most consistent association across models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract News organizations increasingly depend on subscriptions, donations, memberships and audience engagement figures, calling up the question of what kind of journalism audiences would find so valuable that they might be willing to pay for it, in money or attention. To answer this question, I have fleshed out the concept of Valuable Journalism by performing a meta-analysis of the results of twenty-two audience research projects (2005–2020) involving 3068 informants. By focussing on what audiences experience as valuable journalism, rather than on its content or approach, I will demonstrate how Valuable Journalism crystallized over the years into three key experiences: Learning something new, Getting recognition and Increasing mutual understanding. In the final part of the paper, I address the challenges raised by Valuable Journalism for practicing journalists and journalism scholars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With rapid technical advancements, deepfakes—i.e., hyper-realistic fake videos using face swaps—have become more widespread and easier to create, challenging the old notion of “seeing is believing.” Despite raised concerns over potential impacts of deepfakes on people’s credibility toward audio-visual evidence in journalism, systematic investigation of the topic has been lacking. This study conducted an experiment (N = 230) that tested (1) how a news article using deepfake video (vs. real video) affects news credibility and viral behavioral intentions and (2) whether, based on signaling theory, obtaining knowledge about the low cost of producing deepfakes reduces the impact of deepfake news. Results show that people whose pre-existing attitudes toward controversial issues (abortion, marijuana legalization) are congruent with the advocated position of a news article are more likely to believe and be willing to share deepfake news as much as real video news. In addition, educating participants about the low cost of producing deepfakes was effective in reducing the credibility and viral behavioral intention of deepfake news for those who have congruent issue attitudes. This study provides evidence for differing levels of susceptibility for deepfake news and the importance of media literacy education regarding deepfakes that would prevent biased reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Push notifications provide news outlets with direct access to audiences amid concerns around information overload, disinformation, and heightened competition for reader attention. Such news distribution is relevant because it (a) bypasses social media and news aggregators, reaching readers directly; (b) alters the agency and control of temporal news personalisation; and (c) reinforces mobile as the locus of contact between news organisations and audiences. However, push notifications are a relatively under-researched topic. We explore news organisations’ use of alerts, considering whether they attempt to integrate with existing mobile-user behaviour patterns or seek to be a disruptive element, garnering attention when audiences are not typically using devices. Through quantitative content analysis, this study examines the temporality of push notifications (n = 7092) from nine Northwestern European countries, comprising 34 news outlets. These data allow for comparisons at two levels: publisher type and national context. The study shows how the temporal patterns of push notifications’ dissemination align with existing news consumption behaviours; concepts of content-snacking and audiences’ rhythms and rituals are a useful lens through which these immediate, concise texts can be considered. Our findings show that news organisations use the mobile channel for attracting and maintaining users’ attention, with varying interpretations of temporal customisability.",

    "title": "Appropriating Social Media",
    "abstract": "The hype over social media and the rapid expansion of social networking and micro-blogging in recent years can easily lead us to believe that all journalists are online, chatting and tweeting, all the time. Previous research, however, indicates that the spread of social media differs between groups of journalists and that social media usage is related to the journalist’s age, gender, type of work and workplace. This paper advances our understanding of how journalists appropriate social media in their professional lives by examining the changes in social media use across time. We examine if and how the perceived usefulness of social media for various professional purposes changes over time, and if different categories of journalists change their usage in different ways. The theoretical perspective draws from theories on the appropriation and adoption of technologies. The empirical material consists of Web survey data collected in 2012 and 2014, targeting representative samples of Swedish journalists. Our findings show that the use of social media increased slightly between the two surveys but the expansion was levelling off in 2014. Some early adopters were abandoning social media, and there was a noticeable decline in the journalists’ valuation of social media affordances.",

    "title": "The Relative Importance of Social Media for Accessing, Finding, and Engaging with News",
    "abstract": "The growing use of social media like Facebook and Twitter is in the process of changing how news is produced, disseminated, and discussed. But so far, we have only a preliminary understanding of (1) how important social media are as sources of news relative to other media, (2) the extent to which people use them to find news, (3) how many use them to engage in more participatory forms of news use, and (4) whether these developments are similar within countries with otherwise comparable levels of technological development. Based on data from a cross-country online survey of news media use, we present a comparative analysis of the relative importance of social media for news in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, covering eight developed democracies with different media systems. We show that television remains both the most widely used and most important source of news in all these countries, and that even print newspapers are still more widely used and seen as more important sources of news than social media. We identify a set of similarities in terms of the growing importance of social media as part of people’s cross-media news habits, but also important country-to-country differences, in particular in terms of how widespread the more active and participatory forms of media use are. Surprisingly, these differences do not correspond to differences in levels of internet use, suggesting that more than mere availability shapes the role of social media as parts of people’s news habits.",

    "abstract": "This article measures the relative attention given to Israel and Palestine in 37 leading news sites in 10 languages over two years. Findings clearly show that the Palestinian entities and Israel are the world’s most prominent polities after the United States in top news stories of international online coverage. Most news attention is given by Middle Eastern news sites, and only then by European and American news sites. During periods that attention to Israel decreases, attention to China increases. After presenting these rather surprising findings, the study considers a number of directions for interpreting them.",

    "title": "Editorial Note",
    "abstract": "I am delighted to write a brief editorial note to introduce this special issue of Digital Journalism which focuses on the impact of new media technologies on African journalism, a focus which Guest Editor, Hayes Mawinda Mabweazara, notes is “scarce”. The application of digital technologies to the traditional practice of journalism is reshaping every aspect of the production, content and reception of news and the newsrooms where it is produced. But the impact on journalism is distinctive in particular national settings, reflecting unique journalistic organisations, professional cultures, histories and economic resources. Consequently, understanding the relationship between new media technologies and a changing journalism practice requires an interpretive sensitivity to these particular socio-cultural and historical complexities. What is required, as Mabweazara notes, is “detailed qualitative explorations of how newsrooms (and their journalists) are adjusting to the new digital context of practice, as well as an understanding of the structure of the ensuing transformations from an African perspective”. The various research studies published here derive from five national settings and explore: the integration of digital technologies and mobile devices by free community newspaper @Verdade (Mozambique); the uses of social media at three community radio stations (South Africa); readers’ responses to online news in state-controlled and private newspapers (Zimbabwe); the impact of user-generated content on election reporting in 2011 (Nigeria); and the implications of online technologies for journalism practice in three case study settings in private and state-controlled newspaper newsrooms (Egypt). The ambition is that these studies will assist in refashioning and de-Westernising accounts of African journalism. In the Guest Editor’s words, this special issue should contribute towards “a reconstituted vision of global journalism practice in the digital era—one that validates the value of experiences outside Western countries ... but also demonstrates how new digital technologies have the potential to ... position African journalism in the unfolding global Information Society”. I am very grateful to Dr Hayes Mawinda Mabweazara for organising, editing and contributing to this collection of studies of journalism in Africa. Thanks also to each of the individual authors, the many anonymous reviewers of individual papers but especially to Herman Wasserman, Professor of Media and Deputy Head of School at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa, who read and commented on earlier drafts of all the papers which are published here.",

    "title": "THE SOCIAL JOURNALIST",
    "abstract": "The ongoing social media hype puts pressure on journalists to be active in social media 24/7. In this process professional values and journalistic norms are put to the test and not all journalists are equally keen to embrace the “social media life”. So far, few studies have examined the differences between categories of journalists when it comes to social media use. Based on a representative large-N survey of Swedish journalists conducted in 2011/2012, this paper examines journalists’ professional and personal use of social media. The study analyzes the level, purpose and evaluation of usage among different categories of journalists. The broad finding is that there are three main categories of users: “skeptical shunners”, “pragmatic conformists” and “enthusiastic activists”. Furthermore, there exists a professional digital divide between the “skeptical shunners” on one side and the “enthusiastic activists” on the other. The differences in social media use are mainly associated with journalists’ age and type of work but also with professional attitudes towards audience adaptation and branding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To understand how journalism is made and what news is, it is helpful to center “the press” as an object of analysis and concern, a way to see the conditions under which news is made and made meaningful. For several years, many scholars and practitioners have focused on “the platform press” as a new way of understanding how journalism is made and what news is. In this essay I argue that that this “platform press” view enables three vital, generative ways to see the press: as platform labor, as a chance for normative honesty, and as an opportunity to take a long view of journalism and news.",

The thesis of this paper is that the key to the viability of news media in the digital age, as demonstrated by both long- and short-term patterns, is innovation. To insure long-term success, innovation in news media should be guided by four principles: intelligence or research, a commitment to freedom of speech, a dedication to the pursuit of truth and accuracy in reporting, and ethics. Evidence is presented that early innovation by news media leaders that adhere to the principles outlined here are finding success in both building audience and generating digital revenue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Search engines are among the most popular online services used in a range of contexts, including to find information on political issues. As such, they increasingly act as powerful mediators between news organizations and their audiences. The claim that search results are politically biased, while hardly new, has also recently received fresh support from President Donald Trump, who has blamed Google for unfairly prioritizing news outlets critical of his policies. In the context of elections, search engines may serve to inform citizens and have been argued to sway the choices of undecided voters. I examine two related issues: How political parties and candidates are represented in Google Search results and how strongly results in both Google Search and Google News are personalized in the run up to the 2017 German general elections. My results suggest that some parties and candidates are able to exert greater influence over how they are represented in search results than others, through a combination of local branch websites and social media presences. I furthermore find only a small share of results which differ from the mainstream, while controlling for time, language, and location, calling into question the validity of the filter bubble concept.",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "abstract": "The past 15 years have seen a steady decline in the news industry, while ironically there has been a great increase in journalism research (visible in, for instance, the emergence of specific journals and divisions within research associations). During this time period there has been a good deal of theorizing about changes in the journalistic profession, professional norms and routines, and on the role of journalism in society. While journalism theory has indeed been advanced, the same can unfortunately not be said about methodologies used in journalism research. Instead, the traditional concepts of sender, channel, message and receiver are still the most common starting points for much journalism research. This also holds true for most research on digital and online journalism, despite the many methodological challenges that follow from the characteristics of digital media and digital journalism. In order to assess contemporary journalism properly, we think that research methods must be assessed, adjusted, redesigned and perhaps even invented. This idea is far from novel as methodological innovation has previously been made, and more importantly, revitalized the field. Consider, for instance, the ethnographies of the 1970s (e.g. Tuchman 1972) that gave new insight into how news was constructed. Or how Lazarsfeld and colleagues, with content analysis, innovative use of panels and the invention of the “focused interview”, lay some of the foundations that were to become the field of media and communications research (Katz 1987; Merton and Kendall 1946). Yet, the challenges and, consequently, rewards for journalism studies and communication research might be even greater with the digitization of communications. We now face an ontological trial as some of the very categories, and their relationships, of journalism studies—producers, newsrooms, contents, channels of distribution and audiences—seem less certain than they did only a few years ago, becoming increasingly elusive when old boundaries, distinctions and demarcations dissolve. With a changing ontology come questions about a changing epistemology. The aforementioned discrete categories have typically been investigated using a fairly standard set of methods such as surveys, content analysis, interviews, ethnography and experiments. As our objects of study changes, our methodological approaches need to be considered as well, as it is unclear to what extent previously used methods remain feasible, need revision or if new methods have to be invented. The digital world of journalism is developing fast, and researchers need appropriate, stringent and viable methods for capturing and understanding these changes. So far, few systematic attempts have been made in this area. That is why this special issue of Digital Journalism is dedicated solely to digital research methods. In putting together this special issue, our aim was to encourage scholars to develop new and revised methods, take stock of old methods,",

    "abstract": "As quantitative forms have become more prevalent in professional journalism, it has become increasingly important to distinguish between them and examine their roles in contemporary journalistic practice. This study defines and compares three quantitative forms of journalism—computer-assisted reporting, data journalism, and computational journalism—examining the points of overlap and divergence among their journalistic values and practices. After setting the three forms against the cultural backdrop of the convergence between the open-source movement and professional journalistic norms, the study introduces a four-part typology to evaluate their epistemological and professional dimensions. In it, the three forms are classified according to their orientation toward professional expertise or networked participation, transparency or opacity, big data or targeted sampling, and a vision of an active or passive public. These three quantitative journalistic forms are ultimately characterized as related but distinct approaches to integrating the values of open-source culture and social science with those of professional journalism, each with its own flaws but also its own distinct contribution to democratically robust journalistic practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract If news companies are to survive in today’s highly competitive media landscape, they need to stay worthwhile to news users. However, news companies’ quantitative audience analytics have difficulties grasping news users’ increasingly complex ways of finding and consuming news. This is especially the case for younger news users familiar with high-choice, digitized media formats. To better understand how these news users negotiate and assess news providers' worthwhileness, we conducted 20 qualitative in-depth interviews with young Danes. Our findings show that the participants distinguished between seven desired news services, and that they perceived news providers to be worthwhile if they could deliver the news services they desired for an appropriate level of personal effort. In this way, our findings suggest that an increased focus on specific desired news services can help news companies as well as scholars to more comprehensively understand the uses and preferences of younger news users. This study aims to go beyond the quantitative nature of many uses and gratifications studies, allowing for new categories to emerge – categories which, this study finds, play a very central role in how young news users navigate and assess news providers’ worthwhileness in today’s complex media landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In less than seven years, Instagram has grown five-fold and in 2021 overtook Twitter globally as a source of news. Here we engage the recurrent debate regarding the normalization of digital tools through interviews with lifestyle journalists from Austria and the United States (n = 63). Through the lens of Normalization Process Theory, we seek to understand how the routine use of Instagram has become embedded among lifestyle journalists and elaborate on the nature of normalization in journalism. We argue that to engage with the normalization of a technology is also to consider the stacking of platform-specific routines. Journalists reflected that normalizing Instagram required them to apply many of the norms they developed using Twitter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Platform companies play a crucial role in the creation, dissemination, and business of news. They are also central actors in artificial intelligence (AI) which has led some to argue that the increasing use of AI in journalism may heighten the news industry’s dependence on platform companies. This article evaluates this argument. Drawing on 121 interviews with news workers at 33 leading publishers in the US, UK, and Germany, as well as 31 expert interviews, and secondary material it finds that AI reshapes the dependency of publishers on platform companies by exacerbating existing dependencies in distribution and creating new dependencies in production. News organisations rely on platforms for AI for various reasons, such as high development costs, lack of resources, and varying visions over their mission. The findings show that while increasing dependence on platforms is acknowledged, there is disagreement over its extent and impact. The reliance on platforms’ AI shows isomorphic tendencies and potentially limits publishers’ autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Killings, as the most extreme form of violence against journalists, receive considerable attention, but journalists experience a variety of threats from surveillance to gendered cyber targeting and hate speech, or even the intentional deprivation of their financial basis. This article provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary framework of journalists’ safety, summarized in a conceptual model. The aim is to advance the study of journalists’ safety and improve safety practices, journalism education, advocacy, and policy making - vital as press freedom and fundamental human rights face multifaceted challenges, compromising journalists’ ability to serve their societies. Journalists’ occupational safety comprises personal (physical, psychological) and infrastructural (digital, financial) dimensions. Safety can be objective and subjective by operating on material and perceptional levels. It is moderated by individual (micro), organizational/institutional (meso), and systemic (macro) risk factors, rooted in power dynamics defining boundaries for journalists’ work, which, if crossed, result in threats and create work-related stress. Stress requires coping, ideally resulting in resilience and resistance, and manifested in journalists’ continued role performance with autonomy. Compromised safety has personal and social consequences as threats might affect role performance and even lead to an exit from the profession, thus also affecting journalism’s wider function as a key institution.",

    "abstract": "Exploring constructions of journalistic identity in a digital age has been a lively area of scholarship as the field of digital journalism studies has grown. Yet despite many approaches to understanding digital change, key avenues for understanding changing constructions of identity remain underexplored. This paper addresses a conceptual void in research literature by employing semiotic and semantic approaches to analyse performances of journalistic identity in narratives of newswork facilitated by and focused on digital megaleaks. It seeks to aid understanding of the way narratives describe changing practices of newsgathering, and how journalists position themselves within these hybrid traditional/digital stories. Findings show news narratives reinforce the primacy of journalists within traditional boundaries of a journalistic field, and articulate a preferred imagination of journalistic identity. Methodologically, this paper shows how semantic and semiotic approaches lend themselves to studying narratives of newswork within journalistic metadiscourses to understand journalistic identity at the nexus of traditional and digital dynamics. The resultant portrait of journalistic identity channels a socio-historic, romantic notion of the journalist as “the shadowy figure always to be found on the edges of the century’s great events”, updated to accommodate modern, digital dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The use of social media as a source of news is entering a new phase as computer algorithms are developed and deployed to detect, rank, and verify news. The efficacy and ethics of such technology is the subject of this article, which examines the SocialSensor application, a tool developed by a multidisciplinary European Union research project. The results suggest that computer software can be used successfully to identify trending news stories, allow journalists to search within a social media corpus, and help verify social media contributors and content. However, such software also raises questions about accountability as social media is algorithmically filtered for use by journalists and others. Our analysis of the inputs SocialSensor relies on shows biases towards those who are vocal and have an audience, many of whom are men in the media. We also reveal some of the technology’s temporal and topic preferences. The conclusion discusses whether such biases are necessary for systems like SocialSensor to be effective. The article also suggests that academic research has failed to recognise fully the changes to journalists’ sourcing practices brought about by social media, particularly Twitter, and provides some countervailing evidence and an explanation for this failure.",

    "title": "Who Shares What with Whom and Why?",
    "abstract": "Successful online publishers like BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post have mastered the art of making news go viral. In order for this to happen, it needs to be shared by a large number of online media users. Understanding what makes a piece of content worth sharing with others then becomes a key element in understanding current news flows. User-oriented studies about what incites people to share news are limited. Content characteristics, personal dispositions towards news and new media, and self-presentation have proved to be relevant indicators, but people might differ considerably in the way they share news. We hypothesize that different “sharing profiles” are discernible amongst online news users, based on their motivations to share, but also considering internet skills and news-sharing behaviour. In order to identify these profiles, we draw on a survey amongst Dutch-speaking Belgian online media users (N = 1237). The results illustrate how motivations to share are important predictors of online sharing activity; especially staying socially connected with others. Yet, self-confidence in internet skills was found to be a second, important predictor for online sharing behaviour. Drawing on these insights, we discuss whether viral news forms a threat or an opportunity to news reporting.",

    "abstract": "The ability to build boundaries, known as boundary work, is typically understood as being in the hands of major players, who keep out or begrudgingly admit interlopers. This article, based on a longitudinal case study of metajournalistic discourse around the Center for Public Integrity, one of the oldest and largest news nonprofits in the United States, finds the Center engaging instead in what I have called “boundary evolution,” starting out self-consciously outside of journalism, and gradually working its way in. This insight helps us understand the power that marginal players wield in positioning themselves relative to larger participants. It also points to how players can evolve against the background of a changing ecology; in this case, the Center for Public Integrity came to see a place for itself in journalism only after funding cuts left news organizations hungry for quality, free content, and the digital environment normalized sharing.",

    "title": "Political News in Online and Print Newspapers",
    "abstract": "The electoral model of democracy holds the ideal of citizens who are well informed about politics, and regards it as a task of news media to provide citizens with political information. Against this ideal, the quality of political news in online news outlets is highly contested. While pessimists point out the dangers of increased competition online, optimists emphasize the potential benefits of unlimited space and interactivity. To see which view holds true, this paper compares political news in popular and elite print newspapers and their respective online editions during the 2013 National Election Campaign in Austria. Findings show that online editions score better than paper editions regarding the amount of political news, (party) diversity, and emotionalization, but differences between newspaper types were notable. Whereas elite newspapers cover politics online more extensively than in print, the reverse is true for popular newspapers. Leader focus is also strong in popular papers online. We conclude that the gap in quality between political news in elite and in popular newspapers is larger online. This might contribute to a wider gap between a well-informed elite audience and a lesser-informed popular news audience, when audiences switch from print to online news.",

    "abstract": "Online journalism is associated with, among other characteristics, a breaking-news culture and sense of immediacy. However, in an era of falling resources, questions must be asked about how demand for quick content is fulfilled and what role external actors play in providing material to journalists under pressure. This article focuses on coverage of health policy over 14 weeks, looking at the outputs and strategies of three newspaper-brand websites in Ireland. The study, using qualitative content analysis, traces the origins of each story; of primary interest is material from information subsidies, wire reports and content repackaged from other media reports. The sample is divided into two categories: (1) stories uploaded during the day (defined as being between 6 am and midnight) and (2) stories uploaded overnight (typically delayed for the print edition), with the aim of determining what, if any, relationship exists between the time of publication and the level of repackaged content, which may include churnalism. Structuration theory is used to consider the system of news production. At its core is a duality: structures such as time pressure and resources interact with journalistic agency, manifested through decisions on source selection and publishing schedules.",

    "abstract": "This mixed-method study assessed the relationship between the content in news articles about mental health and illness and the reading and sharing of this content by the news audience. It used Web analytics from three major Canadian news sites. Regression analysis indicated a tendency for social media users to share news about mental health and illness that was neutral in tone and that contained recovery and intervention as themes. Stories on mental health that had themes of violence and criminality, however, did not increase the article’s readership or online sharing. This research is considered in the context of the sociological process of making news, network gatekeeping, and uses and gratifications theory.",

    "abstract": "Amid the increasing use of web analytics to gage the success, present and future, of news content and related news products, this article focuses on in-depth interviews with the suppliers of those analytics: web analytics companies. Drawing on the concepts of boundary work and interloper media, this article examines how managers for these companies understand and position their work in relation to news production as a boundary object. The larger finding of this article is that while web analytics companies seek to understand and address news production values and norms without assuming responsibility as journalists, they foster profit-oriented norms and values in newsrooms by introducing web analytics as disruptive, connective, and routinized in news production. By offering a product that they (i.e. web analytics companies) need to modify on a continuous basis because of changes in the structure of the web and audience behaviors, they foster a milieu of constant experimentation with old and new products. This and other findings provide a portrait of the development of norms and values in journalism as these companies gain a greater acceptance in newsrooms and increasingly influence news production.",

    "abstract": "After prediction-defying elections in 2015 and 2016 in the United Kingdom and the United States rattled journalists, some publicly blamed data journalism—an indictment that raised questions about journalistic discourse surrounding the polysemic phrase and still-developing field. A content analysis (n = 612) of all published news stories over two years in four international news databases revealed the potential of journalists to embrace data as an empirical tool, for the phrase was most frequently associated with numerical analysis. However, the next most-frequent definitional category was electoral prediction, which was statistically more likely in the nations where data journalism is most often practiced, the U.K. and U.S. Correlating data journalism with electoral prediction also was statistically more likely in the month immediately after the surprising elections. Further, it was more likely to stimulate pushback from practitioners who saw data as epistemologically less reliable than “shoe-leather” approaches marked by observation and interviews with a few people perceived to be voter archetypes. The results reveal more than journalistic ignorance about polling techniques. They reveal an element of news culture that privileges traditional methods and dismisses unfamiliar evidentiary tools, which risks skewing audience understanding of data journalism.",

This paper aims to understand these emerging audience-oriented roles and to what extent considerations of the audience figures in editorial choices. This paper draws from a set of 15 in-depth interviews with engagement editors, social media editors and audience editors from different media systems around the world. Three major findings emerge: First, the definition of engagement is almost entirely centered on different types of metrics. Second, while audience-oriented editors take part in the editorial process, their role is to help journalists negotiate between the information obtained by their metrics and their journalistic intuition to make editorial decisions. Third, there is a lack of cohesiveness regarding what these newsroom positions are and how they operate. The paper contributes to the growing literature on the pervasiveness of metrics and quantification of journalistic processes by offering a more nuanced understanding of a new set of editorial roles.",

    "title": "Sourcing the Sources",
    "abstract": "Social media today are playing a more important role as a news source than ever before. Yet, there have been no longitudinal studies on journalists’ sourcing practices in recent years that allow us to consider the mechanisms of innovation diffusion. Comparative studies of different social platforms in different media systems are just as rare. We therefore examine the use of Facebook and Twitter as journalistic sources in newspapers of three countries. A main finding is that, after a period of stagnation at the beginning of this decade, the use of social media sources has resurged massively in recent years. The patterns of this second rise of social media in journalism are almost identical in the analyzed newspapers. A comparison of the platforms has shown that Twitter is more commonly used as a news source than Facebook. Compared to Facebook, Twitter is primarily used as an elite channel. An unsupervised topic clustering approach (LDA) also revealed that the issues on which social media are sourced and the quantities of social media references are similar in The New York Times and The Guardian. In Süddeutsche Zeitung, however, journalists source social media considerably less, and in different thematic contexts.",

    "abstract": "The public needs to be aware of conflict in order to participate effectively in a democracy. The demise of local news has threatened the normative role of journalism in this process. With traditional news organizations struggling, non-profit sites have set out to fill the void. Whether or not they can indeed function as substitutes, however, has largely been unexplored. This case-oriented study examines how frequently stories about local government conflict appeared in the coverage of 10 for-profit and non-profit sites in metropolitan areas, and what factors predicted such coverage. A structural equation model was used to test the direct and indirect effects of organization-level and reporter-level variables. Results indicate non-profit news sites are more likely to cover government conflict, and that this difference is caused by variables inherent to the organizations.",

    "title": "Reporting with WhatsApp: Mobile Chat Applications’ Impact on Journalistic Practices",
    "abstract": "Abstract Since its release in August 2009, WhatsApp has played a key role in the fast development and expansion of the contemporary polymedia environment within which humans interact with each other. Those in the media, and journalists in particular, have taken to this platform to use it as a way to share and receive information as well as to maintain regular, and sometimes more private, contact with their sources. The goal of this paper is to examine the incentives that underlie journalists’ decisions to turn to WhatsApp and the consequences that this mobile chat application has had on the newsmaking practices of reporters inside two Chilean newsrooms. Newsroom ethnography, including participant observation, is employed in this study to gain insight into journalists’ routines and their everyday usage of WhatsApp. The conclusions of this article suggest that the utilization of WhatsApp has impacted the relationship between journalists and sources both on a personal and professional level. New perceptions of intimacy and trust, camaraderie and obtainability, and temporality are observed among the journalists who use this application. These observations carry important professional and ethical implications for journalists navigating today’s media ecology, and show how technological and socioprofessional aspects are tightly interwoven.",

    "title": "Are Newspapers Heading Toward Post-Print Obscurity?",
    "abstract": "With print circulations in decline and the print advertising market shrinking, newspapers in many countries are under pressure. Some—like Finland’s Taloussanomat and Canada’s La Presse—have decided to stop printing and go online-only. Others, like the Sydney Morning Herald, are debating whether to follow. Those newspapers that have made the switch often paint a rosy picture of a sustainable and profitable digital future. This study examines the reality behind the spin via a case study of The Independent, a general-interest UK national newspaper that went digital-only in March 2016. We estimate that, although its net British readership did not decline in the year after it stopped printing, the total time spent with The Independent by its British audiences fell 81%, a disparity caused by huge differences in the habits of online and print readers. This suggests that when newspapers go online-only they may move back into the black, but they also forfeit much of the attention they formerly enjoyed. Furthermore, although The Independent is serving at least 50% more overseas browsers since going online-only, the relative influence on that growth of internal organizational change and external factors—such as the “Trump Bump” in news consumption—is difficult to determine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While deliberation is regarded as crucial for democracies, research on the deliberative nature of user comments in journalism has so far been inconclusive and somewhat neglected to assess audience views qualitatively. Based on 26 in-depth interviews with German media users, this study therefore explores audience views on the deliberative nature and potential of user comments by examining their reasons for active and passive (non-)use, evaluations of comments and perceived personal and societal importance of comments. While users criticize a lack of deliberative or even non-deliberative elements and this drives them to not participate, to evaluate comments negatively and to not attribute personal value to comments, the findings also show that users recognize deliberative elements and that—when present—this deliberative nature is a reason for participation and positive evaluations. Users especially value the often unfulfilled or impeded deliberative potential of comments for society. Strategies to strengthen deliberation and future avenues of research are discussed.",

The papers in this special issue advance our understanding of (1) how online sources are used in the news production process and how they change the relationship between journalists and different groups of actors; and (2) why and how journalists use online sources during their daily work, and how they verify these sources. Together, the different contributions within this issue illustrate that the increasing use of online sources has impacted, yet perhaps not drastically changed, all aspects of journalistic news production.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes how inter-media connections and news flows can establish societal resilience in times of crisis. The article is framed by understandings of the discursive practice of news as polyvocal and networked, and that social media as much as legacy media are important to a society’s resilience to crisis situations. Based on an analysis of the Norwegian public sphere during and immediately after the terrorist attacks of 22 July 2011, the article finds that the Norwegian public sphere established societal resilience through what we identify as “uniformed polyvocality”. This analysis reveals that an inter-connected news landscape, in which power is distributed and trust in established news institutions is intact, is key to the formation of societal resilience in times of crisis. The analysis is based on the following empirical material: Hyperlinks in the Norwegian Twitter-sphere and in online news sites, and sources referenced in stories about the attacks published in the most read Norwegian online and print news outlets. The findings, and the methodology presented in this article, have important implications for future research related to discursive practices of news and societal resilience in times of crisis.",

    "title": "Atomising the News: The (In)Flexibility of Structured Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract The field of data-driven news production and delivery is maturing, and public service media are among a wide range of news organisations innovating to exploit these advances. This article extends the literature on computational journalism by analysing two of the BBC’s recent experiments in “atomizing” the news–an object-based approach, which seeks to make news more adaptable and scalable using media components that can be automatically and algorithmically combined in multiple ways. Findings suggest atomised news is viewed by the organisation as offering opportunities for greater efficiency and personalisation and sits within a broader turn towards “structured journalism.” We highlight three characteristics of atomisation—recording, recombining and re-use—to illustrate how it breaks from traditional approaches. We find journalists are “writing for machines” by converting unstructured information into structured data to enable automated recombination and future re-use of content. This impacts editorial control by delegating responsibility to either the algorithm or the audience, in the name of choice. We propose a research agenda that maps the field of structured journalism, contextualises it in the politics of data and technology, and further considers the implications for public service journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We propose a five-step computational framing analysis framework that researchers can use to analyze multilingual news data. The framework combines unsupervised and supervised machine learning and leverages a state-of-the-art multilingual deep learning model, which can significantly enhance frame prediction performance while requiring a considerably small sample of manual annotations. Most importantly, anyone can perform the proposed computational framing analysis using a free, open-sourced system, created by a team of communication scholars, computer scientists, web designers and web developers. Making advanced computational analysis available to researchers without a programming background to some degree bridges the digital divide within the communication research discipline in particular and the academic community in general.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While news sharing by ordinary social media users has received growing attention, hyper-partisan news sharing, which has been closely associated with misinformation circulation, has received less attention. In this study, we investigate hyper-partisan news sharing from two perspectives: (1) the features that make hyper-partisan news share-worthy, as well as (2) the user motivations that drive the sharing process. We scrutinize one week’s content from Infowars.com as it was shared on Twitter. Through both manual coding of news content and semi-automated clustering of Twitter account descriptions, we find that human interest and conflict in news stories drive the sharing process from a content perspective. Concerning the user perspective, we find partial support for a sharing hypothesis based on motivated reasoning, which indicates that users are more likely to share hyper-partisan news stories if these align with their own political opinions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mobile instant messaging services (MIMs) are important gateways to news exposure and political conversations. Nevertheless, we still know little about the specific uses and consequences of using messaging apps on other aspects of democratic citizenship. This is especially true in Latin American countries, where usage of MIMs is more widespread than any other social media. Using a two-wave panel survey conducted in the context of the 2017 Chilean elections, this study examines the information sharing practices of WhatsApp users, comparing the antecedents and effects of the spread of personal (e.g., family, work) and public affairs content (e.g., news, political messages). Findings show that sharing on WhatsApp was rather equal across social groups, and that it could exert a significant influence on learning about politics and issues in the news as well as on protesting and other political behaviors. We discuss possible explanations, limitations, and significance of these results for digital journalism research and practice.",

The study content-analyzed fact-checking coverage from major news outlets in South Korea using both manual and computerized coding, focusing on three categories of message characteristics: source transparency, contextual information, and vividness. The content-analysis data were examined in relation to behavioral data of audience engagement (“like” and “angry” reactions, shares, and comments) on Naver News, the most popular news portal in South Korea. Using statistics and official reports as evidence and specifying when the claim at hand was made facilitated audience engagement behaviors. News articles triggered more audience comments when they (a) mentioned the importance of fact-checking the claim under scrutiny, and (b) conveyed negative content. Findings are discussed in light of the empirical and practical implications of the current efforts to fight “fake news” by news media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the relationship between legal and journalistic perspectives on the way editorial independence can be safeguarded in the context of automation. It aims to bridge two discussions. First, the journalism studies literature that has explored how automation challenges the way editors and journalists fulfil their role in newsrooms and society. Second, the legal discussion that is revisiting how the conditions for editorial independence can be created in a media system where automation is increasingly important. To do so, this article contrasts a normative framework that outlines the functions of editorial independence in European media law with interviews with editors and journalists involved in data journalism and news personalisation. It finds excellent potential for a complementary relationship between legal and journalistic perspectives on editorial independence. However, the challenges posed by automation fall outside the mechanisms through which this relationship has traditionally been operationalised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Under the premise that the use of alternative news frames is a key characteristic of alternative media, this study examines frame repertoires of alleged mainstream media and right-wing alternative media (RAM) in Germany. This endeavor is based on quantitative content analyses of eighteen news websites, including seven RAM, on two issues: immigration and the coalition talks following the German federal elections 2017. In multidimensional scaling models, we inspect how the media outlets relate to each other. The results show two types of RAM that deviate from the mainstream in different ways. The first type is clearly distinguishable by its interpretive style and heavy use of alternative frames. Media of this type openly oppose immigration, the German government and mainstream media. The second type, consisting of international news providers like RT, exhibits a more descriptive style and frame repertories that are similar to conservative mainstream media. We discuss this as a strategy to establish credibility and highlight perspectives for further research on RAM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The shifting role of journalism in a digital age has affected long-standing journalistic norms across media platforms. This has reinvigorated discussion on how work in online newsrooms compares to other platforms that differ in media affordances and forms. Still, more studies are needed on whether those differences translate into distinct practices, especially when examining cross-national studies. Based on the second wave of the Journalistic Role Performance (JRP) project, this article reports the findings of a content analysis of 148,474 stories produced by 365 media organizations from 37 countries, comparing the performance of journalistic roles in online newsrooms to three other types of media—TV, radio, and print. The paper analyzes if journalistic roles present themselves differently across platforms, and if these differences are constant or they vary across countries. Results show that there are measurable differences in role performance in online journalism compared to other platforms. Platform had a significant impact, particularly in terms of service and infotainment orientation, while the implementation of roles oriented toward public service was more similar. Additionally, country differences in the relationship between role performance and platforms mainly emerged for roles that enable political influence on news coverage, with differences in the relationship between online vs. traditional platforms appearing to be distinct features of the specific political system.",

    "title": "Digital Disconnect: how capitalism is turning the internet against democracy",
    "abstract": "Internet celebrants and sceptics ultimately lead us down blind alleys. To understand digital communications we need a political economy approach that grasps how corporate capitalism has shaped how the internet has developed and is likely to develop. For anyone familiar with the work of this prolific US scholar and activist, Robert McChesney’s Digital Democracy addresses key themes with a wealth of fresh industry data. It provides an accessible introduction to core arguments for sustaining journalism as a public good, with a richly supported analysis of old and new media in America. McChesney also provides a fascinating reflection on the arguments and strategies not only of the internet celebrants and sceptics but also of radical media reformers. The opening chapters introduce contemporary capitalism and the subfield of Political Economy of Communication (PEC) that examines capitalism, democracy and communication. There follow two fluent yet densely supported chapters on the internet. The first charts increasing corporate control and commercialisation, including the “internetisation” of old media; the second focuses on the new “digital giants” such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, and digital advertising and the national security state. A substantial chapter on journalism follows before a conclusion that argues only structural reforms achieved though policy can counter the trends. Here, McChesney, reflecting on the failures of the Obama administration, the corporate capture of politicians and regulators, as well as the difficulties faced by the media reform movement he co-founded, Free Press, to sustain widespread popular support, is at his most downbeat. At a time of crisis, and opportunity, when debates in the decade ahead may settle the contours of communication control for the century, reform cannot succeed while governments are doing the bidding of capital. While there have been important victories, like stalling SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act), the coalition of people power needed to win the big internet policy fights has not yet been assembled and remains an immense challenge. The chapter “Journalism is Dead! Long Live Journalism?” builds on McChesney’s critique and recommendations set out in earlier work, notably Communication Revolution (McChesney 2007) and The Death and Life of American Journalism (McChesney and Nichols 2010), as well as the collection Will the Last Reporter Please Turn Out the Lights (McChesney and Pickard 2011). Commercial journalism is facing collapse and the internet is not substituting for the loss of salaried, professional investigative journalism. The deal between advertising and commercial media that propped up the commercial model is breaking up, rapidly. Advertisers do not need media to track and target prospective consumers, and while media content is still valued, advertisers can extract more concessions from media whose firewall protecting the integrity of journalism from corporate interests has crumbled; “That’s all gone now. Out the window”, the veteran",

On the one hand, the amount of empirical evidence that supports a gap is impressive and the authors show a profound knowledge of the journalistic field. On the other hand, however, the book provokes contestation against a simplification of the reflexive relationship between journalistic supply as the “most newsworthy” and audience demand as the “most clicked” news items.

    "abstract": "For the longest time, many thought the problem was unemployment. When Carl Benedikt Frey and Martin Osborne published their study on potential job losses from automation with Oxford’s Martin School in 2013, they landed what one could call an academic blockbuster (Frey and Osborne 2017). Hardly any conference on something or other digital went by without them being quoted, applauded, dreaded. Images of self-driving lorries, robot doctors and automated lawyers raised fears about the very future of coming generations: In a digital world shaped by artificial intelligence, would there still be work for humans? But now that we hope to approach the other side of the pandemic, an entirely different picture has emerged in many developed economies. As restaurants, airports, hotels, stores, and yes, newsrooms are desperately seeking potential staff and talent, the predominant question sounds more like this: Will there still be humans willing to work if jobs don’t live up to expectations?",

    "abstract": "This article describes and analyses the production, consumption, and form of Live Blogs at a popular UK newspaper website and contributes to related debates in journalism studies. Qualitative research interviews with journalists and editors, a reader survey, content analysis, and web metrics were used to obtain data about production practices, product outcomes, and the consumption stage of the product lifecycle. The study finds that Live Blogs are a popular daily component of the news site, used increasingly to cover serious breaking news. Although rarely authored exclusively on location, they may utilise more original sources than traditional online hard news formats. Their frequent updates mean factual verification is cursory, but compensatory factors, including their attribution practices, contribute to a positive evaluation of their objectivity by readers. Live Blogs—with their timeliness, navigational simplicity, and bite-sized content units—suit readers’ consumption of news in the workplace. Live Blogs may increase online news readers’ interest in public-affairs content, and their inclination to participate. This study contradicts some existing scholarship on sourcing practices, content preferences, and immediacy in online news, while supporting the observation that news is increasingly consumed at work. It makes the novel suggestions that Live Blogging is uniquely suited to readers’ at-work news consumption patterns and that the format provides journalists with a means to manage the competing demands of their elite and mass publics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How do audiences understand today’s high-choice media environment? This study focuses on the beginning stages of the sensemaking process and how audiences group, differentiate, and give meaning to various media organizations. Adopting a multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach, 13 media organizations are visually mapped by the implicit thoughts used to compare them. The output—a sensemaking map—is analyzed across two studies, with a mixed-method sequential explanatory design. Study one uses national survey data of U.S. adults (n = 1502) to generate and interpret an overall, aggregate sensemaking map. Study two combines this procedure with in-depth interviews of 18 U.S. adults, to identify distinct types of personal sensemaking maps and logic. Both studies point to the central role that assessments about media genre (news–entertainment) and political orientation (liberal–conservative) play in the sensemaking process. Ultimately, more attention should be paid to audience sensemaking about media, particularly as research about disinformation, media literacy, and news avoidance grow.",

Pulitzer jurors singled out that coverage for its smart use of Web tools to enhance audience engagement and the paper’s overall online presence without sacrificing accuracy. Findings suggest the growing power of such tools in breaking news and beyond, but also the need for less common but perhaps more humanizing efforts, including short, personalized videos of journalists stepping from behind the veil of objectivity to discuss how they do what they do.",

    "title": "Millennials, News and Social Media: is news engagement a thing of the past?",
    "abstract": "Changing audience consumption patterns are regarded as a key issue in the ongoing debate about the future of newspapers and news industries. Younger age groups, especially the so-called Millennial Generation, often feature prominently in this debate as the audience cluster whose news consumption patterns seem significantly different from those of older generations. Research on this topic has increased in recent years, with scholars applying different methodological approaches and arriving at somewhat different conclusions. Thus far, no decisive conclusion has been reached; some researchers emphasise that what we are seeing is the news consumption of younger age groups shifting platforms and forms, while other scholars argue those in the Millennial Generation are becoming non-users of news. Paula Poindexter’s book, Millennials, News and Social Media: Is News Engagement a Thing of the Past? makes a timely and valuable contribution, and provides evidence that supports the latter school of thought in the debate. The book broadens our knowledge about the news consumption and attitudes to newspapers of the Millennial Generation in the United States. The author argues that there are fundamental differences between news and media consumption patterns between three generations: Baby Boomers, Generation X and Millennials. A key reason for these differences is each generation’s prevailing media technologies, which according to the author leave a “permanent imprint on a generation” (p. 16). For example, while the dominant media technology during childhood and “coming of age” for Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) were TV, radio, movies, comic books, The Ed Sullivan Show, and the “Motown Sound”, for Generation X (born between 1965 and 1982) they were MTV, CNN, USA Today, Apple computers, VCRs, rented movies and reality shows (p. 21). For the Millennial Generation (1983–1999), however, a series of newer technologies meant that they grew up with a wealth of information and entertainment choices their forebears never experienced, and this increased choice has led to a decline in news consumption. A key technology in this respect, according to Poindexter, is social media, which has not only provided plenty of distractions but has also redefined what news is for the Millennial Generation. As a result, Millennials have turned away from traditional news. This can be seen in figures from Pew Research that Poindexter cites, noting “only 27% of them [Millennials] enjoy keeping up with news a lot and even fewer (23%) read a newspaper regularly” (p. 7). An additional factor in this decline, the author argues, is the news industry has ignored early signs of the weakening news engagement of this generation and has been slow to address changing news consumption patterns. Most chapters in this book examine specific aspects of this decline in the news engagement of the Millennial Generation, such as attitudes towards news and coverage of their generation, their general media consumption patterns, and how race, ethnicity,",

    "abstract": "This article chronicles the recent history of the debate in the United States over digital paywalls, a model often hailed as newspapers’ savior. We show how this debate has evolved from emphasizing industry-wide adoption to focusing on individual experiments. While highlighting potential legal, economic, and democratic concerns with paywalls, we examine the empirical record of three prominent newspaper paywall models: the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the Dallas Morning News, and the New York Times. While each has enjoyed varying levels of success, our analysis suggests that paywalls are unable to offset steep losses in advertising revenue. We conclude by briefly discussing non-commercial alternatives.",

As the delivery and consumption of news content online continues to overtake other channels in reader numbers and market penetration, so methods of transparency and reliability developed over centuries continue also to be tested by digital media. We have carried out content analysis on existing stories and developed low fidelity prototypes and an interaction model to test the design approach. The outcomes are in production and will result in a digital artifact that reveals editorial changes to news items. The implications of the project relate to the wider question of news truth-telling, trust and online news credibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract India’s hybrid media milieu provides a plentiful turf to engage with the regulatory framework marking the worlds of digital journalism. On the one hand, are the provisions and silences in inherited regulatory frameworks spilling over to scar digital journalism. On the other hand, are challenges triggered by new actors and dynamics characterising digital journalism. Across these, this article brings out two tendencies marking the regulatory framework of digital journalism, one ridden with control and the other with laissez faire. We begin by introducing the key actors and dynamics in digital journalism in India, and outline the contours of the regulatory architecture. We then detail the regulatory mechanisms implicating digital journalism as a form of speech and a form of business. Reflecting on the personality of the regulatory framework, we highlight the relationship between inherited and emergent regulatory responses. Here we point out two phenomena: the simultaneous endurance of restrictive and market liberal responses; and, the persistent non-intervention on key regulatory challenges. While the latter is captured through the idea of “considered silence,” the seemingly contradictory tendencies of the former are argued be part of the inheritance of analog thinking in media regulation in India.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of this study is to explore the Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) as a specific legal aspect of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) within the context of digital journalism and related media policy issues. We address this issue in cases where requests have been made to unpublish news items or other (visual) content from online media archives because they contain embarrassing, irrelevant and/or outdated, yet truthful content. To do this, we researched the editorial policies of five Slovenian online news media outlets in their responses to such unpublishing requests. First, we reviewed regulation and key legal decisions and then used in-depth semi-structured interviews with editors of these outlets. Our research showed that unpublishing requests from 2018 and 2019 cite or imply the RTBF as having an EU-wide legal basis, yet the media outlets analyzed have not established clear internal policies. This opens the door to inconsistent and/or arbitrary decisions. The legal foundations for unpublishing online news items are vague and, at least in Slovenia, subject to opposing interpretations which might lead to new restrictions on media freedom. To avoid additional potential for the manipulation of media, both legal and self-regulatory frameworks need to be updated and clarified.",

    "title": "“If Nobody Gives a Shit, is it Really News?”",
    "abstract": "While a growing body of academic research explores the evolution of production practices within formal news organizations, much less attention is paid to how journalism schools are addressing the demands of the profession in the twenty-first century. Strains on the traditional routines, practices and unwritten rules of news production challenge those involved in professional development to rethink the standards and skills they prioritize as they transmit knowledge to the next generation of news workers. This paper explores some of these changes in a “learning newsroom” at one of the top journalism schools of the United States. The research is based on both qualitative and quantitative methods, including over 200 hours of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between January and June 2015, interviews with journalism graduate students and faculty members, content analyses of the articles published on the news organization’s website, and an online survey. I focus on the recent shift within my fieldsite from a “learning newsroom” framework to a “Content Lab” alternative envisioned as preparation for graduate students in journalism for a radically different media ecosystem than that which existed in the past. The professionalization process within the Content Lab reflects the eroding boundaries of the institution of journalism. Three interrelated trends stand out in this context: a shift in the educational emphasis from story content to story form; increasingly flexible professional standards concerning what qualifies as news, resulting from the greater emphasis on the audience; and a growing horizontality in the educational process.",

    "title": "Multimedia, Slow Journalism as Process, and The Possibility of Proper Time",
    "abstract": "Digital communication is fast and easy; but as a cultural process communication is difficult, especially when it engages with strangers and strangeness. Roger Silverstone describes the space necessary for respectful communication as a “proper distance” vis-à-vis mediated Others—neither too far away, nor too close to see the Other, and to recognise in her our own inherent Otherness. What Silverstone describes in terms of distance can also be considered in relation to time. This article builds on Silverstone’s ideas to outline a working definition of slow journalism as process, and it is argued that multimedia journalism provides a platform for communication that approximates “proper time”—journalism that is fast enough to engage, surprise and retain our attention, yet slow enough to respect a story’s nuance and complexity. It is argued that the poetics of photography provides a subversive logic of efficiency, capable of both revelation and evocation, and of helping us hear the Other; and that audio can expand our vision beyond the photographic frame, providing us with the necessary context and narrative to properly see. This is a narrative warp and weft. The trajectory of one form crosses and expands the narrative arc of the other, providing colour, depth, and nuance. Multimedia journalism can be quick and profound, fast and slow, short-form and long-form, thus occupying a critical middle ground between the impenetrable overloads and binary simplifications of digital communication, and opening a space and a time for mediated Others.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Informed by new institutional perspectives to debates about theorising media logic, this study asks whether a popular digital native media platform has, over time, conformed to a singular news logic associated with the norms and routines of legacy media. Drawing on a content analysis of 399 BuzzFeed news items and 1878 sources during the 2015 and 2017 UK general election campaigns, we established that coverage had shifted, reflecting an editorial agenda that is consistent with how legacy media have long reported politics. In the 2017 election campaign there was more substantive policy reported, new specialist reporters employed, a greater reliance on institutional sources, particularly from established legacy media, and a sharper focus on the two main political parties. Overall, we argue that, as digital native media have evolved, become more popular and interconnected with legacy media, the norms and routines of their news reporting are not necessarily that distinguishable from a singular, institutional news media logic.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes that the underlying ideas of data journalism are not new, but rather can be traced back in history and align with larger questions about the role of quantification in journalistic practice. This article sketches out a theoretical frame (assemblage theory) in which quantitative journalism is best understood by examining the objects of evidence that journalism mobilizes on its behalf. The article illustrates this perspective by outlining three historical tensions in notions of quantitative journalism: tensions between records and reports, individuality and social science, and isolated facts and broader patterns.",

    "title": "Radical Media Ethics: a global approach",
    "abstract": "Stephen Ward is clearly a man with a mission. His theme is global media ethics and his texts, The Invention of Journalism Ethics: The Path to Objectivity and Beyond (2005), Global Journalism Ethics (2010) and Media Ethics Beyond Borders: A Global Perspective (edited with Herman Wasserman, 2009), together with a number of academic journal papers, have received critical acclaim. Now this new book advertises itself as a “call for action for those who care about the future of journalism in a global, online world”. Its nine chapters are divided into three clearly defined sections. In the first, Ward explores ontological issues, seeing ethics as part of a distinct social reality that depends on human intentionality and agreement. Moreover, ethics are viewed “as a constantly evolving interpretation of values as we respond to ever new conditions” (p. xvii). In the second part, Ward outlines what he calls “a tri-level theory of meaning for media ethics” (pp. 91–170)—involving a thin, “minimal” meaning of basic terms and principles; a “robust” meaning that is developed for interpreting the basic terms and principles; with a third “maximal” meaning grounded in specific practices and cultures. The third and final part includes a call for an integrated media ethics to be “global and cosmopolitan, promoting human flourishing around the world” (pp. 200–201). How might all this be achieved? Ward suggests a three-stage process: firstly there’s the injection of ideas into public discourse, next the codifying of principles and, finally, the completion of “the ethics revolution” when “ethical content will be clearly formulated and receive substantial endorsement” (p. 222). Drawing on an impressive array of theorists—including Manuel Castells, Ronald Dworkin, Immanuel Kant, Martha Nussbaum, John Searle and Ludwig Wittgenstein—it amounts to a fascinating addition to the growing global media ethics oeuvre. It’s bursting with excellent (indeed, radical) ideas. For instance, Ward is all for democratising the media. He argues:",

    "title": "Navigating Interactive Story Spaces. The Architecture of Interactive Narratives in Online Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past decade, journalists have created in-depth interactive narratives to provide an alternative to the relentless 24-hour news cycle. Combining different media forms, such as text, audio, video, and data visualisation with the interactive possibilities of digital media, these narratives involve users in the narrative in new ways. In journalism studies, the convergence of different media forms in this manner has gained significant attention. However, interactivity as part of this form has been left underappreciated. In this study, we scrutinise how navigational structure, expressed as navigational cues, shapes user agency in their individual explorations of the narrative. By approaching interactive narratives as story spaces with unique interactive architectures, in this article, we reconstruct the architecture of five Dutch interactive narratives using the walkthrough method. We find that the extensiveness of the interactive architectures can be described on a continuum between closed and open navigational structures that predetermine and thus shape users’ trajectories in diverse ways.",

    "title": "Journalism as Cultures of Circulation",
    "abstract": "The universe of journalism has always consisted of interspersed texts, practices and meanings. Yet, much journalism research has often isolated either texts and/or contexts and thus assumed relations between professional practices, informed (rational) readers and (conceived) core texts. It is, however, more important than ever to shift attention away from texts to the processes through which they are circulated. This is partly because the many cultural forms of journalism (textual, institutional, technological, material, behavioural and imagined) are undergoing significant changes, one of which is being interrelated in new and increasingly complex ways. To understand some of the related processes, this article proposes a notion of circulation that implies a close attention to the ways in which the various forms of this landscape travel, intertwine and connect and, in particular, to the ways in which these forms construct and maintain what is termed cultures of circulation. In order to approach such processes, this article traces the photographic mediation of a specific event with the overall aim of beginning a theorization of the landscape of journalism as interrelated cultures of circulation.",

    "abstract": "Tiananmen Square is a compressed and repressed space of memories and histories. It is symbolic of different forms of collective forgetting and remembering for the Chinese state and a monumental space of global spectatorship. In 2013, the commemoration of the 24th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989 in Sina Weibo (the Chinese version of Twitter), demonstrated how people negotiated state censorship to remember the event. This social media commemoration was both an act of resistance against the state’s imposition of an official memory and equally a means to thwart censorship through creative expression, particularly in the form of the image. The commemoration of Tiananmen online nevertheless highlighted the hegemony of media memory where it was entrapped through the iconic image of the Tank Man. The Tank Man as a meme on social media was both a phantom place memory of Tiananmen as well as a cultural artefact re-imagined through the ludic and visual architecture of Web 2.0.",

    "title": "The No-Go Zone of Journalism Studies—Revisiting the Concept of Technological Determinism",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study aims to assess technological determinism in relation to interdisciplinarity in journalism studies. Based on a scoping review of articles published during the last decade in three influential scientific journals within the journalism studies field, Digital Journalism, New Media & Society and Journalism, the study analyzes manifestations of technological determinism and interdisciplinarity. The review includes in its analysis 127 articles published between 2012 and 2022 that mention “technological determinism” and “journalism.” Furthermore, the study connects these manifestations to the biographies of the authors in terms of their PhD dissertation discipline. The study raises two concerns. First, the analysis of the manifestation of technological determinism indicates that technological determinism is mainly thought of and discussed by the scholarly community from a functionalist viewpoint. It seems like scholarship that has added nuances and further developed the theory has been disregarded or perhaps is not even known. Second, interdisciplinary research on technology becomes difficult since the essence of technological determinism is considered a no-go zone in journalism studies. However, for the field of journalism studies to grow even stronger a revised delimitation is necessary. To reduce the stigma around technological determinism as a concept, the limitation should not exclude the use of the concept, but encourage a more nuanced assessment of it to contribute to the discussion of the role of technology in journalism.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the entanglements between data journalists and civic technologists. Following an approach inspired by practice theory, it describes how they form a community that comes together through interlocking practices and complementary values and ambitions. Data journalists and civic technologists interlock along a continuum that oscillates between practices of facilitating (enabling others to take action themselves) and gatekeeping (being impactful and steer public debates). Depending on how much emphasis is put on either facilitating or gatekeeping, four different groups are identified that differ in how they position their work, in their professional self-understanding and in how they use data: Normalizers, Experimenters, Translators and Facilitators. The article concludes by suggesting that actors populating this community of practice can be described as flexible data professionals who aspire to work in a public interest. The findings illustrate how the progressive datafication of social life creates new entanglements between the field of journalism and civil society and we should pay more attention to such entanglements and the implications for increasingly datafied publics.",

    "title": "Alternative Journalism as Monitorial Citizenship?",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen claims that some examples of online alternative journalism in the form of hyperlocal and local blogs are helping to address society’s “democratic deficit” by subjecting the actions of the powerful to increased public scrutiny, in a process that has been described as “monitorial citizenship”. To explore how this might work in practice, this study examines the origins, motivations and practices of one such site in the United Kingdom: the Leeds Citizen. The aim is to provide the sort of detailed consideration in depth that is almost by definition missing from wider surveys of the field. To this end, the case study is based on a series of interviews with the site’s creator, augmented by analysis of content, all discussed within the context of scholarly literature on how alternative, non-commercial forms of journalism operate in the digital age. The article concludes that this contemporary form of alternative journalism may indeed be described as an example of monitorial citizenship in action, but there is also a need for further research.",

    "abstract": "This article critically interrogates the impact of new information and communication technologies on the institutional practices of mainstream journalists in Nigeria with particular reference to current newsroom practices and how user-generated content (UGC) was incorporated into mainstream media coverage of the 2011 Nigerian election. Rooted in the sociology of journalism, the study employs an ethnographic approach to examine the implications of new information and communication technologies for journalistic practices in Nigeria. With a reading of new information technologies as “alternative journalism”, the ethnography, which deployed in-depth interviews with print journalists as well as newsroom observation, investigated whether “alternative journalism” is challenging traditional newsroom culture in Nigeria. The findings suggest that alternative journalism is redefining the roles of mainstream journalists as “news producers”. Journalists have become “gatewatchers” with everyone else, especially during the 2011 elections when citizens actively engaged with alternative journalism in reporting the elections. However, mainstream journalists continue to contest their hegemonic traditional practices of giving prominence to “official” sources in news reporting, and negotiate how “alternative journalism” in the form of UGC is networked into mainstream reporting to avoid publishing rumours. The study concludes that contrary to scholarship that sees digital technologies as “de-professionalising” journalists, mainstream journalism in Nigeria maintains the dominant discourse by articulating and appropriating content from “alternative” sources for subtle economic motives.",

    "abstract": "Social media and “citizen journalism” have arguably changed the face of traditional newsgathering. This paper examines how social media and user-generated content (UGC), specifically video, have been integrated by BBC World News into their coverage of conflicts, with Syria as the main case study. Drawing on interviews with BBC News staff, a newsroom ethnography and a content analysis of BBC World News TV reports, this research asks: What are the challenges for journalists wishing to use UGC? What are the skillsets needed? And is the role of the journalist itself changing, with news becoming more “social” as it is being gathered and disseminated on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter? This paper argues that journalists have been forced to react to issues pertaining to UGC newsgathering, verification and dissemination. The study contributes to literature examining how UGC is used by news outlets. It also considers the extent to which the role of the journalist itself is being redefined as new products are launched. The findings illustrate that UGC has, at times, been used extensively to cover events in Syria, but ideally complements journalists’ own reportage. The research also highlights the crucial role played by journalists, harvesting and checking content found online.",

    "abstract": "Abstract How audiences behave behind newspaper paywalls is, in research, almost unknown territory. In editorial offices, however, this has become common knowledge, since traffic data is available around the clock. In this study, we have had the opportunity to study how subscribers with different degrees of subscription experience behave behind the paywall. In the analysis, we use traffic data generated from tracking scripts and stored in Amazon Redshift. The results are unambiguous. Readers with a paid subscription show a higher degree of activity, greater involvement, and more varied usage than do newly added readers with a free subscription, independent of age. Following subscribers with free subscriptions over time shows that their behaviour mainly is negative, with an overall lower degree of activity. Young subscribers with short-term accounts show the lowest degree of activity, independent of the measurement used. Implications of the results are discussed.",

    "title": "DIGITALITY, VIRTUAL REALITY AND THE ‘EMPATHY MACHINE’",
    "abstract": "The man who works recognizes his own product in the World that has actually been transformed by his work: He recognizes himself in it, he sees in it his own human reality, in it he discovers and reveals to others the objective reality of his humanity, of the originally abstract and purely subjective idea he has of himself. Alexandre Kojève (1980, 27) The essay critiques an aspect of the so-called post-mobile wave of technological change that claims, through the vector of virtual reality (VR), to have created an ‘empathy machine’ that will form the basis of a new journalism. Through VR devices deployed by news organisations such as the New York Times, and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, users will be so powerfully immersed in, for example, a street demonstration, or a refugee camp, that the empathy they feel may constitute a new strengthening of the fourth estate’s civic role in informing and enlightening the public, to the extent that it can go beyond subjective empathy to develop a shared basis for political participation in civil society. The essay considers these claims from the overarching context of what is called digitality. It argues that human agents are analogue agents from an analogue world. Digitality, by contrast, is an essentially alienating sphere wherein digital media cannot replicate analogue communication processes without generating gaps, voids, and ‘missing information’. It further argues, extending insights from Guy Debord, that what VR does produce is a powerful ‘integrated spectacle’ that is a pale substitute for the form of interactive experience needed for the generation of empathy. Taken together, the essay concludes that empathy, a contestable term in its common understanding to begin with, cannot be generated from a digital source. Moreover, should VR become the next dominant post-mobile technological wave as the tech giants predict, then people, users and consumers of VR products in the fourth estate news context, will be further distanced from the analogue reality of the actual world.",

    "title": "When Computers were New: Shifts in the Journalistic Sensorium (1960s–1990s)",
    "abstract": "Abstract In an attempt to escape the presentist and pro-innovation biases that sometimes taint (digital) journalism studies scholarship, this article proposes an oral history of newsroom computerization before the boom of the Internet, from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. Our work is informed by three theoretical and methodological sensibilities: (1) a plea for genealogical approaches of “new” technologies made by scholars at the intersection of media history and STS, (2) an interest in reframing journalism history as the history of newswork, (3) an overall sensibility for the materiality of journalism, which leads us to study the history of newsroom computerization through the lens of shifts in the journalistic sensorium. Drawing on interviews with newsworkers active during the key decades of the 1960s to the 1990s in the province of Quebec, Canada, our findings show that they primarily remember computers as personal tools (and not as newsroom-wide transformations) that were easily incorporated to their work habits. Furthermore, we show how the introduction of computers affected the senses of journalists doing work: newsmaking sounds, feels and moves differently with computers. Altogether, we argue that these transformations have epistemological consequences, as newswork shifts from analogue craft to screenwork.",

    "title": "An Emotional Turn in Journalism Studies?",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article develops the idea of an “emotional turn” in journalism studies, which has led to an increasingly nuanced investigation of the role of emotion in the production, texts and audience engagement with journalism. These developments have occurred in tandem with, and accelerated by, the emergence of digital and social media. Research on news production has shown that journalistic work has always taken emotion into consideration, shaping approaches to storytelling and presentation. However, the view of journalists as detached observers has rendered the emotional labor associated with news production invisible. Research on emotion in journalistic texts has highlighted the fact that even conventional “hard news genres” are shaped by an engagement with emotion. As studies on news audiences and emotions have shown, audiences are more likely to be emotionally engaged, recall information and take action when news stories are relatable. The affordances of digital platforms and social media have had a profound impact on the space for emotion. The expanded opportunities for participation have contributed to questioning traditional distinctions between news audiences and producers and have ushered in new and more forms of emotional expression that have spilled over into practices of news production.",

    "abstract": "As the use of social media becomes more common, it is often claimed that a media environment arises in which traditional distinctions between concepts like online and offline, producer and audience, citizen and journalist become blurred. This study’s purpose is to identify and explore the implications for contemporary news stories. Using a content analysis of Belgian election campaign coverage in 2014, we study the role of five newspapers, two daily television newscasts, seven current affairs programmes, radio news bulletins, three news websites, and a selection of Twitter accounts in creating and shaping news stories. We find that the analytical distinction between platforms still matters, since they have different roles in creating and shaping news stories, suggesting that different platform-specific logics are at play. Twitter is an important factor in launching and shaping news stories, but it tends to be dominated by establishment actors (journalists and politicians), whereas citizens only play a modest role.",

Borrowing sophisticated tools and resources from computer science and computational linguistics, journalism scholars have started to gain insights into the constant information flow and made big data a regular feature of the scientific debate. Both deductive (manual and semi-automated) and inductive (fully automated) text analysis methods are part of this new toolset. In order to make the automated research process more tangible and provide an insight into the options available, we provide a roadmap of common (semi-)automated options for text analysis. We describe the assumptions and workflows of rule-based approaches, dictionaries, supervised machine learning, document clustering, and topic models. We show that automated methods have different strengths that provide different opportunities, enriching—but not replacing—the range of manual content analysis methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The article investigates the futures of journalism that pioneering entrepreneurial journalists anticipate. This comprises the different imaginaries that journalists employ to make sense of journalism’s present potentials, anticipate its possible futures, and inform their decision-making. By analysing semi-structured interviews with Finnish entrepreneurial journalists, the article identifies a peer-to-peer imaginary on which the interviewees draw and construct to anticipate the potential futures of journalism. In this peer-to-peer imaginary, journalism is produced in journalists’ and audiences’ peer networks of affinity and shared interests. The imaginary promises elevated audience engagement and increased income from audience members. It also emphasises journalistic work that is often seen as ideal: autonomous, multi-skilled, self-expressive and non-routine. Despite these potentially preferred outcomes, the imaginary risks distancing journalism from its public roles and embracing more individualised and market-oriented approaches. The peer-to-peer imaginary can shape a journalism that is increasingly elitist by orienting it towards serving paying audiences, contributing to the fragmentation of public discussion by its focus on niche interests and playing into the power interests of global social media platforms that govern much of the digital media infrastructure. The imaginary, thus, mirrors the prevailing contemporary tendency to employ emancipatory visions of digital technologies for commercial objectives.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the tweeting habits of journalists with different job roles at a UK city newspaper. The Twitter profiles of 16 journalists working at The Star in Sheffield were captured in 2014 and a content analysis was conducted to examine the types of information each individual was reporting. The data revealed Twitter was being utilised as a versatile tool for gathering, reporting and disseminating news, and there was correlation between types of tweets and the job role of the profile account holder. Those in managerial positions tended to include more hyperlinks to their own news website and use Twitter as a promotional tool whereas sports journalists tended to use the social media platform as a live reporting tool. News reporters at the newspaper did not regularly link back to their legacy platform, preferring to use Twitter to build relationships and interactions with users. The authors conclude that these data together with similar comparative studies are useful for identifying patterns in changing journalistic roles within a local, national and international context. The emerging trends challenge the notion of the redefinition of the journalist as a universal role and instead point towards multiple redefinitions of the varying roles of journalists.",

    "title": "Reporting the Covid-19 Pandemic: Trauma on Our Own Doorstep",
    "abstract": "Abstract The political and media rhetoric of the pandemic is that of conflict and a call to arms in face of a hidden enemy. But this is not a distant war where journalists are parachuted in to report on the action for a few weeks and then fly home. It is on our own doorstep. Many of those covering the global crisis do not correspond to the popular image of hardened conflict reporters and may have little experience in dealing with distressing stories of death, grief and mourning. How are journalists coping with the everyday diet of trauma when the corona frontline may be affecting their families, friends and colleagues? this article explores these issues through narrative interviews with UK-based journalists covering the pandemic for broadcast, print and digital media. It seeks to capture their “emotional labour” and explore possible differences in their practice and the coping strategies they employ. The paper locates this discussion within the context of an industry that has paid relatively little heed to these issues and considers what long-term implications the coronavirus may have for the next generation of digital journalists.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Editorial technologists, such as developers, designers, or data specialists represent novel interdisciplinary computational journalism positions in newsrooms. Drawing on field theory, this explorative study evaluates the character of the professional community of editorial technologists by analyzing their discussions in the peer conference “SRCCON” over four years (2016–2019). Findings indicate that editorial technologists are united by the goal to improve journalism. They critically reflect on their roles and strive to augment their agency in the field through normalizing their computational skills, accumulating social capital, e.g., by building enduring relationships in newsrooms, and gaining symbolic capital. Instead of pressing to enforce technological adoption at all costs, editorial technologists acknowledge their responsibility towards the editorial office, news organizations, audiences, and society at large. These responsibilities form the core of their doxa, which is why we conceive of editorial technologists as a community of accountable engineers of sociotechnical change in journalism. Editorial technologists’ collective professional imagination aims at overcoming the inert processes, hegemonic structures, and restrictive culture of journalism.",

    "title": "“Saving Journalism from Facebook’s Death Grip”? The Implications of Content-Recommendation Platforms on Publishers and Their Audiences",
    "abstract": "Abstract Previous research on the platformization of news has mostly been devoted to considering the effects of social media on the news industry. The current study focuses on Taboola and Outbrain, two leading content recommendation platforms. The companies form “partnerships” with news organizations, through which they take over a designated space on news websites and curate news, sponsored content, and advertisements, creating a blend that—the companies claim—maximizes monetization. We argue that the unique business model and distribution mechanism of these companies has a distinct effect on news sites, their audiences, and ultimately the journalism profession. An empirical analysis of 97,499 recommended content items, scraped from nine Israeli news sites, suggests that the spaces created by these partnerships blur the distinction between editorial and monetization logics. In addition, we find the creation of indirect network effects: while large media groups benefit from the circulation of sponsored content across their websites, smaller publishers pay Taboola and Outbrain as advertisers to drive traffic to their websites. Thus, even though these companies discursively position themselves as \"gallants of the open web\"—freeing publishers from the grip of walled-garden platforms—they de facto expose the news industry to the influence of the platform economy.",

    "abstract": "Curious City, a series produced by WBEZ Chicago Public Media, invites listeners to participate in the reporting process. Using the Hearken digital engagement platform, listeners ask and then vote on questions that are turned into radio stories. Over a year, Curious City attempted to engage residents of Chicago areas that traditionally had few public radio listeners, mostly stigmatized African-American and Latinx neighborhoods, to participate via face-to-face outreach, outreach via community partners, or social media marketing. Using a communication infrastructure theory framework, this study draws from observations and 25 interviews with journalists, participating audience members, residents of targeted outreach areas, and partner organizations to examine best practices to combine digital and offline strategies, and the importance of pre- and post-broadcast engagement. The study also reflects on journalistic norms and approaches to participatory media, local news “storytelling networks,” and relations between public media and marginalized publics.",

    "title": "Saving Data Journalism",
    "abstract": "Important works of data journalism are disappearing from the web because they are too technologically complex to be captured or archived by libraries or web archiving technologies. Research based on journalism depends on the existence of news archives. For the benefit of future scholars, it is imperative that libraries and newsrooms solve this problem. This research contends that dynamic web archiving of data journalism will require a new, emulation-based approach to capturing these works. This new approach in turn necessitates new web archiving tools and workflows to enable collaborative collection of the projects, because unlike in print-based archiving, the process will depend on detailed technical information sharing among stakeholders. Toward this end, this article summarizes the results of a questionnaire that described the most common frameworks, database technologies, and programming languages used to build 76 complex works of data journalism published between 2008 and 2017, as well the ways these works are being maintained and stored. This information can inform the development of emulation-based archiving tools to capture and preserve these stories using methods that would fit within the workflow of news organizations. This research is a first step toward devising an automated solution for long-term preservation of data journalism projects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While past studies have predominantly focused on bias in traditional mainstream media in the Western context, this article seeks to explore bias on the Telegram App during the 2017 presidential election in Iran. In doing so, the most visited Telegram news channel titled AkhbareFori (literally meaning breaking news) was selected. Three types of bias (i.e. gatekeeping, coverage and statement) were examined through quantitative content analysis. The results of the study regarding gatekeeping bias show the rate of mainstream sources affiliated to the Reformists was higher than the rate of Conservative sources. In addition, the study indicates that the rate of news coverage from the Reformists was higher than the rate of news coverage from the Conservatives. Moreover, the results indicate that the channel showed higher positive orientation towards the Reformists. Accordingly, AkhbareFori had all three types of bias in favor of the Reformists. Other characteristics of the AkhbareFori channel such as use of news values and tone of news items are also discussed in the article.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines how people tailor their news environment in an era of news abundance. In particular, the researchers attempted to clarify the concept of news tailoring by identifying its structures in the context of digital news consumption. The study’s findings show that news tailoring takes place either through excluding (decreasing the quantity of news to process) or including (lowering the complexity involved in news processing) specific types of news. Specifically, two excluding behaviors (ignoring and filtering) and two including behaviors (customizing and saving) constitute the dimension of news tailoring. The results demonstrate that those who suffer from higher levels of news overload are more likely to adopt two types of exclusionary approaches (ignoring and filtering) and a saving strategy. However, news overload and news customizing were not significantly associated. The implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Using a qualitative approach, this article explores South African community radio stations’ uses of the internet, particularly the online social networking sites, Facebook and Twitter. Specifically, it explores the extent to which these sites are used in news production, and whether there is an increase in organization on the basis of network sociality instead of identity politics or communal social relations. Focusing on three community radio stations in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban (South Africa’s three largest cities), the article draws on anthropological methods of participant observation and qualitative interviews. The study argues that while the potential exists, in this case access to and the use of social media does not necessarily facilitate the formation of counterpublics or result in collective political action and networked activism. However, the technologies have impacted on the daily routines of community radio journalists who increasingly rely on the internet as a source of news; and in turn, their use of social media has led to greater access and participation for those audiences which are already online.",

    "abstract": "The 2014 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Ice Bucket Challenge (IBC) received unprecedented attention by both news media and social media audiences. Using content analysis, this research examines how digital news utilized different news values and emotional appeals to cover the IBC. In addition, this work includes a secondary analysis that examines what coverage characteristics influenced social media audiences to share content on Facebook and Twitter. Results reveal that while celebrity participation and human interest stories were more likely to be covered, news values played a limited role in predicting audience sharing practices. Articles that use emotions in a story are more likely to entice sharing on Facebook than on Twitter.",

    "title": "News Coverage of the Arab Spring: State-Run News Agencies as Discursive Propagators of News",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We explore the official state news agencies’ digital platforms of 10 Arab countries depict the “Arab Spring.” We argue that these agencies serve as “discursive propagators” because their outreach is widespread throughout the media ecosystem and are regarded as one of the only official sources of news on the protest movements in these respective countries. This article makes two main original contributions to the field of digital journalism. First, it introduces the theoretical concept of discursive propagators that addresses the often neglected information impact of state-run news agencies operating in authoritarian states and their influence on other news media. By examining this seldom studied area of news production in the region, we are able to glean some news content that has the potential of influencing Arabic news media. Second, the study examines a unique Arabic language dataset and analyzes it using topic modelling and other digital approaches that are not often employed in the analysis of Arabic news. The analysis of digital state news agency coverage is contextualized to provide more insight into this digital type of content that often sets the tone of local journalistic production about the Arab Spring and other politically sensitive issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The complexity and diversity of today’s media landscape provides many challenges for scholars studying online news consumption. Yet it is unclear how news consumers navigate online. Moving forward, we used a custom-built browser plug-in—passively tracking Dutch online news consumers 24/7—to examine how context (website) and content (news topic) features affect patterns of online news consumption. This resulted in a data set containing more than one million Web pages, from 175 websites (news websites, search engines, social media), collected over 8 months in 2017/18. We used automated content analysis to retrieve news topics, and estimated Markov chains to detect consumption patterns. Our findings indicate that news consumers often directly visit their favorite (typically mainstream) news outlet, and continue browsing within that outlet. We also found a strong preference for entertainment news over any other topic. Although social media often offer entertainment news, they are not necessarily the starting point to such news.",

    "title": "Characterizing Communication Patterns between Audiences and Newsbots",
    "abstract": "Abstract News organizations are increasingly exploring how the use of newsbots can enhance journalism by enabling novel ways to disseminate news and engage with audiences in social media environments. While newsbots have begun to draw attention in journalism studies, little consideration has been given to how audiences perceive and respond to newsbots. Through the lens of human–machine communication (HMC), this article presents a case study of a newsbot interacting with Twitter users who shared news articles from the New York Times (NYT). In particular, we analyzed the Twitter users’ perceptions and responses to the newsbot using qualitative analysis. We found that Twitter users perceived the newsbot in several degrees: from ignoring it, to addressing the content curated by the newsbot, to responding to newsbot itself. Moreover, we found that Twitter users offered a range of opinions, personal experiences, facts, counter-arguments, and affective displays when they addressed the content or the newsbot. We discuss how newsbots can be effective tools to enhance news engagement, the obstacles that they face when they interact in online environments, and reflect on the range of communicative roles that newsbots play with online audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines how extended family group chats on WhatsApp operate as meso-news spaces, focusing on how misinformation is negotiated within these spaces. Through interviews with urban Indian young adults (N = 26), it finds that these spaces are characterized by a mix of interpersonal interaction and news, including misinformation. The findings suggest that young Indians believe that older generations are more susceptible to believing such misinformation, reflecting third-person perceptions regarding susceptibility to misinformation. The participants view misinformation correction as something one ought to do but state that it is not a widespread practice among their peers. Furthermore, various considerations shape their own decision to correct or not correct older relatives who share misinformation. They consider the misinformation topic and refrain from correcting misinformation on politics or religion; the potential consequences of correction, as they avoid correcting if it may lead to conflict; and their relationship with the misinformation sharer, as a greater sense of closeness, history, and rapport makes correction easier. They view WhatsApp as a suitable space for correction as it is associated with a known audience. Thus, this study reveals how relational, cultural, and technological factors inform responses to misinformation within meso-news spaces.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As algorithms are increasingly integrated into news selection and consumption processes, it is crucial to understand how news users respond to them. Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this study examined the underlying mechanisms of consumptive news feed curation, a type of news consumption behaviour through which news users could determine what shows up in their news feeds. Findings based on a national survey data in the United States showed that the proportion of Facebook users who practiced consumptive news feed curation remained low and the extent of such practices varied according to their socioeconomic and political backgrounds. The study further tested a moderated mediation model and found that Facebook use contributed to consumptive news feed curation through perceived knowledge, depending on levels of perceived user controllability. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article explores De Correspondent as a specific example of slow journalism that aims to establish an alternative for quality journalism governed by the objectivity regime. It offers an analysis of the way the platform redefines journalism’s quality standards against the background of the tension between traditional modernistic claims to truth and competing postmodern ideas on the social construction of knowledge. Moreover, the article examines how these ideals are translated into journalistic texts. The article argues that both in its rhetoric and in its actual practice, the articles in De Correspondent deviate from the principles of quality journalism under the objectivity regime. They are structured around the mediating subjectivity of the journalists and are thus openly subjective. Yet, they also draw on empirical research and scientific knowledge. Moreover, they are transparent about the reporting process, which through their reflection becomes an integral part of the story itself. Thus, being transparent about their combination of different forms of knowledge, rooted in more traditional rational-positivistic inquiry as well as in personal experience and emotion, they try to reconcile the tension between the modernist and postmodernist claims to truth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, misinformation and hoaxes travel faster than they did in the past, mostly thanks to the emergence of digital platforms and the popularization of social networking sites. Scholars have found that journalists have turned social media platforms into essential components of their professional operations. However, the extent to which journalists engage in debunking misinformation on social media is still unclear. By conducting a U.S. Nationally representative survey with more than 400 journalists, this study delves into journalists’ perceptions of false information, social media use, and debunking actions to expose misleading content in online contexts. Our findings indicate low levels of debunking, although we found factors associated with journalists either confronting or reporting misinformation. On the one hand, journalists who use social media platforms to develop their brands and engage directly with their audiences are more likely to publicly confront misinformation. On the other hand, journalists who believe social media companies should be held accountable for the spread of fake news do not engage directly in confronting false information, but do report it when they encounter it. Taken together, our findings suggest the journalist-audience relationship plays a central role to understand debunking behaviors in online spaces.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Governments and policymakers are considering intervening in the relationship between major tech companies and the news media industry and holding various inquiries and reviews to canvass reform options. This article provides a comparative study of Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, some of the earliest countries in the world to engage in these policy processes. The study reveals that these media systems have devised similar regulatory tools and their approach aligns with a more disaggregated set of reforms occurring across Europe. While these reform agendas often draw on valuable concepts from media policy, they also awkwardly translate frameworks and introduce already questionable regulatory approaches to the platform environment. The most notable is the ongoing focus on stakeholders instead of the wider public interest. I end the paper by arguing the long-term sustainability of journalism need to be decoupled from attempts to limit platform power. I outline a more targeted regulatory response focussed on antitrust and privacy and note that journalism will receive downstream benefits from these efforts. The approach challenges the core issues associated with platform dominance and stands in contrast to current reform proposals, which threaten to hamper much needed institutional transformation across the journalism sector",

    "title": "Theorizing Citizenship in Citizen Journalism",
    "abstract": "Citizen journalism has become a prominent term referring to a variety of newsgathering and reporting practices conducted via a range of new digital technologies. The scholarly literature on citizen journalism, however, has tended to concentrate on its significance for journalism theory and practice while comparatively neglecting underlying questions about the theories of citizenship utilized within citizen journalism. This article examines the range of theories of citizenship at work in citizen journalism, highlighting problems in trying to locate citizen journalism practices and practitioners within definitional debates around citizenship. It explores how some theories construct citizen journalism as a tool for citizenship whilst others construct it as constituting a form of citizenship in its own right. The article identifies a range of problems within these theories in terms of their capacity to understand the relationship between citizen journalism and citizenship. It argues that fully understanding and situating citizen journalism requires moving beyond the journalism-centered focus which dominates the literature towards a consideration of citizen journalism that incorporates theories and practices of citizenship alongside those of journalism.",

    "title": "Newsroom Engineering Teams as “Survival Entities” for Journalism? Mapping the Process of Institutionalization at\n            <i>The Washington Post</i>",
    "abstract": "Abstract Engineering teams – a form of newsroom innovation labs – have been heralded as survival entities in the news ecosystem as they have the potential to improve where news goes and moves. At The Washington Post, these teams have been around for three years, and they started to implement tools like election models fueled by A.I. and smart data pipelines that can possibly affect the autonomy and the tasks of the broader newsroom. By applying the process of institutionalization as an analytical framework, this study enhances our understanding of how the interaction takes place between these rather novel engineering teams and the established newsroom. In addition, we get a glimpse if the tools that are being implemented by these engineering teams are taken for granted and what forms of interaction obstruct or drive the way these tools are institutionalized. This study conducted 16 expert interviews focusing on the interaction and the process of institutionalization in combination with digital ethnography where that interaction is observable. Results reveal how the innovation justify – via interaction – the implementation of these tools to the broader newsroom and vice versa. The ways in which the tools are trusted to a minimal group of the newsroom show that the process of institutionalization, for both the teams and the tools, are still in a nascent state. The journalists in the broader newsroom that trust these tools are mostly data savvy and are therefore very homogenous. Transparency is key in order to increase institutionalization across the newsroom for these engineering teams and their tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Do people with a more pessimistic worldview also select more like-minded news that confirms their negative—sometimes irrational—outlook on reality? This study theorizes that, based on the negativity and confirmation biases in audience digital news selection, a pessimistic outlook increases the likelihood of self-selection of more negative and episodic headlines over positive and thematic news. In a next step, news media literacy (NML) literature is consulted to explore how to counter this tendency to, via news selection, confirm an overly negative and distorted worldview. A selective-exposure experiment (N = 612) monitored participants’ self-selection of crime news after exposure to NML interventions. Findings show that those participants who hold a more pessimistic outlook on crime in society tend to confirm this worldview by self-selecting into more negative crime news. Exposure to NML interventions concerning negativity bias or clickbait was found to mitigate this negativity bias in news selection, especially for those who already hold a pessimistic outlook. This study is the first to document that NML interventions can potentially have merits as a tool to combat negativity bias in online news selection.",

    "title": "Quantified Audiences in News Production",
    "abstract": "A number of social, technological, and economic shifts over the past two decades have led to the proliferation of audience analytics and metrics in journalism. This article contends that we are witnessing a third wave toward the rationalization of audience understanding and distinguishes between audience analytics (systems that capture information) and audience metrics (quantified measures output by those systems). The body of literature on analytics and metrics in the context of news production is then synthesized across the ABCDE of news production: attitudes, behaviors, content, discourse, and ethics. That synthesis leads to an overarching conclusion that while contemporary journalism is not being driven by quantified audiences, both audiences and quantification are playing far more prominent roles in news production than in the past. Scholars and practitioners have also become less pessimistic about analytics and metrics over time, recognizing more nuanced effects and prosocial possibilities. Finally, important gaps in the literature are identified and new research directions proposed to help address them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research examines the key characteristics of hyperpartisan news pages on Facebook and how audiences interact with politically polarized content through the visual-emotional shorthand of Facebook Reactions. Through a quantitative content analysis of 4,236 posts shared by the most popular hyperpartisan U.S. Facebook pages before, during, and after the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, the researchers introduce the concept of affective affordances to analyse emotional reactions elicited through Facebook Reactions in response to right- and left-leaning Facebook news posts, as well as the political topics, rhetorical devices, stylistic devices and emotionally charged content that are most likely to elicit emotional responses and inspire shares and comments from audiences in reaction to liberal and conservative content. The results are interpreted in light of the theory of affective intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of an increasingly complex variety of digital actors who may be considered as engaging in journalism has led to a veritable explosion of scholarship on peripheral actors in the field. Numerous cases have been analyzed, yet we currently lack a systematic understanding of the shapes and forms in which such actors can be studied. To better account for the increasing complexity in this area of scholarship, this article conducts a systematic literature review of 63 articles published in English-language peer-reviewed journals. Through this review, we identify and propose a framework for assessing and classifying the peripherality of actors that is composed of three dimensions – identities, practices, and structures. These are further divided into ten components, which we have termed: values, experience, belongingness, professionalism, competencies, formats, transformativity, autonomy, audience-centricity, and organization. Together, these may help scholars better understand the diversity of peripheral activities in journalism.",

    "abstract": "The New York Times’ 2012 publication of John Branch’s “Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek” reinvented the template for digital longform articles designed for the tablet and inspired other media outlets to create similar products. This essay uses three case studies—a legacy newspaper (New York Times), a sports media outlet (ESPN), and a legacy magazine (Sports Illustrated)—to illuminate how different companies use digital longform to build their brands and compete for market share in the wake of “Snow Fall.” Special attention is given to how these companies deploy “Snow Fall’s” signature elements to distinguish their brand identities in the race for the growing demographic of tablet users. As an emblem of its company’s efforts to build journalistic prestige, each work functions as a “cognitive container” in which media add-ons work to hold reader attention rather than scatter it to external Web sources. These examples suggest digital journalism represents an important development in convergence culture and illustrate this emergent form’s industrial, institutional, and cultural uses.",

The goal is to fill a gap in the literature on viral news especially on social media news as previous communication studies mostly focused on news sharing habits on the news organizations’ websites as well as editors’ news selection criteria. The top 50 news stories are selected for this study by examining the most viewed videos on the Guardian, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal’s YouTube channels as well as their most retweeted news stories. The study introduces a mixed model to examine viral news, borrowing from previous studies on emotions and others that focused on news worthiness. The results indicate that social media news readers prefer to read and share overwhelmingly positive news, while social significance and unexpectedness in news stories are the most appealing viral news elements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the relationship between digital news coverage of protests and the audience’s willingness to engage with a story about Black Lives Matter on social media. Using a 3x2 experiment, we evaluate if news frames from the protest paradigm literature (riot, confrontation, and legitimizing) and the presence of an accompanying visual would make people more likely to read, like, share and comment on a news story about a street demonstration on social media. We also tested if news portrayal of protests might influence people’s level of support for the movement, which in turn could lead to different types of social media engagement outcomes. Results show that only the presence of visuals has a direct impact on willingness to share a story, with frames having a limited influence on behaviour if compared to other pre-existing attitudes about the police and protesters. However, we also found that the relationship between frames and social media engagement is mediated by a change in these attitudes and increased support for the movement. These findings suggest that engagement outcomes with digital news coverage are contingent on people’s support for the movement portrayed, although legitimizing coverage can influence those attitudes and shape social media behaviour in return.",

    "abstract": "Analytics are now embedded in newsroom practice. In a form of participative gatekeeping, the ability to track how the audience absorbs information is shaping editorial content. Although there is much discussion that engagement metrics, like time spent, are more important than pageviews, many advertisers are still more interested in clicks than counting time, some newsrooms still have pageview targets, and the pageviews metric is often used as a simplistic measure of reach. As such, digital editors sit cemented to monitors, working to decipher what stories have or are gaining traction. Using this information, they choose placement of content, enhance stories, and share stories via social media to build traffic, then repeat this frenetic cycle in a seemingly endless loop. But at what cost? How does the focus on metrics affect best practice in the newsroom and, potentially, information sharing in the public sphere? This article examines the impact of audience data on practice at The Hamilton Spectator, a local newsroom in Canada, to explore whether traffic-based metrics and the use of analytics impede the ability to meet journalistic standards, and/or build bigger, more informed and engaged audiences.",

    "abstract": "Among the emergent data-centric practices of journalism, none appear to be as potentially disruptive as “automated journalism.” The term denotes algorithmic processes that convert data into narrative news texts with limited to no human intervention beyond the initial programming choices. The growing ability of machine-written news texts portends new possibilities for an expansive terrain of news content far exceeding the production capabilities of human journalists. A case study analysis of the pioneering automated journalism provider Narrative Science and journalists’ published reactions to its services reveals intense competition both to imagine an emergent journalism landscape in which most news content is automated and to define how this situation creates new challenges for journalists. What emerges is a technological drama over the potentials of this emerging news technology concerning issues of the future of journalistic labor, the rigid conformity of news compositional forms, and the normative foundation of journalistic authority. In these ways, this study contends with the emergent practice of automated news content creation both in how it alters the working practices of journalists and how it affects larger understandings of what journalism is and how it ought to operate.",

    "title": "Everyday News Use and Misinformation in Kenya",
    "abstract": "Abstract A growing body of work in journalism studies focuses on understanding audiences’ relationship with news and misinformation. This article adds to this area of inquiry by exploring Kenyans’ experiences with news and (mis)information in their everyday lives, how they use traditional and social media to meet their information needs, and how they navigate information ecosystems with a particular focus on news literacy strategies. This study broadens the scope of current audience research, which has primarily been conducted in the Global North, by using data collected in focus groups with Kenyan adults. Findings suggest that Kenyans consume news from a variety of sources, but trust in these sources vary with most finding “mainstream” news media most trustworthy. In addition, when faced with misinformation, participants’ decisions on whether to engage with the content was based on personal interest in the topic, perceived resonance within their social networks and perceived importance. Finally, participants discussed strategies consistent with news literacy behaviours, such as looking at multiple sources, checking the source of news, and verifying content to navigate complex media ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "This case study takes a brief look at commercial operations with automated news in the United States as well as five European countries to explore how the logic of journalism has been interpreted and translated into software and how industry experts anticipate the future. The empirical material consists of 31 qualitative research interviews with data journalists, news managers, computer scientists, academics and industry experts that inhabit and reproduce this new ecosystem of computation, journalism and statistics. Theoretically the study is inspired by a social constructionist perspective, arguing that social action is a central element in technological development: there are many forms of friction that creates barriers to increased automation. It would be naive to think that the development of learning algorithms will not lead to more advanced forms of automated news, however, journalists have shown a strong capacity for adaptation and mitigation of new technology. The paper turns the usual discussion about job losses on its head and asks “Why are there still so many jobs in journalism after decades of newsroom automation?” We argue that journalism as ideology, understanding how journalists give meaning to their work, probably will be a strong mitigating effect also in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study examined how Instagram users’ visual posts changed in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo incident, one of the most covered and online-trending news events of 2015. Through a quantitative content analysis of 1000 images posted in the four days following the shootings, the study found that Instagram users interrupted their routines when they began posting images about the incident rather than selfies or personal photos that typically make up Instagram’s fare. The images are studied in the framework of media events theory, a concept explained by Dayan and Katz. The study also found that most posts originated from outside France immediately after the incident, while French users posted more in the later days. Moreover, the visual analysis revealed that Instagram users shifted from a reactionary mode in the first two days to an informative and visual citizen journalist mode in the next two days as they posted newsworthy images of events pertaining to the Charlie Hebdo shootings.",

This article focuses on sensor journalism, which brings new practical and ethical concerns to journalism. By interviewing and working with data journalists and journalism scholars, we analyze the new technological and ethical challenges that sensors bring to journalism. The results contribute to the knowledge on how data journalists implicitly embed ethical values into their everyday work. Furthermore, they suggest that general ethical values are revisited and extended by the influence of sensors.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores and identifies the content which news publishers consider worthy of placing behind a paywall. It compares online news commodification in the leading Australasian financial newspapers—the Australian Financial Review (AFR) and the National Business Review (NBR). Based on a quantitative content analysis of 614 articles published on the AFR’s and NBR’s homepages, the paper finds that publishers consider hard news and opinion pieces as the most valuable news commodity. These were the most frequently paywalled content of the papers. Both papers allowed greater access to technology news to attract audiences and to enhance their digital subscriptions. Additionally, NBR offered free access to its routine market news, whereas AFR paywalled the same content. There were some major differences between the papers: AFR locked 86 per cent of its content compared to NBR’s 41 per cent. The findings of the paper suggest that ownership structures, corporate finances, and publication models need to be considered when examining newspaper paywalls.",

The author proposed a new analytical model to study six components of a business model namely the consumer, the niche, the delivery, the revenue, the funding model, and the profit sharing mode. Applying this model in eight selected cases in China, this article typologies five business models: (1) Platform-oriented News Aggregator; (2) Platform-oriented Service Provider; (3) Content-oriented News Site; (4) Content-oriented Trade Journal; and (5) Content-oriented We-media. The author argues that Chinese journalism start-ups have explored innovative business models in China’s particular political and social context. The state media policy, market and technology are three main driving forces for the business model.",

    "title": "How Alternative Are Alternative Media? Analyzing Speaker and Topic Diversity in Mainstream and Alternative Online Outlets",
    "abstract": "Alternative outlets can differ in their degree of partisanship, activism, and their opposition to a perceived news “ mainstream. ” We expect this could lead to diverging contributions to overall news diversity. We assess how mainstream-like, partisan and activist media differ from mainstream reporting concerning migration and refugee policy in Germany. We combine a manual analysis of speaker diversity in 12 mainstream and alternative outlets ( N ¼ 1,172 articles) with a computational topic model ( N ¼ 34,819 articles) covering 30 outlets to assess topic diversity. Interestingly, we find no significant differences between mainstream and alternative outlets regarding overall speaker diversity. But our data show differences in which parties get cited, and whether outlets focus on experts, civil society speakers, or migrants themselves. While mainstream media offer higher overall topic diversity, alternative media split along the lines of agenda accommodation and more independent agendas of partisan and activist media.",

    "title": "Alternative Media, Alternative Voices? A Quantitative Analysis of Actor Diversity in Alternative and Mainstream News Outlets",
    "abstract": "abstract Alternative news media are largely independent players in the news environment, which allows them to publish more alternative, and possibly more radical, news content. Do they utilise their independence to display actors that are underrepresented in the mainstream news? And does it affect the actor diversity in their news coverage and the journalistic environment as a whole? This study scrutinises the differences in actor diversity and actor presentation in articles published by alternative and mainstream news media to gauge if alternative media are more one-sided and if they contribute to the external actor diversity of the news environment. We analyse a sample of news articles on migration and social affairs published by two mainstream media and four alternative outlets. Despite limited differences in article-level actor diversity between alternative and mainstream news media, our findings highlight that right-wing and left-wing alternative media exploit their editorial independence differently to highlight other actor categories. Left-wing alternative news media present more civil society actors, while right-wing alternative news outlets pay more attention to right-wing politicians and parties. Thus, alternative news media are not that different in terms of internal actor diversity, but they modestly advance the external actor diversity in the news environment.",

    "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate how journalists at leading national US newspapers and wire services grapple with the impact of technological changes, especially the introduction and growing use of social media in newsrooms. Using a qualitative methodological approach involving in-depth, semi-structured interviews with journalists employed at leading national and regional news organizations such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, The Dallas Morning News, Bloomberg News, Reuters and the Associated Press, we explore how journalists view the impact of the growing use of social media, specifically Twitter, on their work environment. We find that while they acknowledged that Twitter facilitated aspects of their work, they almost universally perceived the growing use of this technology as contributing to a variety of tensions and potential conflicts within the newsroom.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Profound upheavals and the search for a viable business model have led the news industry to explore new sources of revenue. The mainstream Spanish media have set up special units to produce branded content, advertising that is integrated into editorial content. This article presents a multi-faceted approach to this practice in Spain, including interviews with branded content lab managers, a survey of journalists (N = 170), and content analysis of articles (N = 331) published by the six main legacy and digital native media companies in June and July of 2019. Results show inadequate disclosure, which makes it difficult for readers to distinguish between branded and editorial content. The journalists surveyed associate native advertising with the risk of losing credibility. This study reveals that the financial sector is the most active in supporting branded content productions, followed by energy and infrastructure, distribution and food industry, and phone companies. This research also unveils advertiser interest in connecting brand image to environment and sustainability values, together with a macro-issue encompassing well-being, sports, and health. This is consistent with the fact that the strongest role performance observed has been for service information, especially regarding tips for the economy, followed by those of the civic and infotainment categories.",

I discuss the current regulatory approach of treating social platforms as mere 'intermediaries' of the speech of others and propose a different perspective. Instead of perceiving platforms as intermediaries and facilitators of the speech of others, I view social media platforms as active political actors in their own right, and wielders of considerable opinion power. I will explain how taking the perspective of opinion power throws a very different, and rather alarming light on the recent regulatory initiatives.",

Yet as algorithms come to regulate more aspects of our lives, the contours of their power can remain difficult to grasp. This paper studies the notion of algorithmic accountability reporting as a mechanism for elucidating and articulating the power structures, biases, and influences that computational artifacts exercise in society. A framework for algorithmic power based on autonomous decision-making is proffered and motivates specific questions about algorithmic influence. Five cases of algorithmic accountability reporting involving the use of reverse engineering methods in journalism are then studied and analyzed to provide insight into the method and its application in a journalism context. The applicability of transparency policies for algorithms is discussed alongside challenges to implementing algorithmic accountability as a broadly viable investigative method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have seen an increasing amount of self-reflective discussion among media and communication scholars, about the hegemonic structures and inclusive participation within the field. In the scholarly community of journalism studies, similar reflections have emerged in recent years. Digital Journalism has also been actively pursuing a diverse and equitable scholarship in its journal. As part of the 10th anniversary issue of Digital Journalism, this article offers a systematic diagnosis of the diversity within published journalism scholarship between 2013 and 2021. In total, 3068 publications from a group of five journalism journals—Digital Journalism, Journalism, Journalism Studies, Journalism Practice, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly—were analysed. The operationalisation of ‘diversity’ focuses on both the authorship and content levels. Findings from this study suggest that (1) Digital Journalism published research papers mostly from and on the Global North, (2) the gender distribution of corresponding authors in the journal is slightly less balanced than the group average, (3) the methodological approaches employed in Digital Journalism are more asymmetric towards quantitative and computational approaches in comparison to the group average. Based on the empirical evidence, this article makes several recommendations to Digital Journalism, and to the field at large, to achieve better equity and inclusiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies have shown that uncivil comments under an online news article may result in biased perceptions of the news content, and explicit comment moderation has the potential to mitigate this adverse effect. Using an online experiment, the present study extends this line of research with the examination of how interface cues signalling different agents (human vs. machine) in moderating uncivil comments affect a reader’s judgment of the news and how prior belief in machine heuristic moderates such effects. The results indicated that perceptions of news bias were attenuated when uncivil comments were moderated by a machine (as opposed to a human) agent, which subsequently engendered greater perceived credibility of the news story. Additionally, such indirect effects were more prominent among readers who strongly believed that machine operations are generally accurate and reliable than those with a weaker prior belief in this rule of thumb.",

    "title": "Making Artificial Intelligence Work for Investigative Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Many have envisioned the use of AI methods to find hidden patterns of public interest in large volumes of data, greatly reducing the cost of investigative journalism. But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts “newsworthy” are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.",

    "abstract": "looking at a hot, contemporary, issue. WikiLeaks is in many ways an un-missable target, and all manner of research in journalism, politics, legal, and cultural studies have touched on its emergence, not to mention the biographies and insider accounts. This is not to say that because there has been a good deal written about WikiLeaks that more cannot be done, but rather a reality that any volume—including Beyond WikiLeaks— risks blending seamlessly into a collection of volumes without leaving its own mark. This leads to a tempting question: where does a volume such as Beyond WikiLeaks sit among those many? The answer is in the first word of its title, and perhaps not the second. This collection offers a concise and thorough account of where things stand and how WikiLeaks research has made sense of change thus far, but it tries to place these within broader discussions that can develop regardless of the WikiLeaks project’s future dynamics. In doing so, the work in Beyond WikiLeaks carries weight even as attention to WikiLeaks and Assange wanes. To this point, in June 2013 WikiLeaks’ was superseded as the key voice in debates of journalism, power, and society when Edward Snowden and his National Security Agency (NSA) leaks hit the front pages, a position they have yet to abandon. It seems the question of what lies Beyond WikiLeaks has been answered by Snowden and by this new set of leaks meted out across news sites and front pages, and a new set of debates about online freedom and journalistic roles. However, just because we seem to have an answer to the “beyond” question does not make this volume less valuable. Rather, its thorough and provocative scholarship establishes a basis upon which future dynamics of change can be discussed, including those raised by the NSA leaks. For its range of content and its valuable theorization and contextualization, Beyond WikiLeaks offers scholars who work in these areas a broader narrative and a way to avoid WikiLeaks being set aside as something of a moment. The strength of its academic reflection allows us to consider the implications of something like WikiLeaks as well as someone like Snowden across their political, social, cultural, and journalistic disruptions for what each offer in their moments, and for what they hint at “beyond”.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the ways in which global press freedom watchdogs have discursively constructed the issue of press freedom during the Covid-19 pandemic. Drawing on a multimodal discourse analysis, the study examines web stories and Tweets posted by the International Press Institute (IPI), the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), and Reporters sans Frontières (RSF), with the purpose of answering three primary questions: (1) Who or what do the CPJ, the IPI, and RSF represent as the greatest threat to press freedom in relation to Covid-19? (2) What are the differences between these groups’ representations of press freedom in their own regions of the world and their representations of press freedom in “Other” places? (3) What digital strategies do the IPI, CPJ, and RSF use in coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic? The article ultimately seeks to understand the ways in which each of these influential press freedom groups help to popularize particular understandings of press freedom in the 21st century.",

    "title": "Reporting Elections: Rethinking the Logic of Campaign Coverage",
    "abstract": "What kind of logic do news media follow when reporting elections? And how well do they inform citizens about their democratic choices? These are the two central questions addressed in Stephen Cushion’s and Richard Thomas’s Reporting Elections. And it’s easy to see why their latest work is an especially timely addition in the distinct and growing academic discipline of journalism studies: more than two years after the UK’s divisive ‘Brexit’ vote, political commentators continue to debate the democratic legitimacy of the vote in the first place, and what role the media played in reporting on the ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ campaigns. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump regularly labels media outlets critical of his leadership as “fake news”. At the same time, accusations that Cambridge Analytica, a London-based data-mining firm which has since gone into administration, may have meddled in both the U.S. presidential election as well as the ‘Brexit’ referendum, continue to persist. Such seismic shifts in international politics happen against the backdrop of an equally concerning development observed in the 2017 Reuters Institute Digital News Report: across a sample of 36 countries, less than half of the population (43%) trust the media. So, how can campaign coverage in particular address this, so that it genuinely serves the democratic needs of citizens? Focusing on recent elections in the US and the UK, the authors set out to rethink how election reporting can strengthen democracy – so that the news media continue to fulfil their core function: to submit power to scrutiny and hold politicians accountable for their actions.",

    "abstract": "News consumption has shifted increasingly to new platforms and gateways such as social network sites (SNS) with Facebook leading the way. Accordingly, journalists must cope with this “uneasy bedfellow” and provide news on Facebook to attract otherwise hard-to-reach audiences. This is even more relevant for public service broadcasters (PSBs), whose mission is to serve the interests and needs of every citizen. Bound to their public service mission, PSBs have to generally fulfill specific normative requirements such as diversity within their coverage, particularly to a higher degree than their commercial counterparts. Consequently, these requirements should be transferred to public service online supply in general and to public service supply on platforms such as Facebook. Whereas these demands have at best been roughly discussed, they have not been investigated to date. Therefore, we conducted a content analysis of the most viewed public service and commercial German TV newscasts and their respective Facebook sites, and analyzed whether public service news outperform commercial news on Facebook and whether they perform as good as on TV in terms of diversity (diversity of issues and of people and groups). Results show that public service news on Facebook show an even higher performance (albeit slightly) than on television.",

    "title": "Reading Patterns in Print and Online Newspapers",
    "abstract": "This article analyses whether reading patterns differ between readers of a printed newspaper and readers of an online newspaper. Such a question is hardly new but has increased in importance as more readers switch from printed to digital news media. The analysis compares data collected from a readership study focused on the printed local Swedish newspaper VLT (Vestmanland Läns Tidning) and data collected by automatic registration of the number of unique page views on the news site vlt.se. Both data collections were made during the same two-week period in September 2013. The results show some obvious differences as online readers focus on the first page of the online edition, while print readers focus on the editorial sections inside the newspaper. Print readers also display a more diverse reading repertoire, while online readers concentrate on a limited number of subjects. However, when the time factor is taken into consideration—the amount of time spent on each article—the reading patterns of print readers and online readers become closer to each other. The article discusses the importance of focusing not only on “clicks” but also on the time factor when selecting what kind of news to publish online.",

    "abstract": "This paper revisits the longstanding debate about journalism, academic scholarship, and their connections with the powerful forces of surveillance that shape the lives of contemporary democracies. Drawing critically on the practical findings of Edward Snowden and others, we offer an analysis of the “Five Eyes” intelligence collection and sharing arrangements between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and the responses it has elicited from journalists and academic researchers. We show how and why journalists and academics have been deterred from researching and reporting on the significance of Five Eyes activities to the public. The paper provides a new account of the Five Eyes project, helped along by the findings of journalists, including the NSA data-gathering schemes exposed by Edward Snowden. Then we examine the uneven outputs of journalists and academics. Finally, we will show why Edward Snowden’s revelations must be seen as just one contribution to our understanding of a much longer historical trend; and we show why the work of other, less well-known journalists is vital for explaining and understanding a surveillance programme that arguably has profound threatening implications for the future of journalism, university scholarship, and the ideals and institutions of democratic citizenship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This mixed-methods study introduces the concept of journalistic visibility and examines its implications. Drawing on diverse approaches for understanding the challenges of visibility labor and personal branding, and applying them to assessing the impact of routinized practices that can make journalists “local celebrities” in their communities, we explore how visibility may be connected to growing levels of abuse from hostile publics. Using data from 32 in-depth interviews and a survey of US journalists (N = 509), we find that the more time a journalist spends on social media platforms, regardless of the number of followers they have, the more likely they are to experience harassment. Furthermore, the more visible that journalists are—online and offline—the more harassment they experience. This is particularly challenging for women, who not only share more personal information on social media but also experience more harassment. Additionally, we find initial evidence that the frequency of abuse appears to be higher for journalists of color, those who wear religious garb, or those who may be transgender or gender non-binary—altogether pointing to a research agenda for the future study of journalists and safety, particularly in light of the intersectional nature of harassment.",

    "title": "What is Holding Us Back? We Should Be Looking Ahead! Considerations about Open Science Practices in Journalism Studies",
    "abstract": "Only very few debates within our discipline are as relevant and at the same time challenging as the one covered in this special issue. Indeed, at the time of writing this commentary, many researchers within (digital) journalism studies remain reluctant to the implementation of open science practices which are geared at increasing transparency in the research process, such as (1) sharing data and the research process publicly (research data, materials, protocols, power and statistical analyses etc.), (2) replicating work of others, (3) pre-registration prior to data collection (including registered reports), and (4) open access publication (Bakker et al. 2021). While many scholars have slowly started to warm up to these practices, which is in line with findings from a recent overview by Bakker et al. (2021), showing that there is a general belief among communication scholars that open research practices are important for research quality, there is still a long way to go. So, what is holding us back? Looking at the larger communication research field, there are ethical and privacy concerns when it comes to open science, as well as more practical hurdles. Markowitz, Song, and Taylor (2021) showed that 5.1% of the papers published between 2010 and 2020 across 26 communication science journals used or mentioned open science practices. Bakker et al. (2021) noted that while many scholars participating in their survey, for example, reported having shared data at least once (64%), the modal response to the question of how frequently this is done is ‘occasionally’. While research quality may be enhanced, researchers experience various constraints in getting involved in open science, ranging from unfamiliarity with practices, and procedures that are experienced as tedious to rightful concerns about data protection and privacy. Overall, however, the move to open science practices is undeniable: normatively but also empirically. Recently, for example, steps were taken by various journals to increase transparency (publishing data, dedicated spaces in journals for replication, and preregistration). The question remains which specific considerations need to be taken for research within journalism, and more specifically digital journalism research. We want to argue that there are (at least) three important points to be considered.",

Second, participants’ expectations of quality were rarely met. Third, when participants saw only one article, differences in the perception of automated and human-written articles were small. However, when presented with two articles at once, participants preferred human-written news for readability but automated news for credibility. These results contest previous claims according to which expectation adjustment explains differences in perceptions of human-written and automated news.",

While computer scientists and literary scholars have explored the impact of hypertext on narratives, on comprehension and on the role of readers, little of this knowledge has filtered into journalism scholarship. Given recent efforts by publishers to monetise hyperlinks, it is worth examining how a better understanding of hypertext might generate new ideas about journalism practice. This review draws on literature from computer science and journalism to consider how hypertext might be used as a narrative tool, and specifically examines notions of audience, comprehension, narrative design, and visualisation of space, with a view to progressing the research agenda around such themes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the growing journalistic practice of embedding full tweets in online political news coverage. Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to news coverage as a whole. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets will be selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice to a moderate extent. In the majority of news articles, the function of tweets is to illustrate an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and – with some dependencies – the number of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper shows how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.",

    "abstract": "Since its debut in 2006, Twitter has established itself as a unique platform for news sharing with features, such as “@mentions” and “retweets,” popular among journalists and non-journalists alike. This study examined how journalists share news messages on Twitter. Specifically, the authors investigated whether there is any difference in linking and attribution behavior between journalists for online and prestige traditional news organizations. A content analysis was conducted of a sample of 1175 tweets from 40 journalists from eight news organizations (four prestige traditional and four online) posted during the US government shutdown from October 1 to 16, 2013. This study supports previous research that journalists are more likely to promote content from their own news sites than from other sources. The study also extends agenda-setting theory to journalists’ use of Twitter. When they were not linking to their own news organizations’ work, journalists in the sample were more likely to link to content on traditional news sites than on online news sites. Also, journalists were more likely to interact through retweets and @mentions with other journalists than with public officials or other citizens.",

    "abstract": "report is a result of the decision to interview only newspaper staff. Newspaper journalists, from my experience, were never going to say anything else. Broadcast staff—presenters as well as reporters and producers—have been forced to talk with audience members for decades, and two-way conversation has been built in to online publishing for at least 10 years. This two-way conversation has become “many-ways” in the online phenomenon of “sharing”, when audience members on-publish news items using email, Facebook, Twitter, re-blogging and SMS messages, often with a comment attached. The chiefs at the Australian ninemsn network (the online incarnation of one of Australia’s free-to-air commercial television stations) have started their own blog called “Share Wars”, and lead with the statement: “We believe sharing will drive a new era of journalism.” My other review in this issue discusses sharing in more detail (Cokley 2012). This is a useful report as far as it goes, in capturing what a segment of a community of once-influential Australian journalists thinks about the state of the profession. But as a picture of the future of journalism in the twenty-first century, the methodological choices taken have undermined the stated research aims.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The term ‘hyperlocal’ has become part of internet-era local news media vocabulary. In the UK, it symbolizes a twenty-first century style of community news provision which exists on the margins of the local media ecosystem. Mainstream media has lost traction in the ultra-local space, which has been increasingly populated by independent operators. This article proposes that independent hyperlocal publishing has borrowed elements from the mainstream, particularly the socially cohesive aspects. Applying subcultural theory to the working practices of 27 UK hyperlocal operators revealed that they were adopting a ‘make-do-and-mend’ bricolage culture (Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1966. The Savage Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press) which both retrieved and repurposed aspects of the mainstream (Hebdige, Dick. 2014. “After Shock: From Punk to Pornetration to “Let’s Be Facebook Frendz!!.” In Subcultures, Popular Music and Social Change. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing). Working practices and business practices once prevalent in the parent culture were at the heart of hyperlocal activities. When viewed as a news subculture, hyperlocal operators were found to be resistant to the mainstream parent culture, yet they retrieved and repurposed elements of it in their daily activities.",

    "title": "Innovation(s) in Photojournalism",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the place of amateur imagery and citizen photojournalism in Time magazine’s photoblog, Lightbox. If user-generated content has been seen as a threat by professional photojournalists in the last decade, Lightbox offers a paradigmatic example to understand if the visual elite still has a dominant status in the decision-making processes of news production. This paper, therefore, explores how citizen imagery is shaping and challenging a photojournalistic culture still influenced by criteria of excellence, legitimacy, and authority. Managed by professional photo editors, Lightbox has included a variety of sections which emphasize new, original work by professional photographers as well as weekly news reviews that sometimes incorporate amateur photography. Through a visual analysis of amateur imagery in Lightbox’s sections and a textual examination of the editors’ discussions on citizen photojournalism, this paper analyzes how the photoblog is adapting to the shift towards a digital age of innovation and hybridity. The results show that photo editors apply strategies to delimit citizen productions by very rarely selecting them and avoiding specific mention of the amateur nature of such images. Moreover, they underline that hybridity is understood not as multimodal content and co-creative processes between professional and amateur incorporations, but rather as professional and creative practices, for example by highlighting innovative photographers who use cell phone imagery and photo-sharing websites. While this paper interrogates the new careers in photography of amateurs turned professionals, it also shows how digital platforms emphasize the photographers’ personal initiatives over usual gatekeeping processes.",

    "title": "The use of information and communication technologies in three Egyptian newsrooms",
    "abstract": "The basis of the information revolution in Egypt centres on the use and appropriation of technological advancements. At its forefront is the growth of information and communication technologies (ICTs), which offer an active and interactive platform for socio-political development, including the circumstances leading to the “25 January 2011 revolution”, predominantly labelled as the “Facebook” or Twitter revolution’. After this “digital” revolution many Egyptians continued using cyberspace. They clustered in networks, created parallel communication systems, each with its own identity, and interacted on issues of common concern. Witnessing a changing environment, the Egyptian journalism industry has had no choice but to overcome its fear of adopting technologies in order to fit into the new mould. Several newsrooms have adopted ICTs in the hope that the new media would help them to develop their content and reconnect with their audiences. Although on the surface this implies development, this claim requires further assessment. This study therefore aims to investigate the implementation and appropriation of ICTs, especially internet technologies, in three Egyptian newsrooms: Al Ahram, Al Dostor, and Al Masry Al Youm. The study further examines the extent to which newsrooms are incorporating ICTs into their daily routine as well as how the technologies are shaping and redefining practices.",

    "title": "A Digital Baron for a Digital Age: Chris Hughes and Neoliberalism’s Ascendancy in Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines news media coverage surrounding Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes’s purchase of the magazine The New Republic in March 2012 in order to reveal the ways in which media narratives situated him as a new kind of media owner for a new kind of media age. This textual analysis is embedded within the framework of metajournalistic discourse, aiming to interrogate the extent to which characterizations of Hughes are aligned with emerging digital practices and neoliberal ideals. This article pays particular attention to coverage in the immediate aftermath of his purchase as well as to the new owner’s letter to readers and subscribers, ultimately arguing that Hughes is constructed as a self-enterprising and digitally savvy media owner, uniquely situated to preserve journalism by bringing tech industry philosophies and practices into the field. An abiding conflict between market logics and journalistic norms underscores the broader danger in knitting together neoliberal ideals of entrepreneurialism and startup culture with notions of how journalists can and should respond to financial and cultural threats of digital innovation to their industry.",

    "title": "Cascading Activation Revisited: How Audiences Contribute to News Agendas Using Social Media",
    "abstract": "Abstract Social media have become conduits through which audiences can challenge elites in media and politics. Recent updates to cascading activation, originally developed to explain how frames flowing from powerful figures gain public dominance, give greater theoretical scope for audiences to exert influence. Yet empirical understanding of how and in what circumstances this happens with respect to agenda-setting—another core media effect—is not well-developed, especially given the affordances of digital technologies. We address this gap by connecting theorization on cascades to developments in intermedia agenda-setting. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics surrounding the perceived reluctance by ARD-aktuell, the newsroom of Germany’s public broadcasting consortium, to use its prime-time broadcast “Tagesschau” to report the arrest of a refugee accused of murdering a German woman in December 2016. By presenting finely grained timelines linking content analysis of 5,409 Facebook comments with Tagesschau editorial responses and parallel media coverage of this event, we contribute further conditions under which audience-informed cascades may occur: notably, when publicly funded news organizations are involved, and the issue at stake invokes both domestic and international aspects which sustain disagreement.",

    "title": "Pursuing the Ideal",
    "abstract": "Many news organizations provide online readers with an opportunity to comment on public issues in the news through a news-mediated forum for discourse. These spaces are provided by news organizations as part of a mission to provide a public space for discourse, but are governed by a commenting policy that establishes the rules for discourse and behavior. These rules can help to meet the ideals of public discourse or stand in the way of productive public deliberation. This study examines the commenting policies of 21 news corporations in the United States to see how the policies facilitate or inhibit the creation of a space for ideal public discourse. A constant comparative analysis of the policies guided by the ideals of Habermas’ public sphere, as well as the expectations of civility norms, shows that news organizations establish rules to protect respectful and egalitarian spaces for the public, but fail to meet other critical needs of public discourse, including rationality, tolerance, reflexivity, and the pursuit of common understanding and solutions. The implications of these findings are further explored and possible objectives for news organizations are provided.",

    "title": "Playing the Mainstream Game. A Language-Game Analysis of “Mainstream” as a Possible Boundary Object in Journalism Studies",
    "abstract": "Abstract “Mainstream media” and “mainstream journalism” have become significant concepts in political, popular, and academic discourse in recent years. They are key in how media, communication, and journalism scholars have been, and continue to be, concerned with relational dimensions in their work. However, the meaning of the word “mainstream” is often taken for granted. How and by whom this concept is used among media, communication, and journalism scholars is therefore of great importance. This article analyses uses of “mainstream” in academic discourse to unpack the various meanings ascribed to it. Through computational Topic Modelling Analysis and qualitative context analysis we analyse the relations, positions, normative underpinnings, and appropriate uses of “mainstream” in 779 journal articles published between 2000 and 2022. The analysis is framed by Wittgenstein’s notion of “language-game” as a way of analysing the meaning-making process constituted by uses of “mainstream” in these articles. We argue that “mainstream” resembles a “boundary object” but conclude that the rules of the “mainstream language-game” are confusing and need revisions, and that the concept only functions as an illusory boundary object, which is arguably problematic.",

The aim is to discuss how journalists perceive the loss of control when technologies and users interact with the debate agenda online. Actor-network theory is used to explore the interaction amongst editorial staff, new technologies, professional norms and the participation of audiences. The findings reveal that digital technology becomes a powerful actor in the network of public media, as it directly affects the forms of journalistic presentation and public debates. In addition, new technologies contribute to the empowerment of audiences, who gain better access to both the newsroom and the wider public.",

    "title": "Audience Engagement in a Post-Truth Age",
    "abstract": "In any discussion about a “post-truth age,” the audience is both part of the problem and part of the solution. The authority of journalism is called into question if everyone can participate in generating and spreading verified and unverified, relevant and irrelevant “news.” At the same time, journalism can integrate the audience into the editorial process and dialogue in an unprecedented variety of ways, thereby disclosing the way journalism works and raising awareness for the difference between journalism and any form of mis- and disinformation. Thus “Audience Engagement” is becoming a key factor for journalism in a post-truth era. This article analyses dimensions of audience engagement in a holistic sense. Key findings were gathered through interviews with practitioners within the innovative training format “Learning Lab Audience Engagement.” Factors for a successful audience engagement comprise a paradigm shift away from a “lecturing” towards a “dialogue” approach. This approach changes not only journalism, media and newsroom cultures: Educational institutions have to change their attitude accordingly. The experience of the participants suggests that a broad understanding of media and training organisations alike as “engaging organisations” brings with it several challenges and limitations but can help to raise trust.",

    "abstract": "Technology is typically seen as an instrument that aids journalistic processes. Digital artifacts, however, are seldom considered as active participants. Tautologically, journalism is defined as a practice of journalists. But journalism would not be the same without the role played by technological artifacts. To assess such a problem, this article discusses the ontological contributions from actor-network theory and how they may help to disclose the complex associations between a multiplicity of actors involved in journalism. Besides asking “who” does journalism, we argue that it is also necessary to assess “what” does journalism. We then show how technological actants transform journalistic practices in two recent processes: newsroom convergence and the creation of news by algorithms. Finally, we argue that this new ontology demands epistemological and methodological transformations in journalism studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While there is an upsurge of research examining hostility toward the press from those external to the newsroom, there continues to be a lack of critical and robust theoretical foundation and agenda for such inquiry in countries considered to have a democratically free press. Therefore, the objective of this article is to synthesize literature in the study of abuse and harassment of journalists, set forth clear definitions of terms, situate that literature within a larger theoretical context, and ultimately establish future lines of inquiry for research examining harassment of journalists. The primary argument of this article in theorizing hostility toward the press is examining the identity of a journalist as a place of oppression that intersects with other identities of oppression resulting in unique context-based experiences. The principal objective is to unify work in this growing field to help not only answer important questions about a topic gaining increasing attention, but to also do so with a critical foundation in how hostility toward the press is theorized.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of blogging and citizen journalism has created challenges in defining the once-simple terms of “journalist” and “news media”. Internationally, courts, legislators and policy makers are developing new definitions that incorporate a broader understanding of journalism practice, as territories blur and shift across digital spaces. However, a lack of consensus has resulted in jurisdictional clashes, challenges to legislative amendments, appeals to higher courts, and confusion for regulators and practitioners alike. In Australia, recently legislated shield laws have resulted in different definitions across the country’s various jurisdictions. In the United States, court cases relating to defamation and shield laws have been successfully appealed based on differing definitions of the role of a journalist. In New Zealand, a High Court judgement overturned a lower court decision, to find that a blogger could be viewed as a journalist. At the same time, courts internationally are developing policies and guidelines relating to live text-based communication from courts, which also requires them to determine who is permitted to text, tweet or blog from within courtroom. This paper examines how these courts, legislators and policy makers are grappling with the challenges of redefining “journalist” and “news media” while ultimately focusing on the objective of ensuring a free and democratic flow of information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, much has been made of the crisis in local news. Communities across the United States are rapidly losing local news coverage. In response, policymakers and community advocates have sought to craft new mechanisms to support the health of local news ecosystems. This work interrogates the core ways in which community members understand and define the communities within which they live and examines the socioeconomic and media variables that impact how local communities are defined by the people living in those communities. Data are drawn from a national survey in the United States that was designed and implemented to better understand different framings of local communities in the context of media. Findings demonstrate the critical role that media, and the provision of media serving critical information needs, has in the mutual shaping of how community members define and perceive the boundaries of what is local. Subjective definitions are far more prominent and are shaped more directly by media consumption and the context of place. Firm boundaries are hard to establish, but this work points to key levers such as local newspapers, local television, and community size that directly impact how community members perceive their local community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Today’s Black Lives Matter movement is mediated largely by fortuitous smartphone witnesses and dedicated mobile journalists, who post precious footage to social media platforms that are designed to disappear their content. This has potential long-term consequences for the world’s collective memory of this summer’s global uprising, in the wake of George Floyd’s extrajudicial killing—and beyond. For these reasons, I argue in this article that the next frontier in mobile journalism research will involve finding new ways to archive the millions of protest videos that are uploaded to ephemeral social media sites every day. To achieve this ethically, digital journalism scholars can consider the three “P’s” of protest journalism preservation: precariousness, privacy and platforms.",

    "title": "Modelling Contemporary Gatekeeping",
    "abstract": "Gatekeeping theory struggles to describe the rise of algorithms and users as information selectors in digital spaces. Algorithms and users may co-exist as decision-makers and reach high visibility through decentralised gatekeeping mechanisms. Classic gatekeeping theory is no longer adequate in describing contemporary news selection processes online and recent gatekeeping approaches at theory-building are isolated and have not been synthesised in a coherent gatekeeping theory. This theoretical paper addresses this issue and develops a digital gatekeeping model in three steps. First, four gatekeeper archetypes are identified that differ in access, selection criteria and publication choices. Second, gatekeeping frequently involves platforms on which gatekeepers operate. These platforms either apply gatekeeping mechanisms controlled by a central authority or rely on collaborations between many micro-level interactions to publish news. Third, a digital gatekeeping model is derived to model the four gatekeeper archetypes and their selection processes in relation to platforms employing collaborative gatekeeping mechanisms. This proposed digital gatekeeping model extends previous research on gatekeeping by synthesising classic gatekeeping theory with contemporary approaches and by providing a framework for future research on information control and dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study critically reviews scholarly debates on state aid for independent, professional news journalism in the public interest, its funding models and principles, the market failure paradigm, and policy efficacy. State aid is handed out by government agencies which believe that their support can help independent, professional journalism thrive in the digital, mobile, and platform-dominated future. Government support mainly comes as direct financial grants or indirect tax offsets. It aims at engendering economic opportunity and prosperity, while safeguarding journalistic independence and quality of output. Ideally, this shall foster the production, distribution and consumption of original and high-quality news in the public interest, which, in turn, shall keep people informed, facilitate public debate, and hold power to account. Still, this study finds arguments that government funding models for independent journalism in the public interest are limited by several critical challenges that endanger their principles, do not avert failure in the news media market and prevent effective policy governance. These deficits may even be exacerbated in the digital era.",

    "abstract": "Abstract What explains news sharing in polarized social media environments? Will polarization of the audiences further polarize news organizations? In this article, we connect existing theories of news sharing and gatekeeping to describe the conditions under which social media polarization will increase polarization among news organizations. Our results show that a polarized readership will further polarize news organizations. However, polarization will be larger for organizations with lower reputations. To test our theory, we introduce readers to a statistical design that estimates news sharing behaviour from observational social media data. The model allows researchers to study the relationship between news sharing behaviour and gatekeeping in political communication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the features of day-to-day data journalism produced by The New York Times and The Washington Post in the first half of 2017. The content analysis evaluates story characteristics linked to the concepts of transparency, interactivity, diversity, and information provenance. It finds that the data journalism produced by those outlets comes from small teams, focuses on “hard news,” provides fairly uncomplex data visualizations with low levels of interactivity, relies primarily on institutional sources and offers little original data collection, and incorporates just two data sources on average in a generally opaque manner. This leads to the conclusion that “general data journalism” still has a long way to go before it can live up to the optimism and idealization that characterizes much of the data turn in journalism. Instead, contemporary day-to-day data journalism is perhaps better characterized as evolutionary rather than revolutionary, with its celebrated potential to serve as a leap forward for journalism and engender greater trust in it remaining untapped.",

    "abstract": "This study, based on a representative online survey of 1080 US journalists conducted in 2013, analyses the demographic and organizational predictors of how journalists use social media and how they evaluate the impact of these media on their professional norms and values. The findings indicate that 9 of 10 US journalists regularly use social media in their work—but mainly to check on what other news organizations are doing and to look for breaking news events. The most frequent users of social media are younger journalists with higher incomes who work for television, radio, or online news organizations. The findings also indicate that journalists who hold more positive attitudes toward the use of social media in journalism, and those who think that social media are more important in their jobs, tend to be more supportive of the populist-mobilizer and the disseminator roles of journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social media has been increasingly used to gather and share news stories from mainstream news sites. This article aims to extend the analysis to the public interactions between citizens and media on Twitter after the airplane accident of Germanwings’ flight 9525, in which citizens’ eyewitnessing role was minimized. Thematic and interpretative analysis have been carried out of 70,000 messages posted on Twitter with the hashtag #germanwings during the three days after the crash. Results point towards a hegemonic position of accounts connected to news media (mainstream, but also local and specialized outlets) in what regards public interactions in Twitter. However, findings also suggest that this central position coexists with an important role of the “common” citizen in shaping both the agenda of issues that are going to be covered but also the particular narratives and discourses associated to these issues. Furthermore, results also reflect how Twitter users were active in auditing the work of news media, criticising some of the approaches of their coverage that they considered to be negligent, unprofessional or unethical, performing as watchdogs of professional journalists and news media.",

    "title": "Citizen Participation in News",
    "abstract": "The process of producing news has changed significantly due to the advent of the Web, which has enabled the increasing involvement of citizens in news production. This trend has been given many names, including participatory journalism, produsage, and crowd-sourced journalism, but these terms are ambiguous and have been applied inconsistently, making comparison of news systems difficult. In particular, it is problematic to distinguish the levels of citizen involvement, and therefore the extent to which news production has genuinely been opened up. In this paper we perform an analysis of 32 online news systems, comparing them in terms of how much power they give to citizens at each stage of the news production process. Our analysis reveals a diverse landscape of news systems and shows that they defy simplistic categorisation, but it also provides the means to compare different approaches in a systematic and meaningful way. We combine this with four case studies of individual stories to explore the ways that news stories can move and evolve across this landscape. Our conclusions are that online news systems are complex and interdependent, and that most do not involve citizens to the extent that the terms used to describe them imply.",

    "title": "Toward A New Visual Culture Of The News",
    "abstract": "This paper argues that the rise of new digital technologies and new amateur/citizen practices of photographic production have constituted a “short-circuit” that has critically destabilized but also productively challenged professional photojournalism. In this context, the paper focuses on the practice of digital post-production (i.e. digitally “retouching” and “enhancing” photographs), as an empirical prism through which to theoretically discuss wider technological, professional, and cultural shifts that have been affecting news photography over the last decade. In particular, drawing on in-depth interviews with international photojournalists, jury members of press photo contests, and directors of digital post-production labs, the paper analyzes a few paradigmatic case studies of post-produced news photographs that have recently won prestigious professional awards, yet have generated considerable controversies. Through the analysis of the case studies, the paper aims to shed light on the contested construction of aesthetic conventions and professional-ethical standards within digital photojournalism, in relation to (1) the shifting professional ideal of visual news “objectivity,” and (2) the shifting symbolic boundaries between professional and non-professional news photo producers. Finally, introducing the notion of “digital cultural capital,” the paper suggests the theoretical relevance of a (post-)Bourdieusian approach to photojournalism, which frames the conflictual implementation of new digital technologies and the diffusion of new social and material practices as a symbolic struggle for professional distinction within the wider visual culture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The messengerization of society and the rise of meso-communication spaces have created new opportunity structures for spreading misinformation. Countermeasures in this context must meet other privacy standards than, for instance, journalist fact-checking or community management on more public social media spaces. In this article, we are specifically interested in audience perspectives on fact-check delivering bots to counter misinformation thriving in meso spaces on instant messengers. Despite initial journalistic projects, there is scarce knowledge of audience perspectives on such fact bots in private and meso-spaces. The current study sought to fill this gap and describe the themes and beliefs characterizing instant messenger users’ considerations of fact bots. To this end, we conducted explorative qualitative interviews (N = 18) with a heterogeneous group of German instant messenger users. We identified four central themes in interviewees’ considerations of employing fact bots: questionable advantages in terms of ease, perceived usefulness for educating others, perceived injunctive norms between safety and privacy, and distrust towards information curators. We describe these themes using the technology acceptance model as an organizing framework. Overall, our study provides meaningful starting points for further research and practitioners fighting misinformation in the messengerized society with its increased digital meso spaces.",

    "title": "Meso News-Spaces and Beyond: News-Related Communication Occurring Between the Public and Private Domains",
    "abstract": "Abstract The concept of meso news-spaces refers to online spaces located between the private and public realms, where everyday users, more professional media actors, or both, can produce and share news-related content among each other, yet not to a wide audience. Such spaces are afforded by digital media platforms, including, but not limited to, Facebook groups, X spaces, and group chats on WeChat, WhatsApp, or Telegram. This special issue is devoted to further understanding news-related communication that occurs neither in fully public nor fully private realms, but between or across the two. In the introduction to the special issue, we demonstrate the significance of meso news-spaces by considering the example of the use of WhatsApp groups in the mobilization of the pro-democracy movement in Israel in 2023. We then consider the challenges that meso news-spaces pose for researchers, in terms of conceptualization, research ethics, and context. We conclude with a review of the articles of the special issue, and with directions for future research around this phenomenon, that is proving to be a significant one in the digital news environment.",

    "title": "A Matter of Organisational Silence: Media Managers Struggling to Make Sense of the Online Harassment of Journalists as a Collective Issue in Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract The online harassment of journalists is a phenomenon which has been on the rise in Europe over the last decade and it affects journalists' working lives. As an expression of mob censorship, online harassment raises questions about how media organisations react to online aggressions targeting their journalists, the consequences on the victims’ well-being and on the role of journalism in society. Yet, previous research has shown the lack of support mechanisms provided by journalists’ employers. In this article, we explore the hypothesis that the lack of organisational support towards targeted journalists is partly due to the challenges faced by media managers when trying to make sense of the phenomenon. This article offers a unique viewpoint on how 22 Belgian media managers from five media organisations struggle to define what online harassment is and how to respond to it. In turn, it shows that the vague understanding of what online harassment is seems to favour case-by-case organisational responses. Missing words and unstructured actions related to online harassment impede media managers from addressing online harassment as a collective issue in journalism and its consequences on the democratic debate.",

    "abstract": "Media gatekeeping has been a critical theoretical tenet in the formation of iconic images. Traditionally, news photographs became iconic, in large part, through their prominent placement on elite newspaper front pages. But as we move away rapidly from print news towards a digital news environment, what is the effect on this traditional tenet of iconicity? Additionally, with the rise of social media, elite media outlets are no longer the sole gatekeepers. Within the age of digital news and social media, this research seeks to understand differences between identification of iconic imagery, comparing a prompt of commonly used elite media images to an unprompted response in an effort to ascertain which images are, in fact, considered most iconic by audiences. The research also considers events across time, from historic events to more recent events that have fallen within the timeframe of the rise of digital news and social media. Findings indicate that the democratization of the news via social media has had the unanticipated effect of rescinding the uniformity of collective visual consciousness and the traditional formation of iconic imagery. Indeed, elite media outlets are no longer the sole dictators of “crowning images.”",

    "abstract": "This article investigates how competition among news outlets and editorial strategies of news outlets affect both their decisions to publish a live blog in the event of a terrorist attack and whether to implement 10 quality dimensions in the live blogs. We draw on theories related to herd behavior and strategy formation. We use quantitative content analysis data covering 22 terrorist attacks in Western Europe and 29 corresponding live blogs during a time period of 14 years. We investigate live blogs of three major Swiss news websites: nzz.ch, tagesanzeiger.ch and blick.ch. We control for professionalization, a key event and newsroom convergence, as well as the news factors damage, impact and centrality. Linear and logistic regressions are applied. The results show that competition plays a significant role in decisions regarding whether or not to publish a live blog. Moreover, competition speeds up the provision of information and expands its scope. The editorial strategies, in turn, generate different approaches as to how this information is conveyed to news consumers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study compares the role performance of native advertising on the websites of legacy news media and digital-only news media in the United States. Instead of analyzing discourses and rhetorics about native advertising, this study concentrates on the content characteristics of native advertising to infer its roles oriented to audiences. The study finds that native ads on the selected media sites have more emphasis on the service role than the civic and infortainment roles. The digital-only media sites have native ads with more emphasis on the service and infortainment roles than those in the legacy media sites, whereas the legacy media sites have native ads with more emphasis on the civic role than its counterparts in the digital-only media sites. However, native advertising lacks independent and transparent sources of information. Nearly half of the native ads on the legacy media sites reply on sponsor-affiliated sources, and more than half of the native ads on the digital-only media sites lack attributions for sources of information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract User comments to digital news often contain media criticism, detrimentally affecting how others perceive the quality of news and possibly lowering media trust. It remains an open question, however, how journalistic reactions can mitigate these effects. Based on premises of engagement moderation, accountability, and transparency in digital journalism, we conducted an online experiment investigating how critical user comments and journalistic reactions affect quality perceptions and behavioral intentions towards a news media brand. Results show that media-critical comments lower perceived brand quality, but only among media cynics, whereby increasing it among media supporters. Journalists admitting mistakes only enhances perceived brand quality for media cynics, while denying does so for everyone and decreases cynics’ intention to comment negatively. Lastly, explaining why a mistake was made or not boosts brand quality perceptions overall, suggesting that transparency is a viable strategy for improving media trust in the long run.",

    "title": "What a Special Issue on Latin America Teaches Us about Some Key Limitations in the Field of Digital Journalism",
    "abstract": "This special issue showcases research on digital journalism in Latin America. As such, it serves an important mission of contextualization of knowledge in a nascent field of inquiry dominated by Global North papers, perspectives, scholars, and institutional arrangements. Yet, its very existence foregrounds the depth of the inequities between North and South that still mark the production of knowledge about digital journalism— and in journalism studies more generally. These inequities affect disproportionally the regions of the world most disadvantaged in terms of institutional resources, but by implication impoverish the field of inquiry as a whole: since all knowledge is contextual and comparative in essence, knowing less about the other implies also knowing less about the self. Thus, we take advantage of the opportunity to write this introduction to reflect on what the conditions of possibility of putting together this special issue say about dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in scholarship on digital journalism—and in communication and media studies more broadly. More concretely, we identify four problems that characterize these dynamics: lack of representativeness, lack of reflexivity, lack of decentering, and lack of cosmopolitanism. On the basis of this diagnosis about the current state of affairs, we also offer some steps towards a more scholarly robust and politically equitable domain of inquiry. We conclude this introduction by providing an overview of the papers that are featured in this special issue. First is the problem of lack of representativeness. The countries that constitute the Global North amount in the aggregate to approximately 14% of the global population, but much more than 14% of the published scholarship, the reviewer pool, and the positions of power in the journalism studies field. In statistical terms, the Global North is pretty much an outlier. Yet, this status is never mentioned. On the contrary, the findings are typically assumed to be universal and are rarely contextualized with regards to the statistical norm. When was the last time that you read a paper on, say, the United States, Norway or Germany where the authors contextualized the findings with respect to comparable phenomena in, say, Thailand, Paraguay, and Ghana?

    "title": "The Hierarchy of Influences on Professional Role Perceptions Among Chinese Online Journalists",
    "abstract": "This research seeks to understand the journalistic profession in contemporary China, given the growth of online journalism, the transformation of the media system, and the emergence of transnational journalism culture. Based on a nationwide sample of 1751 full-time online journalists from 205 online news organizations in 31 provincial level units and other aggregate-level data from secondary sources, the study applies Shoemaker and Reese’s Hierarchical Model to examine the factors that drive the formation of professional role perceptions among Chinese online journalists. The final results of hierarchical linear models provide evidence for the significant influences of individual level, routine level, and organizational level factors. However, social institutional-level and social system-level factors are not significant predictors of professional role perceptions.",

Through in-depth interviews with Web editors, reporters, and bloggers within and outside professional newsrooms, it explores the institutional and cultural forces at work in determining whom blogs and news sites link to, and in what contexts. Drawing on the framework of institutionalism, this study aims to supplement research on journalistic normalization and hyperlink patterns by providing a fuller understanding of the processes by which professional journalism and the political blogosphere mutually adapt toward new norms. It finds a significant role for blogging’s cultural values in establishing the importance of linking within professional newsrooms, but also a heavy influence on journalists’ linking practices from bureaucratic processes within those newsrooms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital press criticism, or the use of non-journalistic platforms as a means for critiquing journalism, is made possible by digital technologies that circumvent traditional media channels. This form of criticism is not marginal, but indeed is increasingly central within the political communication environment. This can be seen in President Donald Trump’s persistent attacks on U.S. journalists. This article examines how journalists responded to two episodes of digital press criticism, in 2017 and 2019, when Trump used Twitter to affix the incendiary label of “enemy of the people” to journalists. This article explores the propensity of the journalistic community to use frames that individualize Trump by promoting his agency as paramount. We argue that this framing obscures and downplays, if not outright ignores, how far-right politicians utilize emergent channels of digital press criticism to undermine journalism’s epistemic legitimacy and raise questions about its social role.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the changing roles of Social Media Editors (SMEs) in the field of journalism, focusing on their unique position as mediators between online news consumers, marketing departments, and newsrooms. Based on in-depth interviews, our findings suggest that, far beyond their origins as comment field moderators, SMEs now play a crucial role in integrating complex behavioral data from social network sites and circulating this data in the newsroom to align news production with perceived audience tastes. Our findings also suggest that while SMEs identify with traditional norms of professional journalism, they also work closely with staff in marketing departments and draw on marketing language and imagery when describing their work. Ultimately, we find that our SME participants experience their increasingly central role in the newsroom in contradictory and ambivalent ways, at times defending traditional professional values, while at other times voicing support for audience sovereignty and giving readers what they want. In this way, if Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory suggests that journalism is structured by an ongoing struggle between exogeneous (commercial and marketing) logics and endogenous professional values, the changing roles of SMEs indicate the arrival of a new stage in this struggle – a stage marked by the deep and virtually uncontested advance of marketing terminology and goals into the journalistic field. In this restructured professional field, individual SMEs are thus left with the difficult task of reconciling, at the level of habitus, internalized tensions between ascendant marketing imperatives and residual but still-cherished journalistic dispositions and values.",

    "abstract": "Using data from a cross-national survey (N = 940) and from in-depth interviews with 37 students in Israel, Norway and the United Kingdom, we discuss how in different political and news media environments young people’s trust in traditional media can explain their news exposure online. This study shows there are some similarities, but also major cross-national differences, between young people in how they trust, are exposed to and find different news sources usable for information about their society. Students from all these countries have higher trust in traditional news media than in social media. However, young people in Norway living in high-trust environments tend to be exposed to a wider variety of news sources than the UK and Israeli students. They also tend to be more skeptical about social media as a useful source of information. Furthermore, this study suggests that in a national context of conflict and low trust in media, such as Israel, distrust in traditional news media can explain foreign news exposure online. However, the effect of trust in national media is not significant in the Norwegian and the UK sample, which highlights the importance of discussing online news exposure in different national political and media environments.",

    "abstract": "This introductory essay introduces “measureable journalism” as a term that encapsulates the cultural and material shift to digital platforms capable of providing real-time, individualizable, quantitative data about audience consumption practices. Measurable journalism is not a break from the past as much as it is an enactment of industrialized journalism’s desire to monitor its audience. As a conceptual framework, measurable journalism adopts a broad, anti-reductionist perspective to avoid privileging technology, economics, or professionalism as having ultimate explanatory or agentic dominion over the other facets. What is proposed is a mutually constitutive approach that considers how elements of materiality, practice, culture, and economics converge and diverge under the banner of measurable journalism. This approach both informs future research and helps identify the social implications of measurable journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This qualitative study examines creativity and innovation in dispersed, journalistic teams. Specifically, we study the factors enabling and constraining creativity and innovation in journalistic work in technology-mediated settings and explore how technology shapes these phenomena in dispersed journalistic teams. The study is motivated by the media industry’s heightened need for creativity and innovation as well as the changing nature of working life where an increasing amount of work is done via information and communication technologies. By closely examining two journalistic teams and their idea sharing and development processes, this study finds that successful creative work and innovation in dispersed journalistic teams is characterized by intentional idea sharing and development habits and tangible goals as well as a psychologically safe communication climate. Furthermore, team characteristics, such as geographical dispersion and team history also shape creativity and innovation. The findings indicate that communication technology gives journalists more opportunities for sharing ideas, but it also induces uncertainty into the idea development phase. The study extends existing knowledge on remote, technology-mediated work in media organizations and offers valuable practical implications as the findings can encourage new cultures of experimentation and innovation in media organizations.",

Drawing on 28 interviews with professionals working for 14 news organizations in the U.S. and Israel, this study offers a framework for understanding the underlying logics of media production in triple-party news-spaces. It does so while building on the theoretical construct of media logics and the notion of a hybrid media system. Under the proposed framework, the production logics comprise five dimensions: item selection, temporality considerations, hierarchy considerations, expression style, and approach toward UGC. The study reveals what norms are applied and how—along each dimension and in different national/cultural contexts. It thereby advances understanding of news organizations’ activity on platforms that play a key role in distributing digital content.",

    "abstract": "The Sochi Project is a distinguished example of slow journalism. The project, a transmedia experience built by Dutch photographer Rob Hornstra and journalist Arnold van Bruggen, depicts the hidden story behind the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. The project involves an interactive documentary, numerous print media extensions, digital publications, and an exhibition. Transmedia storytelling involves the unfolding of a storyworld in which instalments of the narrative are distributed across different media platforms to engage the audience and offer a meaningful experience. The case study paper aims to discuss the premises of slow journalism within the transmedia space as the theoretical background on which the analysis of the project is founded. The transmedia analysis delineates how The Sochi Project is developed and, consequently, how slow journalism can benefit from multiplatform media production. In conclusion, slow journalism is not necessarily attached to traditional media, but the opposite: it is aligned with the new possibilities offered by novel technologies. The relevance of the paper relies on the exemplification of slow journalism within transmedia dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract New Information and Communication Technologies (NICTs) are transforming newsmaking practices and journalistic cultures across the globe. Although factors such as lack of Internet access and prohibitive costs are constraining the adoption of these interactive digital technologies in most African countries, journalists are creatively appropriating these digital tools in their everyday professional work. Informed by the concept of journalism culture and the social constructionist approach to technology, this article examines the lived experiences of Zimbabwean journalists covering the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drawing upon the first-hand accounts of 21 journalists covering this pandemic, this study explores the adoption and appropriation of digital technologies in their newsmaking practices. Despite challenges of resources such as finances, internet access and lack of protective gear, Zimbabwean journalists increasingly relied on interactive digital tools such as WhatsApp and Twitter to generate story ideas, conduct diary meetings, and for virtual sourcing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The future of data-driven journalism has attracted widespread attention, but what about the future in data journalism? In other words: How do future predictions shape the formulation of knowledge claims in newsmaking that relies on the analysis of large troves of digital data? Based on interviews with professionals working on such projects, we study how they exploited predictive analytics to make evidentiary propositions and we interrogate the epistemological conceptions that underpin this future-oriented data journalism. Despite growing ambitions to generate more precise prognoses in a shorter amount of time, the practitioners downplayed the journalistic relevance of such projections. Instead, they stressed their dependence on past numeric information and the time-consuming effort needed to produce forward-looking stories that connect with the public. We argue that acknowledging the temporal exigencies around anticipatory news allowed those working on data journalistic projects to explore the possibilities of probabilistic storytelling while at the same time maintaining a professional paradigm of fact-based, post hoc reporting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This exploratory study examines how participants incidentally consumed news on social media through an eye tracking analysis of their visual interaction with posts on Facebook. By interaction, we refer to the attention participants gave to news (measured through the time devoted to looking at the content); how they read these news items (measured through ocular movements on the screen); and the way they engaged with this content (measured through forms of participation such as liking, commenting, or sharing news). The data were triangulated through interviews with Facebook users and an analysis of the metrics of posts from Costa Rican news organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2020. We draw on scholarship in communication studies and multimodal discourse analysis. We argue for a more nuanced approach to what study participants did when they incidentally encountered news on social media that focuses on mechanisms, that is, the specific procedures and operations that shape user interaction with news on Facebook (such as visual fixations on parts of news posts; the visual entry points through which they begin to interact with the news; the sequences that characterize how they navigate content; and the time they spend assessing various multimodal elements).",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the contemporary media environment, and particularly on social media platforms, people are embedded in multiple, intersecting flows of political information generated by a wide range of curating actors, and two sets of predictions have emerged in the literature to explain these dynamics of political information exposure and engagement. Theory on incidental exposure suggests that it will lead to news engagement, particularly among the least politically interested individuals. Meanwhile, research on news algorithms suggests the reverse temporal ordering and an antecedent role for political interest. The goals of this study are to (a) theoretically integrate these claims into the ‘curated flows’ framework, (b) to test orthogonal predictions about temporal ordering and the role of political interest, and (c) to compare models by testing cross-lagged relationships between incidental exposure and news sharing. Analysing a two-wave online survey of adult internet users in the United States, results show support for both sets of predictions; however, results also show key differences in the role played by political interest. Results are discussed in light of their implications for theory about news exposure and engagement in the contemporary media environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Algorithmic recommenders are omnipresent in our daily lives. While a multitude of studies focus on how people use algorithmic recommenders, far too little attention has been devoted to how they perceive and understand these complex systems. In this study we focus on Algorithmic News Recommenders (ANR). Drawing on 26 semi-structured interviews, we investigated how laypeople decode Google News and Facebook News. In our method we employ the scroll-back method, make use of visualizations and a double interview design. Our results differentiate between those with a high and low level of understanding. Those with a high level of understanding acknowledged the role of companies and developers in the workings of ANR. Others, who were less cognizant had a more instrumental view and mostly focused on the relation between their individual data disclosed and the ANR. More importantly, in both groups, their feelings (ranging from admiration to frustration) about and everyday interactions (both dominant and deviating) with ANR shape their general understanding. In the discussion we argue how it’s necessary for future research endeavors and algorithmic literacy initiatives to be mindful of the interconnection between knowledge, feelings, and interactions to understand layman’s perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies have extensively discussed what characterizes news media sources as alternative. However, this study focuses on users and the range of news sources they perceive as alternative media. We expect that these audience perceptions vary between countries, depending on the level of media fragmentation and polarization. We use original survey data from five countries (Denmark = 2,667 respondents; Italy = 2,121; Poland = 2,536; Switzerland = 1,859; United States = 3,493) and investigate (i) what sources are perceived by users as alternative and (ii) whether these perceptions differ among users embedded in more or less fragmented-polarized media environments. Our results reveal that users have distinctive types of media in mind when reporting alternative media consumption, fanning out on a spectrum from traditional mass media outlets to self-proclaimed alternative news media. Interestingly, despite a greater supply of alternative news sources and an overall higher propensity to indicate the use of alternative news sources, citizens in more fragmented-polarized media environments are more likely to indicate using mass media outlets as alternative news media. We conclude from these findings that media fragmentation and polarization in a political information environment contribute to the convergence of the alternative-to-mainstream spectrum in the eyes of their audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alternative media are more recently discussed as anti-democratic threats rather than hopeful alternatives to established mainstream positions. Despite the growing attention to anti-system alternative media in communication research, knowledge about the users of these media is still limited. In this article, a qualitative approach is used to explore alternative media users’ motives and practices as well as the role these media play in their overall news consumption. An empirical study involving 35 guided interviews with users of digital alternative media was conducted to categorize the users based on how they selected, sorted, and curated their personal blend of media and the role alternative media played in their repertoire. In the analysis, a typology of alternative media users was developed, resulting in five different user types of (1) the awakened infowarrior, (2) the critical curator, (3) the completist, (4) the reconnaissance user, and (5) the community seeker.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article takes a close look at news sharing on the immensely popular Chinese instant messaging app WeChat. The study is an example of how an affordances perspective can be useful for understanding a key concept of digital journalism, namely news sharing. Most research on news sharing focuses on its antecedents or consequences; in contrast, this study demonstrates how a focus on the affordances of WeChat can illuminate ways in which news sharing on social media in China works. It also explores how the interplay of the platform’s owner, Tencent’s commercial logics and the technology company’s relations with the state may have shaped WeChat’s news sharing through the lens of the political economy of communication. By analysing the platform’s nuanced interface design and its possible implications, the study finds that the affordances of WeChat can both enable and constrain users’ participation in news distribution.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary journalism, there is a need for better conceptualizing the changing nature of human actors, nonhuman technological actants, and diverse representations of audiences—and the activities of news production, distribution, and interpretation through which actors, actants, and audiences are inter-related. This article explicates each of these elements—the Four A’s—in the context of cross-media news work, a perspective that lends equal emphasis to editorial, business, and technology as key sites for studying the organizational influences shaping journalism. We argue for developing a sociotechnical emphasis for the study of institutional news production: a holistic framework through which to make sense of and conduct research about the full range of actors, actants, and audiences engaged in cross-media news work activities. This emphasis addresses two shortcomings in the journalism studies literature: a relative neglect about (1) the interplay of humans and technology, or manual and computational modes of orientation and operation, and (2) the interplay of editorial, business, and technology in news organizations. This article’s ultimate contribution is a cross-media news work matrix that illustrates the interconnections among the Four A’s and reveals where opportunities remain for empirical study.",

    "title": "Breaking Through the Ambivalence: Journalistic Responses to Information Security Technologies",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last several years, numerous journalists and news organizations have reported incidents in which their communications have been hacked, intercepted, or retrieved. In 2014, Google security experts found that 21 of the world’s 25 most popular media outlets were targets of state-sponsored hacking attempts, and many journalists have watched helplessly as hackers took control of their social media accounts, targeting confidential information in their internal servers. When journalists’ digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk, and journalists’ ability to carry out their newsmaking function is reduced. Yet, some journalists do not believe that hacking and surveillance are significant threats, and they are not adopting information security measures to protect their data, themselves, or their sources. This research study includes 19 interviews with journalists, developers, and digital security trainers to shed light on journalists’ perceptions of information security technologies, including motivations to adopt and barriers to adoption. The findings show that motivations to adopt information security technologies hinge on the idea of protection: protection of self, story, and the journalist’s role—more so than the protection of the source, contrary to contemporary discourse about why journalists need to adopt such technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We introduce a design that is able to face some of the challenges that digital news consumption is posing to traditional media effects methods like linkage analysis. The challenges include (1) memory errors and biases when reporting everyday news media consumption leading to (2) errors when linking mass media outlets to survey data; (3) personalization of media content, as well as (4) short-term dynamic processes. Mobile Intensive Longitudinal Linkage Analysis (MILLA) uses an innovative combination of smartphone data donations to capture media exposure and relevant media content, a mobile experience sampling questionnaire to capture immediate reactions to news, and the content analysis of uploaded news media content to measure media effects. The design is explained by using an example of negativity in the news and its effects on emotional reactions of recipients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article proposes a conceptual framework for the concept audience agency, which plays a vital role in the current audience turn in journalism (research). It presents two types of audience agency, deliberate and incidental, and three levels at which they can manifest: the micro level of the individual, the meso level of organised groups and the macro level of collective audiences. While incidental, individual agency is much more commonplace, both media professionals and scholars increasingly aggregate and study – and risk to misinterpret – individuals’ behaviour at a deliberate audience level. Finally, future research avenues are suggested to advance knowledge and debate on audience agency within digital journalism, including studying the concept through editorial, commercial and/or democratic lenses.",

    "title": "Reclaiming Control: How Journalists Embrace Social Media Logics While Defending Journalistic Values",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article uses semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews with journalists at 16 US newspapers to examine how strategies for sharing news content and interacting with audiences on platforms have evolved over the past decade. Using a lens of Gatekeeping Theory, the study analyzes the approaches and techniques used by journalists to distribute content and engage with audiences on platforms—and how those approaches have changed since the beginning of the social media era. Its findings show journalists initially relied on traditional journalistic instincts and used somewhat haphazard approaches when sharing and interacting on platforms. Over time, the findings show, journalists’ approaches became more strategic—based much more on social media logics than just journalistic instinct, with heavy emphasis on algorithms and audience metrics. The study also provides evidence that, even as they have ceded some gatekeeping authority to platforms and adjusted to social media logics, journalists continue to defend traditional journalistic values of speed, objectivity and fairness. It also shows newspapers trying to regain some control over their content, through the implementation of paywalls and prioritization of their own websites. But, overall, the study offers evidence that US newspapers have embraced platforms in their institutional structures and editorial practices.",

    "title": "The Watchdog Role of Fact-Checkers in Different Media Systems",
    "abstract": "Abstract The article aims to capture the diversity of emerging practices in fact-checking by exploring, on the one side, journalists’ self-perception of the watchdog role they believe to perform and, on the other, the effective occurrence of such a role in different media systems. Data regarding the perception of the watchdog role stem from the Worlds of Journalism Survey, whereas evidence concerning the presence of the watchdog function derives from a content analysis of 2,792 fact-checks published by FactCheck.org (United States), Pagella Politica (Italy), Correctiv (Germany), and Lupa (Brazil). While fact-checkers working for Correctiv rarely addressed declarations by political agents, those contributing to FactCheck.org prioritized verifying statements by former President Trump. In turn, Pagella Politica fact-checkers recurrently used assertive labels to stress the falsehood of public remarks, whilst “true” is the most used label in the Lupa case. There is correspondence between professionals’ conceptions about their role and the watchdog stance agencies perform in most cases. The manuscript also discusses how idiosyncrasies featuring each professional culture and specific traits of media systems influence fact-checkers’ work. Lastly, we hold that in some settings fact-checking may outline new frontiers for the notion of watchdog journalism, taking the journalistic voice to unprecedented levels of adversarialism.",

    "abstract": "In light of Edward Snowden’s global surveillance disclosures, this article examines news discourses about online communication security and surveillance circumvention practices. It analyses 1249 news reports mentioning encryption in The Guardian and The New York Times, covering a three-year period from June 2012 to June 2015 (one year before and two years after the Snowden revelations). Whilst there was a marked increase in the volume of news articles mentioning encryption post-Snowden, the context in which encryption is discussed has since shifted from an initial emphasis on “surveillance” towards “security” issues. However, the research found that greater news coverage of encryption did not necessarily mean an increase in depth of coverage, with most mentions of encryption vague and non-descript. In terms of source usage, the research finds an emphasis on private corporations in both publications analysed. This is problematic when many of the organisations allowed to speak on encryption were those accused of colluding with the US and UK Governments to aid covert mass surveillance—the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and so forth—thus providing them with a platform to exonerate themselves from the accusations. This contradictory depiction of communication security serves the status quo and prevents advancement of the “encrypted by default” communication practice called for by Snowden. This, by extension, has serious implications for both journalistic freedom and civil liberties since it helps to perpetuate the ability of nation states and corporations to conduct indiscriminate mass surveillance.",

    "abstract": "In this essay, I consider the challenges of doing research in a shifting domain, where technology has made the concept of journalism itself problematic. For many years, I have used (in my own work with Shoemaker on media sociology) a levels-of-analysis hierarchy of influences perspective to sort out the factors impinging on the symbolic reality produced by journalism, but a “spatial turn” has made concepts of fields, spheres, and networks much more relevant. Understanding these spaces requires thinking in less media-centric terms as we identify the newly coupled assemblages put together in producing digital journalism, beyond its traditional institutional containers. These include algorithmically restructured atomic units of news in content and different configurations of global journalism. A new wave of ethnographies has begun to tackle these challenges, using the kind of thick description that characterized the field in the pre-digital era.",

Drawing from their “essential dimensions” for journalism, it analyzes more than 2700 tweets from reporters at 51 US newspapers. Findings show the reporters engaging in a journalism of service, while also adhering to conventions of product and “lecture by professional authorities.” Evidence for service includes live tweeting news events and retweeting citizen voices. Journalism as product is supported by a significant number of reporters’ links to their own newsroom content, and by their heavy reliance on official sources, despite the networked audience afforded by Twitter.",

    "title": "The Value of UK Hyperlocal Community News",
    "abstract": "The public interest value of news is often viewed through the prism of its relationship to democracy. In this respect news should act as: a source of accurate and plural information for citizens; a watchdog on elites; a mediator and/or representative of communities; and as an advocate of the public in campaigning terms. All of these roles are under pressure in the United Kingdom’s commercial local news sector. This has led many to speculate, often without evidence, that the output of a new generation of (mainly online) hyperlocal citizen news producers might (at least partially) play some of these roles. To test this assumption, we completed 34 semi-structured interviews with producers, the largest content analysis to date of UK hyperlocal news content (1941 posts on 313 sites), and the largest ever survey of UK community news practitioners (183 responses). We found that these sites produce a good deal of news about community activities, local politics, civic life and local business. Official news sources get a strong platform, but the public (local citizens, community groups) get more of a say than in much mainstream local news. Although there was little balanced coverage in the traditional sense, many community journalists have developed alternative strategies to foster and inform plural debate around contentious local issues. The majority of hyperlocal news producers cover community campaigns and a significant minority have initiated their own. We also found that critical public-interest investigations are carried out by a (surprisingly) large number of community news producers.",

    "title": "What is the meaning of a news link?",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the meaning of news links in the context of a qualitative description of links on the home pages of six online news sites. Links are analyzed according to the following taxonomy: who is saying what, where, when, and to what purpose. This 5-Ws method for analyzing links yields four meanings: navigation, commercial, social, and citation. It is argued that the meaning of news links, while theoretically infinite, actually lies within the boundaries of these four meanings. Opportunities to use computational tools to analyze large datasets of news links are discussed in the context of a journalism tool (Jot), the author and colleagues are developing. Issues raised by this taxonomy of news links are several, but two in particular are highlighted for discussion: (1) the role of navigation links in determining the form of news; and (2) the fact that opportunities to share content via social links invariably are outsourced to social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter.",

We describe this space in terms of institutional theory and field-level studies of news production and report on a series of interviews we conducted with senior news app designers and lead programmers. Part of a larger empirical study on mobile news app design, we focus here on analyzing how designers understand their work in relation to journalism as a profession and process, and how they see themselves as like or unlike others in their field. We conclude with reflections on how these designers are helping to constitute the organizational field of news app design by creating and sustaining boundary infrastructures that constitute an emerging “liminal press.”",

    "title": "Twilight or New Dawn of Journalism?",
    "abstract": "The enormous business challenges confronting newspapers, news agencies, and other news providers have multiplied in the Western world in the twenty-first century. Mature and saturated markets, loss of audiences not highly interested in news, the diminishing effectiveness of the mass media businesses model, the lingering effects of the economic crisis, and the impact of digital competitors have all taken a toll on news organizations. Compounding these factors are changes in technology and communication economics that are dismantling the traditional financial configurations that made Western media wealthy. Digitalization has destabilized business models—arrangements that were based on high market power over distribution platforms, mass audience, and mass advertisers. Simultaneously these changes have created opportunities for many more news, information, and commentary providers to emerge, and these afford access to content through multiple platforms. The combination of these factors has produced lower returns and resulted in redundancies and restructurings as it stripped wealth from the established enterprises of the news industry (Küng, Towse, and Picard 2008; Currah 2009; Levy and Nielsen 2010; Picard 2010). Understanding of the conditions has been difficult because media and scholarly portrayals of the causes and solutions have been so poor. Much of the journalistic coverage of the news industry has been anecdotal, narrow, and inordinately concerned about journalistic employment rather than social effects and opportunities. News coverage of changes has been criticized as shallow and self-interested (Chyi, Lewis, and Zheng 2012). Scholarly work on the subject has been polemical, offered limited historical or comparative context, much less direct evidence of social effects from which to more fully comprehend the impact of the changes (Siles and Boczkowski 2012). Consequently, there is a widespread perception that legacy news providers are dying, that quality journalism is disappearing, and that we are witnessing the twilight of an age in which journalism informed and ensured democracy. Many commentators cling to an idealized and illusory vision of journalism in days past and are now dancing in circles, beating their chests, and chanting that the end of journalism is nigh; but that does not make it so. Journalism scholars and critics, who used to bemoan the lapses in the press five years ago, lament the loss of those “golden” days. Corporate owners who were vilified for buying papers from independent",

    "title": "Between Journalistic and Movement Logic: Disentangling Referencing Practices of Right-Wing Alternative Online News Media",
    "abstract": "Abstract The article analyzes the in-article referencing practices of right-wing alternative online news media. It distinguishes between a journalistic logic, in which referencing practices follow established journalistic ways of ensuring facticity and context, and a movement logic, in which references are used to obtain political, movement-oriented goals of dismissing opponents, supporting your allies, multiplying forces and building a community. Based on a manual quantitative content analysis of more than 4,500 references extracted from 1,000 randomly selected articles by 20 right-wing alternative news media from six countries (US, UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark), the article shows that alternative news media predominantly follow a journalistic logic in their referencing practices, though at the expense of a limited originality of sources. Despite their anti-mainstream ambition, alternative news media frequently refer to mainstream media, but only rarely dismiss or re-frame content published by these media. The article discusses these practices as an expression of the hybrid nature of alternative news media situated at the boundary between journalism and political activism. Moreover, it addresses broader implications for the relationship between alternative and mainstream journalistic practice in the digital realm.",

    "abstract": "There has recently been considerable attention paid to spatial visualizations in data journalism; less as a product and more as practice. This refers to the notion that rather than reading maps as fixed representations, digital mapping is by nature a dynamic, performative, and participatory practice. In particular, mapping environmental damage, endangered species, and human-made disasters has become one focal point for environmental knowledge production. This type of digital map has been highlighted as a processual turn in critical cartography, whereas in related computational journalism, it can be seen as an interactive and iterative process of mapping complex and fragile ecological developments. This article looks at computer-assisted cartography as part of environmental knowledge production. It uses InfoAmazonia, the data-journalism platform on Amazon rainforests, as an example of a geo-visualization within information mapping that enhances embodiment in the experience of the information. InfoAmazonia is defined as a digitally created map-space within which journalistic practice can be seen as dynamic, performative interactions between journalists, ecosystems, space, and species.",

    "abstract": "In the backdrop of interests in social media news and polarization the aim of this study is to examine to what extent we are exposed to the same “news” in the News Feed? The article defines news not from a classical position but from the content that is judged relevant to the user and made visible by the algorithm. The study examines filter bubbles as information similarity and more specifically nonoverlapping content segments in a unique snapshot dataset of 14 days of personal Facebook News Feeds for 1,000 Danes mirroring the Danish Facebook population. Deploying methods to analyze both link sources and content semantics the study finds that less than 10% in the link source analysis and 27.8% in the semantic analysis are in a filter bubble. The article tests and discusses suitable conceptual and empirical thresholds for information similarity that can inspire future studies. The best significant predictors for being in a filter bubble are what we term sociality: number of page likes, group memberships and friends. The study does not find age, gender, education or area of residence isolated to be significant predictors of participants in filter bubbles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on face-to-face, in-depth interviews with 31 Chilean journalists from national TV, radio, print, and online media, this study explores how news professionals negotiate their identities and media use on Twitter and Instagram. The results suggest that, overall, they use Twitter and Instagram to stay informed, report the news, engage in branding activities, and interact with their audiences, expanding the scope of their work to include new professional roles and allow for the emergence of different but not mutually exclusive digital selves. Important nuances are found based on the platform used and the journalists’ perceptions of which practices are valid and relevant. Specifically, three analytical approaches to digital selves were identified. While we found strong patterns of a reinterpretation of journalistic practices through the normalization of some traditional functions, which are represented by the “adapted” approach, we also found clear elements of redefinition of journalistic work represented by the “redefiner” approach. The journalists who embrace this orientation disrupt traditional norms, merging their different selves on both platforms and using their accounts to target specific audiences. We also identified an approach close to individuals who resist the idea of mixing their professional work with social media practices, remaining “skeptical” to changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article develops the concept of “mimetic weaponization” for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from “sharing a joke” to promoting “alternative facts,” rebuking “political correctness” or “wokeness,” defending preferred framings of “free speech,” or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with “mainstream” media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme’s public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize – ostensibly through humour, parody or satire – rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as “just a bit of fun.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract This survey of journalists, editors, and managers working for news organizations in the United States explores the perceived importance of citizen and consumer role orientations among newsworkers. It then examines how useful these professionals perceive particular audience metrics to be in fulfilling those roles orientations. This examination takes into account the contextual factors that may influence those perceptions at the individual and organizational levels. We find that newsworkers perceive some audience metrics more useful than others and generally perceive them to be more useful for helping them enact a consumer role orientation that has been historically deemed to be of lesser import. However, these perceptions vary across organizational contexts, and particularly according to the newsworker’s position within an editorial hierarchy. These findings contribute to the literatures that argue that quantified audiences are an important part of role orientation formation.",

    "abstract": "Proximity has helped practitioners and scholars to determine newsworthiness for generations. Emerging mobile technologies, though, with contextual-awareness capabilities, have been complicating many of the related issues and expanding the realm of journalistic content—as well as conceptualizations of timeliness—through growing digital tethers to place and use of that material in place. Those evolving complexities include the increasing possibilities for journalists to make connections to contemporary audiences through the customization of content based on matters of user location. In turn, where an audience member is located when media is delivered can matter greatly. Geolocation metadata has become ubiquitous and media delivery systems can sort that data to customize user experiences based on place. In terms of such tailoring, mobile devices allow novel kinds of personalized connections to journalism, prompted by a geographical nearness to physical stimuli. In response, this study examines the potential of proximity for impact on key factors of engagement, through the involvement, social facilitation, and satisfaction of users. This conceptualization of mobile journalism shows that media designers now not only can know precisely where their particular audience is but also adapt their messages to the situation as a way to generate more engaging experiences.",

    "abstract": "Hurricane Katrina thoroughly restructured New Orleans as a news environment. In the recovery period, New Orleans also lost its daily, printed newspaper when the venerated, Pulitzer Prize-winning Times-Picayune transitioned to a reduced print delivery, digital-driven format. At the same time, the uptick in public interest surrounding institutional corruption post-Katrina left a heightened civic need for newswork that fulfills the social responsibility ethic of journalistic practice. This research—founded upon 92 days of on-the-ground fieldwork and 60 in-depth interviews with newsworkers—explores the nature of accountability reporting post-Katrina. More specifically, this work traces three phases of ecological restructuring that reordered practitioner routines, fostering the growth of slow journalism in the Crescent City.",

    "abstract": "The availability of data feeds, the demand for news on digital devices, and advances in algorithms are helping to make automated journalism more prevalent. This article extends the literature on the subject by analysing professional journalists’ experiences with, and opinions about, the technology. Uniquely, the participants were drawn from a range of news organizations—including the BBC, CNN, and Thomson Reuters—and had first-hand experience working with robo-writing software provided by one of the leading technology suppliers. The results reveal journalists’ judgements on the limitations of automation, including the nature of its sources and the sensitivity of its “nose for news”. Nonetheless, journalists believe that automated journalism will become more common, increasing the depth, breadth, specificity, and immediacy of information available. While some news organizations and consumers may benefit, such changes raise ethical and societal issues and, counter-intuitively perhaps, may increase the need for skills—news judgement, curiosity, and scepticism—that human journalists embody.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As both news and audiences are increasingly mobile, this introduction calls for intensified research into mobility as a core characteristic of journalism. This special issue explores the intersection of news with mobility in production, distribution and consumption. News has become mobile in a material sense as it is accessed on portable devices; and in a professional sense of being cut adrift from the business models which sustained it, challenged by peripheral actors and alternative news media, and embracing new technologies, new relationships with the audience and new political challenges to its status quo. One task is to adapt research techniques usually applied to fixed phenomena – or at least applied with the intention of fixing them – to something fluid. This is not impossible. All mobilities need an infrastructure on which to move, offering fixed points in a fluid world. Mobility offers critical questions of power and dominance of who is mobile, how, and under what circumstances; in this way, mobility becomes embodied. And the paradigm calls for research into the mobility of journalism and its interaction with similarly fluid, related actualities: blogs, smartphones, audiences, economics, advertisers, government and technology. Each interacts with journalism to deliver diverse realities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As an unprecedented amount of information circulates, contemporary newsrooms are turning to automation to manage the data deluge. Amid claims of journalism in crisis, with falling revenues and newsroom closures, this study uses Bourdieu’s field theory to investigate how automation, as supplied by technological firms entering the journalistic field, may transform journalism in drastic ways. This study brings clarity to a field in flux, by reconciling structure and agency – social structures shape the logics of the journalistic field and the behavior of agents to adopt automation, and the agency of actors, in turn, will reshape the structures over time through the skillsets they accumulate and their attitudes towards field transformation or preservation. Through in-depth interviews with newsworkers, this study reveals that while automation adoption may increase the autonomous power of the journalistic field in the long run, the field remains a site of struggle due to a divergence in journalist attitudes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Given the centrality of news media to democracy, it is concerning that public trust in media has declined in many countries. A potential mechanism that may reverse this trend is independent fact-checking to adjudicate competing claims in news stories. We undertake a survey experiment on a sample of 1608 Australians to test the effects of fact-checking on media trust using a real-life case study known as the “sports rorts” affair. We construct duplicate news articles from two national media outlets (i.e. ABC.net.au, news.com.au) containing a senior government minister’s real-life false claim that public funds were not used for political advantage immediately before an election. Half of the participants are exposed to a third-party fact check, which confirms the Minister’s claim is verifiably false, the other half are not. All respondents are asked to evaluate the story’s and news outlets’ trustworthiness. Contrary to our expectations we find a backfire effect whereby independent fact-checking decreases readers’ trust in the original news story and outlet. This negative relationship is not conditional on partisanship or the media source. Our study provides a cautionary tale for those expecting third-party fact-checks to increase media trust and we outline several avenues by which fact-checkers might overcome this.",

    "abstract": "Based on research carried out over two years amongst groups of students from the United Kingdom, France, United States and Russia, this article explores how churnalism is not only having an impact on what people read but also on how they read it, with far-reaching consequences for what has traditionally been perceived as the news genre. Drawing on genre as a social action, we explore the ways in which churnalism is changing news consumption. New news genres are appearing in response to new social interactions that users repeatedly act out predominantly online. As users, we produce and consume texts which we refer to as “news” in multiple situations which can be sorted into patterns. Our comparative analysis offers surprising insights into how these patterns form new news genres, characteristic of social media (many-to-many) instead of mass media (one-to-many). Genres should be studied not only through textual analysis but also through the prism of social reality and recurrent social actions, particularly now that users, rather than journalists, are taking a dominant role in identifying what constitutes news genres. Our perception of what defines news is determined by the changing ways in which we consume news.",

    "title": "Regaining Control Citizens who follow politicians on social media and their perceptions of journalism",
    "abstract": "The use of social media by politicians has received much scholarly interest. However, much less is known about the citizens who follow them and whether their motivation to seek information directly from political actors is linked to perceptions of journalism practice. To address this gap, this paper examines the motivations of news users, in six countries (Australia, Germany, Ireland, Spain, UK and USA), who also follow politicians and political parties on social media. Analysis of data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2017 shows the desire to access information unfiltered by journalists was the primary motivation, followed by partisan support, and dissatisfaction with elements of mainstream political reporting. Additional logistic regression analyses for each country reveals these ‘followers’ are younger, have a higher interest in political news, stronger political orientation and efficacy, and participate more in sharing and commenting, than ‘non-followers’. Drawing on contemporary gatekeeping theory and the curation of information flows, this paper highlights the desire of these politically interested news users for greater control over the information they consume and raises questions about the impact of negative perceptions of journalism on the desire to seek alternative information sources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper studies the prevalence of immediacy in digital journalism from an ecosystem perspective. It combines insights into norms and routines in digital newswork with an analytical approach from news diffusion research and the power of computational methods to track story-based news flows at high granularity of time intervals in comprehensive media samples. We ask how attributes of news stories and situational preconditions of their production help explain whether the variety of newsrooms in a digital journalism ecosystem will converge on immediate story coverage so that wide-range bursts will emerge at the start of news diffusion processes. Based on the reconstruction of 95 news diffusion processes among 28 professional online news sites in Germany, we pool first reports from diffusion processes with the same attribute and compare the dynamics of the accumulation of issued first reports by attributes in event history analyses. We find that most news factors made no difference in a recurring pattern of basically fast diffusion dynamics. Only negative news and stories involving prominent personalities further accelerated diffusion processes and spread even faster. In contrast, events characterized by wide reach beyond small groups and the production break of many newsrooms during the night slowed down digital diffusion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Headlines play an important role in both news audiences' attention decisions online and in news organizations’ efforts to attract that attention. A large body of research focuses on developing generally applicable heuristics for more effective headline writing. In this work, we measure the importance of a number of theoretically motivated textual features to headline performance. Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline context are key to predicting news attention decisions.",

    "abstract": "By means of a large-scale manual content analysis of Dutch economic news coverage in 2015 (n = 4251 articles), we compare the use of “every day” sources by online and offline outlets. The use of those sources is argued to increase news consumers’ attentiveness to the news item. We investigate whether online outlets use the “ordinary citizen” less frequently, both generally speaking as well as a source, while relying more on social media posts. Our empirical analysis focuses on a comparison between two online quality outlets (nrc.nl and vk.nl), two online popular outlets (nu.nl and telegraaf.nl), two offline quality outlets (NRC Handelsblad and de Volkskrant) and two offline popular outlets (Algemeen Dablad and de Telegraaf). Overall, results suggest a limited use of ordinary citizens as news sources, and even less use of social media. Multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for the length of news items as well as the day of publishing, ‘show that offline outlets use ordinary citizens more often, while online outlets rely more on social media’. Additionally, we find the differences between popular and quality outlets a lot less pronounced, with the latter only making slight more use of social media sources.",

    "abstract": "Journalists have for considerable time been criticized for living in their own bubbles, a phenomenon industry commentators have referred to as groupthink, while in scholarship the tendency of individuals to connect with people who are like them is termed homophily. This age-old process has come under scrutiny in recent times due to the arrival of social network sites, which have been viewed as both working against but also leading to more homophily. In journalism scholarship, these processes are still little understood, however. Focusing on the social network site Twitter and drawing on a large-scale analysis of more than 600,000 tweets sent by 2908 Australian journalists during one year, this study shows that journalists continue to live in bubbles in their online interactions with each other. Most journalists were more likely to interact with journalists who have the same gender, work in the same organization, on the same beat or in the same location. However, the study also demonstrates some notable exceptions as well as the importance of differentiating between types of interaction.",

    "abstract": "Digital media have influenced everyday life to a large extent. They have particular influence on jobs in the communication realm such as journalism. Clubs and federations communicate directly with their reference groups without being reliant on intermediate traditional media. Consequently, they have acquired communicative superiority in the highly competitive field of professional sports information. This research addresses how collaboration and relationships between sports and media work through expert interviews with the head spokespersons of 18 German Bundesliga clubs and an online survey among print sports journalists who report on these clubs (adjusted sample N = 174). An integrative analysis contrasts results from spokespersons and journalists. Both sides see journalists as more dependent on the spokespersons than vice versa. None of the spokespersons interprets their role as a service provider for the media but journalists do. Additionally, 87 percent of the journalists expect clubs to increase pressure on their reporting in the future. Assessing honesty, more than 90 percent state that spokespersons withhold certain information or do not tell the truth constantly. Also, 73 percent criticize authorization of interviews as modern censorship. The digital revolution, however, has changed journalistic roles and initiated a journalistic advancement as illustrated by new sports channels, programs, and formats.",

    "abstract": "Franklin Ford (1849–1918) is mostly known for his association with the philosopher John Dewey in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Together, they attempted to launch Thought News, a “philosophical newspaper” that never saw the light of day. But both before and after that failed project, Ford never stopped developing a vision for the future of the news. Reading Ford is a jumping-off point for experimentations that raise original methodological questions in the field of media history and theoretical developments that speak to contemporary media problems. In that regard, our paper focuses on the methodological experiment undertaken to explore Ford’s work: the creation of an automated Twitter account, a “bot” that uses text-mining techniques to automatically tweet excerpts from his writings. The paper describes the concrete steps of that remediation: from the delineation of Ford’s written work to the gathering and digitization of the material and its transformation into tweetable soundbites. We argue that this combination of close and automated reading offers heuristic elements of surprise to guide the historical inquiry. As the tweets echo the specific genre of today’s “future-of-the-news” thinkers, they also constitute an attempt to explore the relationship between “old” and “new” media.",

    "title": "Locating the “Digital” in Digital Journalism Studies: Transformations in Research",
    "abstract": "Abstract This essay applies six commitments for journalism studies to research involving digital technologies, namely: contextual sensitivity, holistic relationality, comparative inclination, normative awareness, embedded communicative power, and methodological pluralism. We argue that the emergent characteristics of digital journalism – as reflected in algorithms, automation, networking tools, and mass posting, sharing, and production with a click of a button – bring on transformations that must be theorized holistically, contextually, and relationally as part of a subfield of journalism studies called “digital journalism studies.” Spatial and temporal considerations inform this argument and complicate how the field of journalism studies examines news production and consumption. It is within the studies of “transformation” that we as researchers find an emergent theory that not only reveals the disruption of norms and introduction of new developments, but also exposes enduring power dynamics. By locating the “digital” in digital journalism studies through the lens of these six commitments, scholars can better identify evolving and blurring boundaries of news content and its production, distribution, and consumption processes.",

    "title": "News as They Know It: Young Adults’ Information Repertoires in the Digital Media Landscape",
    "abstract": "Abstract Despite an “audience turn” in journalism studies, confusion persists about the experiences driving audience engagement. Young adults are especially intriguing in this regard, as they have grown up in digital environments, are less willing to pay for journalism, and lack key historical catalysts for the formation of news habits. Accordingly, this article investigates the information repertoires of this group, using a mixed-method approach to focus upon the preferences and experiences of Danish youth, aged 18–24. Crafting an innovative research design integrating individual interviews, Q-sort methodology, and think aloud protocols, the article explores five repertoires: the online traditionalist, depth-seeking audiophile, digital news seeker, interpersonal networker, and non-news information seeker. In these repertoires, “traditional” journalistic media is often eschewed, while “new” media come to the fore. The paper also examines two analytical themes cutting across repertoires: a tension between the seamlessness of where news is (“platform newsiness”) versus how it is conceptualized (“traditional journalism”); and the guiding role of face-to-face communication and social networks when engaging with news. In sum, by exploring the formation of information repertoires at this crucial life stage, the article provides insights into a key demographic, whose practices and preferences shape the news industry’s ongoing sustainability.",

    "title": "The Unified Framework of Media Diversity: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Abstract How to study media diversity has become a major concern in today’s media landscape. Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries decrease the diversity of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread of misinformation. Different fields, from journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review (1999–2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization, we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction. Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces) and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity) should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As an emerging audience engagement channel for news organizations, news chatbots can interact with and attract audiences in a conversational manner. The present study applies the comparative digital journalism frameworks and examines how society-level factors—such as media systems and information communication technology’s development—explain chatbot implementation on social media platforms. We surveyed 365 news organizations across 38 countries or regions and inspected their Facebook Messenger accounts with a mixed-methods approach. We found that less than half of the surveyed news organizations implemented Messenger, and only 67 Messengers were responsive—i.e. able to produce at least one response. We used the walkthrough method to interact with the Messengers with 22 pre-defined search queries on information seeking and navigation related to COVID-19. Then we used qualitative content analysis to examine the contents generated by the Messengers. Some Messengers are out of service or could only provide limited services (e.g. generating templated responses or closed-ended options). The Messengers in different news organizations demonstrated great variations in their capacity to understand the queries and interact with the audiences and reparative strategies to handle search failure. We proposed a three-category typology of news chatbots and offered practical and constructive suggestions for news organizations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Advances in analytical methodologies and an avalanche of digitized data have opened new avenues for (digital) journalism research—and with it, new challenges. One of these challenges concerns the sampling and evaluation of data using (non-validated) search terms in combination with automated content analyses. This challenge has largely been neglected by research, which is surprising, considering that noise slipping in during the process of data collection can generate great methodological concerns. To address this gap, we first offer a systematic interdisciplinary literature review, revealing that the validation of search terms is far from acknowledged as a required standard procedure, both in and beyond journalism research. Second, we assess the consequences of validating search terms, using a multi-step approach and investigating common research topics from the field of (digital) journalism research. Our findings show that careless application of non-validated search terms has its pitfalls: while scattershot search terms can make sense in initial data exploration, final inferences based on insufficiently validated search terms are at higher risk of being obscured by noise. Consequently, we provide a step-by-step recommendation for developing and validating search terms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research has paid relatively little attention to two aspects that are increasingly important in understanding data journalism as a maturing field: (a) journalism today is increasingly provided by a diverse set of actors both inside and outside of legacy media organizations, and (b) data journalism has become a global phenomenon that cannot be fully grasped within national contexts only. Our article brings both of these aspects together and investigates the roles and practices of peripheral actors in European and African contexts. We engage with research on the role of non-profits and civic technologists in journalism to interrogate further the entanglements between civic technology organizations and data journalism. Following in-depth interviews with 29 practitioners of data-driven non-profits in Europe and Africa, we conclude that practices and roles of these non-profits in relation to journalism are similar, but transcultural and contextual influences shape how they complement or expand data journalism.",

With the field’s recent introspection into the role of gender and race in academia came a need for empirical data, supporting the efforts of scholars working on improving journalism study’s diversity, both in terms of gender and affiliation nationality. The current study aims at adding to this ongoing research by investigating the diversity among the authors of three major journalism related journals from 2000–2020, by employing automated content analysis and network analysis on a corpus of 2,751 original research articles. The results illustrate how authors’ characteristics impact a fields output.

    "abstract": "Data storytelling is rapidly gaining prominence as a characteristic activity of digital journalism with significant adoption by small and large media houses. While a handful of previous studies have examined what characterises aspects of data storytelling like narratives and visualisation or analysis based on single cases, we are yet to see a systematic effort to harness these available resources to gain better insight into what characterises good data stories and how these are created. This study analysed 44 cases of outstanding data storytelling practices comprising winning entries of the Global Editors Network’s Data Journalism Award from 2013 to 2016 to bridge this knowledge gap. Based on a conceptual model we developed, we uniformly characterised each of the 44 cases and then proceeded to determine types of these stories and the nature of technologies employed in creating them. Our findings refine the traditional typology of data stories from the journalistic perspective and also identify core technologies and tools that appear central to good data journalism practice. We also discuss our findings in relations to the recently published 2017 winning entries. Our results have significant implications for the required competencies for data journalists in contemporary and future newsrooms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital platforms are transforming practices of political information production and circulation in local communities. We develop the theoretical concept of local political information infrastructure to draw attention to (1) the broadening array of actors who are producing political information in local communities, in addition to local news media, and (2) the role of network media logics in shaping everyday practices of political information production and circulation. We combine a computational analysis of Facebook posts from news and non-news community actors in a mid-sized Midwestern U.S. city with interviews with communication managers at local non-profits, libraries, local government, and city service organizations in that same case community. Our findings illustrate the ways in which local news media are increasingly displaced from the centre of local political information infrastructures, while Facebook moves to take up a central infrastructural role. We consider the consequences of these shifts for the circulation of politics and policy information in communities.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social media (SM) are often regarded drivers of personalized echo chambers in which only ideas resonante that individuals already hold, leading to more extreme opinions and intensified opinion expression. However, recent theorizing and evidence has cast doubts on the universal applicability of the echo chamber metaphor, pointing out that communication effects on opinion expression are much more complex than the metaphor suggests. Using the refugee crisis in Germany as a background, the current study challenges four implicit premises of the echo chamber metaphor empirically. The findings show a more complex picture than the metaphor implies: (1) Ignoring other information sources beyond SM may lead to severe misinterpretations; seeming evidence for echo chambers disappears after controlling for news media use. (2) SM reliance does not generally stimulate opinion expression. (3) Attitude extremity moderates the effect of SM reliance, suggesting that people with more extreme views are susceptible to echo chamber effects. (4) Attitude position on the issue-at-hand moderates the effect of SM reliance, which suggests that echo chambers do not completely shield their users from the public discourse. We propose the Echo Chamber Continuum (ECCo) Model to stimulate developing the echo chamber metaphor into a theory suitable for studying opinion formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract More than a decade of research in journalism studies on social media has examined how journalists and news organizations have adopted and/or adapted to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and more, surfacing tensions over professional control and normalization. This article advances a conceptual framework for analyzing forms of journalistic norms and practices on social media that takes as its starting point the nature of its platforms, specifically Twitter and Instagram, proposing five analytical dimensions to investigate journalism on social media. They are: 1) structure and design; 2) aesthetics; 3) genre conventions; 4) rhetorical practices; and 5) interaction mechanisms and intentionality. The accounts of five Chilean journalists are used to illustrate how these five dimensions work in the two platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The mechanisms by which users of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter spread misinformation are not well understood. In this study, we argue that the effects of informational uses of social media on political participation are inextricable from its effects on misinformation sharing. That is, political engagement is both a major consequence of using social media for news as well as a key antecedent of sharing misinformation. We test our expectations via a two-wave panel survey of online media users in Chile, a country experiencing information disorders comparable to those of the global North. Analyses of the proposed and alternative causal models with two types of structural equation specifications (fixed effects and autoregressive) support our theoretical model. We close with a discussion on how changes in the way people engage with news and politics – brought about by social media – have produced a new dilemma: how to sustain a citizenry that is enthusiastically politically active, yet not spreading misinformation?",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the increasing use of algorithms in news distribution, commentators warn about its possible impacts on the changing relationship between the news media and news readers. To understand the meaning of news personalisation strategies to users, we investigated how they currently experience news personalisation, perceive their role in the personalisation process, and envision increasing the utility of personalised news by giving users more agency and fostering trust. We conducted four focus groups with online news readers in Germany. For the analysis, grounded theory techniques were suitable due to their applicability in reconstructing user perspectives through their own experiences. We found that (1) users fail to distinguish between news personalisation and commercial targeting, which may negatively bias their perception; (2) there is a contradiction in how users perceive themselves as active participants in the process, but lack the means to exercise agency; (3) user concerns extend beyond privacy to what information they receive and their right to personal autonomy—a solution requires offering users the ability to dynamically adjust their “news interest profiles”; (4) while news personalisation strategies afford new opportunities for introducing reciprocity in the media-audience relationship, negotiating competing logics of journalistic, personal and algorithmic curation remains a challenge.",

    "title": "Encoding the UX: User Interface as a Site of Encounter between Data Journalists and Their Constructed Audiences",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines how data journalism producers encode their audiences’ user experience – or how they construct meaning within the parameters of a user interface. We argue that interfaces enact data journalists’ perceptual image of their audience, and are therefore a meaningful object of study to explore: (a) the relationship between data reporters and their publics; (b) the tensions that emerge from that relationship; and (c) how those tensions are negotiated. Our combined evaluation of producer and artefact perspectives is based on interviews with 12 data journalism producers in legacy UK newsrooms, and interaction design, and multimodal discourse analysis of 12 stories produced by our informants. Findings suggest that data journalism producers’ efforts to create content that resonates with their audiences have resulted in the diversification of data journalism formats, and a more mature view of interactivity, with producers striving to offer experiences in whose meaning negotiation the reader takes centre stage. The reader is perceived as a co-creator of meaning through the expectation of either physical interaction or cognitive immersion. Yet, the paternalistic element, even in the most discovery-/reader-driven stories, remains stronger, manifesting in a carefully crafted experience and pointing to journalism producers’ traditional self-perception as gatekeepers of information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to their potential influence on the individual and societal formation of opinions, the quality of online discussions has been a subject of widespread interest. From a deliberative perspective, rational argumentation and critical reflection are central criteria for good discourse. Drawing on research on the perception of arguments and the conditions of disagreement, we ask how argument strength is linked to the likelihood of receiving (reasoned) disagreement and whether the discussion norms and technical features set by the news organizations moderate this effect. Based on a manual content analysis of 14.690 user comments on nine German news websites, we find that comments with a higher argument strength are more likely to receive disagreement in general and reasoned disagreement in particular. Further, the levels of (reasoned) disagreement are higher on platforms with strong discussion norms and supporting technical features. The results show that the quality of a discussion can be related to both users’ argumentation and the decisions of the news organizations.",

    "title": "Surveillance Normalization and Critique",
    "abstract": "In the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s leaks about “bulk data collection” by the National Security Agency and Government Communications Headquarters, questions about mass surveillance have come to the forefront of public debate. This paper, based on (1) a comprehensive content analysis of newspaper coverage, and (2) interviews with journalists covering stories related to surveillance in the United Kingdom, outlines a key tension between journalists’ self-understandings and practices which has profound consequences. On the one hand, we suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by emphasizing concerns about national security and stressing the surveillance of elites, to the detriment of an interest in the gathering of “bulk data” on populations. On the other hand, journalists, though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical of and resistant to the extent, nature and necessity of mass surveillance. Our paper suggests that despite journalists’ desire to communicate the complexities of mass surveillance, the structural constraints of their professional practice—in particular their reliance on official sources—make it difficult for reporting to move beyond the legitimating discourses provided by these official sources.",

    "title": "Grasping the Digital News User",
    "abstract": "In recent years, people’s news consumption has become increasingly fragmented over different devices, news sources and, especially with the advent of mobile technologies, different situational contexts. This renders a growing part of our (news) media consumption very volatile, even transparent. Journalism scholars are compelled to expand the existing methodological toolset at their disposal if they hope to grasp news audiences’ changing practices. This article investigates the lines along which such a toolset should be conceived. As the digitisation of media and journalism challenges our understanding of news audiences, the article opens by paying considerable attention to the conceptual underpinning of news audiences by revisiting the notion of audience activity in the light of evolving news use practices. This reflection results in an integrated conceptualisation of the term “audience activity”, which in turn makes out a case for adopting “news users” as a more versatile concept to denote people engaging with news. Subsequently, this article addresses how such a more encompassing notion of news users can shape new topical and methodological directions in news audience studies. The article concludes by exploring the current advancements in modular online time use surveys as an illustration of a data-gathering method combining traditional techniques with digital tools to study news users as they cross different devices, platforms, sources and contexts.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly evolving digital technologies across the last two decades have undeniably caused great changes in the field of journalism. The development of online journalism has affected the processes of journalistic work, creating at the same time new techniques and practices. On the internet, search engines still drive a great amount of traffic to news websites. For that reason, factors such as visibility and high ranking on search engines’ results pages remain crucially important for media organizations. Nowadays, journalists or Web editors should be able to write and create appropriate content for the Web. This paper discusses in detail the impact of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) on digital journalism. Through a quantitative analysis, a survey concerning Greek media websites is presented. The aim was twofold: on the one hand, to find out to what extent the use of SEO affects the traffic of a media website whilst, on the other hand, to discover to what degree media professionals in Greece utilize the possibilities given through search engines in order to increase traffic. Finally, a number of SEO elements and practices often used in news content are noted.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the 2016 US presidential election campaign to identify problems with, causes of and solutions to the contemporary fake news phenomenon. To achieve this, we employ textual analysis and feedback from engagement, meetings and panels with technologists, journalists, editors, non-profits, public relations firms, analytics firms and academics during the globally leading technology conference, South-by-South West, in March 2017. We further argue that what is most significant about the contemporary fake news furore is what it portends: the use of personally and emotionally targeted news produced by algo-journalism and what we term “empathic media”. In assessing solutions to this democratically problematic situation, we recommend that greater attention is paid to the role of digital advertising in causing, and combating, both the contemporary fake news phenomenon, and the near-horizon variant of empathically optimised automated fake news.",

    "abstract": "News content analysis is usually preceded by a labour-intensive coding phase, where experts extract key information from news items. The cost of this phase imposes limitations on the sample sizes that can be processed, and therefore to the kind of questions that can be addressed. In this paper we describe an approach that incorporates text-analysis technologies for the automation of some of these tasks, enabling us to analyse data sets that are many orders of magnitude larger than those normally used. The patterns detected by our method include: (1) similarities in writing style among several outlets, which reflect reader demographics; (2) gender imbalance in media content and its relation with topic; (3) the relationship between topic and popularity of articles.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a technology now impacting on many fields, including journalism and mass communication. Also referred to as drones, these small remotely-guided aircraft have gained prominence through their increased use in the hunt for Al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. With increasingly sophisticated navigation systems and dramatically decreased costs, drones are now being purchased and put to use by commercial organizations and private citizens. Traditional journalists and citizen journalists alike are using drones to obtain aerial footage in a variety of locations around the world. The implications for the field of journalism and mass communication are numerous, with practical, theoretical and ethical dimensions. This paper explores these dimensions using an inductive, qualitative approach. This research paper offers a brief history of UAVs, the results of our canvass of cases that could be categorized as drone journalism, the themes that emerge from this case analysis, and an in-depth look at how this technology impacts on journalism and mass communication. Where this new technology fits within surveillance scholarship is also considered.",

Accessing mobile news has gained traction in the everyday life of the public. In parallel, legacy news media have in recent years developed news provision, by repurposing or customising journalistic content published for mobile sites and/or applications. This article explores the production of mobile news, by discussing and synthesising the findings of the contemporary literature found in the nexus of journalism and mobile media. It posits a model of journalism focusing on the roles of humans and technology in activities characterised by customising or repurposing. The article also presents a research agenda focusing on the production of mobile news.",

    "abstract": "To thrive in the digital age, local news outlets must inform audiences and funders of civic-oriented journalism’s impact in their communities. There is little scholarly research on how journalists conceptualize and discuss impact. Literature commonly focuses on non-profit news outlets with a national audience and an investigative bent—an important but small part of the news ecosystem. Through in-depth interviews, this study examines how journalists (n = 20) from varied types of local news organizations (n = 13) in one U.S. city with a diverse news environment define, measure, and discuss their work’s impact. Results show that journalists considered impact as central to their mission, had no qualms about discussing impact with colleagues, but some were hesitant to discuss it outside the newsroom. They defined and measured impact in many ways, including audience analytics and effect-oriented metrics such as audience awareness, public discourse, and public policy. Findings shed light on how journalists view their mission, assess their civic contributions, and perceive professional norms. Ways to expand the definition of measurable journalism are explored.",

Similar studies suggest that journalists covering specialty areas such as health are more likely to experiment with and adopt new forms of practice that break with the traditional tenets of journalism. Through interviews with such journalists, this study explores the perceptions, practices, and drivers of personal branding among journalists. Findings indicate journalists are squarely focused on branding at the individual level (rather than branding the organizations they work for). Journalists cite technological and cultural changes in the profession as giving rise to personal branding. They also describe the tension they feel between their obligation to uphold the traditional tenets of journalism and their perceived need to incorporate more branding into their practice, especially on social media platforms. The findings indicate that journalists may be changing the fundamental elements of branding in at least one way, exchanging the differentiation between themselves and their content for the mutual sharing and co-creation of content with their colleagues and audience.",

    "abstract": "Over two decades ago, Barbie Zelizer argued that journalists should be approached as an “interpretive community” in order to understand the processes through which journalists generate shared meanings around major political events. This article refocuses Zelizer’s concept in order to analyse the consequences of rapid technological transformation, fraught industry conditions, and disparate audience formations in the context of contemporary news media and journalism. Focusing on the challenges faced by professional sport journalists, we invoke the concept of “community of practice” to make sense of this fluid and commercially volatile context, using it to analyse empirically the experiences of journalists in Australia and Scotland. Informed by the interrelationship that exists between formats of news and the practices that produce it, this paper presents evidence drawn from in-depth semi-structured interviews with journalists, editors, news presenters and commentators who specialise in and/or work across newspapers, radio, television, online and mobile media. Understood as a community of practice, sport journalists are shown to be under pressure because of mutually reinforcing changes in mobile and digital media technologies, journalistic routines and institutional relations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing levels of toxicity, harassment, trolling, and doxxing targeting journalists are a global problem that adversely affects journalism and democratic life. This study offers a comparative analysis of journalistic responses to online violence in the United States and Germany, based on 87 interviews and multiple newsroom observations. U.S. journalists typically discussed the problem in individualized terms, with the onus largely perceived to be placed on journalists to protect themselves while maintaining visibility and accessibility. In Germany, journalists typically discussed the problem as a systemic one, with the onus largely perceived to be placed on media organizations to protect staffers. Journalists in Germany thus considered legitimate a variety of obfuscation and avoidance strategies online and offline, while U.S. journalists felt a greater personal responsibility to advocate for the profession. These findings show the contribution of comparative perspectives in studying the global challenge of anti-press violence.

    "abstract": "The protection of fundamental rights, and the human-centric, ethical and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in general is a central ambition of the European AI strategy, with no lesser goal than “spearhead[ing] the development of new ambitious global norms” (European Commission 2021). Like the General Data Protection Regulation before it, the draft AI Act can be expected to set a new tone for the debate around ‘responsible AI’ both within and beyond Europe. It is one of the first attempts worldwide to cut through an increasingly opaque jungle of private and public ethical guidelines in order to formulate binding regulatory standards for what exactly responsible and human-centric AI must mean. The draft AI Act is relevant not only to potential producers and users of AI, but also to a growing community of scholars that is interested in the normative implications of AI and wants to find ways to make the notion of ‘responsible use’ of AI meaningful. Scholars have an important role to play in informing the emerging policies around AI with their insights, as well as studying the consequences once policies are adopted.",

While the linear news models of the past were characterized by delivery of static texts within strict deadlines, contemporary non-linear production practices are characterized by flexibility and constant delivery of “liquid” news. This article presents a method specifically designed for the study of constantly evolving news flows online. Methodologically, the approach entails new opportunities to systematically scrutinize the online news process, using time, duration and positioning of published materials as central variables. Based on an illustrative analysis of the online news flow of the Swedish Public Service Radio, the article gives examples of how such analyses can provide new knowledge about the processes of digital news production.",

Approaching the problem from a socio-technical perspective and using focus groups with Latin American journalists, this study identified the dimensions of social media violence against journalists, and the actors and coping strategies involved in responses to social media violence. This study shows that social media violence against journalists permeates all stages of news production stages. The study also identifies new and changing actors—such as the social media agent provocateur, who, working on behalf of governments and parties, stirs up mob censorship as part of orchestrated online harassment to try to dictate what news is told—, as well as actants, such as messaging apps that journalists use to create support networks. Implications for Latin American journalism are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The voice intelligence industry is an emerging sector of society that involves smart speakers, car information systems, customer service calls to contact centers, and “connected-home” devices such as thermostats, home-security alarms and other tools. Linked to it are advanced machine learning and deep neural network programs that can discriminate prejudicially among individuals in ways that benefit the firms using their voice. This commentary explores the implications of these activities for journalism. For example, combining inferences about an individual’s voice with a raft other information collected about that person might lead to a rearranging of the agendas of news articles, news videos, commercial messages, and even discounts differently for different people on the fly. The rise of voice will likely reshape programmatic advertising marketplaces as well as the more private ways journalism organizations work with a variety of branding engines to identify and persuade prospects. As these pieces of the new environment move into place, it is important for people who care about the future of journalism to consider how an era centering on voice-profiling might shape news agendas individuals receive, commercial messages that come with them, and interrelationships between journalism and commerce.",

    "abstract": "This special issue introductory article investigates contemporary notions of theory in journalism studies. Many scholars have argued that we need better ways of conceptualising what journalism is and how it develops in a digital age. There is, however, a lack of knowledge regarding what the theoretical trends within the interdisciplinary domain of journalism studies are today and to what extent contemporary inquiries into journalism are framed by emerging theories and perspectives. To fill this knowledge gap, we have conducted an analysis of more than 9000 metadata keywords and 195 abstracts found in the first 14 volumes (2000–2013) of the two most internationally acknowledged journals dedicated to journalism studies: Journalism—Theory, Practice and Criticism and Journalism Studies. The findings indicate that there has been a move towards greater theoretical awareness in journalism studies since 2000 and that the variety of theoretical approaches has increased.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital news is progressively blurring with commercial content at the same time that mobile technology is increasingly being used to access news. To understand if these trends affect ability to distinguish news from covert advertising, two experiments were conducted among U.S. adults examining whether viewing content on a mobile device versus computer interacts with motivation levels in affecting recognition of native advertising. Consistent with tenets of the Covert Advertising Recognition and Effects model, results show that although people with greater motivation to process media content were more likely to recognize native advertising, it was not enough to compensate for the greater cognitive effort required when using a mobile device.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholarship has now recognized the potentially detrimental effects of social media on political knowledge. At the same time, a separate but similar line of work has raised concerns that these platforms are the primary vector of political misinformation. Despite the renewed focus on misinformation studies, the question as to whether political knowledge and susceptibility to misinformation are related remains open. If they are indeed related, we still know little about the underlying cognitive mechanisms that drive political learning when people rely on social media for news. Based on a two-wave panel survey collected during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we found that social media news use fosters the news-finds-me perception (particularly among those who feel overwhelmed with the volume of information available on social media). This, in turn, leads people to be both uninformed and misinformed about politics and current affairs. Implications for democracy are discussed.",

The study found that the presence of any directional cues in the news story significantly improved participants’ recall of statistics from the story, but did not improve recall of verbal information. The presence of directional cues also impacted participants’ perceptions of message credibility, but did not impact their narrative transportation, attitudes towards the 360̊ video news story, or sense of presence.

    "title": "The Practice of Data-Driven Journalism in Brazil: Between Disruption and the Reinstatement of Professional Values",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents an analysis of metadiscourses used by professionals and institutions that practice data-driven journalism (DDJ) in Brazil. It aims to understand how they define this practice and seek autonomy within the journalistic field. We conducted an argumentative analysis of editorial texts from 15 news outlets and carried out in-depth interviews with 33 professionals in the field, which allowed us to identify three prevalent metadiscourses: (1) cyberactivism; (2) reinforcing traditional journalistic values; and (3) authority. Using boundary-work as a theoretical basis for the analyses we discovered that all the discourses in these self-referential texts expressed some degree of disruption in DDJ, especially regarding data and its ability to reshape the concept of news transparency and introduce the values and practices of hacktivism in journalism. These discourses also reinforce elements of continuity and suggest a conservative restoration of production routines, values, and conventions in journalism without changing the basic ideology of the profession. Added to highlighting the flexibility and demarcation of this profession’s boundaries, this article also identifies the repertoires and identities mobilized in these processes that give Brazilian data journalism a higher profile.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a synthesised framework for the analysis of data visualisations in the news. Through a close examination of seminal content analyses, their methodologies and findings, this article proposes a framework that consolidates dimensional components of data visualisations previously scattered across this body of research. To transition from incidental and essentialist examinations of visual data artefacts towards a systematic and theory-informed exploration, we consider the diagrammatic dimensions of data visualisations. The offered synthesized framework can serve as a starting point for both theory-infused descriptive purposes as well as more theory-guided explorations. The framework is put to the test by analysing 185 visualisations drawn from award-winning data stories. Findings generated through the application of the framework highlight the varied composition of components of data visualisations, though certain combinations of components are prevalent, leading to static categorical comparisons or interactive spatial localization. After all, data artefacts can be understood as problem-posing elements that are the outcome of diagrammatic thinking that journalists employ to communicate claims.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Few would disagree that AI systems and applications need to be “responsible,” but what is “responsible” and how to answer that question? Answering that question requires a normative perspective on the role of journalistic AI and the values it shall serve. Such a perspective needs to be grounded in a broader normative framework and a thorough understanding of the dynamics and complexities of journalistic AI at the level of people, newsrooms and media markets. This special issue aims to develop such a normative perspective on the use of AI-driven tools in journalism and the role of digital journalism studies in advancing that perspective. The contributions in this special issue combine conceptual, organisational and empirical angles to study the challenges involved in actively using AI to promote editorial values, the powers at play, the role of economic and regulatory conditions, and ways of bridging academic ideals and the messy reality of the real world. This editorial brings the different contributions into conversation, situates them in the broader digital journalism studies scholarship and identifies seven key-take aways.",

    "title": "Newsworkers. A comparative European perspective",
    "abstract": "While constant and accelerated technological evolution contributes to spreading the ideas of complexity and lack of definition in journalism, the intrinsic ability of this field to assimilate changes and adaptations is in fact one of its distinctive features. Professor Henrik Örnebring (Karlstad University, Sweden) reminds us of this on the first page of his book Newsworkers. A Comparative European Perspective, when he paraphrases the British journalists of the thirties decade, Carr and Stevens The need to work towards a precise and close-fitting characterization of journalism today is one of the main assertions and motivations of this book, which is an outstanding research contribution due to its usefulness for updating, with empirical data, the existing knowledge on the influence that institutional change in journalism has on the work and routines of newsrooms. Örnebring opts for a cross-national comparison of contemporary newswork in six European countries and media contexts—Britain, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden. This book is the result of a multi-year research project developed at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism of the University of Oxford. It is presented with great soundness and clarity, organized into eight chapters that perfectly fit the empirical approach employed. The first chapter, which has an introductory character, provides numerous indications and reflections that acquaint the reader with the book’s intentions, while the second chapter provides the theoretical and contextual framework of the research. The third chapter offers a methodological discussion, and presents the structural and thematic axis of the work. Here, Örnebring details an analytical proposal he has proven valid for such studies, and which can be adapted to other case studies with similar aims. This is one of the main contributions of Örnebring’s work. This chapter also proves interesting for obtaining an up-to-date overview of the media landscape of each of the countries considered in the study, which is another of the book’s main contributions. The basic procedural information contained in this chapter is broadened with the inclusion of a methodological appendix where the author provides sampling and other significant analytical information. The following four chapters contain the abundant empirical evidence that Örnebring obtained on the basis of more than 2000 surveys with journalists and 63 qualitative interviews. These chapters are organized according to four interrelated dimensions that represent the main comparative axes of the study: Technology, Skill, Autonomy and Professionalism. This contributes to presenting the main content of the book in a clear and readable way. The inclusion of tables and graphs is also clarifying, bearing in mind the book’s comparative purpose. The first dimension considered by Örnebring, Technology, is without doubt one of the most significant, due to the influence that the introduction of new technologies has exerted on journalism as work and as an institution in a state of permanent adjustment and revision.",

    "title": "Becoming the News: how ordinary people respond to the media spotlight",
    "abstract": "For all of the research on gatekeeping, source-journalist relations, and content analyses that probe questions of news media representation, a surprisingly glaring omission exists in journalism studies and political communication research: scholars talk about news subjects rather than to them. Palmer’s first book addresses this gap through an extensive study on the experiences of news subjects in journalism in “making the news,” as she puts it. Palmer’s area of inquiry is not the news sources of the public figure or household name variety, but the “unknowns” of news, as Gans (1979) would call them. Her aim is to probe at the most general level why people become news subjects, what their experiences with journalist are like, and what happens to them when they become news subjects, not novel questions of themselves, yet surprising nonetheless when considering the lack of scholarly material attempting to address them. Palmer points out this gap in the scholarly literature in a convincing way, arguing that the best that scholars and journalists have relied on is The Journalist and the Murderer, Malcolm’s (1990) standard text profiling abusive power dynamics between journalists and their news subjects. Where scholars have asked news subjects about how they feel about the accuracy of news stories they were in, this has generally been through survey research, with little attention paid to their experiences of being talked to and reported on by journalists. Lazarsfeld and Merton (1948/1960) wrote about the way news media could confer status on people, but an updated, empirical examination about how ordinary people experience being in the news has been sorely needed, especially considering, as Palmer points out, the potentially vast audiences and enduring consequences for an individual’s digital reputation and online presence with online news. What makes Palmer’s work a significant contribution is the way that she has identified a seemingly simple set of questions that for whatever reason, haven’t received much attention. She then provides a detailed accounting of the different stages of news subjects’ experiences with journalists: what prompts them to become a news subject (what Palmer calls a “trigger”), what being interviewed by a journalist feels like, the complexity of seeing oneself in news coverage after the fact, and the aftermath of being in the news. Palmer’s book is well-timed, especially given the conversations around participatory journalism and industry interventions in engaged journalism, as well as widespread concerns about declining trust in journalism. It should be noted that this is an ethnography of news participants—about those who are usually the audience except or until they become news subjects themselves—but it is not an",

It is based upon two comparative studies conducted in 2011 and 2013 involving interviews with reporters, photographers and senior editorial staff, a discussion of the company Twitter guidelines and a content analysis of 27 Twitter accounts. During the research timeframe, Twitter use increased dramatically amongst journalists leading to a clearer set of emerging practices. The data suggest that types of Twitter use are diverse but routine practices are forming in the areas of newsgathering and live reporting, causing a shift in traditional gatekeeping and verification conventions. The notion that journalists primarily use Twitter to drive traffic to their legacy platform is not supported but there is evidence of personal branding and journalists presenting a personalised—but not personal—account of their job via their tweets.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the uses of social media by journalists and their views about these tools in four European countries. It examines how professional variables, namely media sector, length of professional career and size of organisation, influence use of and views about social media. The analysis is based on findings from a questionnaire survey of journalists in Finland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It demonstrates that patterns of uses and opinions, while sharing some features, do vary across the four countries, with UK journalists being the most avid users of social media and those with the most positive attitudes towards these tools. The findings also reveal that influences of the examined professional variables vary and they do not explain overall patterns in social media use and attitudes. Thus, these variables do affect practices in some contexts, but they do not provide an overall explanation of social media appropriation in professional practices. The article argues that journalists, similar to audiences, are increasingly fragmented and their professional practices are influenced by a myriad of different variables.",

And how do j-tweeters deviate from other journalists concerning professional practices and norms? The study draws from a representative large-N mail survey of Swedish journalists. The findings indicate that there are substantive differences in norms and values between the most active j-tweeters and their colleagues concerning the “Twitter-specific” features of interaction and networking and their views on personal branding. On the other hand, as the most active j-tweeters do not deviate on core professional values, it appears that Twitter is being normalized in journalism. However, due to the ongoing generational shift in the newsrooms, the views held by the active j-tweeters could lead to a new professional view on journalism in which audience orientation and professional positioning gain importance.",

    "title": "Hybridity and Social Media Adoption by Journalists",
    "abstract": "This article applies the notion of hybridity to compare social media adoption by journalists in seven countries. Hybridity is operationalised through three constructs: complexity, interdependence and transformative potential. These three constructs frame the international comparison, which is based on empirical data from a survey of journalists (N = 2763) conducted in Canada, Finland, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The analysis found broad similarities between the countries, particularly in relation to widespread use of social media in journalistic practices, the importance of the general public as a source of information online, the high proportion of journalists interacting and responding to comments on social media, and the declining importance of PR sources for a section of the respondents. However, there were differences too between the countries, especially regarding the popularity of particular types of social media, the specific combination of professional tasks social media was used for, and perceptions about the impacts of social media. Overall, the findings illustrate that although country-specific characteristics do produce some differences, the key features of social media adoption are broadly similar in the surveyed countries and in this sense the process is both about integration and fragmentation.",

    "title": "Appreciating News Algorithms: Examining Audiences’ Perceptions to Different News Selection Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Abstract As news selection is increasingly controlled by algorithms, a growing number of scholars are exploring how news recommenders can serve public services. Despite aspirations towards public service algorithms, little is known about which type of news recommender people prefer, let alone about a news recommender that aims to promote societal values. This study aims to give insights into audiences’ perceptions to news recommenders and their underlying news selection mechanisms. To do so, we distinguish between three news selection mechanisms, namely between content-based similarity, collaborative similarity and content-based diversity. The first two strive for similarity, respectively between news content and news users, while the third one aims for diversity in the news content consumed. Results of a large-scale survey (n = 943) show that people prefer content-based similarity over collaborative similarity and content-based diversity. Audience characteristics, such as news information overload and concerns towards missing challenging viewpoints, explain how audiences evaluate the different news selection mechanisms. We discuss how these results align with concerns about selectivity and how news algorithms can be used to tackle these concerns. We therefore introduce the concept ‘personalized diversity’ and promote the idea of news recommenders as an individual filter for the growing abundance of online information.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study sought to theorize the crisis coverage gap, a new way of understanding the divide between public information needs and local digital news coverage during a crisis, through the context of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. We used a three-wave panel survey of Americans (n = 730) and analyses of local news posted on Facebook (n = 2,632) at three points during the early pandemic to illustrate how the crisis coverage gap operates. Findings demonstrate a clear divide between the news the public wanted about the pandemic and what local media delivered on Facebook. Specifically, the media over-delivered economic and business news relative to public interest. It left the public wanting for news about how grocery stores were responding to the pandemic and for fact cheques ascertaining the truthfulness of information about the crisis. Earlier in the pandemic, coverage of schools’ responses was in line with expectations based on how interested people were, but later they were over-covered, relative to interest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mobile news alerts have become an important means for news organizations to develop their relationship with growing mobile audiences. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge about the way audiences experience mobile news alerts and how newsrooms should measure the success of news alerts. This article presents an ethnographic study of the consumption of mobile news alerts. For analyzing the consumption, a value creation approach is introduced as an alternative model that does not address audiences solely as citizens that need information for public good, nor as market-driven entities. Instead, the focus is on understanding audiences as individual customers who create the value of news alerts while using the news services. Furthermore, this article reflects the results of a study of the alert sending practices of a regional newspaper. The findings indicate that while news media still tend to think of customers as a unified group of “readers,” the receivers of news alerts treat their mobile screens as an individual sphere whose information flow should match their personal context and needs. This article brings forth the need among news media for a broader understanding of the consumption of news alerts including developing co-creation activities with customers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely held that journalism, journalists and news all play important roles for democracy and an informed citizenry. News publishers have journalistic authority and are oftentimes seen as one of the most important knowledge-producing institutions in society, routinely carrying out epistemic practices that strive towards producing verified and reliable news about public affairs. The COVID-19 pandemic has forcefully reminded us about this vital information function of the news media, with a surge in traffic to mobile applications and news sites around the world. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is simultaneously crushing the advertising business that plays such a vital role in funding news production. This commentary argues that many journalistic institutions - particularly on the local level - currently face an existential crisis, one that calls for immediate and collective action. With a normative desire of saving journalism, we put forward that society should engage in what we refer to as communal news work as an attempt to financially sustain journalism during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and well into the future.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This commentary reflects on the state of research on data journalism and discusses future directions for this line of work. Drawing on theory in international development and postcolonial studies, we discuss three critical pitfalls that we encourage future scholarship in this area to avoid. These include using a linear model of progress, in which journalists in Majority World nations struggle to ‘catch up’ to their Minority World counterparts because of the ‘obstacles’ they face; reproducing a simplistic split between the ‘West and the Rest’, thus missing the complex interaction of structures operating at different levels; and failing to examine journalistic agency due to an overemphasis on the technical structuring of the ‘tools’ used in data journalism. We also encourage scholars to engage in more comparative work rather than single case studies; increase dialogic communication between scholarship produced in, or about, different parts of the world; and incorporate more diverse methodologies with the aim of building theory. More broadly, we advocate for greater critical reflection upon—if not the challenging of—our dominant modes of thought in order to build more nuanced frameworks for explaining the complex causes, and potentially mixed effects, of data journalism around the world.",

    "abstract": "Previous literature has considered the relevance of Twitter to journalism, for example as a tool for reporters to collect information and for organizations to disseminate news to the public. We consider the reciprocal perspective, carrying out a survey of news media-related content within Twitter. Using a random sample of 1.8 billion tweets over four months in 2014, we look at the distribution of activity across news media and the relative dominance of certain news organizations in terms of relative share of content, the Twitter behavior of news media, the hashtags used in news content versus Twitter as a whole, and the proportion of Twitter activity that is news media-related. We find a small but consistent proportion of Twitter is news media-related (0.8 percent by volume); that news media-related tweets focus on a different set of hashtags than Twitter as a whole, with some hashtags such as those of countries of conflict (Arab Spring countries, Ukraine) reaching over 15 percent of tweets being news media-related; and we find that news organizations’ accounts, across all major organizations, largely use Twitter as a professionalized, one-way communication medium to promote their own reporting. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, we also examine how the proportion of news content varies across topics within 100,000 #Egypt tweets, finding that the relative proportion of news media-related tweets varies vastly across different subtopics. Over-time analysis reveals that news media were among the earliest adopters of certain #Egypt subtopics, providing a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for influence.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the anatomy of leaking in the age of megaleaks based on a series of reconstruction interviews with 108 Israeli reporters, who recreated a sample of leaked versus non-leaked items (N = 845). Data show that leaking remains a journalistic routine, encompassing one in six items; however, they cease to be the sole game of senior sources, involving substantially more non-seniors. Despite new technologies and the mounting number of channels that enable their exposure, leaks remain an oral practice, exchanged mainly over the telephone. On the journalists’ end, there is little change: leaks are the prerogative of more senior and experienced reporters in print and television news; they are still accompanied by more sources, more cross-checking and more consultation with editors than regular items. These findings concur with theories that perceive the relationship between megaleaks and traditional leaks as co-existing rather than disruptive.",

    "abstract": "Approaching journalism history through digital archives, digital sources, and digital methods is a demanding task for media historians, but also offers prospects. We explore some of the challenges and potential benefits in the light of a concrete research project that investigates journalism history in Germany from 1914 to 2014. The project focuses on the development of journalistic news storytelling following the inverted pyramid model. This paper mainly discusses the difficulties of assembling an adequate corpus. The German case is complicated, mainly because the country’s violent history, with two World Wars and two dictatorships, has left several desiderata for historical journalism research. We subdivide a hundred years of journalism history into different phases, and for each of these we discuss different approaches with regard to the availability, accessibility, and usability of sources in digital form. We conclude that digital archives and digital sources open up new techniques for historical journalism research, including methods such as automated content analysis and text mining. Nevertheless, new technological and cultural environments of news pose genuinely new challenges and require new skills and literacies to cope with journalism history through digital archives.",

    "title": "Sharing and Discussing News in Private Social Media Groups",
    "abstract": "Social media platforms are an increasingly dominant medium through which people encounter news in everyday life. Yet while we know more-and-more about frequency of use and sharing, content preferences and network configurations around news use on social media, the social experiences associated with such practices remain relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap to consider if and how news facilitates conversations in everyday contexts where social media play a communicative role. It investigates how people engage with current affairs collectively in different social formations and their associated following, sharing and discussion practices. Specifically, it studies the role of news in six focus groups consisting of people who know each other offline and simultaneously communicate regularly through private Facebook or WhatsApp groups, and who interact primarily in relation to their membership in a particular (1) location-based (2) work-related or (3) leisure-oriented community. It finds that communication within social media communities whose members consider their ties as weak generally tended to be more news-centred. Even more significant was perceived control over privacy and presence of clear norms and community boundaries, which alongside the communicative aims of the group proved important considerations when it came to deciding whether to share news within the community.",

    "title": "Seven Characteristics Defining Online News Formats",
    "abstract": "Whilst live blogs have become an established part of the news media ecology, corresponding research is still in its infancy, especially that which examines the crucial question of sourcing practices. Focussing on three UK news organisations – BBC News, the Guardian and the Telegraph – in this article we provide the largest and most comprehensive empirical study to date comparing sourcing practices in online news and live blogs. We analyse sourcing practices across three different genres of live blogging and corresponding online news articles, through a comparative analysis of events broadly categorised as crisis, politics and sport. Our findings suggest that there are some aspects of sourcing practices that are distinct to live blogs, such as directly embedding social media. However, when it comes to polyvocality (the diversity of who gets to speak), genre-specific journalism norms seem to account for more than the affordances of the platform itself and only in sport live blogs are demotic voices habitually included. Based on these findings, we develop a typology of live blogging and online news articles that documents the nuances in sourcing patterns across different news formats and genres, and provide a theoretical basis for future research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent reports show that users increasingly use smartphone messenger applications such as WhatsApp for news. Media outlets have started to provide news via WhatsApp in addition to other platforms. In journalism scholarship, the routines of messenger app journalism are still little understood. Building on the Diffusions of Innovations theory, this paper explores whether newsrooms treat WhatsApp similar to other social media, which they have used for a longer period of time, or whether they have developed new practices that respect WhatsApp’s roots in mobile and interpersonal communication. Focusing on Germany as a case study and drawing on an analysis of 3745 messages sent to WhatsApp channels of news outlets and on an online survey of journalists working with social media (N = 111), this study shows that journalists utilize the innovative possibilities of WhatsApp for news to a varying degree. While some characteristics of mobile communication are considered in news outlets’ strategies, engagement with the audience is often neglected. The results highlight the challenges for relational innovations in the editorial process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract U.S. newspapers’ digital experiment has been going on for more than two decades, with Christensen’s disruptive technology thesis providing theoretical support for the industry’s digital transformation process. Most newspapers expanded their digital offerings, erecting paywalls since 2011. However, little is known about local newspapers’ paywall results. To extend media economics research on digital news consumption and to assess the influence and practicality of the disruption theory in the context of the newspaper business, this study systematically examines consumer demand for 50 major U.S. newspapers’ multiplatform products through analyzing their circulation and pricing data. Results reveal that they charged digital subscribers a fraction of the print subscription price, but digital subscribership remained small, contributing only 3% of total reader revenue. Digital performance as weak as such raises concerns about the viability of digital subscriptions as a revenue source, provides support for the “online news as an inferior good” thesis, and calls for a reassessment of self-disruption as a practical strategy for newspaper firms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The most immediate and important effects of the coronavirus pandemic concern public health. But the crisis also raises a number of key questions for journalism research. As scholars, we should pause, when so much of our working lives seems thrown out of routine, and critically consider what has brought us, individually and collectively, to this juncture in our research and where we aim to go in the future. I suggest two areas of journalism research that are worth pondering during this period: our objects (what we study) and our objectives (why we study). By honestly acknowledging our shortcomings—for example, in giving overweight attention to certain objects of analysis at the expense of others, or in failing to develop a stronger public voice as part of our scholarly objectives—we can reorient our research agendas to be simultaneously responsive and reflective as we address the current crisis and prepare for the uncertainties ahead. We might take the present situation not simply as an opportune moment to pivot to Covid-19 research and collect real-time data about news and journalism in transition, but also as an invitation to rethink our research enterprise in a much larger and longer-lasting sense.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As news consumption shifts from desktop to mobile devices, many journalism researchers and stakeholders wonder how this transition will impact news audience behavior. This perspective assumes that changes in where news is consumed are likely to go hand-in-hand with changes in how it is consumed. However, key aspects of media consumption tend to remain remarkably stable regardless of where that consumption takes place. Most notably, media audiences typically congregate around a small number of familiar brands, while ignoring the lesser-known options. In this study, I analyze a year’s worth of U.S.-based online news consumption data to show that the mobile platform is yet another example of how a few media firms comprise a majority of audience attention. I conclude that, when it comes to where audiences turn for news, the mobile platform is a continuation of what has come before.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Answers from open-ended questions are a valuable part of journalism surveys. However, due to the expense and difficulties involved in manual coding, the current situation, in which open-ended questions are used and analyzed in large-scale web surveys, is not satisfactory. This article reviews the types, coding tasks, and automatic coding techniques of open-ended questions. We propose a five-step procedure on how to analyze open-ended questions through an automatic coding approach, the process of which is as follows: (a) locate the type of open-ended question, (b) choose the corresponding coding task, (c) adopt the appropriate automatic coding techniques, (d) perform the analysis, and (e) evaluate and interpret the results. We demonstrate this with survey data from Reuters Digital News Reports of 2019. Our proposed framework can serve as a practical guide for analyzing open-ended questions with automatic coding and also promote open science in journalism research. We conclude that although automatic coding cannot entirely replace human coding, the constant refinement of the statistical models and the promotion of open sharing of textual data will gradually render autocoding a standard tool for researchers in journalism and communication.",

We also present a useful heuristic device—the Digital Journalism Studies Compass—anchored around digital and journalism, and continuity and change, as a guide for discussing the direction of the growing field and this journal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the visual objects that are used to either disclose or disguise the commercial nature of native advertising as news articles. We adopt a “material object” approach to explore the potential implications for journalism regarding transparency, trust, and credibility. Methodologically, this study used content analysis covering 21 publications in five countries: Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. We analysed 373 individual native ads. The findings show that news outlets do not follow a consistent way to disclose native ads visually, negotiating the balance between transparency and deception. In this balance, news organizations do not boldly push for transparency and instead remain ambiguous. Our analyses show that both national and organizational characteristics matter when shaping the visual boundaries of journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Online disinformation poses a challenge to democratic societies and has become a prominent issue on the research and political agenda. While many analyses focus on patterns of distribution and reach of disinformation, this article contributes to the analysis of strategies to counter disinformation. Employing a governance perspective, it provides a descriptive analysis of the emerging mix of governance responses in the European system of multilevel governance and on the continuum between market and state. Results of the analysis show that the proliferation of disinformation on social media has developed from a socio-technical mix of platform design, algorithms, human factors and political and commercial incentives. Actors and technologies involved provide a starting point for targets of governance within an accountability network. In practice, national governance responses are uneven across the EU, but individual countries pressing for stronger regulation of internet platforms and a weakening of liability protections. In addition, the European Commission has intensified its efforts to combat disinformation and put additional pressure on platforms to take action and provide some level of transparency. However, clarity about the effects of these measures is blurred by contradicting evidence and barriers for research to access platforms and relevant data.",

We find that journalists self-identify primarily through professional characteristics, but a significant number also mix this with personal information. Yet, they are also wary of providing personal information, with one-third including a disclaimer that their views are their own. Whereas only small differences could be found along gender lines, more significant differences existed in terms of whether journalists worked in metropolitan or regional areas and the nature of their employers’ main platform of distribution.",

    "abstract": "It is axiomatic that a functional public sphere depends on quality information, and the traditional source of that information has been legacy news media, most particularly major metro newspapers. The ongoing contraction of legacy media has led to concerns for the public sphere. Some theorists have placed hope in citizen journalism, including a kind of citizen journalism that takes place on social news sharing sites, as potentially filling some gaps left by shrinking public affairs journalism. However, little research has been conducted to investigate what citizens use as sources of information in discussion on social news sites. In this case study, I conduct a content analysis of links posted in discussions of local public affairs on Seattle’s subreddit r/Seattle to see what information from Seattle’s information ecology discussants are citing and re-posting. Findings show that Seattle Reddit users rely far more on alternative media sources and non-mediated sources, especially government sources, than they do on legacy media, but legacy media is still important in setting the conversation agenda. But Reddit users do not reproduce professional standards of journalism, and establish a limited conversation agenda.",

    "abstract": "The article presents a network analysis of 22,861,013 geocoded external hyperlinks, collected from 230 Danish, 220 Norwegian and 208 Swedish news websites in 2016. The analysis asks what the structural properties of the Scandinavian media systems—including its geography and ownership structures—mean for news outlets’ centrality within the hyperlinked news ecology. The analysis finds that whereas incumbent legacy media occupy central positions, about one third of the network is absent from the hyperlinked interaction, primarily local, independently owned newspapers. A multiple linear regression analysis shows that national distribution and corporate ownership correlates to network centrality more than other predictors. As brokers in the network consist of the large, legacy, capital-based news organisations, hyperlink connectivity is primarily characterised by proximity to the centres of power, corporate ownership, agenda setting incumbency and national distribution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Public service media (PSM) are widely acknowledged as part of the variety of solutions to disinformation. The remit of PSM, formed around values of universality, equality, diversity, accuracy and quality, implies a responsibility to fight disinformation by producing fact-based news content and finding anti-disinformation solutions. In this article, we introduce a framework for assessing how PSM organizations are able to counter disinformation in different contexts. Our normative framework provides a triangulation of contextual factors that determine the role of the PSM organization in the national environment, the activities carried out to fight disinformation and expert assessments of the potential of PSM to reduce the impact of disinformation. The framework is illustrated with analyses of PSM from the Czech Republic (CZE), Finland, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nearly half a century since the first calls for comparisons of national-level media-political relations, comparative studies of media systems – and even more so of digital journalism – are still an emergent research field. In this introduction to the special issue ‘Comparing Digital Journalisms across Nations and Cultures’, we draw links between media systems and digital journalism(s) in comparative studies. First, we suggest a ‘systemic turn’ in media systems studies, with various branches of systems theory applied to media studies in a sound way; directing comparative studies to seeking systemic stability of journalism along with assessing its democratic performance; dealing more with contexts; and finding new criteria for cross-country comparisons. Second, we argue that, for digital journalisms as multi-level research objects, the systemic perspective intertwines with the epistemic one of truth-seeking and cultures of media professionalism. Third, we show how this logic is supported by the articles in the special issue which assess the impact of de-industrialization upon media performance and compare journalistic roles across nations and media segments. They also draw attention to audience as a major new comparative criterion, rethink nation-state as the level of analysis, and highlight risk as a new dimension of comparing digital journalism(s).",

    "title": "The Marketplace of Attention: How Audiences Take Shape in a Digital Age",
    "abstract": "How media users distribute their attention is intimately tied to the health of the dialogue that a society is able to sustain with itself. This has long been a central issue in media and journalism studies and has gained renewed significance in relation to the rise of digital media. With digital technology, getting the attention of media users is simultaneously easier and more difficult: easier since almost everybody can create and distribute content, more difficult because such low barriers of entry create an abundance of content competing for attention. What this means for the cohesiveness of society and its ability to focus on matters of common concern is the question that drives James G. Webster’s The Marketplace of Attention. Webster approaches this by breaking up the marketplace into its constituent elements: media users (Chapter 2); the media (Chapter 3); media measures (Chapter 4) after which he discusses audience formations based on “hard evidence” (Chapter 5), which here means TV meter and “server-generated data” that “can measure exposure with a considerable accuracy” (p. 97). Chapter 6 reassembles the insights of the preceding chapters in what he calls a “novel theoretical framework for thinking about the marketplace” (p. 10). In the final chapter, Webster weighs the various arguments and findings of the book in order to decide whether “digital media [will] liberate us to achieve our fullest potential ... or tear us apart” (p. 2). But before getting to where Webster puts his money, it is important to draw out in a bit more detail how he builds his argument. Webster’s approach is to present and discuss major positions and evidence on the constituent elements of the marketplace in order to see what these can tell us about its overall health. The chapters on media users, media, media measures and audience formations thus produce a range of relevant syntheses and discussions of a relatively wide range of research and commentary. Yet most of this is hardly new. What is new is Webster’s attempt to draw on these insights “to develop a more comprehensive and dynamic model of how the market of attention is constructed” (p. 129). At the centre of this is Anthony Giddens’ notion of “structuration”, which is seen as “a useful way to organize the material we’ve encountered into a unified framework” (p. 129). This results in worthwhile discussions of notions of “obtrusive” and “unobtrusive structures” as well as “endogenous” and “exogenous preferences” before tying the various elements together in a broad but useful heuristic framework for thinking about some of the relations between agency and structure in the formation of public attention. After that, Webster ends by applying “our knowledge of audiences—theoretical and empirical—to suggest what might actually happen” (p. 147). Here, he returns to some of the arguments for either a “healthy” or a “weakened” marketplace. The fact that “large minorities of the adult population are uninterested in news” (p. 161) is here countered by",

    "abstract": "During its period of rapid growth, data journalism was poised to position journalism as society’s watchdog once again. But despite eager predictions, its rate of adoption outside large news organisations remains low, limiting the consolidation of data journalism to a normative practice. Through Scenario Network Mapping, this article seeks to outline the possible futures of data journalism practice by determining its sustainability in the current climate of journalism austerity. Results suggest three possible scenarios: (1) As a skillset, data journalism will soon be regarded as essential for every professional journalist. (2) As a genre, data journalism will remain a niche storytelling format but will ultimately find its way into smaller newsrooms due to decreasing limitations. (3) Due to financial and personnel limitations, data journalism will be abandoned by the mainstream media, who will outsource data analysis to non-legacy actors. Within this context, it remains to be seen whether data journalism can continue innovating in order to remain competitive in the constantly evolving ecosystem of today’s news production.",

    "title": "WikiLeaks: news in the networked era",
    "abstract": "The book WikiLeaks: news in the networked era by Charlie Beckett and James Ball is an excellent book offering a systematic documentation on the history of WikiLeaks and the controversial role of the founder, Julian Assange. The destiny of Assange and WikiLeaks are closely linked. One of many uncertainties for the future of WikiLeaks is linked to the outcome of the criminal investigation over the alleged sexual abuse by Assange towards two Swedish women. The authors wisely choose not to go into the details of the case, since the legal case is ongoing, and since the issue of Assange’s possible abuse is irrelevant for the main topic of the book: the future of journalism in the age of internet. The book is more than an account of the different phases of WikiLeaks history, created through the major known leaks such as “The Afghan war logs”, “The Iraq war logs” and “Embassy cables”. For journalism teachers and academics working in the field of journalism, the phenomena WikiLeaks is analysed in a wider context as a challenge to traditional journalism. As such it is also a part of more comprehensive debate related to internet and social media in general. Starting out as an experiment with limited impact, the breakthrough for WikiLeaks came in April 2010 with the publication of the “The Collateral Murder” video, filmed by the crew of an American Apache helicopter as they shot a group of Iraqis—including two Reuters employees. The source who gave them access to this as well as most of the other hundreds of thousands of documents most probably was Bradley Manning, an American soldier, arrested in May 2010 on suspicion of having passed restricted material to WikiLeaks. The video was edited by the WikiLeaks staff in a manner that raised the question on whether circumstances around the publication could be labelled as journalism. WikiLeaks operates in the borderline between being a collection of sources and journalism. This is exemplified by the Kenyan leak, dealing with the serious nature of corruption in Kenya’s national elite; stories the Kenyan media did not have access to, or did not feel able to make public for fear of reprisal. When it was published it had an introduction written by WikiLeaks staff, offering a political context for the document. As I read it, the authors Charlie Beckett and James Ball are not preoccupied with what to call WikiLeaks but to explain its function:",

    "title": "Journalism beyond the Coup: Emerging Forms of Digital Journalism Practices in Post-Coup Zimbabwe",
    "abstract": "Abstract Utilizing a constellation of conceptual tenets drawn from critical digital technology theory, field theory and concepts of digital democracy, this article argues that the post-coup period in Zimbabwe has solidified digital journalism practices in three main ways. These are: (i) the consolidation of a digital leak journalism culture, (ii) an increasingly ferocious form of digital guerrilla journalism, and (iii) the rise in popularity, of small digital-based news platforms that, arguably, are increasingly eclipsing already established mainstream (digital) news platforms as sources of news. These practices’ nascent roots have their genesis in the early 2000 period. In the post-coup context, they have assumed a new and wider meaning, and have become part of the mainstream. This solidification of digital journalism practices has consequently enabled journalists to “speak back” to power by providing robust forms of investigative journalism, and simultaneously avoiding being ‘swallowed’ by the state. While we admit to various gradations of digital journalism practices before the coup, we use the coup as our point of departure in order to factor in the incrementally disruptive and repressive political environment that has forced journalists to adopt digital journalism practices more than in any period of the country’s history.",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "abstract": "In the aftermath of the South Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004, the term “citizen journalism” quickly gained currency, with news organisations finding themselves in the awkward position of being largely dependent on “amateur content” to tell the story of what had transpired on the ground that day in the most severely affected areas. Despite its ambiguities, the term was widely perceived to capture something of the countervailing ethos of the ordinary person’s capacity to bear witness, thereby providing commentators with a useful label to characterise an ostensibly new genre of reportage. While “eyewitness” testimony has long featured in news coverage, the remarkable range of first-person accounts by those who happened to be on the scene (Western holidaymakers, in many instances) appearing in online journals or “weblogs” on personal webpages, together with harrowing imagery recorded via digital cameras or video camcorders, was widely prized for making a vital contribution. One newspaper headline after the next declared citizen journalism to be yet another startling upheaval, if not outright revolution, ushered into view by internet technology. “Your readers and viewers were also your correspondents. Your ability to be in touch was digital as well as conventional”, Peter Preston (2005) of the Observer maintained one week later. “That is a quantum shift, however you phrase it: the world shrinks in an instant. And foreign news desks, maybe, will never be the same again.” In the months to follow, “citizen journalism” secured its place in the news professional’s lexicon, effectively affirming the rapidly forming consensus that what counted as journalism—and who could lay claim to being a journalist—was being decisively recast. The recent 10-year anniversary afforded a vantage point from which to pause and reassess what lessons were learned from “the deadliest tsunami in recorded history”, as it was widely described in the press, particularly with regard to co-ordinating the logistics of emergency disaster relief and crisis communication. Some experts warned the passage of time meant disaster preparation was in a state of decline; memories were gradually fading. “Disaster amnesia”, as the United Nation’s Margareta Wahlstroem called it, threatened to lower defences. “You relax, and that’s dangerous”, she pointed out. “One of the big challenges in reducing disaster-risk is to keep alive this understanding” (cited in Jha and Promyamyai 2014). Playing their part in this regard, several news organisations turned the anniversary into a news peg, reminding today’s publics in frequently heart-rending detail about the human devastation left in the tsunami’s wake. “Ten years have elapsed”, T. Ahmad Dadek (2014) wrote in a guest column for The Jakarta Post, but it remained fresh in his mind how: “on that fateful day, hysteria, screams and panic overwhelmed me and other people around the mosque on which we pinned all our hopes, as an earthquake and tsunami not only engulfed us but also overturned our reason and logic.” Survivor testimony was similarly",

By critically analyzing our collective experiences of and responses to the global health crisis as related to journalism, which range from data-driven news production, to existing and emergent threats to press freedom, to misinformation and conspiracy theories, to individuals’ news use as well as news avoidance, this special issue highlights the key issues in journalism and journalism scholarship in times of extremely high epistemic uncertainty and ambiguity. After briefly reviewing several noteworthy aspects of the research presented in the current issue, I propose several directions in which future research can extend, refine, and advance the findings as well as research agendas reported herein.",

    "title": "Locating The Journalism in Citizen Photojournalism",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of cameras on cellphones and access to high-quality digital cameras has increased the ability of average citizens to capture and share photographs and video. The inclusion of user-generated visual content by news organizations, especially at a time of newsroom contraction, has been a source of consternation for professional photojournalists, who have emphasized their professional training and skill. Though scholars have explored the perceptions photojournalists and citizen photographers have of photojournalism and of each other, little attention so far has been directed to the visual content of citizen photojournalism, the extent to which it adheres to established photojournalism conventions, and its incorporation by mainstream news organizations. This research addresses this absence. Drawing on a content analysis of user-generated images, this study finds that in a situation involving coverage of an ongoing story of significant impact in a community, there was little citizen photojournalism presented within the mainstream coverage. Further analysis reveals that while there is some overlap between events captured by professional and citizen photojournalists, the photographs made by citizens do not generally reflect the aesthetic standards expected of professionals. The results begin to provide practical examination of conceptual concerns expressed by photojournalists regarding the use of citizen-generated content.",

    "title": "Slow Journalism",
    "abstract": "When Bob Franklin asked me whether I thought there was potential interest in the topic of slow journalism for a special issue of Journalism Practice I was keen to send out a call for papers to see what fish might be in that sea. But I was quietly sceptical that the haul could fill an issue. The response was surprising; a sizeable catch of enough quality abstracts, from scholars in many countries, to fill not just an issue of Journalism Practice but an issue of Digital Journalism as well. While “Slow Journalism” as a term has only had a sketchy existence over the past 10 years, and more so in media than in scholarship, it appears that the concept has traction. Many scholars and practitioners internationally have been thinking critically about the problems wrought by speed, and are utilising the concept of “slow” to explain a new way of thinking about and producing journalism. My contribution to the development of the scholarly understanding of slow journalism was an article published in Journalism Practice in 2015, “What is Slow Journalism?” The title, a question, was perhaps misleading in suggesting there could be a firm answer. As I wrote, “this journalism does not require a checklist of key characteristics to qualify as Slow. The term, like the Slow movement itself, is more a critical orientation to the effects of speed on the practice of journalism” (Le Masurier 2015, 143). Slow Journalism is not prescriptive, but those practitioners who use the term to describe their work, and those journalists whose work embodies the spirit of the term, are all producing journalism that enacts a critique of the limitations and dangers of the speed of much of the mainstream contemporary journalistic environment. This is why the concept of Slow Journalism has emerged now, and seems to carry such appeal, even though there have been types of journalism produced and consumed slowly for centuries. What is new is the context of hyper-acceleration and over-production of journalism, where quality has suffered, ethics are compromised and user attention has eroded. The ethical problems that have surfaced in journalism across the past decade, with greater importance and urgency than ever, provides the context for the emergence of slow journalism as a consciously ethical practice. The need for speed and the capitalist news ethic of beating the competition have left many asking if there is another way to practise journalism. The emergence of Slow Journalism suggests that there is. Also new are the self-reflexivity of journalists and the emergence of new media outlets that are embracing slow, and experimenting with new business models to fund their practice. Slow Journalism is a new term for new times. In the opening article of Journalism Practice, Erik Neveu (2016) explores the utility of the concept slow journalism “to work as a shorthand description of the variety of",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article is an exploratory study of the influence of beat and employment status on the information security culture of journalism (security-related values, mental models, and practices that are shared across the profession). The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 journalists based in Canada in staff or freelance positions working on investigative or non-investigative beats. We find that journalism has a multitude of security cultures that are influenced by beat and employment status. The perceived need for information security is tied to perceptions of sensitivity for a particular story or source. Beat affects how journalists perceive and experience information security threats. Investigative journalists are concerned with surveillance and legal threats from state actors including law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Non-investigative journalists are more concerned with surveillance, harassment, and legal actions from companies or individuals. Employment status influences the perceived ability of journalists to effectively implement information security. Based on these results we discuss how journalists and news organisations can develop effective security cultures and raise information security standards.",

    "title": "The State Of Sport Photojournalism",
    "abstract": "Based on a global survey of photojournalism and case studies of recent transformations in the use of photography in sport, this paper critically analyses current professional practices of sport photojournalists focusing on the contemporary challenges faced by this industry. Rhetoric proclaiming the death of the photographer in the age of video technology and self-mass communication of digital photographs has presented a major challenge to the survival of photographers and photography as a professional practice in news media. In the specific field of sport photojournalism, photographers have faced added challenges of accreditation to sport with the selective access to sporting venues or events through commercial licensing of “preferred media partners” and increasing management of “image rights” and anti-piracy measures. This has occurred at a time when sport images and the digital distribution of sporting images are greater than ever. The data for this article are taken from a World Press Photo Foundation–University of Stirling longitudinal project on photojournalism and represents the views and experiences of over 700 photographers who are engaged in sports photojournalism.",

    "abstract": "In this paper I explore the lot of the press photographer in today’s converged newsrooms, where both formats and roles have merged. Since journalists are now typically required to capture images as well as words, and images are increasingly being sourced from the public, especially for publication online, questions arise concerning both the role of the professional photographer as well as the implications for professional competence and image quality. The focus in this paper is on the online news gallery, a space that has the potential for compelling and innovative visual storytelling through sequences of images. Using semiotic analysis, I explore online news galleries from two English-language news outlets, The Guardian in the United Kingdom and the Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, for visual cohesion between images, and for image quality. The findings suggest wildly disparate practices, often displaying little, if any, concern for rhetorical structure, image quality, or even the number of images in a gallery. If, as Picard states, news organisations are to create value in their products, they need to place more emphasis on their editing and packaging activities to produce coherent and manageable stories and provide knowledge that services users’ needs.",

    "abstract": "Open curtains and a careless attitude. The Dutch are described as holding an indifferent stance towards privacy in the aftermath of Snowden’s revelations of far-reaching government surveillance. But are Dutch reactions as aloof as often claimed? This study provides an in-depth overview of privacy attitudes in the Dutch debate about the National Security Agency (NSA) leaks, showing a greater variety of sentiments than anticipated. A qualitative frame analysis and a quantitative descriptive analysis resulted in six frames, which convey distinct privacy attitudes. Online and offline as well as professional and non-journalistic content in the debate displays a different distribution of frames. The frames, ranging from an “End justifies the means” attitude to an anxious fear of an “Orwellian dystopia”, are placed in a larger framework as the research demonstrates the connection to existing theories about privacy and surveillance. Dutch discussions about the NSA revelations often display a trade-off narrative balancing safety against privacy, and include (de)legitimisation strategies. These outcomes are in line with previous studies about mediated surveillance debates, which indicates that privacy attitudes transcend national boundaries. However, the inclusion of user-generated content adds an individual dimension to the existing body of research and reveals a personal perspective on surveillance issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In digitized media environments, users can access news from all over the world. The internationalization of news consumption is intensified by social media like Twitter, as users share news from different countries. In our study, we combine the two strands of research about media repertoires as well as transnational news consumption. Switzerland is a compelling case with regard to transnational news consumption as media outlets in the three official languages, German, French, and Italian can reach audiences in the larger neighbouring countries of Germany, France, and Italy. To investigate transnational news consumption, we tracked URL shares of Swiss online news media websites for two months on Twitter. We then combined this data with the users’ followee structures in the Twitter network (n = 355,197 tweets, n = 64,170 unique users) and inductively detected domestic and foreign audience communities with social network analysis. Thus, we were able to identify and compare the Twitter news media repertoires of domestic and foreign audience communities. Regarding transnational usage patterns, we show that especially quality media brands continuously reach audience communities in neighbouring countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mob censorship, which “expresses the will of ordinary citizens to exert power over journalists through discursive violence” is traditionally considered a grassroots phenomenon. However, within technically mediated systems, who is behind the mob is sometimes unclear. We therefore ask how the technical affordances of the Internet and telecommunications networks complicate the identification of attackers and their motivations and multiply the forms of retaliation that attackers level against journalists. We conducted 18 semistructured interviews with seven current or former journalists, as well as 11 professionals with experience defending news organizations, including security specialists, press freedom advocates, and newsroom infrastructure support staff. Through a constructivist grounded theory approach and in conversation with Lewis and Westlund’s (2015) 4A framework, we found that journalists and those defending news organizations do not reliably identify sources and motivations behind attacks, which may be grassroots in nature but may also be instigated by corporate or government actors. Journalists nonetheless infer attribution and motivation from the context surrounding attacks. Systemic issues related to the lack of diversity, ongoing financial constraints, and journalistic norms of engagement, alongside a lack of internal and platform support, exacerbate repercussions from these attacks and harm journalism’s role in a democracy.",

    "abstract": "News and journalism practices are undergoing complex changes under the influence of technology. As the internet facilitates new ways of collecting and reporting information, conceptions of journalistic identity based on normative values such as objectivity, impartiality and gatekeeping are being contested. These ideals have become a central reference point in empirical evaluations of technological innovations in journalism cultures. However, as they are engrained in Western models of news production, they often mask the nuances that exist in the appropriation of the internet in different locales. In order to offer a better understanding of online technologies as they are adapted in different cultures, online journalism research can benefit from more conceptual clarity in defining journalism culture. We argue that such clarity can assist in capturing the complexity of online journalism as the outcome of profound changes taking place in different societies. We aim to contribute to current debates by borrowing an existing theoretical conceptualization of journalism culture to explore online journalism in Greece. Through interviews with professional journalists, we show the nuances of online journalism as this evolves through a dynamic interaction between technology and local contingencies in a climate of financial uncertainty.",

    "title": "Sports Journalism, Supporters and new Technologies",
    "abstract": "Grounded on the analysis of the campaign #ForaRicardoTeixeira (Get Out Ricardo Teixeira), this article investigates how supporters have used new technologies to challenge controversial decisions of media outlets that hold sports broadcast rights in not covering or under-reporting the severity of scandals involving sports governing bodies and leaders. Adopting a combination of political economy and discursive analysis, this work explores how the interplay between media system and football industry in Brazil led to the perpetuation of a complicity relationship between the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) and Grupo Globo, broadcast rights holder of the main football events since the 1970s in Brazil. Such complicity guaranteed that many corruption allegations against Teixeira during his 23 years running CBF received little attention in the news programming of Globo. In 2011, when the company decided not to cover the ISL case (at that time a still ongoing Swiss investigation that implicated Teixeira in an extensive scheme of corruption and bribery), Brazilian supporters organised themselves to create the campaign, which for many observers was indeed one of the factors that pressed Teixeira to resign from his post in 2012. The campaign had several merits, including its effective use of decentralised media production tools. However, its main pitfall was its personalised focus on Teixeira, which prevented a broader thematisation of the structural problems of football.",

    "abstract": "to the last of these is that “African American, white, female, Republican, Independent, and ideological conservative Millennials may be less likely to consume news because they view it as negative, uncaring, biased, and without value” (p. 90). The analysis builds on primary data collected by the author in the United States. However, there is an issue that some arguments are too technologically deterministic and the evidence provided focuses too much on newspapers and newspaper consumption as the key indicator of news engagement. The book does refer to other forms of news media, but it would have been useful to explore in more detail how news forms and the concept of news are changing for the different generations and whether news values as a result are changing too. This book provides an interesting, if complex, model for the myriad factors that influence the Millennial Generation’s news engagement after the emergence of social media. These factors, the author believes, “will determine whether we will be a society of news consumers who believe being informed is important or a nation in which news illiteracy is the norm” (p. xii). Indeed the book warns of dire consequences for society if “news consumers are extinct and being informed of news is no longer valued” (p. xii). Long-term implications of this generation’s non-engagement with news could be serious for the news industry, society and democracy. But the author argues that the trends in the declining news engagement of the Millennial Generations can be reversed and she presents a sort of manifesto of what stakeholders need to do to achieve this (summary p. 112 and in detail Chapter 7). The 14-point manifesto lists, for example: “Stakeholders must admit problem exists”, “Stakeholders must acknowledge problem matters”, “Legacy news media must become engaged”, “Social media and search engines must intervene”, “Parents need to do more” and “Millennials have a responsibility, too” (p. 112). These are noble aims but less is said about how they can be achieved and what the driving forces would be for their realisation. This book raises important questions, provides interesting primary data and is a useful contribution to the debate on changing news engagement. Given the complexity of the subject area and ongoing shifts in news consumptions, however, more research is needed on the topic to fully understand these changes.",

Actors producing relevant information for the debates in the public sphere multiply and the relationships they establish in online spaces such as social media, among them and with journalists and the public, shape what is considered to be news and journalism in any given moment. This article traces the positions in the field of journalism in the city of Brussels, putting professional journalists in the context of the broader community, in order to identify the diversity of actors active in the production of information. A controversy concerning multiculturalism in Brussels serves as a case study. Discourse analysis of the news about the topic and interviews with professional journalists were used to trace the diversity of actors involved in producing narratives about that specific event. Journalists in mainstream media defend a hegemonic position in the construction of the news narrative of the event by dismissing alternative voices to the trusted institutional ones and not recognising the role of community media.",

    "abstract": "Research on the evolution of journalism is still lacking appropriate theoretical tools to (re)conceptualise the blurring boundaries between professional news production in the media industry, the public actively engaged in using, circulating and producing information, and the diversity of social and material actors involved in these processes. This article suggests how actor-network theory (ANT) can contribute to overcome the limitations of existing paradigms in journalism studies through three complementary moves: dissociating news practices from specific theoretical categories, overcoming the disciplinary divide between the analysis of news production and news consumption, and problematising normative principles of journalism. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical challenges and methodological strategies researchers may need to address when using ANT to trace news networks: the practices performed by a remarkable diversity of actors for the production, circulation and use of news.",

    "abstract": "During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the routines of face-to-face news gathering and newsroom interaction were severely disrupted by the new normal of physical distancing and remote work. So far, journalism scholars have addressed news production, performance, employment and mental health, among other topics, but not the mobilities and immobilities of journalists during this period. Taking this into account, this article studies the perceptions and experiences on the new normal of the award-winning news workers employed by digital-born or digital-only news organizations in the country that ranks fourth in the world in deaths of journalists from COVID-19, Mexico. Drawing on sociological perspectives on mobility and risk, as well as on semi-structured interviews, its emphasis is on their physical and virtual mobilities and immobilities. The analysis exhibits how different forms of capital enabled and disabled the movement of this population, and how this was mediated by risk. Its objective is not only to examine how did these news workers coped with the new normal, but to analyze how they exerted their journalistic and mobility capitals to alter their working conditions, professional practices and personal lives during the pandemic and beyond. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

As that book was going to press, the news industry was still optimistic that sponsored content —in particular, the native advertising produced by boutique ‘content studios’ at newsrooms around the globe — would serve as a robust alternative revenue stream for prestige publications. Over the past three years, these hopes have faded somewhat. Content studios are still around, but their limitations are becoming clear and news outlets (somewhat predictably) have set their sights on still other sources of revenue.",

    "title": "The Emergence of Second-Screen Gatekeeping",
    "abstract": "Legacy media have recently started to include material from social network sites in televised events, including election debates, to enhance the viewing experience of users and to enable interactions between viewers and political candidates. Decisions about which material and which users to include on the screen comprise a new arena for the gatekeeping function of the established media. In this paper, I introduce the concept of second-screen gatekeeping as a theoretical framework for understanding the gatekeeping practice taking place between the first and the second screens. To examine this emergent practice of second-screen gatekeeping, the paper introduces an empirical study of the selection process of material from social network sites in the live-broadcast election debates on Denmark’s two leading television channels, the public service institution DR1 and the commercial station TV2, in the run-up to the European elections in Denmark in 2014, drawing on both qualitative interviews with the individuals responsible for selecting material as well as a quantitative analyses of the distribution of content in the debates. A content analysis of updates from social network sites referenced in the two debates is presented that suggests differences in the selection practices of the two institutions in relation to the thematic content of the updates as well as in terms of which types of users that were referenced on the screen. The findings here testify to the continued centrality of traditional criteria of newsworthiness as well as gatekeepers more generally who continue to exercise control over which content is “fit to the screen”.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surveying journalists in Vietnam, a socialist-communist country, this study attempts to bring insights into the effects of digital platforms on newsroom practices. Specifically, it looks at how journalists from mainstream news media organizations routinize the use of Facebook for various professional purposes. Additionally, this research examines journalists’ role conceptions and how these values influence news workers’ use of Facebook. Its findings show that journalists in this Southeast Asian country are embracing Facebook in their reporting, understanding audience, and branding. Results also indicate that the two important predictors of journalists’ Facebook use for work are the interpretive and populist-mobilizer functions of the news media. Theoretical implications of those findings are discussed in the context of a socialist-communist media system.",

SecureDrop, an open-source software for operating whistleblowing platforms, is now a common component of the toolboxes of journalists willing to work with stronger levels of security, especially in regard to source protection. By means of a content analysis of publicly available documents and semi-structured interviews with journalists using the software, this article looks at news organizations’ uses of SecureDrop, journalists’ perceptions of the software's strengths and limitations, and the accountability practices adopted by news organizations in regard to their use of SecureDrop. Overall, this article contributes to the understanding of how SecureDrop and information security in general are entering the journalistic field and becoming accepted journalistic practices.",

    "title": "AMATEUR SOURCES BREAKING THE NEWS, METASOURCES AUTHORIZING THE NEWS OF GADDAFI’S DEATH",
    "abstract": "This article takes its point of departure in the thesis that today’s global, digitalized and convergent media environment has promoted new patterns of information gathering and dissemination within journalism, and war journalism in particular, which involve changing forms and various degrees of interplay between elite and non-elite sources as well as media professionals and amateur sources. On account of their proximity to unfolding events, amateur sources often break the news by means of raw and fragmented bits of visual and verbal information. Elite sources rarely possess the same exclusive access to information from war zones, but are instead brought in to comment on, validate and grant legitimacy to amateur sources as a form of explicit source criticism that we would like to term metasourcing. This new pattern of information gathering and sourcing within war reporting manifests itself most clearly in cases of major international news events, which render visible the multitude of sources and the speed of information production and distribution. A recent example is the capture and subsequent death of Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of the sources included by selected newspapers to report on this event, the current article investigates the following research questions: Which types of sources are brought into play in the news coverage of Gaddafi’s death, and which forms of interplay between sources in today’s globalized and convergent media landscape are indicated by this case?",

    "abstract": "Archived webpages are a critical source of data for understanding the current state of the news media industry, as well as how the industry has changed over time. Dramatic changes in the news media industry in recent decades have occurred in tandem with the evolution on the Web. Archived webpages are valuable records for understanding and analyzing how newspaper companies have adapted to technological changes such as social media feeds and sharing of news content via Twitter. This article outlines a methodological approach to utilizing Web archives as a means of examining change in the news media industry. Researchers have developed new tools to improve researcher access to archived Web data in order to advance studies of the Web, and to enable the tracking of changes in news media as they emerge over time. A case study examining local news in the United States is used to illustrate the methodological challenges and promise of working with these data, highlighting the power and potential of Web archives for journalism research. Finally, the closing sections discuss challenges associated with the scale and scope of archived Web data and point to new areas for future research.",

    "title": "Journalism: Mirror on a “Decaying” Arab World",
    "abstract": "For Arab journalism, the decade since the Arab Spring has been grim. As I will outline in this article, the gains made in the years leading to the uprising have been lost. Arab journalism today is less free than at any time since the founding of Al Jazeera in 1995. The grip governments hold over the Arab media is at least as iron-fisted as at any time in modern history. And the physical threat to journalists is at historic levels. The October issue of the Journal of Democracy carries an article titled, “Why Sudan Succeeded Where Algeria Failed.” A military coup just weeks after that issue was published underlined the fragility of democracy – or, in Sudan’s case, near-democracy – in the Arab world. In her defense, author Sharan Grewal was writing about the events that led to the 2019 ouster of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir, not predicting what would come next. In the process, she made a critical point: “[E]ven massive, nonviolent uprisings that succeed in ousting a dictator do not automatically produce transitions to democracy” (Grewal 2021, 103). We didn’t need the Sudanese coup to remind us of that. The bittersweet anniversary of the Arab Spring is all the reminder we needed. And as democracies are undermined, so too is the free press. The recent history of Arab journalism is vivid evidence. The years leading up to that tumultuous era were ripe with promise. As the director of the Arab world’s leading journalism training center at the time, I had a front-row seat to the revolution in Arab journalism. Across the region, reporters and editors were pushing against, and in some cases shredding, the “red lines” that had long encircled controversial topics authoritarian regimes had decreed to be off-limits, inspired in part by the “truth to power” ethos of Al Jazeera in the years before it became an overt tool of Qatari foreign policy. Meanwhile, a small cadre of activistbloggers, led by young Egyptians like Wael Abbas and Alaa Abdel Fattah, posted reports and videos revealing police torture and government abuse, creating safe space for the mainstream media to report on those forbidden topics, and inspiring bloggers from Morocco to Yemen. Media are one of the first victims of resurgent authoritarianism, for obvious reasons. As a recent study of the nexus between democracy and media freedom reported, attacks on the media are often the “canary in the coalmine” that predict the erosion of democratic principles, and in the examples studied by the researchers, media freedoms dropped “precipitously” once the democratic “dominoes began the fall”",

    "abstract": "Scholarship about social media in general, and Twitter in particular, has increased dramatically in recent years as adoption by individuals and institutions has burgeoned; especially by journalists and media organisations. Much of the journalism research on Twitter has focused on the dynamics of professional news practices on the social media platform, with journalism considered as a cultural field of production. This paper considers Twitter as a networked communication space that results in a hybridity of old and new frames, values and approaches. It highlights research that points to the hybrid and innovative forms of news production on open, networked platforms, suggesting new paradigms of journalism at play that break with classic narrative structures and deviate from long-held and fiercely defended norms.",

The author finds that WikiLeaks’ lasting impact on journalism has been on forcing the profession to confront its own definitional crisis; drawing awareness to persistent legal issues facing journalists in the digital age; and in revealing the complexity of global information flows.",

    "abstract": "We live in a “surveillance society”—a society organised around the collection, recording, storage, analysis and application of data on individuals and groups by state and corporate actors (Lyon 2001, 2007). As Edward Snowden’s revelations about the extensive surveillance programmes of the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the United Kingdom revealed, intelligence agencies routinely gather vast amounts of data about our activities. The programmes revealed by Snowden ranged from the interception of data shared on the internet to practices of hacking into computer systems and compromising security levels. They encompassed the bulk collection of everyone’s data as well as targeted surveillance of governments, companies and civil society organisations. Among other things, the revelations showed that the intelligence agencies had intercepted the metadata of billions of phone calls recorded by Verizon and other major phone companies. Through its PRISM programme, the NSA also accessed information gathered by Facebook, Google, Apple and other technology companies (e.g. Fidler 2015). The Snowden revelations thus put the spotlight on the forms of surveillance experienced by individuals in contemporary societies. These pervade every aspect of daily life, from our online shopping, browsing and social activities, to the ways we move through public spaces and transportation systems under the watchful eye of CCTV cameras. To Bauman and Lyon (2013), the nefarious nature of surveillance means that citizens increasingly come to accept its ubiquity and pervasiveness as part and parcel of everyday life. As they note,",

The article builds theoretically on the concepts of gatekeeping and news values, and it is based empirically on a year-long study of the news processes related to the use of Facebook. Data material includes an analysis of how more than 200,000 news stories—that were published on the websites of major news organizations in Denmark from June 2011 to June 2012—were shared, recommended and commented upon in different social contexts. The article concludes by discussing some of the prevailing news values in the news media and the social media.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Today, people are increasingly exposed to news on various channels without actively seeking it. However, less is known about the link between the so-called incidental news exposure (INE) and actual news consumption. Using a two-wave panel data set from 18 countries around the world, we study the so-far under researched relation between INE and news consumption across various platforms over time. In doing so, we control for key micro-level variables such as news use, political interest and trust in media as well as macro-level variables, including internet connectivity, GDP, press freedom and literacy rate. The analyses yield an optimistic picture, showing that INE plays a bridging function across countries, leading to actual news consumption on traditional, online and social media platforms. However, trust in news and political interest do not seem to play key moderating roles. Instead, individual analyses per country imply that the link between INE and actual news use is more apparent for online and social media news platforms, and particularly in countries where general social media usage has been reported to be considerably high (e.g. Brazil, Philippines, Taiwan, UK and USA).",

Online video research interviews (OVRI) permit an overcoming of limitations in in-person interviews such as access to participants, time, expense, and a potential impact of the researcher's physical presence during data collection on the subjects' responses. The most prominent challenges regarding the quality of OVRIs are: building rapport and restricted visual cues, turn-taking, participant activation through exercises and participant validation. In this article we offer advice on how to solve these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This triangulated study combines surveys of readers of digital-native news sites in Latin America with focus groups of journalists working at these sites to explore how the emerging media sphere of digital-native media in the region might be redefining what it means to be “alternative.” Results show survey respondents were motivated to read the digital-native sites because of their alternative characteristics, such as media participation in the community, taking a stance against injustice, and their independence. Similarly, focus group findings indicated journalists distinguish themselves from mainstream media because of their innovative approaches to journalism, their independence, their participation in communities, and the stances they take. Ultimately, this study suggests that this trend of independent, online-native news sites does not fit neatly into alternative or mainstream categorizations. Rather, this study points to a hybrid, or mestizaje, way of doing journalism that is simultaneously alike and in contrast to mainstream and alternative media.",

The study found that newsrooms’ integration of social media and entrepreneurialism is blurring the line between reporters and editors. With journalists taking more entrepreneurial roles, the traditional collaborative model between reporters and editors is being taken place by a hybrid model – both reporters and editors take on promotional duties in addition to traditional journalistic roles.",

    "abstract": "This article contributes to debates regarding professional–amateur interfaces in photojournalism by reporting on findings from a qualitative study with members of a demographic cohort often described as “millennial” users (that is, people born between 1980 and 1999). A textual analysis of their responses identified five thematics for analysis: (1) respondents’ views regarding the prospective role of bearing witness and what it may entail; (2) the motivations of those engaged in this type of activity; (3) the uses of citizen smartphone imagery by news organisations; (4) presumed distinctions between professional and amateur or citizen photojournalism; and (5) ethical questions of trust where the ensuing imagery was concerned. On this evidential basis, professional photojournalism’s discursive authority is shown to be open to challenge by the alternative ethos of citizen imagery, with respondents’ perceptions raising questions over realness, authenticity and truth-value complicating, and at times destabilising, familiar professional–amateur normative binarisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mobile phones and social media can be potent tools for members of the public to circulate news and information during natural disasters. Using in-depth interviews, this study examines the case of a citizen collective to understand the interconnections between citizen journalism, mobile devices, and social media in disaster response, particularly in the Global South. Specifically, we investigate how mobile devices helped a prominent citizen collective to witness the 2015 South Indian floods and to share crucial news and information on social media. Our findings reveal that while mobile phones and social media enabled citizen journalists to gather, verify, and relay news during the floods, these technologies were unable to sufficiently challenge caste, class, and urban-rural inequalities in disaster response. We also demonstrate that the concept of witnessing developed by Peters provides a useful framework to study the production of journalism by citizen collectives in extraordinary times.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Technological corporations and the digital services they provide play an increasingly important role in the production and dissemination of news, e.g., through media’s growing reliance on algorithmic recommender systems that perform gatekeeping functions. Bringing together three areas of interest – the relationships between large technological corporations and the professional news media, the deployment of recommender systems in non-democracies, and their perceived effects – this article investigates the relationship between Russian media outlets and Yandex. It focuses on personalised content recommendation platform Yandex.Zen and its content prioritisation program “Nirvana.” Combining a review of available procedural documents with interviews and auditing of the redistribution of journalistic content via Yandex.Zen, we examine how the power relations within the recommender system’s multi-stakeholder environment condition journalistic practices. Among other findings, we demonstrate that the platform disincentivizes regional and negative content, which may result in depoliticisation of the news agenda.",

To trace the cross-field influences that have shaped the trend, this study first examines changes in neighboring fields, such as the online advertising and online audience research fields, and the intermediate field, i.e. web analytics services that work with newsrooms. This study then identifies and examines three axes of the journalistic field, i.e. the techno-economic means of journalism, the subject of journalism, and the object of journalism. The goal of this study is to contextualize, through a sociological lens, the adoption of audience metrics in relation to the dynamics and struggles inside and outside the journalistic field, and to understand the origin, driving forces, and implications of this trend.",

Drawing on 50 in-depth interviews with 18-34-year-olds, including a shared reading of participants’ most-used social media platforms, we develop the concept of personal platform architecture and articulate links between this architectural work and other forms of digital labor. We illustrate the types of labor young platforms users engage in as they construct and curate across multiple “public” and “private” spaces online, with an emphasis on architectural labor that leads away from encounters with news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facebook is an integral part of the American news environment. Substantial numbers of users now seek or encounter news on the platform and news organizations depend on the site to build audiences and drive traffic to their websites. At the same time, Facebook has also become a space for people to engage alternative sources of news and political information, including highly partisan and ideological sources. Yet we know relatively little about the types of news sources Americans engage with most frequently on the platform. In this study, we evaluate the scope of news and information sources on Facebook, including engagement with these sources. We analyse nearly 12 million Facebook posts from 416 news organizations between 2012 and 2017. We find that the sources that receive the most user engagement are often the most ideologically extreme. We also find that alternative outlets that are politically conservative frequently get more engagement, which may provide them an outsized presence on users’ newsfeeds.",

In this article, we argue that audiences with a counter-hegemonic, ideologically biased worldview are particularly likely to use alternative counter-news, because these outlets validate their worldview ― and worldview validation being a relevant psychological need in times of crises. We suggest that by turning to alternative counter-news, audiences increase their exposure to fake news and end up being less well informed about important events. Results of a random-quota survey in Germany (N = 967) confirmed that those with higher levels of conspiracy mentality and lower media trust were more likely to use alternative counter-news. Alternative counter-news users recalled more fake news than non-users and alternative counter-news use partially mediated the relationship between counter-hegemonic attitudes and fake news recall. Thus, although not all content in alternative counter-news is fake news, these outlets do attract a specific counter-hegemonic audience and they do contribute to the “pollution” of the information ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract News recommenders are attracting widespread interest in scholarly work. The current research paradigm, however, holds a narrow (mostly user-centered) perspective on the recommendation task. This makes it difficult to understand that their design is in fact the result of a negotiation process among multiple actors involved, such as editors, business executives, technologists and users. To remedy this, a multi-stakeholder recommendation paradigm has been suggested among recommender systems scholars. This work sets out to explore to what extent this paradigm is applicable to the particular context of news recommenders. We conducted 11 interviews with professionals from three leading media companies in Flanders (Belgium) and find that the development of news recommenders is indeed characterized by a negotiation process among multiple stakeholders. However, our results show that the initial multi-stakeholder framework is not adequately accommodating some of our findings, such as the existence of preconditions, the role of product owners, and the indirect involvement of particular stakeholders. Based on our analysis, we suggest an elaborated framework for multi-stakeholder news recommenders that can contribute to scholarship by providing a multi-sided perspective towards the understanding of news recommenders.",

    "title": "Un-Locking Strategic Lock-Ins of Local Media: An Investigation of Local Media’s Preferences towards Public Support for Strategic Innovation",
    "abstract": "Abstract Media practitioners and policy makers are calling for more public support to facilitate the digital transformation of local journalism. However, newer academic literature focuses on explaining why public support for local media has become a necessity from a market failure and societal point of view. Almost no attention is dedicated to the question which known public support instruments might be considered as helpful from the perspective of local media and their digital transformation strategies. Therefore, this study draws on strategic path dependence theory and investigates how local media’s perceptions of innovation constraints (i.e., lock-in mechanisms), their innovation status (i.e., lock-ins) and their preferences for public support instruments to enable innovation (i.e., public un-lock mechanisms) differ depending on the type of strategy. Four strategies are compared: two content strategies (multimedia formats and artificial intelligence applications) as well as two commercial strategies (revenue diversification and digital payment models). Data about the four strategies are collected with an online survey of local media, which operate in the Swiss Canton of St. Gallen. The findings show significant differences between the investigated strategies and suggest a differentiated approach to public support of local media in the digital age.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that journalism scholars should strive to understand the democratic significance of everyday news use, and that such an interest requires us to tackle some methodological and conceptual challenges. We utilize the concept of public connection as a starting point for prioritizing aspects of everyday news use that are most relevant to democracy. Based on a review of existing methods—surveys, interviews and digital trace data—we propose an approach that facilitates analysis beyond the moment, and beyond single platforms or providers, and which situates journalism and news as part of intricate media experiences in everyday life. Our approach centres on media diaries to achieve these aims, and we illustrate its relevance for public connection research with a case from Norway.",

    "abstract": "Local reporting has become an endangered occupation. Print publications merge, close down or face budget cuts because audiences and advertisers move online. The result is that fewer journalists are covering local affairs. Online models could be expected to assume the role of traditional print and broadcast media as they are more flexible and cheaper to operate, especially in terms of production and distribution. In the Netherlands, we identified 123 hyperlocal news websites. We explored how they organized their business, how they were geographically distributed, what sources of revenues they relied on, and what their editorial strategy was. Data were gathered through content analyses of websites and interviews with owners. Results indicate that models are diverse, ranging from fully staffed operations to home-operated websites. Editorial and economic foci differ substantially. Offering local content is not the biggest problem. Many sites, however, underperform in terms of organization and revenues. Maintaining a site seems to be a bigger issue than launching it.",

Given that we have limited knowledge on online news video use, this study examines the consumption of online news video in six countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom and United States), as well as how online video news use is correlated with other news behaviour patterns. Based on a comparative survey of news consumption, it is evident that online news videos are becoming increasingly prominent in most countries. In addition, the study showed that online news videos are seen both on the sites of news organizations but especially and increasingly off-site on social media like Facebook and video-sharing sites like YouTube. This research is a first attempt in understanding the audience of online news videos. The findings reflect the power of social media platforms in influencing news consumption habits.",

    "abstract": "This article is an empirical investigation of 18 venture-backed news startups from around the United States and Europe. The central concern here is to examine yet another new entrant to the journalism ecosystem by asking how venture-backed news startups both depart from and replicate traditional journalism. These news startups aim to solve what they see as problems with journalism in novel ways, yet their concerns mirror larger historical critiques of journalism. In this respect, news startups leave the fundamental doxa of the field mostly intact. However, their distinct technological and cultural innovations—the creation of algorithms and other news personalization efforts, the development of scalable technology such as platforms, and the elevation of technological innovation and technologists as equal to journalists—do prompt consideration about how the underlying habitus of journalists, or their sense of the “feel of the game,” may well be challenged.",

This online news project was launched in Portugal in May 2014, with a strong professional structure, led by journalists who are highly acknowledged professionals in the Portuguese media. Before its launch, Observador announced: “We are digital natives and we will be doing the journalism of today.” We argue that contemporary journalism recycles old traditions from the early days of journalism, cultivating the relationship of proximity provided by epistolarity, and reinventing agenda-setting practices as well as the gatekeeping function.",

    "abstract": "The study of citizen journalists’ characteristics and values has gained relevance and popularity, but problems remain in operationalizing the ambiguous term, “citizen journalist.” This study uses Q-methodology to determine the types of citizen journalists that exist in the newssphere, allowing citizens to define themselves. Through Q, categories of people are generated which are operant, revealing entirely new effects in ways that traditional questionnaires cannot. The factor analysis revealed three types of citizen journalists: The Nonchalant, Self-fulfillment Seeker; The Watchdog’s Watchdog; and the Passionate Pro-hopeful. The Q-method proved valuable in identifying new ways of thinking about citizen journalism, confirming some traditional knowledge about citizen journalism, and offering new insights.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The advertising-based revenue model for journalism is severely challenged due to the effects of digitization. Providers of journalistic content have therefore put increasing emphasis on paid content strategies in recent years. This article provides a literature review of factors that contribute to consumers’ past payment (PP), paying intent (PI) and willingness to pay (WTP) for digital journalistic content. We identify 17 variables based on 37 articles that influence PP, PI and WTP. While those factors are linked to either consumer(s), the product or its economics, little research examines the psychological needs and motives associated with demand for digital journalism. Due to inconsistent measurements in the literature, however, the results remain ambiguous.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Researchers and practitioners recently have observed the intricate and ever-evolving relationship between publishers and platforms may be reaching a crucial crossroads as each fight for relevancy and profitability amidst disruption in both media industries. This article draws on in-depth interviews with owners and editors of community weekly newspapers in the US to examine how such understudied local news organizations are responding to the threat posed by Facebook. Findings underscore the platform’s impact on these news outlets’ business models, especially how publishers see themselves as competing directly with the platform for a shrinking pot of advertising dollars, but they also highlight how many view the platform as a competitor for crucial content. Having historically given prominence to community-connecting cultural content to fulfill audiences’ “ritual” needs, owners and editors of community weekly newspapers struggle to carve out their own unique identity and stay relevant in a world in which many audiences have come to see their social media feeds as the more relevant place to chronicle their everyday lives. These changes have serious, negative and long-term implications for the survival of these smaller news outlets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Locative data is data that identifies a person’s precise location in a specific moment in time, allowing for evidence-based interpretations of who was doing what, when and where. Such tracking already happens regularly as a part of ubiquitous smartphone use. In journalistic contexts, with relative ease, this data can provide detailed documentation about events – connecting people, actions, and settings – in unprecedented thoroughness and complexity, even without informed consent. Locative data also can create significant threats to personal privacy, legal due process, and ethical norms along the way. To determine how journalists, conceptualize the emergence and power of locative data, this research turns to organizational codes of ethics, as representative of public discourse in the field. This content analysis explored such discourse in more than 50 major U.S. news organizations, including examinations of public policies and terms of service. This analysis shows that fewer than half of the largest U.S. news organizations even publicly share a code of ethics, conveying transparency and leadership issues throughout the field. The implications of this research also highlight the lack of clear policies and guidelines for how such data should be handled, protected, and ethically used by journalists.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity where local news sites play an essential role in their readers’ lives. Whether this increased level of news readership will help save the business of local journalism is a question that journalism scholars and professionals seek to answer. We propose a framework that demonstrates the relationships between local news consumption experiences, reading behaviours, and audience retention. We analysed individual-level clickstream data and payment records of subscribers of a regional newspaper to track the changes in their news reading behaviours and renewal decisions before and after the virus outbreak. We found that reading behaviours spiked since the beginning of the pandemic and gradually decreased but remained at a relatively higher level compared to the same period in previous years. We also found that reading news on COVID-19 or local issues and signing up for email newsletters for local news or sports positively influenced establishing the regularity of online local news consumption. The regularity of consuming local news on the site, in turn, positively impacted audience retention, demonstrating the importance of building the habit of online news consumption by providing the value that current and potential subscribers seek from their digital news consumption experiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For online news organizations trying to improve audience engagement strategies, Facebook Groups and Messenger chats constitute promising avenues. We explore whether these meso news-spaces, with different discourse architectures and group sizes, affect the substance of the discussion and people’s impressions. In this study, we experimentally tested how training and intimate forms of news engagement in small-group discussions on Facebook Messenger compare with larger conversations in a Facebook Group. The study draws from a real-world experiment in collaboration with Vox Media and its popular Facebook Group for the political podcast The Weeds. Results show that participants perceive the Messenger group as more civil and respectful and report being less prone to self-censor in the Messenger group. Comments in the Messenger group, however, are less relevant to The Weeds podcast and participation in the Messenger group leads people to have less favorable views of the large Facebook Group. The ways in which discourse architecture and group size affect digital discussions provide theoretical and practical insights.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital platforms, with their ever-increasing reach and power, are reshaping many aspects of society. China is experiencing a platformization of society akin to what has occurred in the West. By mapping the algorithmic news distribution field in China, this study shows how the key players (including digital platforms, news organizations, and state regulators) compete, collaborate, and work symbiotically with each other in this changing ecology. We explore a particularly key player—Jinri Toutiao, led by ByteDance (parent company of the popular app TikTok)—as a case that exemplifies the platform logic in China’s news ecosystem and how it involves a delicate dance with the public and regulators in a politically restrictive environment. We find that the mutual shaping of platforms and society is not a given but rather a dynamic process. Indeed, we show that Toutiao’s tremendous success is partially because of the state’s laissez-faire policy in the earlier years, and that its move to assume greater social responsibility is a response to recent tightening of regulations. Amid widespread questions about the role and influence of Big Tech and platforms in society, the case of China enriches our understanding of the platformization of news outside the Western context.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using the Philippines as a case study, we draw on crowd theory to understand how and why online mobs gather to harass reporters. Under Rodrigo Duterte’s presidency, his administration and supporters targeted independent journalism using violent tactics online and offline, including threats of rape, death, and doxing. Yet, when online mobs harass reporters it is not simply an extension of state censorship. Rather, understanding the dynamics that spur regular social media users to take part in anti-press mobs requires a less hierarchical approach. Nor can we simply blame technology for facilitating mob censorship. We argue that crowds are formed from the bottom up, are loosely organized, and intensely felt. These crowds do not necessarily share goals or identities despite their collective affect and aesthetics. Instead, more sustained types of subjectivity emerge from involvement in the crowd. Ultimately, journalism studies can benefit from the insights of crowd theory that emphasize the plasticity of the subject and the ways in which ideas and feelings spread in rapid and unpredictable ways online.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fight against rampant disinformation has triggered two major answers: fact-checking and news literacy. These affect the established fields of journalism and of Media and Information Literacy (MIL). They create opportunities for new entrants from the margins to enter professional fields in need of revamping. Using information and communication sciences research on policy and organizations and on the interplay between agency, platforms and networks, this analysis focuses on three main criteria for evaluating the field-configuring role of disinformation: policy rules and professional canons (to regain some lost political and economic ground), key events and projects (to provide sense-making strategies), and interactions with audiences and communities (to restore trust and reputation). Focusing on the European Union as main terrain of analysis due to its pioneering initiatives, this analysis first considers the mutual benefits afforded by the fight against disinformation. Then considers three main challenges: MIL risks being reduced to news literacy, digital journalism risks being reduced to fact-checking, and the disinformation discourse risks downscaling the emphasis on information. It concludes with the implications for the future for all actors to effect real field change in MIL and journalism.",

An online experiment was conducted to test a 3 (comment valence: positive vs. negative vs. no comment control) × 4 (topic type: policy vs. international vs. health vs. sports) between-subjects design using a convenience sample recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 230). Results revealed that negative comments decreased news credibility and issue importance through the mediating pathway of decreased bandwagon support. The pattern of results was particularly strong among comments perceived as vivid and authentic, regardless of the type of news in question. Theoretical and practical implications of study findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Search engines are an absolutely central part of the web. Yet we know relatively little about how they shape news consumption. In this study, we use survey data from four countries (UK, USA, Germany, Spain) to compare the news repertoires of those who say they use search engines to search for news stories, and those that do not. In all four countries, and controlling for other factors, we show that those who find news via search engines (i) on average use more sources of online news, (ii) are more likely to use both left-leaning and right-leaning online news sources, and (iii) have more balanced news repertoires in terms of using similar numbers of left-leaning and right-leaning sources. We thus find little support for the idea that search engine use leads to echo chambers and filter bubbles. To the contrary, using search engines for news is associated with more diverse and more balanced news consumption, as search drives what we call “automated serendipity” and leads people to sources they would not have used otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While news outlets still play an important role as a source of news, people increasingly receive their political information and news from social networking sites (SNSs). This study extends the literature on exposure and sharing decisions on SNSs by exploring how different attributes shape such decisions, how the two decision types differ, and by disentangling the role played by personal news recommendations and shared news stories on SNSs. As SNSs add a social dimension, exposure and sharing decisions are contingent not only upon the news story itself (news-story attributes) but also upon characteristics of the person who shares the story (recommender attributes). We designed a conjoint experiment to disentangle the effects of recommender and news-story attributes on the decision to recommend and read news and fielded it in a probability-based Norwegian online survey. The results suggest that committing to reading and sharing information are two similar yet distinct phenomena and that selective sharing is a stronger commitment than selective exposure. We also found evidence to suggest that selective sharing of news featuring a favored political party was contingent upon whether one also received information about the recommender attributes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fact-checking as a specific genre has become more important than ever over the past two decades to counter misinformation. However, we know from previous research that people rarely actively search for fact-checks. This study therefore argues for the importance of fact-checks as so-called direct content interventions on social media. More specifically, this article discusses the findings about an innovative way to implement these fact-check interventions, namely through the Tooties, cartoon characters that kindly point out the incorrectness of a refutable claim. Based on both a real-life implementation of the Tooties and an online experiment, this study provides insights about the feasibility and effectiveness of the Tooties as an innovative type of fact-check intervention compared to some of the more widely used types of fact-check interventions. This can prompt further research into the added value of fact-check interventions on social media and help news media and fact-check organizations in developing and implementing them.",

    "abstract": "Although news in virtual reality (VR) is currently on the rise, relatively little empirical evidence on its effects has been reported. This study tests if telepresence in VR news consumption can affect news credibility. In a posttest-only experiment (N = 80), 40 subjects watched VR news: 20 with a headset (Google Cardboard) and 20 in 360 degrees without a headset. A group of 20 subjects watched 2D video news. Twenty subjects only answered a questionnaire without VR exposure. The comparison of four groups revealed that VR news groups showed significantly higher telepresence than did the group with no exposure. Both the VR with a headset and 360-degree groups also marked higher in news credibility than did the group with no exposure. There were only a few significant differences between the 360-degree group and the 2D video group in telepresence and credibility. In an interaction effect test, VR news groups with high telepresence evaluated news credibility better than the group with no exposure. There were no differences among the headset, 360-degree, and 2D news groups with high telepresence in credibility. Study implications, limitations, and suggestions are discussed.",

In this paper, we consider the extension of robot journalism to the domain of social platforms and study the use of “news bots”—automated accounts that participate in news and information dissemination on social networks. Such bots present an intriguing development opportunity for news organizations and journalists. In particular, we analyze a sample of existing news bot accounts on Twitter to understand how news bots are currently being used and to examine how using automation and algorithms may change the modern media environment. Based on our analysis, we propose a typology of news bots in the form of a design and editorial decision space that can guide designers in defining the intent, utility, and functionality of future bots. The proposed design space highlights the limits of news bots (e.g., automated commentary and opinion, algorithmic transparency and accountability) and areas where news bots may enable innovation, such as niche and local news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this introduction to the special issue Contesting the Mainstream: Understanding Alternative News Media, we discuss how and to what extent alternative news media contribute to news diversity. We elaborate on the concept of diversity, the democratic role of media, and the normative implications of alternative media in the wider media sphere. Based on the articles published in this special issue, that offer new and revealing empirical insights into a wide range of alternative media sites and their practices, from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North America, and Latin America, we argue that it becomes increasingly clear that awareness about normative positions within alternative media research is imperative. This is because an appreciation of the normative purpose of alternative media guides our ability to understand their role in society. The necessity for thinking through such positions is particularly exemplified by the most radical alternative media actors, and how they are debated and studied in different political systems.",

    "title": "How Do They Debunk “Fake News”? A Cross-National Comparison of Transparency in Fact Checks",
    "abstract": "Abstract Fact-checking has gained importance in recent years, as so-called “fake news” has started to spread on social media. News outlets and independent organizations engage in debunking to combat the massive spread of disinformation. However, several authors have argued that fact checkers can only be successful if they win the trust of the audience - by making their practices transparent. This article analyzes the degree of source transparency provided by eight fact checkers from different countries (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings show major differences among the outlets studied which can be attributed to varying levels of journalistic professionalism as well as to organizational differences. Implications for the success of fact-checking and solutions to combat online disinformation are discussed.",

    "title": "Opening up Data, Tools, and Practices: Collaborating with the Future",
    "abstract": "Scholars of media and communication never stop emphasizing the importance of journalism in informing the public and in serving as a conduit for critical societal debates. The metaphor of a theater performance is sometimes used in this context. In this perspective, news is a stage on which political actors play their parts, and citizens represent a frequently critical (and in the age of social media sometimes hostile) audience. Meanwhile, journalists set the stage and arrange the props, but mostly stay in the background, allowing public figures to grab the limelight. Arguably, journalism research can also be regarded as a performance of sorts, one that also has a front stage – polished papers, well-timed conference presentations – and a backstage – projects that are behind schedule, messy data analyses, the many perils of peer review. And yet, apart from giving each other occasional, and usually confidential tours of their own behind-the-scenes area, the degree to which journalism scholars make the research process and its products available beyond publications is still limited, possibly for the same reasons as in journalism – it is quite messy back there and we never seem to find the time to tidy up properly. Much data sits undocumented and forgotten on hard drives and many strategies for analysis remain improvised rather than thoroughly planned, particularly when relying on computational methods where the methodological playbook is still in the process of being written. Of course, the appendix was not invented yesterday, and data sharing in media and communication research more broadly is increasingly common, but it seems appropriate to say that digital journalism research – in spite of the copious volumes of data we increasingly regard as normal – is not yet as open and transparent regarding its methods, data, and research practices as seems desirable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Until recently, the notion of emotion in media studies and communication research was mostly examined through the lens of cultural studies, media effects, and visuals. Research on emotion in journalism has been slow to arrive, as Karin Wahl-Jorgensen shows in this special issue. However, this is radically changing. Contributions by Hassan, Kilgo, Lough, Riedl, Sanchez Laws, Waddell, and Zou highlight how the affordances of digital journalism have an impact on the space for emotion in evaluating the relationships between journalists, journalistic content and their audiences. Embracing emotions as a dimension in digital journalism studies contributes to opening up interesting approaches towards concepts such as objectivity, and for more nuanced research on the power hidden in the ‘taken for granted’ in classic liberal journalism. While highlighting the liberating and empowering potential in the inclusion of emotions in journalism, there is also a need to focus on how affective dynamics can be spurred by phenomena such as conflict and hate. When introducing emotions in the journalistic loop, new questions arise, and perspectives of power and negotiations must be included in these discussions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study investigates how journalists construct the rise of data journalism discursively within the specific political and economic conditions of Italy, and whether data journalists describe it as able to promote transparency at the level of both journalism and society as a whole. Italy is an interesting case for four different reasons: (1) to date, few analyses have been carried out on Mediterranean countries; (2) the Italian media system and its traditional journalism culture appear to be reluctant to innovate; (3) Italian data journalists are generally freelancers linked to small news agencies rather than established newsrooms; (4) the research reported in this paper was accomplished while the Italian government was approving a Freedom of Information Act. From the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2017, we carried out 15 interviews with data journalists working full-time for both established news organizations and specialized agencies. The findings show that data journalism in Italy is a highly professional sub-field, although journalistic education is not well developed. Data journalism is still largely determined by the availability and accessibility of public datasets. However, data journalists have developed certain strategies with which to generate and collect their own data, for instance collaborations and networks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This theoretical essay considers how the institution of journalism, now threatened by authoritarian attack and other challenges, has been conceptualized and proposes a refinement on previous definitions: An institution is a complex social structure—formed by an interlocking network of rules and activities, roles, technologies, norms, and collective frames of meaning–which work together to sustain its coherence, endurance, and value. Guided by this general definition, and to better accommodate new institutional forms of journalism specifically in the hybrid media system, I introduce a typology based on two dimensions: level-of-analysis and structural emphasis, that is whether on traditional news organizations or emerging assemblages. In balancing their roles as critic and champion, I argue that academic observers must not take institutional stability, coherence, and value for granted, which previous perspectives have over-stated, but rather take a more explicitly normative assessment of how different structures contribute to those qualities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Building on theories of the journalistic field and its refraction effect, this article calls to attention the unique circumstances Chinese journalists have faced when sourcing during the outbreak of COVID-19. Based on 32 semi-structured interviews with local journalists from 20 media organizations across four large cities in China, our study investigates how journalists navigate multiple social media platforms and employ data-driven sourcing as complements to traditional sourcing practices. We find the disruptions caused by the pandemic have unexpectedly converged with the ongoing developments of platformisation and digital transformation in China. We also reveal the subtlety of the field’s refractions of external shocks and structural constraints, as evidenced in journalists’ sourcing practices amid the crisis. Variations in their navigation of multiple sourcing options, i.e., platform-swinging, giving voice to the data or the lingering effect of hysteresis, are identified as contingent on media type and locality, platform affordance and popularity, as well as practical sensibilities towards each sourcing option at their disposal. Expanding the wide-ranging field theory to China’s specific social and political contexts, this study offers a valuable window to discern technology-induced changes and the field’s refraction effect to external influences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the overall topic compositions and traces of right-wing populist partisanship in the content structures of German-language digital alternative news outlets. We argue that a topically heterogeneous landscape of right-wing populist alternative news outlets could maximize the reach of right-wing populist messages. Using LDA topic modeling, we explore the topical structures of nine different outlets (n = 66,965 articles) and empirically identify meaningful groups of outlets. Our analyses suggest the existence of two topically heterogeneous clusters of alternative news media: (1) core right-wing populist outlets, with around 45–50% of articles coming from topics that are related to right-wing or populist politics; and (2) topically diverse outlets. The latter group's topic selection also reveals right-wing populist partisanship, but less prominently so, while putting more emphasis on general interest news topics, such as sports, economy, or international relations. This group also includes Russian state-owned RT deutsch and Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times whose institutional roots, however, are only partially reflected in their topic selection. Additionally, longitudinal analyses reveal an increase of populism-related topics in both groups around the election date of the 2017 German federal election.",

    "abstract": "The huge collections of news content which have become available through digital technologies both enable and warrant scientific inquiry, challenging journalism scholars to analyse unprecedented amounts of texts. We propose Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling as a tool to face this challenge. LDA is a cutting edge technique for content analysis, designed to automatically organize large archives of documents based on latent topics, measured as patterns of word (co-)occurrence. We explain how this technique works, how different choices by the researcher affect the results and how the results can be meaningfully interpreted. To demonstrate its usefulness for journalism research, we conducted a case study of the New York Times coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present, partially replicating a study by Gamson and Modigliani. This shows that LDA is a useful tool for analysing trends and patterns in news content in large digital news archives relatively quickly.",

    "title": "Online Harassment and Its Implications for the Journalist–Audience Relationship",
    "abstract": "Abstract Amid growing threats to journalists around the world, this study examines the nature of online harassment, the types of journalists most likely to experience it, and the most common forms of response to such abuse. Through a representative survey of U.S. journalists, we find that nearly all journalists experience at least some online harassment but that such harassment is generally infrequent overall and especially in its most severe forms. Nevertheless, online harassment against journalists disproportionately affects women (particularly young women) and those who are more personally visible in the news but not necessarily those who work for larger newsrooms. Moreover, it is clear that the more often a journalist is harassed online, the more likely they are to take a dim view of the audience by seeing them as irrational and unlike themselves, and to perceive interaction with them as less valuable. Additionally, as greater targets of the worst forms of abuse, women face a greater burden in deciding if and how to respond to online harassment. Conceptually, this article advances the literature on journalists and audiences by extending the concept of reciprocal journalism, which emphasizes individual-level perceptions that shape the quality of person-to-person exchanges. We explore how the experience of online harassment may complicate the way that journalists think about and act toward their audiences, offering a window into the downsides of encountering audiences online.",

    "title": "Journalistic Legitimacy Revisited",
    "abstract": "Journalism in general—Anglo-American journalism in particular—has undergone a number of profound changes within and outside the newsroom. This paper explores whether these changes have weakened the basis of journalistic legitimacy, or have offered new grounds for journalistic legitimacy, and, in each case, to what extent. It is argued that a number of factors, including the financial difficulties of news media, the decentralisation of public communication as facilitated by the internet, the dual dilemmas faced by both objective and partisan journalism, and the belligerent public discourse about journalism are delegitimising journalism. However, the legitimatisation of journalism can be found in the efforts of news organisations—not only leading news organisations such as the Guardian and the New York Times but also regional and local ones such as the Trinity Mirror group and the Palm Beach Post—in adopting and possessing digital and technological tools and skills, and in defending their journalism. The relegitimation of journalism reiterates and reinforces the historically shaped essence of journalism that reflects a continuity of legacy journalism; and this is an organisational and occupational response to, and boundary defence against, the trend of delegitimation of journalism in the digital era.",

    "abstract": "Facebook’s News Feed is an emerging, influential force in our personal information flows, especially where news information is concerned. However, as the News Feed’s story selection mechanism starts to supplant traditional editorial story selection, we have no window into its story curation process that is parallel to our extensive knowledge of the news values that drive traditional editorial curation. The sensitive, trade-secret nature of the News Feed and its constant updates and modifications make a traditional, computer science-based examination of this algorithmic giant difficult, if not impossible. This study takes an alternative approach, using a content analysis of Facebook’s own patents, press releases, and Securities and Exchange Commission filings to identify a core set of algorithmic values that drive story selection on the Facebook News Feed. Informed by the principles of material culture analysis, it ranks these values to create a window into Facebook’s curation process, and compares and contrasts Facebook’s story selection values with traditional news values, examining the possible consequences of one set of values supplanting the other. The study finds a set of nine News Feed values that drive story selection: friend relationships, explicitly expressed user interests, prior user engagement, implicitly expressed user preferences, post age, platform priorities, page relationships, negatively expressed preferences, and content quality. It also finds evidence that friend relationships act as an overall influence on all other story selection values.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Communication abundance in the digital sphere has raised concern over audience fragmentation and the declining capacity of general news media to shape common experiences and promote shared discourses required by a well-functioning local democracy. Based on the concept of mediated public connection this paper offers an analytical framework to investigate how people orient themselves to a local public world through media in high-choice, digitally advanced information environments. Two analytical dimensions of people’s media use – practice and perception – are tested on survey data from Norway (N = 1692) using a network analysis approach combined with media experience data. The study finds substantial convergence in use of different online and offline media with the largest audience overlap occurring between online local and regional newspapers and Facebook. These digital players represent the backbone of the local media environment under study. Overall, citizens’ experiences with different media as democratic resources for their local public life are not very strong and weaker for online media than for their offline editions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The 2016 US election and the victory of Donald Trump are closely connected to a perceived rise of the far-right in the United States. We build upon public sphere and alternative media theory to discuss the relevance of alternative media for the US (far-)right and whether the election period and the candidate Trump allowed far-right alternative media to establish themselves in the (far-) right networked public sphere. We investigate whether it has come to a convergence of topics between the right and the extreme far-right. We analyze the topics nine right-wing outlets, ranging from Fox News to the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, covered in 2015/2016 during the US presidential election. We show through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established itself as a media outlet between the extreme far-right and mainstream right by both covering more extreme and more classic conservative topics. We show through time series clustering how Breitbart and Fox News converged in their coverage of Islam and immigration. Finally, we show through hyperlink analysis that the connection between the far-right and the mainstream right is mostly one-sided; while the alternative outlets link to more established ones, the established outlets mostly ignore the outlets from the far-right.",

    "title": "Radical Media Ethics",
    "abstract": "The digital media revolution has created a revolution in journalism ethics. Established principles are under scrutiny, new practices emerge, and a previous professional consensus on the aims and principles of responsible journalism has been shattered. Journalism ethics has to be re-invented for a global, digital media. The once cozy world of journalism ethics—a somewhat sleepy domain of agreed-upon codes of ethics too often presumed to be invariant—is becoming a faint memory from an earlier media era. We witness the end of a tidy, pre-digital journalism ethics for professionals and the birth of an untidy digital journalism ethics for everyone. Although the digital media revolution is much-discussed, the far-reaching consequences of this revolution for journalism ethics is less discussed, and not clearly understood. This article views the state of journalism ethics through the lens of this digital revolution. To get a sense of the depth of the ethical revolution, it compares pre-digital media ethics and the evolving digital media ethics. The article identifies the assumptions of the pre-digital approach to ethics, and describes the “fatal blow” that digital media delivered to this traditional framework. The article argues for a radical media ethics and outlines some features of the emerging ethics. It concludes with an agenda for digital journalism ethics. The guiding idea is that we need serious and systematic responses to the situation of journalism ethics today, and such changes should be radical—not piecemeal or conservative.",

    "abstract": "As more news articles are written via collaboration between journalists and algorithms, questions have arisen regarding how automation influences the way that news is processed and evaluated by audiences. Informed by expectancy violation theory and the MAIN model, two experimental studies were conducted that examined the effect of purported machine authorship on perceptions of news credibility. Study One (N = 129) revealed that news attributed to a machine is perceived as less credible than news attributed to a human journalist. Study Two (N = 182) also observed negative effects of machine authorship through the indirect pathway of source anthropomorphism and negative expectancy violations, with evidence of moderation by prior recall of robotics also observed. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "title": "Waiting for Data Journalism",
    "abstract": "Data journalism has emerged as a trend worthy of attention in newsrooms the world over. Previous research has highlighted how elite media, journalism education institutions, and other interest groups take part in the emergence and evolution of data journalism. But has it equally gained momentum in smaller, less-scrutinized media markets? This paper looks at the ascent of data journalism in the French-speaking part of Belgium. It argues that journalism, and hence data journalism, can be understood as a socio-discursive practice: it is not only the production of (data-driven) journalistic artefacts that shapes the notion of (data) journalism, but also the discursive efforts of all the actors involved, in and out of the newsrooms. A set of qualitative inquiries allowed us to examine the phenomenon by first establishing a cartography of who and what counts as data journalism. It uncovers an overall reliance on a handful of passionate individuals, only partly backed up institutionally, and a limited amount of consensual references that could foster a shared interpretive community. A closer examination of the definitions reveal a sharp polyphony that is particularly polarized around the duality of the term itself, divided between a focus on data and a focus on journalism, and torn between the co-existing notions of “ordinary” and “thorough” data journalism. We also describe what is perceived as obstacles, which mostly pertain to broader traits that shape contemporary newsmaking; and explain why, if data journalism clearly exists as a matter of concern, it has not transformed in concrete undertakings.",

This study investigates in what ways the innovation of drones for journalistic purposes might extend and improve the use of eyewitness accounts, especially in areas or fields where human coverage would be impossible or too dangerous. It examines the interrelationships among new technologies, journalistic innovation, and the audience’s quest for constant visual enforcements, drawing on diffusion theory and social constructivist models for process innovation. It argues that the emergent genre of drone journalism might come to exemplify a “disruptive innovation,” an innovation that has emerged accidentally, but disrupts existing conceptions of visual journalism, and subsequently contributes to the creation of new markets and value networks.",

    "abstract": "Search engines provide a window into the changing association between websites and keywords across cultures and countries and over time. As such, they offer journalism and news researchers an opportunity to study how search engines, in this case Google, mediate news events and stories online. However, search results are not straightforward to study. Since search results are made in the act of searching and will have to be retrieved from Google Search in real-time, there is a range of different ontological and methodological issues related to this data source. This paper addresses these issues by discussing how factors in the search algorithm can be used proactively to study variations across searchers and in time. The paper identifies various endogenous and exogenous factors in the search algorithm one has to pay attention to and discusses ways to archive search results accordingly. Through a small case study, ways to work with the influence of endogenous factors (keywords, language settings, geo-location, Web history and clicking behaviour) and mitigate the effects of the exogenous factors (experimentation and randomisation) are suggested. Then, a new approach to studying search results is put forward, which builds on purposeful sampling of real-world participants or constructed research profiles. Finally, perspectives for news and journalism scholars in studying algorithmically generated content in a broader context are offered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Research has struggled to answer a critical question: why would people share fake news if they have no intention to deceive, and they run a risk of social censure for doing so? Working on the basis that sharers do not know whether the news is fake, we propose the term “dubious news” to help answer that question. The term describes news which exists in two states simultaneously, both true and false until it has been established which it is. People who would be reluctant to knowingly share fake news might nonetheless share dubious news. Focus groups run in Singapore during the early stages of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic – when uncertainty ran high – explored why people share dubious news, its value in establishing truth, and its impact on group cohesion. We identify a difference between the motivation of the sharer and how that motivation is perceived by a recipient, which further illustrates the distinction between dubious and fake news. We conclude that, despite the potential for discord in the group and censure for the individual, dubious news may still perform social functions like that of rumour: group cohesion; personal status; and a sense of control in situations of uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study focuses on managerial responses to disruption and, specifically, how news executives implemented journalistic practices and processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the lens of Harvey’s (2006) theorization of space, the concept of Collaborative Virtual Environments, and the model of communities of practice, I explore management’s roles in virtual newsrooms. The method is based on semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 17 news managers in Spain. The findings presented here underline managerial performance in virtual newsrooms considered as communities of practice. Virtual spaces reconfigured relationships among colleagues and increased collaboration, shaping news practices and communication protocols. Management implemented strategies to control the negotiation of meaning, the building of trust and cooperation, and the power dynamics within their professional communities. Journalistic production during the COVID-19 pandemic also raised problematic issues such as work overload, psychological distress, and job insecurity.",

    "title": "EMOTIONAL NEWS, EMOTIONAL COUNTERPUBLIC",
    "abstract": "Examining a popular news blog that targets Chinese diaspora living in the United States, this paper explores how emotionally-oriented digital news sustains the diasporic community as an emotional counterpublic. The salience of emotionality in the Chinese diasporic media sphere has to do with the complex identity of diasporic news bloggers, and their adaptation to the new media logic of interactivity and participation. This paper finds that diasporic news bloggers regularly construct an emotional climate of fear through the normalization of a number of narrative strategies in their routine practices. Keeping in perspective the socio-cultural context in which diasporic media operate, this paper argues that the construction of fear as a collective emotion holds civic potentials, for it bridges the political life and everyday life, and connects the diasporic counterpublic with the dominant public sphere of the receiving society. Particularly, the fear-evoking news potentially enhances civic engagement in five ways, namely personalized sense-making, moral evaluation, mobilization, therapeutic closure and cohesion maintenance. Caveats on the use of emotionality in journalism are also discussed at the end.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on journalists Paul Lewis (The Guardian) and Ravi Somaiya (The New York Times), the most frequently mentioned national and international journalists on Twitter during the 2011 UK summer riots. Both actively tweeted throughout the four-day riot period and this article highlights how they used Twitter as a reporting tool. It discusses a series of Twitter conventions in detail, including the use of links, the taking and sharing of images, the sharing of mainstream media content and the use of hashtags. The article offers an in-depth overview of methods for studying Twitter, reflecting critically on commonly used data collection strategies, offering possible alternatives as well as highlighting the possibilities for combining different methodological approaches. Finally, the article makes a series of suggestions for further research into the use of Twitter by professional journalists.",

    "title": "Understanding Peripheral Journalism from the Boundary: A Conceptual Framework",
    "abstract": "Abstract With increasing digitization and commercialization, a plethora of new formats has entered the journalistic field, challenging its norms, routines, and practices. Research on these so-called peripheral actors, particularly in political journalism, has grown substantially, leading to a range of studies that engage with key concepts of the core and periphery. However, because such descriptions often assume a homogeneity that fails to account for the diversity of peripheral actors, we still have an incomplete and, crucially, under-theorized understanding of the different kinds of constellations in which peripheral journalism may exist. This article intends to address this gap by offering a new and comprehensive theoretical framework, which draws on Bourdieu’s concepts of autonomy and heteronomy, as well as doxa to understand peripheral political journalism. We then test this framework in the context of the Austrian journalistic field and identify 11 different forms of peripheral political journalistic actors.",

    "abstract": "Whilst new forms of presentation and user participation make a “way new journalism” possible, researchers around the world critically claim that news websites do not live up to their potential. To offer an explanation for the slow adaption of hyperlinks, multimedia, and interactive options, we examine if there is a path dependence between news websites’ online sophistication and their structural background. Based on a large-scale automated content analysis, we analyzed 65,000 news articles from nine countries. The results reveal that institutional factors (media system, nation, media type) are more relevant for predicting websites’ online sophistication than content-related factors. This suggests that, apart from a few remarkable exceptions, there is a path dependence on a news website’s media background.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Especially during election times, news is an indispensable means for citizens to make informed political decisions. The ubiquitous information access of mobile devices creates the potential for increasing news use among citizens in general and specifically during campaign time. However, little is known about the outcomes of this new way of accessing news, although research suggests that less attention and involvement are dedicated to news accessed on a mobile phone. This study therefore applies the differential gains perspective to mobile news use during the 2015 Danish national election campaign. We utilize a pre- and post-election panel survey and a smartphone-based media diary study among Danish voters (n = 1108) to test whether news app use and mobile browsing affect political knowledge and campaign participation differently than other types of campaign news exposure. Results suggest equal gains for citizens’ political knowledge, but differential gains for mobilizing effects of mobile news use.",

    "title": "“Worse than the Harassment Itself.” Journalists’ Reactions to Newsroom Social Media Policies",
    "abstract": "Abstract Journalists increasingly use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to pursue audience engagement. In doing so, journalists have learned these platforms carry personal and professional risks—namely accusations of political bias that can lead to termination from their jobs, as well as trolling, doxing, and threats of physical violence. This is especially true for women journalists and journalists of color. This study examines the extent to which newsroom managers help—or hinder—their journalists when it comes to navigating the risks and challenges of audience engagement via social media platforms. It draws on interviews with 37 reporters, editors, publishers, freelancers, and social media/audience engagement managers from throughout the U.S. about their experiences with and thoughts about their newsroom’s social media policies. Findings reveal that although journalists are encouraged to be “active,” “personable,” and “authentic” social media users, their newsroom social media policies offer little guidance or support for when journalists subsequently face personal, aggressive attacks. I conclude that these tensions are a consequence of the extent to which social media has upended the ways that journalists approach their work, as well as their relationship with the public.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study uses a survey of journalists from throughout Latin America (n = 1,094) to understand the relationship between policies (or lack thereof) and journalists’ work environments and editorial decisions. Results show most journalists work in newsrooms with no policy in place. Country, newsroom size, geographic scope, and revenue source all are significantly related to presence of a policy. Despite differences in organizational factors and country contexts, this study suggests newsrooms in Latin America mostly approach the use and regulation of social media in the same ways. Journalists’ descriptions of policies suggest they extend traditional practices and ethics to the social media realm, representing a missed opportunity as journalists lack the guidance they need to deal with the latest technological advancements. Journalists described outward-facing policies focused on protecting the news companies’ brands, readers, and sources, rather than protecting journalists.",

    "title": "Shared Emotion: The Social Amplification of Partisan News on Twitter",
    "abstract": "Abstract As people increasingly rely on social media for news, it is important to understand what types of news media they are likely to come across in their social media environment. Exposure to news content in social media is the result of complex, interdependent systems driven by individuals, platforms, and institutions—among others—but an important element of exposure is what kind of news content engaged individuals tend to share with their peers. This study examines how partisan news media may be influential in social media by proposing that their content is shared more frequently and that they share more emotional content than non-partisan news media. This study examines more than 300,000 tweets and retweets from 22 news organizations to understand what type of political news is shared more widely in social media and how emotion in news content can influence political news sharing. The results suggest that partisan news media are shared more frequently in Twitter, and that partisan news content is more likely to express emotion compared with non-partisan news. Overall, partisan and emotional news media content is disproportionately amplified in social media, which may have important consequences for others who rely on social media for political news information.",

    "abstract": "users access news items via a connected smartphone every week, more than the 25 percent evident in the United States and the United Kingdom. These figures spell opportunity on both sides of the Atlantic but invite US and UK journalists to ponder why the Danish figure is higher and what it means for future growth in their own markets. By far the most interesting finding for future news producers is that online is the most frequently accessed form of news for young internet users: “they discover and share more news through social networks and show less loyalty to traditional media platforms” (p. 11). This is excellent news for journalists working on new product development for the next generation of social media, and pointed advice for the cashed-up seeking new investment vehicles. This is bolstered by perhaps the most predictable outcome of the survey; that 58 percent of tablet users in the UK are accessing news on these machines, and that on those machines, it is the newspaper brands that have embraced new paid apps and product development that “do significantly better on a tablet than on the open internet—in terms of overall market share” (p. 11). This seems to be a moment of clarity in understanding the potential future avenues for successful growth in and from journalism and digital news.",

    "abstract": "Constant growth in digital markets has triggered a changing landscape for media organizations, with an increasing number of digital media products, new media consumption devises, and shifting media consumption patterns. Innovators in Digital News takes an opportunistic look at the common patterns underneath successful digital innovation in media organizations. The book is a departure from a rather depressing outlook on the US news industry, such as Will the Last Reporter Please Turn Out the Lights (McChesney and Pickard 2011). The case studies presented in Lucy Küng’s book highlight digital adaption as a transformation strategy for pioneering in the news business. There is no doubt that journalism is facing new challenges. However, Küng’s case studies reveal how such challenges were transformed into opportunities for those organizations seen as Innovators in Digital News. The main goal of the book then is to describe the process of that transformation and to pinpoint common elements underlying organizations’ success with digital news, while outlining the constituents of a pro-digital culture. Lucy Küng sheds light on why it is that Vice and BuzzFeed, for example, invest in journalism, while established organizations are letting experienced journalists go to recruit technologists. She analyzes five key players in the field who have been recognized at different times as leaders, successes, and, perhaps, role models when it comes to digital news production: The Guardian, The New York Times, Quartz, BuzzFeed, and Vice. The success of these organizations marks the only binding element between the otherwise heterogeneous structures of these news organizations. The Guardian and The New York Times, for instance, are legacy newspaper organizations that are far along the process of transforming themselves into digital news organizations. Küng describes how The Guardian, a UK newspaper, became a pioneer of legacy media reinvention and delineates the role of the Scott Trust in defining its innovative path. In addition, she details The New York Times’ early adaption to digital innovation. The book highlights the ongoing tensions experienced in newsroom cultures of adaptors: the deep commitment to the highest journalistic standards and the deeper relationship with users and commercial activities necessary in the digital news markets. As such adaptors to the digital market, The New York Times and The Guardian stand in stark contrast to “clean sheet” digital news organizations, such as Quartz or BuzzFeed, that are defined by technological innovation coupled with news content. The book describes how BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti started the organization in 2006 as a viral content lab and side project to his main role as co-founder of the Huffington Post. Increasingly, BuzzFeed is investing in journalism and a number of classic news journalists with reputation have joined the organization. Finally, Vice is described as another case altogether. Starting off as an alternative street magazine in Montreal, Vice transformed itself into a leading international",

    "abstract": "During the 2012 elections, several narratives built around humor, zingers, and gaffes blurred the lines between news and entertainment. This paper examines how political journalists used humor on Twitter during the first 2012 presidential election debate. This study also explores the character of such humor, how jokes relate to other forms of Twitter interactivity, and who, or what are the targets of these jokes. Twitter use by political reporters during a presidential debate might offer evidence of a deviation from traditional reporting norms. Recent scholarship on journalism practice and new media technologies suggests that journalists tend to “normalize” new media affordances; journalists often adapt long-standing routines to new technological platforms. Normalization offers a solid construct to guide inquiry on how social media might, or might not, affect change in the delivery and style of contemporary political news. A content analysis of tweets posted by 430 political journalists during the debate reveals widespread use of humor by journalists on Twitter, especially associated with the retweet function. About one-fifth of the journalists’ tweets included jokes, suggesting a growing acceptance of the rhetorical device on Twitter. Results also reveal that journalists and commentators pointed their jokes toward political figures, but more sophisticated satirical comments were aimed at the news media or the debate process at large. Overall, political journalists tended to avoid humor as a means of criticism. Implications regarding the role of humor in politics, the nature of reporting on Twitter, and areas of potential future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social media can create opportunities and networks that empower people and advance communities, especially in developing nations. This study examined how Rwandan journalists believe the professional use of the popular online messaging application WhatsApp influences their daily news processes as well as influences their news audiences. In-depth interviews with journalists revealed that in Rwanda, a developing country that has experienced substantial social and economic progress since its 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, journalists regularly use WhatsApp to generate story ideas, communicate with sources, disseminate news, receive audience feedback, and most notably, to collaborate with one another and promote professional practices for the good of their country. In practice, these activities empowered audiences, increased participation, and improved professionalism, ultimately contributing to the country’s post-genocide reconstruction and development. Theoretically, this research advances knowledge about how journalism is connected to social media and ultimately contributes to a subfield of an emerging area called epistemologies of digital journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article conducts a qualitative textual analysis of the New York Times’ 360-degree news reports that focus on international human rights issues, posing the following research questions: (1) How do the form and content of the New York Times’ 360-degree videos potentially help to construct the vividness and interactivity that virtual reality scholars say will contribute to a greater sense of telepresence? (2) In what ways do the form and content of the New York Times’ 360-degree video news reports reflect the tension between traditional notions of journalistic authority on the one hand, and the need to engage—on both ethical and economic levels—with news audiences on the other hand? The article will show that the news industry’s deep ambivalence toward giving up control of the journalistic narrative in the digital age is coded into the visual and aural structures of the videos, raising questions about the celebratory discourse on agency and interpersonal engagement with distant suffering.",

    "abstract": "Journalistic use of social media for sourcing, distribution and promotion of news comes at a time when the newsroom itself can be said to be in a state of “transition”. Previous research about social media and journalism has focussed on the transition of journalistic practices to the “social media age”, but less attention has been given to the ways in which new workplace relationships might contribute to a social media-enabled newsroom. It is thus important to analyse the policies and procedures different media organizations have implemented to integrate and regulate the use of social media in their newsrooms and how this might impact on news production and dissemination overall. The aim of this paper is to compare and critically analyse social media management policies and procedures in Australian newsrooms, as well as the relations between various editorial staff, to manage its introduction into journalistic practice. Based on 25 qualitative research interviews with editors, social media managers and news media staff from major Australian media companies, this study also reflects more broadly on the potential conflicts created by the regulation of social media use in newsrooms and how various personnel respond to them.",

Then, I will discuss how the collapse of the archive in 2017 reflects a larger problem within NGO-launched and maintained projects regarding the tension between meeting donor needs and community needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fact-checking databases, as important results of fact checkers’ epistemic work, are increasingly tied together in new overarching infrastructures, but these are understudied and lack transparency despite being an important societal baseline for whether claims are false. This article conceptualizes fact-checking as infrastructure and constructs a mixed-methods approach to examine overlaps and differences and thereby detect biases to increase transparency in COVID-19 misinformation infrastructure at scale. Analyzing Poynter and Google as such overarching infrastructures, we found only a small overlap. Fewer fact-checkers contribute to Google, with fewer stories than to Poynter. 75% of claims in Google are fact-checked by Asian and North American fact-checkers (44% for Poynter) but none by South Americans (20% for Poynter). More stories in Poynter originate from Facebook than outside social media (43% vs. 17%), while Google shows the opposite (16% vs. 38%). In Google, claims originate to a larger extent from public persons. We find similar large topics on “statistics” and “cures,” but also differences regarding smaller topics (e.g., “vaccines”) and types of misinformation (e.g., “virus characteristics”). Thus, the article shows that the infrastructures have inherent biases and argue that making visible such biases will increase transparency for stakeholders using it.",

The results show that journalists, while perceiving accuracy and verification as central to journalistic work, either distance themselves from having responsibility for the accuracy of amateur images or attempt to perform or find some form of verification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study uses surveys with readers of entrepreneurial news startups in seven Latin American countries to examine their motivations for donating to journalism. Using the donor–organization relationship from public relations scholarship as a framework, this study showed content, independent/objective journalism, and community were main motivating factors for donating. A lack of priority, and techno- and commercial-related concerns were reasons why readers did not donate. Professional and theoretical implications are discussed.",

    "title": "A “Massive and Unprecedented Intrusion”",
    "abstract": "In May 13, 2013, the Associated Press announced that the United States Department of Justice had secretly subpoenaed phone records from Associated Press phone lines over a two-month period in early 2012. A few days later, on May 17, the Washington Post revealed that the Department of Justice had also been tracking the activities of Fox News’ chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen. These two stories caused large scandals in the United States, and the majority of American journalists denounced the surveillance. As these scandals were still unfolding, yet another government surveillance scandal broke: former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the federal government had been collecting the cell phone metadata of American citizens for several years. Journalists’ responses to this scandal were more nuanced; editorials expressed a wider spectrum of views about the ethics of government surveillance practices, and more complex opinions about the legitimacy and necessity of government surveillance. Drawing on approaches to journalistic professionalism, this study uses qualitative textual analysis to assess editorials written in response to these three revelations. The analysis suggests that journalists see their speech as something deserving of unique protections, above and beyond those protections afforded to the general public.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how hyperlocal entrepreneurs interpret and undertake the role of accountable journalism, but it still acknowledges the many roles hyperlocal news may hold in a local community. The analysis is built on the approaches within this group toward (1) business and (2) journalism. The findings suggest that the focus of (A) nonprofit/nonprofessional could be to mirror community events, often as a “positive” counter-image. Within (B) nonprofit/professional, interrogative reporting could be viewed as a contribution to the common good. Niches of news alerts and partnership content are found within (C) for-profit/nonprofessional, while a full news standard is the (struggling) ambition within (D) for-profit/professional. The argument can be made that a deeper understanding of how media accountability can be addressed and/or promoted in this diverse sector of scarce resources is a vital question for policymakers, educational institutions and the public – as well as for the future of local journalism.",

    "abstract": "Digital disruption has challenged newsroom norms, and newsmakers are increasingly sought and found online. But who can reporters trust? In a post-truth, fake-news era, this paper explores how student reporters in Singapore verify the credibility of online newsmakers. The study has three areas of enquiry. Firstly, how do they utilise social media to find newsmakers? Secondly, as one benefit of the internet is that it offers access to diverse voices, how do they verify non-elite newsmakers’ identities? Finally, how do they negotiate credibility online in a post-truth world? This study draws on interview data between 2010 and 2016 to observe changes over time. Findings suggest that the next generation of reporters “stalk” non-elite newsmakers on social media to verify their identity. They have a greater flexibility of what constitutes “truth” and are more accepting of truth as relative. Thus, they prefer to use multiple news sources and viewpoints. They also viewed the social aspect of social media as a marker of credibility as they preferred to access newsmakers who showed one degree of separation from their own network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The title of this article is a pun referencing Howard Becker’s classic 1967 essay “Whose side are we are on?” – a call to sociologists to question their allegiances and acknowledge their involvement in bolstering the institutional processes they research. By bringing existing perspectives from within digital journalism studies into conversation with Becker’s central argument, this article aims to identify tools both inside and outside of the field that encourage greater engagement and conceptual refinement with what is labeled here as a “politics of digital journalism studies.” Two such analytical tools that encourage a politics of digital journalism studies are the accentuation of complexity within media systems and a recognition of the positionality of research. After engaging with barriers to a politics of digital journalism studies, two broad pathways are suggested around digital journalism studies as a space of critique and a space of possibilities. Our impact as scholars may be limited, as some scholars have argued, but the conclusion warns of our irrelevance as a field if we ignore our potential to contribute to the broader meaning making taking place around the topics we study.",

    "abstract": "The use of information and communication technology and the Web-based products it provides is responsible for significant global energy use and consequent emissions of greenhouse gases. Media organisations acknowledge this to be a growing sustainability issue for their businesses; many are anxious to better understand how they can manage the carbon footprints of their digital services. This paper combines learning from a computer-based mathematical model of energy use in a digital product system with intelligence of the day-to-day activities of a global news business, Guardian News and Media Limited. It finds that: (1) emissions associated with a digital news product are comparable to media activities already subject to environmental management, suggesting an issue of material importance to publishers; (2) unlike physical products such as newspapers, the way energy is consumed in a digital news system is determined not just by technical decisions but also the everyday activities of journalists and the newsroom; (3) interventions that could reduce such energy consumption often conflict with parallel objectives, such as editorial and commercial. We therefore contend that the environmental effects of digital media delivery have significant implications for the practice of ethical digital journalism—and hope to stimulate further debate.",

I then offer three recommendations for our field going forward: to prioritize offering perspective over developing predictions; to foster awareness over awe, and to maintain a devotion towards unapologetic contributions, with humility.",

    "abstract": "this article examines how pioneer journalism communities reimag-ine journalistic epistemology from the periphery, and traces how ideas about journalism as a form of knowledge are embodied in their metadiscourses and enacted in their epistemic practice. empirically grounded in metajournalistic discourse analysis of man-ifestos, event descriptions, and semi-structured interviews, this cross-national multi-method study explicates (1) pioneer journalism communities’ epistemic values found in the manifestos of 20 jour-nalism startups from different parts of the globe and online descriptions of seven innovation-focused industry events; and (2) how pioneer journalism communities put these values into epistemic practice, based on interviews with 30 pioneer journalism producers from four startups located in different journalistic cul-tures— Bureau Local (UK), The Current (Pakistan), DoR (Romania), and New Naratif (Malaysia). the study findings suggest that pioneer journalism communities around the world imagine their knowledge production praxis as relational and meaningful , and through their metadiscourses and storytelling practices, create self-contained spaces of collective action, where publics play an equally important role in the negotiation of knowledge. Pioneer journalism communities around journalism startups/cooperatives go beyond their traditional epistemic role as facilitators of knowledge and adopt a semi-political, knowledge-based advocacy role, seeking to act upon their visions of “a better future” (Rappler).",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent, rapid growth in the number of digital start-ups seeking sustainable models for conducting journalism alongside a relative lack of detailed, empirical research about such organisations. This article addresses this gap by analysing The Ferret—a recently launched investigative journalism platform threatening to “nose up the trousers” of power in Scotland. Based on in-depth interviews with members of The Ferret’s Board of Directors, the article explores the motivations behind the launch of the co-operative, examines its growth to date and critically assesses its prospects of achieving a sustainable future. It finds The Ferret was a response to three perceived crises: democratic, economic and ethical. Its founders call upon the traditions and mythology of journalism while seeking to offer a new version of what journalism might be. Funded mainly by subscriptions, The Ferret has achieved slow but steady growth, but only survives due to the subsidised labour of its core team. The organisation is now reaching a tipping point where, if it is to endure, it must expand beyond its journalistic base, while building a much fuller understanding of the nature and motivations of its paying audience.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of WhatsApp in everyday life, but also in relation with practices such as receiving, sharing and commenting on news is growing. However, due to its close or private nature, users' engagement with news is less obvious or harder to grasp on WhatsApp than on other social platforms. Drawing on practice theory, this research aims to address how WhatsApp users engage with news content, to identify if they are subject to incidental exposure, and how technological affordances, as well as individual and in-group social dynamics, shape these issues. The results of 6 focus groups highlight that on WhatsApp news is experienced by each user in an individual fashion, and news is used decontextualized from media brands. In fact, the sender seems to be the most influential element who determines how users engage with and trust media content. Furthermore, depending on the level of trust that the sender possesses, news is more likely to be endorsed or not. Finally, incidental exposure to ideologically diverse news content tends to happen in groups, particularly large groups, not in one-on-one chats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Comments in designated sections of newspaper websites and on social media platforms are the most prominent form of user participation in journalism, offering the opportunity to connect to the audience. Yet, rising levels of dark participation in the form of hate speech, disinformation, and strategic attempts to influence public opinion, provide new challenges for media organizations and require moderators to ensure a minimum of discursive quality. Newsrooms employ a variety of moderation strategies. Based on computer assisted telephone interviews with German journalists working for online newspapers (N = 274), we identified explanatory factors for the implementation of discursive-interactive and authoritative-interactive moderation practices. The results suggest that left-leaning media tend to engage more in authoritative-interactive as well as discursive-interactive moderation than right-leaning media. If media organizations establish a participative communicative setting, moderators engage more with the audience although the prevalence of dark participation is higher.",

    "abstract": "The prominence of “fake news” today has sparked an open challenge to the legitimacy of traditional news media. As a result, a series of independent data-driven organisations are emerging to fact-check legacy news media as well as other news sources. This study examines how these actors advocate and adopt journalistic practice and the perceived impact they have on news journalism. We draw our data from in-depth interviews with 14 practitioners working in three organisations—Code for Africa, Open Up and Africa Check—that are currently leading major data and fact-checking operations in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings show that while these non-journalistic actors are at the periphery of news media as institutions, their operations, activities and goals are at the heart of journalistic discourse. In their data strategies, they emerge as data advocates and activists seeking to reformulate fact-checking processes within news media.",

In order to achieve these objectives, firstly, all the Global Editors Network Data Journalism Awards were analysed with the purpose of detecting projects involving user-generated content. Secondly, La Nación was studied from an ethnographic perspective, as it is the medium with the most prizes in which citizen participation was detected. The results show that collaboration between media and audience can make large-scale journalism projects a reality, and also that citizens in Argentina are recruited by LN Data specially to boost political accountability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This commentary surveys and analyzes the flourishing field of alternative news audiences, whose values, attitudes and practices were previously underexamined by scholarship. Rauch discusses this new research as a response to significant recent shifts in the conceptualization of both audiences and alternative news, including recognition of their hybridity as well as their negative influences on democratic discourse. She interprets these trends in light of John D.H. Downing’s prescient warnings of two decades ago regarding a slippage toward binarism, a neglect of far-right or repressive media, and a conflation of technologies, genres and formats in media user research. This article synthesizes and extends findings about the contexts and consequences of hybrid news consumption, including those related to mutually reinforcing relationships between alternative and mainstream media and those addressing their potential to provoke intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. Rauch proposes several new directions for future research on alternative news reception, including extended comparison of national contexts and attention to audience attitudes regarding journalism reform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this introduction to the special issue Design + Journalism, we present a manifesto about the future of design and journalism. This manifesto discusses the key areas that need attention in order to develop a more robust bridge between design and journalism. The manifesto is structured by the following three notions: (1) Recognizing design contributions in the field; (2) Integrating design into digital journalism studies through cultural shift; and (3) Widening the scope of the journalism design industry-academia interface. First, we argue that design artifacts, requirements, methods, and implications ought to be recognized as scholarly contributions in digital journalism studies. Second, we need a profound cultural shift in digital journalism studies, which entails conceptualizing design as a cultural practice, understanding design as a continuous process of shaping, and updating pedagogical approaches. Third, we argue that transversal integration between academia and industry should be more heterogeneous in terms of geopolitics, cultural norms, and values. A varied set of industries should be engaged beyond North America and Western Europe. We argue that integrating these three aspects in digital journalism studies will strengthen the understanding of design as an integral part of journalism and digital journalism studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper considers new and old challenges to journalism production and education, focusing on the rising field of mobile journalism. The article examines how journalism schools are adapting to the increasing integration and proliferation of mobile technologies within journalism production and consumption, and the increasing trend to incorporate technical skills training within courses. In addition, it integrates the “mobilities paradigm” to insert questions about the social meanings and implications of the “mobile turn” within journalism and journalism education, exploring how mobile subjectivities are deeply embedded within and undergird mobile journalism and journalism education infrastructures. In all, while the technical skills of mobile journalism are important to training successful professional journalists, the analysis points toward a need for the re-definition and re-orientation of mobile journalism education toward the unequal power relations and broader and societal implications of mobile journalism whereby journalists’ labor is increasingly and contradictingly more precarious, immobile, and invisible than imagined within educational priorities.",

    "title": "EDITORIAL",
    "abstract": "Welcome to this first issue of Digital Journalism, a peer-reviewed, international journal published by Routledge, Taylor & Francis, designed to provide a critical forum for the scholarly discussion, analysis and responses to the wide-ranging implications of digital technologies for the practice and study of journalism. For those eager to read the articles in this launch issue, I promise to be brief. I do not intend that Editorials should be a routine part of the editorial mix in Digital Journalism since space is always at a premium in a busy journal; except for those published solely online. But I want to spend a little time unravelling the editorial ambitions for Digital Journalism by posing the six questions which typically inform journalists’ inquiries when researching and writing news stories: who? what? why? where? when? and occasionally, how?—although not necessarily in that order. But let’s get on! Why is there a need for a new journal? I think the answer here may seem fairly self-evident, to the great majority of journalists and scholars of journalism who have become increasingly aware, across the last few years, of fundamental changes which have been restructuring all aspects of journalism and journalism studies. And, because journalism is such a significant institution, these changes have in turn had implications for the economic, social, political and cultural life of communities and nations. The development of digital media technologies has been particularly crucial and radically altered virtually every aspect of news gathering, writing and reporting. The collapse of traditional business models to fund and resource a critical and independent journalism, as well as the absence of any widely accepted alternative funding strategy, has triggered a radical reshaping of journalists’ employment, their work places, products, role perceptions, ethical values and ways of working. These important changes challenge traditional assumptions in journalism practice, but also journalism scholarship and education, make definitional boundaries fluid and suggest reassessment of even the most fundamental questions such as “Who is a journalist?” and “What is Journalism?” So these changes in journalism have already proved significant, fundamental, wide-ranging and, for journalists and scholars of journalism studies, intriguing, challenging, sometimes alarming, but always fascinating. I believe that the absence of a journal devoted to exploring these developments in journalism has constituted an extraordinary omission in scholarly publishing provision within the field of journalism studies and I am delighted that Routledge, Taylor & Francis have decided to try to fill that gap. What are the editorial ambitions for Digital Journalism? In broad terms they are no more than twofold. First, Digital Journalism intends to provide what journals have always offered readers and contributors, which is a place of intellectual companionship, a public discursive space in which common academic concerns can be addressed and in which argument and evidence can be tested; if necessary to destruction. So Digital Journalism will be a place for addressing common concerns with scholars and journalists who share a similar interest and enthusiasm for journalism studies but without any whiff of orthodoxy. In short, a place where scholars and researchers can “hang out” or “hang their intellectual hat”. Second, because the pace of change has been rapid and looks set to continue at some considerable if not accelerating pace, it is important to",

    "abstract": "Just under a decade ago the term “churnalism” moved into mainstream journalism discourse, describing in less-than-complimentary terms the recycling process of news production which drew increasingly on wire service copy and public relations (PR) subsidies. Davies’ 2008 book Flat Earth News and Cardiff University researchers Lewis, Williams, and Franklin (2008) were to popularise the term that would become part of the vernacular of an industry on the brink of major change. To be fair, the concept of “churn” and churnalists was earlier coined by Tony Harcup in his book Journalism (Harcup 2004), in which he cites BBC journalist Waseen Zakir’s description of how wire service copy had eroded original news production. However, the “assembly line in the news factory” and the “two primary conveyor belts” of wire services and PR (Davies 2008, 74) were to be seared into the journalistic psyche forever by Davies’ polemic, which laid the blame of churnalism on the “dark arts”, “pseudo-events” and out-ofcontrol commercialism.",

    "abstract": "This study concerns Twitter use by 26 news entities with the largest online audiences in the United States. A quantitative content analysis compared interactive characteristics of posts on news organizations’ main Twitter accounts. Most of the tweets included hyperlinks to articles posted on the news organizations’ websites along with text about the articles and a photograph or other still image. Differences existed between news organizations in the use of such hyperlinks to their own websites, as well as socially and technically interactive functions of Twitter such as retweets, @mentions, hashtags, and multimedia. Tweets with interactive characteristics seemed intended mainly for the purpose of promoting news organizations’ programming or content.",

    "abstract": "Newspaper sports beat reporters have experienced challenges to their workflow as social media, such as Twitter, has emerged as an essential tool in the reporting of live-game events. The purpose of this study was to assess the ways newspaper sports beat reporters meet consumers’ needs for information during these live events. Using retweets and likes as measures of engagement, this study found that newspaper sports beat reporters’ Twitter content during live-game coverage was liked and retweeted more frequently when it included analysis, opinion, entertainment, and visual content. By contrast, tweets containing only play-by-play outcomes were retweeted and liked significantly less than average. This study suggests that newspaper sports beat reporters should capitalize on their exclusivity and insider access to create Twitter content beyond mere play-by-play results that are typically available to those following the game through more traditional means such as television, radio, or in person. These strategies could distinguish newspaper sports beat reporters in an increasingly crowded sports media landscape. These findings may also be applied to the work of journalists beyond the sports realm.",

In this article, we examine what affordances of digital news sites are present or absent. Based on the perspectives of Gibson’s ecological psychology and his conceptualizations of affordances, as well as Norman’s theorizing of signifiers, we conducted an exploratory study with loyal digital news readers to query their reliance on a number of affordances. We compared those findings to the affordances realized in print and argued that many signals supporting sense-making of the print news are attenuated in digital. Implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing use of recommender systems to provide personalized news delivery influences media systems worldwide. Using different data sources to predict what content will be interesting for specific readers, recommender systems can better accommodate individual information needs, but also raise concerns about potential audience fragmentation. However, current assessments of the effects of news personalization are predominantly based on observations from Western democracies. This Western-centric approach raises concerns about these assessments’ applicability to other contexts, in particular non-democratic ones, and brings to question the influence of prevalent Western conceptualisations of news personalization (e.g., filter bubbles) on attitudes towards it in non-Western countries. To address this gap, we scrutinize discussions of the promises and threats of news personalization in countries characterized by limited press freedom: Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Using document analysis, we examine how three categories of actors—academics, journalists and IT specialists—discuss news personalization and the ways it can affect the public sphere. Through our analysis we uncover how Western conceptualisations of news personalization interact with discussions about it in non-democratic media systems and scrutinize whether existing concerns about personalization are applicable to non-Western contexts.",

    "abstract": "This study maps the emerging digital media landscape of online-native news sites in Latin America, interrogating to what extent these sites challenge mainstream, traditional journalism. Researchers identified and analyzed the region’s online-native sites, exploring their influence and “alternativeness”—in terms of ownership, funding, content, degree of activism, and organizational goals—and their “digital-ness,” in terms of the sites’ inclusion of multimedia, interactive, and participatory digital features. In general, results show that the most influential online-native sites are attempting to renovate traditional, outdated modes of journalism, serving as alternatives to mainstream media and aiming to change society, even if the sites do not necessarily self-identify as “alternative” per se. Their emphasis on using innovative, digital techniques is important for re-conceptualizing not just the role of journalism in a digital era, but also journalism’s relationship to alternative media and activism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing influence of computation on news has intensified the need for an analytical framework that describes the common foundations of different computational approaches to journalism. This article proposes such a framework, founded on the concept of units of journalistic knowledge smaller than the article, expressed partially or completely as structured data and positioned along a continuum of news artifacts. The emerging practice of structured journalism and its use of “atomized” news is described and is presented as an embodiment of the framework. Different approaches to the use of computation within journalism are then positioned as specific instances of that practice. This conception, analogous to “semantic unit” paradigms currently emerging in other information-centric domains, is then used to reinterpret several of journalism’s urgent problems. A research agenda for developing computational journalism as an editorial activity within an increasingly data-centric communication environment is proposed, and several implications of the conception are discussed.",

    "abstract": "How do users rate the journalistic quality of different formats and services on the internet? To answer this question a survey was conducted in which 1000 German internet users evaluated 11 formats and services. The participants were recruited through an online panel and were matched with the general distribution of the population with respect to age, gender, and education level. In summary, the results show that internet users perceive distinct differences between formats and services and in most cases prefer professional journalism. Therefore, it is unlikely that competition exists between journalism, social media, and news search engines. The majority of the respondents believed that press websites best embodied features such as credibility, regular reporting, and timeliness. Although Wikipedia, television station websites, and radio station websites received fewer top votes, they were still rated significantly higher than all other services. Users still perceive professional journalism in the traditional gatekeeper and agenda-setting role. However, if users are actively in search of specific information or reports about special areas of interest, they prefer news search engines and Wikipedia. News search engines and portals with news are especially well suited for orienting users on the internet and the spontaneous discovery of interesting topics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article reports a case study on how government-sponsored native advertising influences everyday practices of journalism and journalists’ role identification in China. The process is the result of the state attempt to centralize control in response to digitalization that is, changing the press landscape. Building on social identity theory, we undertook an ethnographic fieldwork in a local party newspaper to observe how news organization and journalists make sense of the changes. Analyses show that, in addition to gains in material resources, the politics of native advertising also symbolizes new salient values for journalists whose professional identity swings between idealism and realism. The complexity of the phenomena under study reveals a plurality of meanings of the interplay among native advertising, journalistic routines, and the ever-shifting state-media relationship in China.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The coronavirus pandemic has been a battleground for China and the U.S. to score political points on international media. With outlets from both countries exemplifying distinct media systems, the coverage is very likely to differ between Chinese and U.S. media. Previous studies point to key differences across the two, with Chinese media being more pro-government, more focussed on the African community, and less reliant on reporting that emphasizes personal stories and negative economic impacts. Using visual framing as a theoretical lens, this study explores the intersection of soft power and journalism in Xinhua and Voice of America's (VOA) visual coverage of the coronavirus pandemic on Instagram. A quantitative and qualitative visual analyses of 1911 photographs reveals that Xinhua serves as a prototypical soft power media organization that projects pro-government narratives and downplays negative economic and social consequences of the crisis, while VOA operates as an aggregator of content from predominantly Western sources that viewers can consume elsewhere, hence making its coverage redundant and likely less effective and coherent. The study discusses the implications of both photojournalistic approaches on the global media market.",

    "title": "Stronger and Safer Together: Motivations for and Challenges of (Trans)National Collaboration in Investigative Reporting in Latin America",
    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the growing scholarship on investigative journalism in Latin America, very few studies have addressed collaboration across newsrooms in the region. By analyzing the responses of 251 journalists who work for investigative units in Latin American news outlets, this study explores a) the reasons why Latin American journalists are increasingly seeking to participate in national and transnational collaborative enterprises, b) the challenges they identify, and c) the role digital technologies are playing in this trend of transnational collaboration. Using mixed methods, we found that collaborations occur to enhance the impact of investigative projects, to reach larger audiences, and to achieve a big-picture coverage. We also found that safety is an important motivation to work in conjunction with other newsrooms—by collaborating, journalists are able to strengthen security measures and challenge censorship. Yet, coordinating teams—especially at the transnational level—remains the biggest challenge to overcome. Digital technologies are significantly related to reporters’ likelihood of collaborating, but these technologies require other reporting skills to be useful for investigative journalism. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unparalleled global crisis impacting both public and private life. In the situation of uncertainty, emotions run high and might compromise the public acceptance of and compliance with countermeasures tackling the crisis. Mass media play an integral part in communicating crisis measures and provide an institutionalised channel to diffuse relevant information to a broad audience. This is especially true for digital outlets of legacy media given the greater immediacy of coverage. In addition, digital news offers the unique opportunity for readers to engage with the news contents, allowing an analysis of the dynamics of emotional reactions to crisis news coverage. We explore the case of Austria as an early COVID-19 hotspot. We analyse digital news coverage of two high-circulation newspapers and the emotionality it prompted in user comments, based on a unique dataset comprising 38,253 articles and around 1.6 Million comments from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020. Results show increased emotionality during lockdown and towards the government. With reference to the rally around-the-flag literature, we interpret this as emotional rallying behind the responsible political crisis managers.",

    "title": "The Coronavirus Pandemic and the Transformation of (Digital) Journalism",
    "abstract": "When the first cases of an unknown virus disease were reported from the city of Wuhan in China, journalists from around the globe mostly treated it as a potentially worrying, but remote story, often somewhat hidden in the foreign news sections of the respective outlets . What seemed to be a relatively insignificant and controlled event far away, developed into a worldwide issue at breathtaking speed. The global pandemic not only became a central topic of journalistic coverage (Quandt et al. 2020), but it affected journalism itself: in its work and production routines, its news distribution and technology use, and even in its economic foundations and societal role. In that sense, the pandemic was different from other crises, as its impact was direct the object of the coverage became tangible and transformative for journalists as it did for everyone else. The traditional journalistic position of the detached, distanced and objective observer of “news from nowhere” (Epstein, 1973) became untenable, as all members of society—including journalists themselves—were directly affected by the “trauma on our doorstep” (Jukes, Fowler-Watt and Rees, in this special issue). As a result, journalists became co-represent witnesses to an unfolding and unprecedented crisis (Wahl-Jorgensen, forthcoming). As we have noted elsewhere, the Coronavirus pandemic therefore represented a critical moment for digital journalism (Quandt and Wahl-Jorgensen 2021). Here, we draw on the contributions to this special issue to make the case that the upheaval wrought by the pandemic ushered in transformations in the practices, texts and audiences of digital journalism, shaped by technological, social, political and economic responses and adaptions. However, even as these changes may have appeared sudden and dramatic, they did not come out of nowhere or emerge in isolation, but were instead enabled and accelerated by the condition of crisis. Now more than two years after the pandemic started, it has become apparent that some impacts on societies around the globe were profound and may have brought about lasting changes. In many countries, daily lives changed dramatically over the course of these two years. During the peak phases, social distancing measures and lockdowns, mask wearing, working from home, video conferencing and online education became the norm in many places. The adaption to “in-between” and “post-peak phases” with what were sometimes unclear regulations was also a source of personal stress and tension. On a societal level, there was a massive economic impact, rising unemployment in many countries, social tension and political turmoil. And there was a death toll that grew into the millions.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how bloggers link to and comment on news content and selected participatory sources. The extent of follow-up communication is explored through the analysis of the number of blog posts linking to topic-specific professional and citizen media content. In addition, the underlying network structure resulting from the bloggers’ linking behaviour as well as their interconnectedness is determined. Do bloggers refer to a broad range of viewpoints and do they evaluate and comment on linked material? It is contested whether actors participating in networked publics commonly match these standards. The underlying question is whether these media-related contributions lead to an effective and collaborative form of filtering which may help to reduce fragmentation risks. Through a combined content and network analysis of 323 blogs, this study reveals that bloggers primarily give attention to a limited and less diverse selection of articles on a given topic basis. All blogs in the sample were investigated in 2007 and revisited in 2010. They show a link connection to at least one of 545 articles from a major professional and a citizen media website in Germany. The research design allows a complete comparison of the media coverage and their reactions within blog posts.",

    "title": "Windows to the World: Imagining Flemish News Audiences and Their Views on Society through the Lens of News Repertoires",
    "abstract": "Abstract News media act as a window to the world. This window is now believed to be shrinking due to developments in digital media such as algorithmic personalization which restricts people to echo chambers in turn affecting citizens’ views on society. It is an example of the moral panics surrounding digital media and obfuscating underlying social dynamics at play. This article seeks to address this issue by looking at news use through the lens of news repertoires. Building on a representative survey of Dutch-speaking Belgian citizens, we identify four archetypical news repertoires (Limited – Panoramic – Traditional – Casual) and investigate how these relate to civic attitudes including civic (dis-) engagement, individualism, and ethnocentrism. In line with previous research, our study shows that age and socio-economic status significantly predict the constellation of one’s news repertoire. Furthermore, variances in news repertoires translate into small but significant differences in views on society, particularly between the media-rich Panoramic and media-poor Limited news repertoires regarding ethnocentrism. Finally, we discuss how in order to appease moral media panics, it is not only necessary to substantiate debates on media power with empirical insights on news use, but also to imagine news audiences in a more nuanced way.",

    "title": "E-Lancer Resistance",
    "abstract": "In 2009 and 2013, labor organizations of freelance journalists in Canada formed coalitions and initiated digital communications campaigns to boycott rights-grabbing freelancer contracts of the publishing conglomerate TC Media. These disputes reveal the ongoing industrial struggles over journalists’ copyrights, demonstrating tensions between the continuing control and devaluation of freelance labor to increase corporate profits as well as freelancers’ use of digital communications to resist the law of copyright. Through an examination of these tensions, the broader political-economic context and labor process of freelance work, and freelance journalists’ collective organizing, this paper develops a conception of the precarious “e-lancer,” a feminized and electronically connected class of journalists. The TC Media campaigns are situated within a broader history of freelancer struggles in North America and Western Europe. Since 1993, freelancers have adopted three refusal tactics: class-action lawsuits, contract boycotts, and strikes. Freelancers should not rely on these tactics and digital tools to facilitate them but rather use them, along with face-to-face and internal communications, to win the right to bargain collectively and address women’s disadvantaged position in freelancing. This paper ultimately demonstrates the central role that journalistic workers have played in attempting to recompose precarity and democratize communication in the evolving digital economy.",

    "title": "The State Deputizing Citizens to Discipline Digital News Media: The Case of the IT Rules 2021 in India",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines a recent regulation in India called the “Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021.” The Rules allow for filing of “grievances” – defined quite broadly – against digital news outlets, who are required to resolve them within a specific time frame or face legal action. This article analyzes the government’s press conference transcripts, PR materials, statements to the UN and in courts to articulate the purported rationale for the Rules: curbing fake news and ensuring that the press is accountable to the public. However, analysis of the meta-journalistic discourse shows how the Rules institutionalize online vigilantism in the name of “accountability.” These findings are contextualized by discussing the Indian media system and the related regulatory regime; and the rise of Hindu nationalism and online vigilantism. More broadly, this article illustrates how online harassment of journalists can involve a combination of grassroots mobilization and state-backed efforts; it underlines the urgency of studying how the “fake news” crisis is being instrumentalized to curb press freedom in the Global South; and it illustrates how press freedom assumes different meanings across a news media landscape segmented by language and geography, as in the case of India.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article brings together perspectives from digital media studies and journalism scholarship to propose a working definition of digital journalism that can guide scholarship and applied research in this field. We define digital journalism as “those practices of newsgathering, reporting, textual production and ancillary communication that reflect, respond to, and shape the social, cultural and economic logics of the constantly changing digital media environment.” We elaborate and illustrate this definition through a discussion of the co-evolving relationship of journalism with the Internet and social media platforms since the 2000s and outline in detail how social news outlets such as BuzzFeed are paradigmatic examples of these dynamics and relationships. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for both the study and practice of digital journalism in the public interest, especially in the context of an increasingly platformed and closed media system. We focus particularly on the methodological challenges and threat to public oversight that recent moves to platform enclosure and lockdown represent and provide some suggestions as to how these might be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article interrogates the relationship between epistemic authority and journalistic technology through the perspective of mechanical objectivity—a belief in technological systems capable of rendering a particular output in a manner that overcomes the limits of human subjectivity. By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Using semi-structured interviews with Chinese data journalists across party and commercial media, this article assesses the structure and practice of data journalism in China. In doing this, it responds to calls for further studies of data journalism in non-western contexts. It finds that Chinese data journalists face some of the same pressures and challenges that have been documented in other countries, including limited access to data and the constraints imposed by the screen-size of smartphones. However, these were often exacerbated through a combination of social and systemic factors - to the point that their impact is qualitatively and quantitatively different. Simultaneously, however, we find that in some cases Chinese data journalists, at least amongst party media, were protected from pressures such as audience demand, and encouraged to focus on state-of-the-art work. We conclude that what has emerged is a form of ‘data journalism with Chinese characteristics’, and that these characteristics emerge from the interactions between systemic, newsroom and social factors.",

    "abstract": "The provision of online news provides unique opportunities for users to interact with content and with other users. One of the more common forms of interactivity involves commenting on news stories. These interactive features are often heralded for enabling virtual public discussion of current events. Yet there exists a widespread belief that these spaces fail to meet that lofty goal, instead exhibiting hostile and vitriolic discourse, which undermines the deliberative potential of online interaction. At the same time, there is a lack of consensus among researchers regarding the proper conceptualization of hostility, and its more desirable counterpart, civility. This article aims to integrate normative and contextual conceptual definitions of hostility and civility in online interactions with the news. Building on these, we develop operational definitions of the two concepts and analyze the presence of hostile and civil discussion in user comments posted to YouTube news videos. Further, we explore the possibility that the content and source of those news videos, as well as popularity and engagement metrics, may explain the degree of hostility and civility in comments.",

    "title": "ONLINE NEWS CONSUMPTION",
    "abstract": "While media scholars tend to take “media use” as an indicator of popularity or diffusion, media use alone does not fully capture the complexity of online news consumption. For instance, given free online news offerings in most cases, consumers do not always use what they prefer, and most are not willing to pay for what they use. This study identifies from the literature three distinct factors—preference, use, and paying intent—as well as two key demographic variables—age and gender—each helping to explain a specific facet of online news consumption. While previous research has uncovered a number of relationships among these factors, a holistic model that weaves different empirical findings together is lacking. To address the interplay among the key factors, this study presents two theoretical models via structural equation modeling. The goal is to clarify the interrelationship among preference, use, and paying intent for online news, which helps to explain why most newspapers have difficulties monetizing online usage. Applying new conceptual and methodological approaches, this study synthesizes previous studies and advances research on the economics of online news consumption.",

    "abstract": "Sports journalism’s perceived proximity to fandom has posed professional problems relating to status, prestige and standards. Sports journalists are now seeing performative aspects of their occupational practice appropriated by fans using digital platforms. This paper outlines a study that involved in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK print sports journalists to explore what fan blogging has meant for their occupational identity. This study found sports journalists did not consider fan bloggers to be a threat to their professional distinctiveness. Bloggers seeking to emulate sports journalism’s daily beat routines were seen as conflictive. However, participants considered the occupation to be safeguarded by privileged accreditation to professional sport and access to resources. The study also discovered sports journalists held nuanced attitudes towards bloggers and did not necessarily see them as inferior. Sports journalists saw a value in bloggers with niche, writer-driven interests providing complementary content to mainstream media. Sports journalists could legitimise blogs through acceptance and adoption while asserting their own cultural dominance. There were positive indications this expansion and diversification of the sports section of print media websites could lead to a range of perspectives and exposure of marginal voices. Participants also indicated blogging had become an entry route into the occupation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Widespread concerns about the spread of misinformation have gained urgency during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and pose challenges for science journalism, in particular in the health area. This article reports on a Research through Design study exploring how to design a tool for helping readers of science journalism understand the strength and uncertainty of scientific evidence in news stories about health science, using both textual and visual information. A central aim has been to teach readers about criteria for assessing scientific evidence, in particular in order to help readers differentiate between science and pseudoscience. Working in a research-in-the-wild collaboration with a website for popular science, the study presents the design and evaluation of the Scientific Evidence Indicator, which uses metadata about scientific publications to present an assessment of evidence strength to the readers. Evaluations of the design demonstrate some success in helping readers recognize whether studies have undergone scientific peer review or not, but also point to challenges in facilitating a more in-depth understanding. Insights from the study point to a potential for developing similar tools aimed at journalists rather than directly at audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Citizens these days feel inundated with news online and are worried about its veracity. This study examines if these concerns in the digital news environment led to greater news avoidance and news authentication behaviors. The relationships were tested across 16 countries by combining individual-level survey data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report (N = 34,201) with country-level data based on comparative media systems research. Analysis from multilevel modeling showed that concern with fake news was related to news authentication and news fatigue was related to news avoidance. High news fatigue also accentuated the influence of concern with fake news on news avoidance while low fatigue attenuated the relationship. Additional cross-level interactions further contextualized the findings according to media system, showing how the relationships can vary under different conditions of press market, political parallelism, journalistic professionalism, and public service broadcasting. This study demonstrates the utility and importance of considering the contextual role of media system to understand individuals’ perceptions of news they receive online and subsequent news engagement, especially in the context of fake news research because its prevalence and deleterious impact varies across countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In order to reach its audiences, journalism regularly turns to social media to promote its articles. This study sets out to ascertain competing communicative logics of Facebook posts as opposed to article teasers on news outlets’ websites. We look at Scandinavian news outlets as a most-similar three-country case with at least a third of all news consumers regularly using Facebook for news. The study builds on an extensive data collection of all Scandinavian news outlets’ Facebook posts including their respective websites’ article teasers over the course of 11 months. We investigate the use of news text grammar (e.g., punctuation or the use of pronouns) and social media features (e.g., hashtags or the use of emojis) alongside structural influences from individual countries, outlet reach, and ownership. Findings show Facebook posts to include less punctuation while employing more calls to action through the use of question and exclamation marks. We conclude with a reinvigorated call for hierarchical considerations when investigating news outlets’ social media endeavours through editors’ experiences, available resources to a news outlet, and institutional willingness to align with audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines Nigerian journalists’ perception of the affordances of recommendation algorithms in news production and distribution on Opera News Hub. The study uses a triangulation of methods involving content analysis, a semi-structured interview, and a focus group discussion (FGD) with content creators, who have been trained in traditional media practices in Lagos, Nigeria. The findings indicate news stories published on the Hub contravene the platform’s publishing guidelines. The Hub’s recommender system is underpinned by “metricisation” of gatekeeping, which affords soft news over hard news. Hence, content creators of hard news compromise their journalistic autonomy and take on a new professional identity in which they engage in a constant struggle to produce sensational content that will attract audience engagement on Opera News Hub. However, there are indications that Opera News Hub may enhance media sustainability and the welfare of journalists in Nigeria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Platform journalism in China shows a number of distinctive characteristics. This study employs Tenenboim and Kligler-Vilenchik’s concept of “meso news-space” and extends it from the social dimension to the institutional dimension to analyze peripheral news production by private digital news organizations on social media platforms in China. Based on interviews with 17 digital news practitioners and onsite participant observation, it reveals that such organizations practice peripheral news production by redefining news and using of strategic collaborations to build a “dual legitimacy”. Their news production tends to follow a nonconfrontational approach emphasizing traffic priority over public interest, so that their contribution to the publicity of the news space is limited. These findings illuminate the particular context of the Chinese meso news-space by examining peripheral news production and the process of building a meso news-space in non-Western media landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article contributes to broadening the understanding of journalistic authority by focusing on the example of local journalism startups in the UK, on the basis of in-depth interviews. The research suggests that for local journalism entrepreneurs, the establishment and maintenance of journalistic authority relies heavily on claims to knowledge of the local context and relationships of co-presence with the local community. As such, the epistemic foundations of the authority of local journalism entrepreneurs are particular to this form of journalistic practice, and closely linked to distinctive self-understandings. For these journalists, the relationship to the local is premised on a strong affective attachment to the material spaces of their communities, and the relationships and networks they have built within them. The paper proposes that the authority of local journalism entrepreneurs is premised on their witnessing in the context of co-presence. The long-standing presence of these journalists, and their resulting visibility and accountability, form the basis for the trust vested in them by their communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Political actors have increasingly incorporated digital advertising into their persuasive efforts. Greater transparency of how political actors are using digital ads is necessary given concerns that they may be using digital ads to suppress voter turnout and spread disinformation and xenophobia. We apply a human-centered design framework to identify the design requirements necessary to create tools that satisfy journalists’ needs for covering digital political ads. Based on interviews with journalists, our findings indicate that they are interested in covering how political actors are using digital advertising as well as reporting on the platforms, such as their policies. Our findings also reveal serious obstacles that impede journalists’ ability to effectively cover digital political advertising. From the currently available tools, journalists we interviewed found it difficult to quickly identify key takeaways that could result in or contribute to stories. Journalists also need information that the most popular technology platforms do not offer. Supporting journalists’ efforts to provide greater transparency of digital political ads will require a collective effort on the part of designers and technology platforms to provide information that journalists need via tools that surface and synthesize this information in a way that satisfies journalists’ professional demands.",

    "title": "Portrait of the Online Local News Audience",
    "abstract": "With resources for local journalism outlets on the decline and the use of digital tools on the rise, there has been greater consideration of the audience among journalists, editors, and foundations. Recent research on news audiences has focused on the industry-driven concern of the impact of technology on news audience practices and routines as well as about the civic journalism concern about the ability of local news to meet critical information needs and to offer space for “public connection.” However, a limited amount of current scholarship addresses a qualitative understanding of the social contexts for local US news audiences’ habits and beliefs. Drawing upon data from six focus groups across three communities, this paper highlights three collective narratives on local news audience practices generated by participants, which we have labeled: (1) self-reliant news consumer, (2) lack of citizen journalism, and (3) continued importance of interpersonal networks. These collective narratives may provide insights into the nature of local news audiences and point to avenues for future research.",

    "title": "Engineering Consent",
    "abstract": "As the reach and influence of audience analytics tools continue to grow in newsrooms, a burgeoning body of scholarship conceptualizes them as a form of managerial surveillance that seeks to standardize journalistic work and render it more reliably profitable. While workers in many contexts have been found to resist the rationalization of their labor process, existing research suggests that journalists have become increasingly amenable to—and even powerfully fixated on—the analytics dashboards that quantitatively monitor their performance and rank them against their peers. Drawing on six months of ethnographic observation and interviews at a leading newsroom analytics startup, this article examines the discursive strategies and design elements employed by analytics companies to engineer journalists’ consent to analytics-driven labor discipline. These include performing deference to editorial judgment, professing allegiance to journalism’s institutional norms, and providing a habit-forming user experience. Such tactics enable the newsroom analytics dashboard to extract increased productivity from journalist-users—and to do so in a way that obfuscates, rather than highlights, managerial influence in the newsroom. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research on the rationalization of journalistic work in the digital age.",

    "title": "Newsbots That Mediate Journalist and Audience Relationships",
    "abstract": "Abstract News media organisations are experimenting with a new generation of newsbots that move beyond automated headline delivery to the delivery of news according to a conversational format within the context of private messaging services. To build the newsbot, journalists craft statements and answers to users’ questions that mimic a natural conversation between a journalist and user. In so doing, journalists are experimenting with styles of communication that reflect very particular journalistic personas. We investigate the persona of the news chatbot created by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the better to understand how the public broadcaster’s forays into social media service delivery and automation are shaping new relationships between public service broadcasters and their audiences. We find that, for a section of the audience that uses it, the friendly newsbot contrasts favourably with their previous experience with news and the journalists who produce it. The public service journalists who operate the bot are, in turn, using the bot to try to reach new audiences by experimenting with a more informal, intimate relationship with citizen users. The supposedly “intelligent” (but in actual fact very much human-crafted) newsbot is the vehicle through which this new relationship is being forged.",

    "abstract": "The article focuses on innovation and social media strategies in newspaper companies in the US and three Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Norway and Denmark). Many previous studies have focused on the state of journalism and media industry in single countries, although media have distinct features in different countries. Through the comparative setting, it is possible to examine the differences in media innovation strategies and study what factors affect innovation in media production, business models, sources of funding, and social media strategies. The qualitative part of the paper consists of semi-structured in-depth interviews (N = 65) with media managers and experts, which were carried out in Scandinavia in 2016 and in the US in 2017. The quantitative market data covers the years 2006–2016; this timespan corresponds well with the accelerating digital transition in the newspaper business. According to the results, new business models are mostly new combinations of existing revenue streams, while adaptation of new technology is slow, with few exceptions.",

    "abstract": "The question “what is news?” has been a topic of scholarly examination for more than 60 years as researchers have sought to develop and revise the taxonomy of news values to inform journalism education and wider public debates on the subjectivity of journalists. However, these studies have focused on legacy print and broadcast media even when attempting to bring their findings into the digital era by examining online content. To date, there has been limited research, in the UK and internationally, on news values on digitally born news websites – platforms that only exist online such as Huffington Post, Buzzfeed News and LADbible, which are consumed by a third of the UK population at least once a week. A significant impediment is the complexity of mapping offline latent coding methods to fluid online content. Digital native websites are particularly problematic due to their varied appearance across platforms – desktop, tablet and mobile – and their multiple access points – via web browser, social media and App. Yet, content analysis has a rich history dating back to the clergy's examination of newspapers in the late 1600s and the method has proved to be an adaptable tool for measuring news output as each new media technology has emerged. This paper argues that it is imperative that researchers look beyond legacy media when studying digital news values due to the growing significance of digital native news websites in the marketplace. The secondary purpose of this methodological paper is to highlight the challenges of capturing and analysing news values on digital native news platforms and suggest how researchers can begin to tackle the complexities of liquid content analysis in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerial filming is ubiquitous in contemporary media and drones have been heralded as “game-changers” in the news industry. However, very little academic research appears to have investigated the claim. This research uses a transnational multiple case study to produce a semiotic and discourse analysis which shows how drone images are being used to produce meaning and whether they present challenges to quality journalism. The article examines the content and effect of drone shots in five edited video news items, from USA, Kenya, South Africa, Syria and the Philippines. The research shows that UAVs are instrumental not only in bringing viewers closer to the story but also in distancing them. It suggests that, contrary to some predictions, the use of drones is not revolutionising newsgathering, but is presenting a number of new perspectives, some of which threaten quality journalism. Empirical data indicate that drones are used more often to provide news context than content, and that the use of aerial footage encourages style over substance. The article also demonstrates that “drone journalism” is a potentially rich field of academic study.",

    "title": "Signalling and Expressive Interaction: Online News Users’ Different Modes of Interaction on Digital Platforms",
    "abstract": "Abstract Online news users interact with news on digital platforms in different ways. Some take advantage of the technical affordances that allow sharing, liking and commenting, while others do not. Based on a national survey of the Australian adult online news users, this study explores online news users’ different modes of interaction on digital platforms: non-interaction, signalling interaction, and expressive interaction. This study demonstrates that different types of online news users are largely determined by a combination of structural influences and individual factors related to the uptake, reception, and dissemination of news. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on news engagement by exploring the concept of interaction as a more specific term to describe online news behaviours, and identifies different types of news users connected to, rather than disembodied from, their practice. In doing so, this article advances the understanding of news consumption behaviour and its implications for engaging news audiences in the digital age.",

    "title": "Exploring “Angry” and “Like” Reactions on Uncivil Facebook Comments That Correct Misinformation in the News",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the effect that uncivil news engagement comments that correct misinformation on a news story posted on Facebook have on newsreaders’ perceptions and attitudes. This study also considers whether social reactions, such as a “like” or an “angry” posted on correcting comments, will influence newsreaders’ perceptions and attitudes. Results from a survey experiment (N = 873) in the United States show that if comments that correct misinformation are uncivil, they led newsreaders to perceive the correcting comments and the commenters who posted them less favourably, although no effects on perceptions of the credibility of the news story itself were found. In addition, we found that uncivil correcting comments increased dislike for the political out-group in some instances unless they were marked with an “angry” social reaction. The “angry” reaction reversed the effect of the incivility, leading to decreased dislike for the out-group. Our findings advance digital journalism studies related to news engagement by showing the effects of incivility in corrections of misinformation and explaining how social reactions may alter the effect of these corrections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the mid-to-late 1990s, readers reacted to journalistic accounts of the world around them, from sending emails to posting to message boards on newspaper sites. Some of these practices, especially positive suggestions of sources and conversations with reporters, represent an earlier time’s web-optimism, now perhaps lost. This article will explore how design practices, including integrated forums, tabs, indexes and other early site design conventions—sometimes intentional, sometimes not— led to the first generation of online interactions between readers and news workers in the United States, and, to some degree, in the United Kingdom and Canada. This project will explore examples of in-situ design hopes surrounding these early digital connections, and why and how some of that enthusiasm failed to make it into the 2000s and beyond.",

    "title": "Communicating a Local Journalism Crisis Online: How Media Workers Frame Industry Changes",
    "abstract": "This article examines how newsworkers’ trade unions framed industry and newswork changes on their websites and Twitter in the United States between 2015 and 2022 as unionization increased. Grounded in critical political economy of journalism and social movement studies of industrial relations, this study conducts a frame analysis of unionization announcements ( N = 141) from the Writers Guild of America, East, and The NewsGuild. This analysis is supported by interviews ( N = 32) with unionized newsworkers and a union organizer. Unionization announcements are aimed at employers, newsworkers, and the general public. This article builds an integrated conceptual framework on how unions use online communicative framing to strategically express a local journalism crisis narrative online in these announcements and the internal organizational process shaping their narrative. The analysis reveals a hybrid union-oriented narrative, reflecting unions’ unique circum-stances and heterogeneous perceptions of industry and workforce changes. This narrative blends elements from the competing business-oriented, financialization, and labor-oriented narratives, emphasizing labor concerns. These findings offer insights into unions’ conciliatory communication strategies that have the potential to shape their power struggles with management. They high-light the need to consider the influence of online organizing and social media on framing narratives since the digital era.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores an effort to direct state-level public funds toward journalism by using a national policy window combined with an intensive grass-roots effort. We use the lens of Kingdon’s policy process model to showcase dynamics that contribute to the media policymaking literature. The process and enactment of New Jersey’s 2018 Civic Information Consortium bill are analyzed using a combination of archival research and oral history, highlighting the efforts of policy entrepreneurs and knowledge-brokers, who served as key advocates for the bill’s passage. However, they faced strong oppositional political factors that dampened their efforts; specifically, a policy window narrowed by institutional pushback and the tradition of conservative opposition to public funding of media limited the ultimate outcome for the novel initiative. Looking at implications for policymaking and media, the results provide a framework for a new model of public funding for journalism, but the case study also highlights the headwinds facing these types of policy initiatives, at least in the current political climate.",

    "abstract": "This study uses Bourdieu’s field theory to examine differences and similarities in digital practices among regional news organizations. Findings from interviews and field observations indicate that online journalism is fragmented in the region, with newsrooms operating on their own beliefs and interpretations. The variance can be explained by such factors as differences in managerial approaches, organizational culture, external factors, and history of the field. In addition, respondents saw online news as simplified journalism, or as a first draft of a story that has the potential to be published in the print edition. In the language of field theory, reporters do not perceive online journalism as providing cultural or symbolic capital, and there is little evidence that it offers economic capital.",

    "title": "Towards a Classification of Participatory News Websites",
    "abstract": "Participatory news websites are a large, heterogeneous, and dynamic object of research which has been difficult to systematize scientifically. This paper presents an integrative instrument for classification and an evidence-based typology of participatory news websites. On the one hand, it extracts seven heuristic types from academic literature. On the other hand, it presents three empirical types which emerged as clusters from an analysis of 101 websites: Exclusive Thematic Dossiers, Commercial User Playgrounds, and Local Media Clippings. A comparison of the heuristic and empirical types shows that they are only partially congruent. It is concluded that the existing heuristic types should be relabeled in order to reflect reality more precisely.

    "abstract": "This article presents the findings of an exploratory piece of research focusing on contributors to the participatory news photo agency Citizenside (launched in France in 2006 and based on a business-to-business model, equivalent to iReport, Blottr, or Demotix). The authors have studied the viewpoints of contributors themselves, through an online questionnaire and through in-depth interviews. The responses help to identify the profiles, practices, and motivations of so-called citizen photojournalists. Contrary to bloggers or users regularly commenting on online news articles—which research has often scrutinized since the mid-2000s to understand better online areas of participation—the active audiences or publics producing news images are driven by logics which remain poorly known, if not stereotyped. Several features showing the shift from ordinary to organized practices are discussed in the paper, including the minor use of smartphones as well as the importance of the preparatory fieldwork versus the minority of events captured “by chance.” In this respect, the motivations and profiles of Citizenside’s contributors go further than citizenship aspects, as they behave actually as independent eye-witnesses and photographers/videographers, some of whom are even remunerated. Therefore, in the authors’ view, these publics, considered as “amateurs” from afar, are in fact driven by (semi-)professional logics.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that though loosely configured and encapsulating a variety of approaches, the “slow journalism” movement offers a useful set of techniques and tools for critiquing the way print and television news currently represents the US–Mexico border. Working against the sensationalism and lack of introspection in contemporary news media, slow journalism advocates champion projects that focus on developing innovative techniques for providing deeper coverage of social issues. Drawing on Borderland: Dispatches from the US–Mexico Border, a multimedia collaboration launched by National Public Radio’s (NPR) Morning Edition staff and the Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR) in 2014, I will address the interaction between two complementary “slow” strategies: an ethnographic strategy that draws heavily on extensive interviews with individuals whose everyday lives are affected by border issues and an analytical strategy featuring visualizations created by processing large datasets related to annual seizure figures, ownership information, and demographics of border crossers Drawing on content analyses of newspapers and television programs on the US–Mexico border, in-depth interviews with staff members from NPR and the CIR, and a visual/textual analysis of the Borderland website, I hope to advance a strategy that incorporates multiple genres of journalistic coverage together in order to deepen and sharpen news’ investigative potential.",

    "title": "On the Margins: Exploring Minority News Media Representations of Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately negative affect on women, especially women from minoritized groups. Minority news media are an important information source for these groups, when it comes to providing alternative views, and health related information. Whilst the poor representation of women in COVID-19 related mainstream news coverage is acknowledged, little is known regarding the representation of women in digital minority news content, during the pandemic and beyond. Considering this gap, we examine how women have been represented within a diverse corpus of minority news, and explore how these representations serve to bridge between different social groups. Critically analyzing the representation of these marginalized groups offers a lens through which we can better understand the function of minority news media in a democracy. Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines three online minority newspapers and one podcast from the US. Findings show that women are covered in an inclusive and empowering way, containing perspectives and concerns unique to the minority group, strengthening identities, platforming community-specific issues, communicating a call to action, and promoting intersectional solidarity. These representations also reveal the complex tensions between counterhegemonic and dominant publics which minority news media sources constantly negotiate through their content.",

    "abstract": "While new digital technologies offer mainstream journalism in Africa (and elsewhere) alternative opportunities to engage and deliver content to their audiences, few studies have explored their disruptive implications to the practice of the profession. This study thus confronts the normative dilemmas and challenges facing Zimbabwean print journalism in the era of the rapid proliferation and appropriation of new digital technologies. It specifically explores how the appropriation of the internet and the mobile phone by Zimbabwean print journalists has contributed to a transformation of the profession at a number of levels, including news sourcing routines, and the structuring of the working day. While broadly affirming findings from previous studies, the paper submits that the information society era has spawned a number of localised professional dilemmas that border around copyright infringements as well as concerns relating to the invasion of journalists’ personal space and privacy. It contends that despite the wide-ranging resources and technological possibilities emerging with new digital technologies in Zimbabwe, their appropriation in journalism (and in everyday life) presents several unsettling challenges and modifications to the profession.",

    "title": "Collective Social Correction: Addressing Misinformation through Group Practices of Information Verification on WhatsApp",
    "abstract": "Abstract Recent years show a growing concern about the spread of misinformation on social media. One of the avenues to address this challenge is the practice of social correction—the correction of misinformation conducted by other social media users. While social correction focuses on individuals in the context of their respective social media networks, we offer the concept of collective social correction: an ongoing practice of information verification, occurring within group contexts. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we examine collective social correction by analysing the case study of a large-scale Israeli WhatsApp group, led by a journalist, and devoted to informal discussion of politics and news. Our findings point at the importance of active, discursive processes of information verification in the current media environment, particularly when it comes to political (mis)information. The study further highlights the role of group dynamics and group norms—modelled by the behaviour of everyday participants as well as of the group admin—in promoting the adoption of journalistic practices of fact-checking and source vetting and increasing participant accountability. Finally, the paper considers to what extent the interplay between social dynamics and information verification processes can inform our understanding of other, non-specialized group contexts as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital entrepreneurism is often depicted as a positive disruption in the news ecosystem; it initiates new business models, fosters new ways of storytelling, and enables closer interaction with audiences. The extent to which entrepreneurial journalism entails a disruption of journalistic norms, roles, and procedures remains a matter of debate. Against this background, our study aims to explore how news entrepreneurism impacts journalistic autonomy on an organizational as well as an individual level. Conceptually, we define four dimensions of journalistic autonomy, namely organizational and procedural autonomy, as well as autonomy regarding professional norms and external influences such as funding and audiences. Empirically, we conducted interviews with founders of and journalists at 12 news startups in Germany. Our results indicate that both groups perceive a high level of autonomy in relation to professional norms and working procedures, and experience only little pressure from external influences. Still, the struggle for solid financing as well as the duality of economic and editorial duties limit both founders’ and journalists’ autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Audience expectations of journalism reveal how well journalism is performing its role in society in the minds of its consumers. In an increasingly fragmented media and audience landscape, it has become more important to consider how social identity shapes audience expectations. However, scholarship has tended to examine expectations based on single identity categories (e.g., class or gender), revealing a crucial but disassembled understanding of how audiences perceive the journalism they consume. This study relies on an intersectional framework and eight focus groups to examine how class, race, and gender, as intersecting and mutually constitutive modes of power/oppression, shape audiences’ expectations of journalism in South Africa. It identifies intersectional differences in audiences’ expectations of solutions journalism, perceptions of journalism’s unaffordability and inaccessibility, and normative evaluations of quality and popular journalism that reveal classist and racist discourses of distinction and stereotyping. The study demonstrates the importance of intersectionality as a critical framework for studying audience expectations and the extent to which they are in/excluded and rendered (in)visible to journalism’s dominant ideology.",

    "abstract": "This study performs comparative and longitudinal analyses of the domestic and overseas consumption (measured by time-spent-reading and popularity) of UK national newspaper brands across their print editions and online channels (excluding mobile “apps”). The study estimates that, in 2011, a minimum of 96.7 per cent of the time spent with newspapers by their domestic audience was in print, with “popular/tabloid” titles least successful in capturing audience attention online. In terms of popularity, the print channel accounted for a majority of domestic daily readers: in 2011 the newspapers studied had an estimated average daily readership per print copy of 2,110,633. By contrast, the average number of online sessions per day was estimated to be between 385,156 and 709,559. Nearly half the newspapers may have increased their aggregated domestic print and online popularity between 2007 and 2011, although those increases have not translated—with one exception—into increases in time spent with those brands. The online channel has increased newspapers’ daily overseas audience by between 7 and 16 times. However, because those online readers’ visits are relatively brief, the effect on the attention newspapers receive (measured in time) from overseas has been minimal. In fact, two-thirds of the newspapers for which the most recent data were available suffered decreases in the time their overseas readers spent with their print and online channels between 2008/9 and 2011.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Throughout the current global health crisis, false and misleading content has proliferated on social media. Previous research indicates that users of social media primarily share information that contains attention-grabbing elements. Because sensationalist elements are prevalent in disinformation, this study examines the role of sensationalism in supporting disinformation. We conducted survey experiments in six countries (N = 7,009), presenting versions of a false claim that differed in their degree of sensationalism. We varied three contextual conditions for disinformation support: whether respondents grew up in a tabloid-oriented national news culture, whether they indicated individual usage preferences for tabloid and alternative media, and how they rated their situational uncertainty during the pandemic. Our results show a weak influence of tabloidized cultures, but people who frequently use tabloid or alternative media are more likely to agree with disinformation. Users who are uncertain about what is true and what is false are also more likely to agree with disinformation, especially when it is presented sensationally. The average user, however, is more likely to agree with disinformation that is presented neutrally. This finding is concerning, as disinformation presented in a sober manner is much harder to detect by those who want to fight the “infodemic.”",

    "title": "Restructuring Democratic Infrastructures: A Policy Approach to the Journalism Crisis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Democracy requires a free press. However, most people rarely reflect on the requisite infrastructures and policies that maintain a healthy press system. Today, as we look to journalism to protect us against misinformation and authoritarianism, the press is in a structural crisis. Journalism’s institutional support is collapsing, leaving entire regions and issues uncovered at a time when we desperately need reliable information and robust reporting. The crisis is disproportionately harming specific groups and regions, especially communities of color, rural areas, and lower socio-economic neighborhoods. This article addresses key policy issues that are central to the future of journalism, including those connected to media ownership, broadband policy, and the rise of new digital monopolies such as Facebook. It concludes with a call for designing a new public media system in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Through the lens of theories of field and normalization process, this research seeks to understand technology’s current role in how self-identifying digital journalists define the field. The definitions of digital journalism/journalists and what constitutes digital journalism practices are essential–they shape a range of crucial activities including how journalists prioritize sources to how journalists shape their content for audience consumption. Built on long-form interviews with 68 U.S.-based self-identifying digital journalists, this article argues that the digital turn in the industry has emboldened new entrants to the field and required dominantly placed legacy media journalists to reconsider their definition of journalism as well as their practices. Rather than seeing digital journalism as a sub-field within journalism, participants saw digital journalism as business-as-usual throughout the journalistic field.",

    "abstract": "Today’s online news environment has made it easy to select outlets covering the topics one is interested in and the political viewpoints one shares. Previous research often examined either the diversity of news content or the audience’s choices. This study of online news use in Austria does both to assess audience selectivity systematically. It first investigates the topics and bias of news sites based on a content analysis (N = 2069), before survey data (N = 2829) are used to investigate how far online news users select outlets that match their preferences. Content differences exist to some extent, but people hardly match them with their personal preferences. We conclude that, across the population, there is a substantive interest in general-interest digital journalism. In contrast to what selective exposure research suggests, factors other than interests and orientation might guide the choice for a specific news site.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a recent commentary, Seth Lewis calls for a “rethinking” of the “objects and objectives” of journalism studies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst not underestimating the significant effects of this ongoing global health crisis, the authors of this commentary do not share the sense of urgency for revising the field on such a broad scale. We wish to raise three key points that criticize and supplement Lewis’ reflections in light of existing debates in and beyond journalism studies and digital journalism studies in particular. These concern (1) the assumption that news journalism is relevant independent of its orientation towards audiences, an assumption that is problematized especially in digital journalism studies, (2) the overlooked importance of journalism education in a global perspective to create impact of research, and (3) the problematic assumption of a common identity of journalism studies scholars across the field as such. In this reply, the authors wish to make a pledge towards a greater importance of diversity in relation to global journalism studies and the importance of the field of digital journalism studies to realize such an ambition.",

    "abstract": "Proximity is an ambiguous journalistic notion for which there is no single definition. In this article, we re-evaluate the relevance and use of the concept in the digital news environment. Based on interviews with journalists in Finland and audience focus groups in Finland and the United Kingdom, we ask how new forms of visual amateur production incorporated into professional news journalism have transformed the concept. The concept of proximity has evolved from being a criterion of news selection into a central imperative of news production aiming to engage audiences. Through the prism of amateur news imagery, proximity appears as a spatio-temporal, emotional and strategic keyword.",

    "abstract": "This article examines crowdsourcing as a knowledge-search method and an open journalistic practice in digital journalism. The study draws on data from four cases in which professional journalists used crowdsourcing in their investigations. Crowdsourcing resulted in an efficient knowledge discovery and a continuous flow of tips to journalists and thus benefited journalistic investigations. The horizontal and vertical transparency in crowdsourced journalism supported the knowledge-search process. However, the high volume of submissions in some cases made the journalists compromise the journalistic norm of data verification, which resulted in publishing unverified information. Crowdsourcing as an open journalistic practice thus ruptures journalistic norms and creates pressure for new ones to emerge, such as blended responsibility, in which the responsibility for data accuracy is shared by the journalists and the readers. The article extends the examination of open journalistic practices and contributes to the understanding of their impact on digital journalism.",

    "title": "Cheerleaders or Critics?",
    "abstract": "Sports journalists have often been criticised for their casual approach to work and cheerleading content in stories. This style of journalism contrasts with the traditional norms of objectivity employed in other areas of newsrooms. It is also opposed to the critical watchdog role considered essential to objective reporting. To examine how sports journalists operate in relation to being cheerleaders or critical watchdogs, this study utilises the Australia–India Test cricket series of 2014–15 as a platform to investigate sports journalists’ views, and the content they produce. It employs in-depth interviews with 18 sports journalists from Australian and Indian newspaper organisations in conjunction with a content analysis of 1265 articles from eight Australian and Indian publications. This allows a comparison of the perceptions of the sports journalists with what they are producing in their stories. Selecting a major international event with historical importance, such as the Australia–India Test series, is important in providing an example for analysis of whether contemporary sports journalists have confused the roles of reporter and supporter. An important finding in this study, given the long-standing criticism of sports journalists, was a considerably higher proportion of critical reports about the series in both nations than of cheerleading. Overall, this was consistent with the perceptions of the sports journalists in the in-depth interviews.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Academic attention towards the effectiveness of fact-checking often centres on how receptive people are to the correction of news. But many studies do not take into account audience expectations of fact-checking or their engagement with news generally in the context of a national media system or its political culture. Our study makes an intervention into debates about fact-checking by focussing on the effectiveness this type of journalism has with audiences who were attentive to the news in the UK’s media system during a key point in a major health crisis. Drawing on a six-week news diary study (N = 200) during the coronavirus pandemic, our study concluded that the UK’s impartial media ecology and public service ethos creates an environment where audiences are largely receptive to journalists’ fact-checking and countering misinformation. Yet our content analysis of television news (N = 1259) during the pandemic found most broadcasters did not regularly challenge or question the government’s decision-making. We argue that since audiences favoured robust forms of journalistic scrutiny, broadcasters could more prominently fact-check claims and question dubious statements without undermining trust in journalism. We recommend scholars should pay more attention to understanding the audience reception of fact-checking across different media and political systems.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms are becoming an indispensable resource for journalists. Their use involves both direct interaction with the platforms themselves and, increasingly, the use of specialist third-party apps to find, filter, and follow content and contributors. This article explores some of the ways that social media platforms, and their technological ecosystems, are infusing news work. A range of platforms and apps—including Geofeedia, Spike, and Twitter—were critically examined, and their use by trainee journalists (N = 81) analysed. The results reveal how journalists can—and do—surveil social network users and their content via sophisticated, professional apps that are also utilised by the police and security forces. While journalists recognise the value of such apps in news work, they also have concerns, including about privacy and popularism. Although the participants in this study thought the apps they used could help with verification, there were warning signs that an over-reliance on the technology could develop, dulling journalists’ critical faculties.",

    "abstract": "While the term churnalism in this special issue speaks to the negative impacts of extensive news re-use, one pervasive form of news redistribution, social media news sharing, has had the more positive connotations of creative engagement, political participation and cross-promotion. Yet this reading of commendary culture is, as José Van Dijck suggests, largely ideological, anchored in the Silicon Valley rhetorics that support the data capture, data mining and behavioural advertising activities of social media businesses. Our paper critically analyses journalisms’ increasing dependence on social media news-sharing analytics and the implications for news media diversity. We first examine how sharing analytics function as a novel form of news commodification, influencing reporting and editorial practices, with possible implications for news media diversity. We then map the news-sharing ecology, looking at the interlinked business models, ownership patterns and industrial power of social news intermediaries such as Facebook, Twitter, Gigya, Chartbeat and Newswhip, and how these relationships reinforce the significance of analytics to news production. Finally, we propose how the use of news analytics could also help in tracking the changes wrought by social media news sharing, particularly in developing a media policy framework for monitoring digital news diversity and pluralism.",

    "title": "Undoing Churnalism?",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the types of information that users of a local news site share on Facebook. This issue relates to the idea of “churnalism”, which concerns a form of weakened journalism that diminishes the ability to perform expected tasks in a democratic society. As a major social media platform, Facebook has acquired substantial influence over news dissemination, and therefore, scholarly focus needs to be directed to users as news disseminators. The manners by which users share news on Facebook indicate whether churnalism is promoted or abated through users’ interaction with online news. In this study, a quantitative content analysis illustrates how 348 news articles published on a local news site were shared 7266 times. The results show that concerns related to churnalism should be directed primarily to the fact that the news outlet only rarely provides users with opportunities to interact with serious or hard news, while lightweight news is frequently offered. Despite this, users abate churnalism in the sense that the news they prefer to share is news from in-house sources rather than from external sources. The news extensively shared covers changes in the vicinity, and health care, and has emerged from local and regional events.",

    "title": "Visualization, Technologies, or the Public?",
    "abstract": "Data(-driven) journalism has triggered debates about whether this innovative storytelling and investigative approach, using data analytical and computational methods, better serves the public. Applying the concept of articulation, wherein an array of terms are juxtaposed and expressed together, this paper examines how the term “data-driven journalism” is represented on social media. Focusing on the Twittersphere as the research context, the paper employed the Twitter search application programming interface (API) to harvest all available public tweets (N = 6951) containing hashtags or keywords related to data-driven journalism within a four-week period in late 2016. A text-mining analysis of the contents of these tweets found that they focused extensively on journalistic practices, data visualization, and data analytical techniques. Further analysis on the hashtag co-occurrence network revealed that a number of hashtags bridged and organized the discussion of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere. Some hashtags on technologies and commercial applications, such as “#dataviz,” “#bigdata,” and “#datajournalism,” were located at important positions in the network. In contrast, public-related terms, such as “#opendata” or “#opengovernment,” were mentioned in a limited way and positioned peripherally. Implications for journalism and society are discussed.",

    "abstract": "collection of this nature. However, reading the chapters in this volume, one is struck by the seemingly repetitive nature of this debate and its continuing prominence. A feature that could have been tempered here had there been greater discussion of topics that, for this reviewer at least, are more central to this debate, yet are given only cursory attention. For example, though the demarcation between the two camps is explicitly set out in the volume, scholarship devoted identities, role perceptions and so-called ‘boundary maintenance’ do not loom as large as they should. This is a shame as a discussion of how media and academic practice and identity become manifest within this contestation would have been useful and taken the conversation forward some way. Moreover, given the increasing numbers of those within the academy who come from ‘practice backgrounds’ coupled with the growth in research which genuinely transcends the so-called divide, one is left wondering whether or not the ‘chasm’ between ‘theory and practice’ is as problematic as the premise of this volume suggests. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to gain an insight into critical practitioner perspectives on the work of academics within a scholarly publication such as this. Likewise, greater prominence to media and journalism scholarship that does not meet the utilitarian demands of ‘relevance’ within the mainstream media would be another step forward in this conversation.",

    "title": "Social Media’s Challenge to Journalistic Norms and Values during a Terror Attack",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the frequency of terror attacks around the world has increased. In the context of the 22 July 2011 terror attacks in Norway, social media use by citizens, and even victims, became an essential feature of reporting. Social media confronted the legacy media’s way of covering crisis events. It raised questions about traditional journalism’s ability to handle audience’s as, not only news consumers, but also producers. In the present article, we look at the ways in which the professional norms and values of traditional journalism are specifically challenged by social media use in times of terror, using the 22 July 2011 attacks as a case study. We find that Norwegian journalists initially held to their professional roles, and to the classic self-representational principles of journalism, including objectivity, autonomy and immediacy. When they integrated social media into their traditional platforms and modes of coverage, they framed it as a “source” of sorts. As the 22 July 2011 event coverage became more focused on the collective grief felt by the nation, in turn, the traditional journalistic principles of objectivity and autonomy became less relevant, enabling yet more audience participation and social media use in relation to the attack.",

    "title": "Exploring Machine Learning to Study the Long-Term Transformation of News",
    "abstract": "The labour-intensive nature of manual content analysis and the problematic accessibility of source material make quantitative analyses of news content still scarce in journalism history. However, the digitization of newspaper archives now allows for innovative digital methods for systematic longitudinal research beyond the scope of incidental case studies. We argue that supervised machine learning offers promising approaches to analyse abundant source material, ground analyses in big data, and map the structural transformation of journalistic discourse longitudinally. By automatically analysing form and style conventions, that reflect underlying professional norms and practices, the structure of news coverage can be studied more closely. However, automatically classifying latent and period-specific coding categories is highly complex. The structure of digital newspaper archives (e.g. segmentation, OCR) complicates this even more, while machine learning algorithms are often a black box. This paper shows how making classification processes transparent enables journalism scholars to employ these computational methods in a reliable and valid way. We illustrate this by focusing on the issues we encountered with automatically classifying news genres, an illuminating but particularly complex coding category. Ultimately, such an approach could foster a revision of journalism history, particularly the often hypothesized but understudied shift from opinion-based to fact-centred reporting.",

This study uses organizational sociology and actor-network theory to examine the infrastructure supporting journalists’ newsgathering in two Rwandan newsrooms, highlighting the role of the messaging platform WhatsApp. The network, which includes editors, sources, reporters, weather, vehicles, drivers, moto-taxis, WhatsApp, and petty cash, encourages journalists to gather news from predictable events. In this newsgathering network, WhatsApp allows reporters and editors to coordinate with each other, gather news, and influence newsroom behaviour. However, the platform does not overcome physical limitations such as transportation problems, which contribute major obstacles to newsgathering, even at wealthy organizations. In this network, WhatsApp extends the communication capabilities of journalists but is moderated by existing social relationships and subject to physical constraints as a result of those relationships. This study shows how physical and social contexts influence newsgathering and production. It also reinforces the importance of context in understanding how new tools are adopted into news production networks.",

    "abstract": "This special issue has been initiated and edited by the Digital Journalism editorial team with three ambitious aims: first, to offer a review of research that has been published in this journal since its launch in 2013 to examine the current state of play; second, to introduce a new article format for the journal – the invited conceptual article (Westlund 2018); and, third, building on these articles, to outline our vision of Digital Journalism Studies and the editorial agenda of this journal going forward. The special issue features a series of invited yet double-blind peer-reviewed articles by highly regarded scholars in the field, each from different parts of the globe and representing different scholarly traditions. They serve as exemplars of the invited conceptual article format, which has a target length of about 3000–4000 words and explicates a key concept relevant to digital journalism. Along with defining a concept, the conceptual article also includes a discussion of implications for future research and benefit to empirical research. We are immensely grateful to the contributors for rising to this challenge and producing highly reflective and clarifying articles. In this special issue, our invited authors have generated concise definitions of how they understand digital journalism that we then extrapolate in our own article, found at the end of this issue. This process has allowed us to clarify what we mean by digital journalism and Digital Journalism Studies and cement our aims and vision for the journal. We are also thankful to all the reviewers who provided their comments to each of the articles in this special issue, and for engaging with this new article format.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents for the first time longitudinal evidence according to which the role of digital news sources has grown dramatically since 2006. The study includes reconstructions of 1,594 news items, authored by a representative sample of Israeli news reporters, and details regarding each item’s sources (n = 5,647). We found that digital sourcing did not open the gates for alternative voices. Moreover, digital sources are verified less than non-digital ones and are mentioned less often in final publications. However, the lower epistemic standards in treating digital sources were explained in a series of follow-up interviews, not due to their elevated trust, but rather due to the traceable footprints of digital sources that can protect journalists against future attacks, thus making these sources reliable. In addition, reporters continue to adhere to elite sources due to the familiarity paradox we found: while in principle reporters understand the ethical value of alternative sources, in practice they dismiss them, as they consider them riskier and less reliable due to their unfamiliarity. This may suggest that until the familiarity paradox is resolved, one cannot expect new technology to democratize the mix of news sources.",

    "title": "Accounting for Personalization in Personalization Algorithms: YouTube’s Treatment of Conspiracy Content",
    "abstract": "This article investigates under which video watch conditions YouTube’s recommender system tends to develop a preference for conspiracy-classified videos. Whereas existing research on so-called filter bubbles and rabbit holes tends to rely on non-personalized recommendations and on standard watch patterns, this study puts personalization and diversified user strategies at the center of its design. 20 authenticated bots have been instructed to watch YouTube content based on four distinct watch strategies. In a baseline strategy, bots watched non-conspiracy videos only. Treatment strategies involved watching conspiracy-classified content, selected based on either non-personalized, partly-personalized, or fully-personalized input. Bots watched a total of 15 videos, and after each video their top 20 homepage recommendations were collected and classified as either conspiracy-related or not. This allowed us to measure the impact of each video watched and of each watch strategy on the proportion of conspiracy-classified content recommended at each step. The same experiment has been reverted, exposing the treatment groups to non-conspiracy videos only, to assess the persistence of this pattern. Our results show that users primed with conspiracy-classified content tend to quickly receive a much larger proportion of conspiracy-classified recommendations. Inverting this pattern proves significantly more difficult than generating it. There are also indications that watch strategies relying on personalized content as input might produce stronger effects. This article contributes evidence to the argument that YouTube’s recommendation system is prone to generating strong, potentially pernicious recommendation patterns. Moreover, it contributes a replicable methodology that puts personalization at the center of the stage in the study of content personalization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The established narrative around newspapers and their relationship with “digital” is predominantly gloomy. We’ve learned how newspapers missed the mark regarding digital distribution and how traditional working practices often led to slow adoption of digital tools. There’s merit in this, yet it is not the entire story. We are missing insights into the smallest newspapers. This paper contributes to this conversation through an investigation into the digital life of small market newspapers. We conducted a multi-method study drawing on in-depth interviews with experts and practitioners, and a survey of journalists and editors at small market newspapers. Our findings point to considerable variety of experience. It is crucial not to discount these experiments, or fall victim to the assumption of digital backwardness and analog quaintness we often equate with small towns and smaller publications.",

    "title": "Analytics-Driven Journalism? Editorial Metrics and the Reconfiguration of Online News Production Practices in African Newsrooms\"",
    "abstract": "Abstract Although the notion of measuring the performance of news stories is not a new phenomenon, the advent of online analytic tools has redefined the whole terrain of the sociology of online news production and distribution. This paper, which draws from an on-going cross-national comparative study of Zimbabwean, Kenyan, and South African newsrooms, focuses on the use and role of analytics in news production and distribution. It investigates how analytics tools are used in editorial decision-making and advertising negotiations. Based on structured and unstructured interviews with editors and journalists working for selected newsrooms in East and Southern Africa, the paper examines how the use of analytics is reshaping the evaluation of the impact, reach, relevance of news stories and performance of individual journalists. Our study shows that the deployment of analytic tools has altered how news organizations in different parts of Africa monitor, track, engage in digital listening and interact with their audiences, thereby spawning a new phenomenon we call “analytics-driven journalism.” The paper argues that newsrooms in different parts of the continent are, to varied degrees, now more concerned about newsroom metrics and engagement rates at the expense of the broader public interest dimension of journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholarly work argues that mobile technology facilitates serendipitous news consumption. This article examines how users understand serendipity in mobile news consumption and whether this leads to news diversity. Technology-mediated news encounters are argued to reduce news diversity, yet these theoretical filter bubbles cannot be found empirically. This paper investigates whether this might be explained by incidental news use. A mixed methods study (n = 20) was set-up, which involved interviews, on-device loggings and experience sampling data. Results show that incidental news differs in the level of user agency, ranging from responding to an unsolicited recommendation or alert; via monitoring, facilitated by a previous action (e.g. activated news notifications); to browsing or stumbling upon unexpected topics during news use. Incidental encounters become serendipitous when they provide new information or insights and consequently stick in one’s mind. Based on our findings, we further develop a conceptual model for (mobile) incidental news, which shows the interplay of news recommendations by peers, algorithms, and editors. Editorial recommendations result in topic diversity. Both peer and algorithmic recommendations lead to brand diversity, yet this remains unnoticed to audiences. Peer recommendations mostly do not lead to topic or viewpoint diversity, but are perceived as valuable when they do.",

It connects a long line of research on journalism and computation with scholarly and professional terrain yet to be explored. Taken as a whole, these articles share some of the noble ambitions of the pioneering publications on ‘reporting algorithms’, such as a desire to see computing help journalists in their watchdog role by holding power to account. However, they also go further, firstly by addressing the fuller range of technologies that computational journalism now consists of: from chatbots and recommender systems, to artificial intelligence and atomised journalism. Secondly, they advance the literature by demonstrating the increased variety of uses for these technologies, including engaging underserved audiences, selling subscriptions, and recombining and re-using content. Thirdly, they problematize computational journalism by, for example, pointing out some of the challenges inherent in applying AI to investigative journalism and in trying to preserve public service values. Fourthly, they offer suggestions for future research and practice, including by presenting a framework for developing democratic news recommenders and another that may help us think about computational journalism in a more integrated, structured manner.",

    "title": "Safeguarding the Journalistic DNA: Attitudes towards the Role of Professional Values in Algorithmic News Recommender Designs",
    "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to the extensive debate on the influence of algorithmic news recommenders (ANRs) on individual news diets, the interaction between such systems and journalistic norms and missions remain under-studied. The change in the relationship between journalists and the audience caused by the transition to personalized news delivery has profound consequences for the understanding of what journalism should be. To investigate how media practitioners perceive the impact of ANRs on their professional norms and media organizations’ missions, and how these norms and missions can be integrated into ANR design, this article looks at two quality newspapers from the Netherlands and Switzerland. Using an interview-based approach conducted with practitioners in different departments (e.g. journalists, data scientists, and product managers), it explores how ANRs interact with organization-centred and audience-centred journalistic values. The paper’s findings indicate a varying degree of prominence for specific values between individual practitioners in the context of their perception of ANRs. At the same time, the paper also reveals that some organization-centred (e.g. transparency) and most audience-centred (e.g. usability) values are viewed as prerequisites for successful ANR design by practitioners with different professional backgrounds.",

    "title": "Diversifying Diversity in Digital Journalism Studies: Reflexive Research, Reviewing and Publishing",
    "abstract": "In 2019, we invited leading scholars to not only define but consider the future of digital journalism studies research. As an editorial team, we also introduced the Digital Journalism Studies Compass (DJSC) which now guides the way we assess the relevance and value of articles published in Digital Journalism (see Eldridge et al. 2019). Central to these efforts is a desire to build a more refined, inclusive, and robust collection of scholarship from across the globe in the pages of Digital Journalism. Ongoing discussion around enhancing diversity in the media as well as in communication and journalism studies has been heartening. Last year, a number of international communication organizations issued statements to affirm their commitment to diversity. Many journalism scholars also took to social media to join this important discussion. We highlighted this in an editorial accompanying an online, free-access special issue devoted to important work by female scholars (Hess et al. 2019). In that virtual special issue, we had also invited Shakuntala Rao (2019) to comment on diversity in the field and she emphasized the importance of mindful inclusiveness. We continue this conversation in this editorial, focusing on three points: First, we hope to further diversify our attention to diversity by referring not only to gender and race, but also to different geopolitical, methodological, and theoretical representations. Second, we want to argue that discourses on and about diversity should not only highlight problems but also include solutions, and we highlight the importance of reflexivity in this challenge. Third, we join calls to accompany discourse with action and seek help from you—our contributors, reviewers, and readers—in doing so.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Different disciplines have studied the content of online user comments in various contexts, using manual qualitative/quantitative or (semi-)automated approaches. The broad spectrum and disciplinary divides make it difficult to grasp an overview of those aspects which have already been examined, e.g. to identify findings related to one’s own research, recommendable methodological approaches, and under-researched topics. We introduce a systematic literature review concerning content analyses of user comments in a journalistic context. Our review covers 192 papers identified through a systematic search focussing on communication studies and computer science. We find that research predominantly concentrates on the comment sections of Anglo-American newspaper brands and on aspects like hate speech, general incivility, or users’ opinions on specific issues, while disregarding media from other parts of the world, comments in social media, propaganda, and constructive comments. From our results we derive a research agenda that addresses research gaps and also highlights potentials for automating analyses as well as for cooperation across disciplines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While the theoretical framework of curated flows provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the social media environment, it overlooks the interactions between curators and the mechanisms pertaining to these interactions. This study argues that each curator can interact with one another, resulting in an interplay between different flows and shaping an individual’s information networks. Specifically focusing on personal news curation, this research argues that it can influence curated flows by signaling algorithms of user preferences. Furthermore, the affective mechanism of news curation has received limited attention. Drawing on the Stress-Strain-Outcome model, this study investigates how Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) manifests divergent effects on news-boosting and news-limiting curation via social media news fatigue. The findings, derived from a large-scale survey in a work-from-home context (N = 1198), reveal a noteworthy association: individuals experiencing FoMO are susceptible to news fatigue, leading them to prioritize being protected (news-limiting curation) than informed (news-boosting curation). This might contribute to a narrower news repertoire and influence the cultivation of informed citizens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Messaging apps increasingly shape the domain of political and news-related communication. Leaning on theoretical and methodological advancements in the special issue, this commentary aims to further define the characteristics of meso news-spaces based on the expanded typology of chat groups. To move beyond the techno-deterministic framework and the binary division on “public” and “private” platforms, this commentary necessitates a positive definition for meso news-spaces. Emphasizing deliberation-oriented qualities of meso news-spaces, it proposes to classify chat groups that facilitate discussion, involve wider than immediate social circle, and establish their own rules, as meso news-spaces. Directions for further research and methodological implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic unleashes multiple fundamental questions about society beyond public health. Based on the classical concept of ‘need for orientation’ and the literature on the role of the media in times of crisis, we investigate to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic affected news consumption in comparative perspective. Based on a two-wave panel survey in 17 mostly European countries, our study targets the role of both legacy news brands (TV, radio, newspapers) and so-called contemporary news media (Internet-based and social media) during this global health crisis. Our results show an overall rise of news use across countries, but only for some types of news media. We find an increase of TV news consumption, and a higher reliance on social media and the Internet for news and information. This indicates that in times of crises and an unusually strong need for orientation, people mainly turn to news sources that are easily available and offer a more immediate coverage. Furthermore, we find the rise in news use to be mainly present among those who already have a higher level of trust in legacy media and among people that were more concerned about the impact of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Across the globe, governments have issued emergency and drastic measures aimed at tracking the spread of COVID-19 and safeguarding public health. Notwithstanding the necessity and importance of some of these measures, this work argues that numerous governments around the world used the pandemic crisis as a pretext to push through restrictions that hamper critical journalism. Drawing from worldwide press freedom monitoring tools and platforms established by various credible global organizations, this study shows that the pandemic crisis exacerbates existing obstacles to press freedom and adds new dimensions to the already documented threats. This is evident not only in authoritarian states, but also in western democracies. Most of the threats documented specifically aim to silence digital journalism, which has gained significant momentum as a result of the pandemic crisis. Overall, the main target of this work is to offer an enriched conceptual approach to the types of threats that press freedom faces in the context of global crisis situations.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the emergence of “participatory journalism” as a scholarly object in the field of journalism studies. By conducting a genealogical analysis of 119 articles on participatory journalism, published between 1995 and September 2011, we analyze the development of scholarly ways of writing and thinking about participatory journalism over the years. Our genealogy reveals how the field of journalism studies constructs participatory journalism along the lines of four normative dimensions: “enthusiasm about new democratic opportunities”, “disappointment with professional journalism’s obduracy”, “disappointment with economic motives to facilitate participatory journalism”, and “disappointment with news users' passivity”. We argue these dimensions are inextricably linked with what “counts” as journalism within journalism studies.",

Financial challenges confronting news organizations are seeing a gradual relaxation of this separation, though tensions remain. This study examines the perspectives of those involved in creating, developing, and executing specific editorial–business collaborative initiatives intended to enhance the financial standing of their respective news organizations. Drawing on organizational theory, it uses qualitative interviews with individuals at editorial and business departments of various news organizations to ascertain the scope and nature of these initiatives and the factors that participants attribute to their success. It identifies a range of different initiatives, finds that such initiatives have organization-wide effects, and categorizes factors affecting the success of collaborative initiatives into individual, organizational, and institutional levels.",

While these in-house innovation labs are intended to infuse experimentation and creativity across the newsroom, several barriers exist toward their success. This exploratory research, which features 20 in-depth interviews with news innovation leaders in the United States and Canada, examines how news intrapreneurship interfaces with three qualities of managerial change: newsroom leadership, organizational culture and innovation speed. Because of the bureaucratic nature of newsroom authority, ideas created in the intrapreneurial unit are ultimately isolated from the lifeblood of the broader news organization. The findings identify three layers of tension (executive, practitioner and internal) existing within the newsroom’s organizational structure that limits the spread of ideas developed within intrapreneurial units.",

    "abstract": "The success of digital longforms in terms of readership and viral spread promotes an optimistic perspective on innovative web journalism with regard to the attention, engagement, and subsequent knowledge acquisition of citizens when consuming news. Since empirical evidence for such effects is scant, this experimental study focuses on visual aesthetics as a signature element of novel news formats that are designed to attract attention in a highly competitive media landscape. Specifically, it draws on the theoretical framework of user engagement and shows that the presence of visual aesthetics contributes to meaningful learning from the news by initiating positive attitudes towards the interface, which in turn leads to deeper involvement with the content. However, when the presence of visual aesthetics fails to affect interface evaluation, the opposite effect occurs. Surprisingly, these effects are not found to be contingent upon individual differences such as issue involvement or issue-specific prior knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that for news organizations, it is worth investing financial and personal resources in innovative news formats in order to support knowledge gain, although they need to be carefully designed as the first encounter with the interface decides about the subsequent engagement with and processing of the news.",

    "abstract": "Abstract “Alternative news media,” that explicitly position themselves against mainstream media have emerged as an increasingly visible aspect of media systems globally including in India. And although such media can espouse left/right political positions, in the Indian context, such outlets are supportive of right-wing politics of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In this article—drawing on rhetorical approaches—we explore the efforts of OpIndia, the most-visited right-wing news site in India to critique and correct the country’s mainstream news outlets through a textual analysis of 576 articles contained in the site’s Media Fact Check section.",

Newspaper executives in newspapers owned by media groups rated most digital competences significantly higher than executives from other newspapers, and ownership explained the relative importance of digital competences necessary in process innovation. There are also indications of a conflict between the product innovation of online news features and the process innovation of efficient multi-platform news production. The low priority of computer-assisted journalism skills will have consequences for the priority of the development of advanced digital methods in investigative journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital journalism in Brazil is dominated by a few big players and has recently been threatened by the country’s challenging political and economic environment. Still, organizational structures promoting independent digital journalism (IDJ) persist. Originally understood as “the blogosphere,” independent digital journalism in Brazil (IDJB) quickly evolved into several professionalized initiatives and now consists of dozens of news organizations. This article contributes to the field by (a) adding to scholarly conceptualizations of independent journalism in North America, Europe, and Latin America through the idea of “positive dependence” and (b) refining the understanding of IDJ in times of acute crisis. Based on an analysis of six emblematic cases, we show that IDJB is relational and distinct and that it functions without clearly defined boundaries. We further find that this relationality is necessary for IDJB to survive the attacks it faces. Different support networks shape “models of resilience” that, while not perfect, facilitate the institutionalization of IDJB by allowing for the slow but ongoing creation of new structures within the news ecosystem. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that the continuing institutionalization of IDJB and its particular characteristics contributes to the creation of a more diverse news ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Although technological innovations in journalism have recently received growing scholarly attention, studies have hardly questioned or explored the naturalised dominance of technology over newswork. By drawing on critical scholarship, the study aims to explore how articulations between technology and journalism are negotiated by actors engineering technological innovations for and implementing them as part of newswork. Adopting the qualitative methods of interviews and document analysis, the study explores the XLike project (Seventh Framework Programme) co-ordinated by the Jožef Stefan Institute, a Slovenian public research institution for natural sciences and, among others, partnered with the New York Times, Bloomberg Media and the Slovenian Press Agency. One of its main results is a technology that is able to extract formal knowledge from texts in different languages scattered online in a structured way. While the study indicates journalists and editors are seen as conservative and hesitant to adopt what is understood as progressive technology, the project chiefly focuses on journalism as a business by pursuing a better understanding of audience behaviour, tracking online traffic and customised advertising. Additionally, newsrooms played at best a marginal role in defining the project’s goals and implementing the technology, and that these were driven foremost by business concerns.",

This study further investigates how different types of relationships (servant or friend) that human writers form with algorithms determine the persuasiveness of algorithm-generated news. Experiment 1 demonstrated that participants who read the human- and humanized algorithm-written news showed greater emotional involvement in the stories and liked the articles more than those who read the algorithm-written news. The participants also reported that news written by humans, humanized algorithms, and algorithms, had equal news credibility. Experiment 2 further showed that the participants perceived the news as more credible and experienced greater degrees of emotional involvement when human writers formed a partner-to-friend relationship with humanized algorithms while generating news rather than a servant-to-master relationship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article uses the notion of habit to explore how news users adopt a new subscription into their everyday routines, and identifies facilitators and obstacles helping or inhibiting this process. Sixty-eight participants received a three-week newspaper trial subscription and were interviewed about their experiences afterward. Facilitators of repeated use were concurrent rewards; embedment into existing routines; and visual reminders. Obstacles were lack of steady routines; strong existing habits; perceived effort; disillusionment; and accessibility. Findings point to the importance of visibility: participants – even those with positive initial experiences – tended to forget their subscription. Visual cues were needed to remind participants to read their subscription: app icons, open browser tabs, social media posts, push notifications, and the print newspaper. Proactive implementation of these cues suggests participants themselves were also aware of their propensity to forget the subscription. Existing (news) habits either helped anchor use of the subscription or blocked it by being automatically cued up by context features. Results also point to a mental hurdle: having to muster up the cognitive and motivational energy to start reading the news. Finally, findings suggest that concurrently experienced rewards may be more conducive to news habit formation than retrospectively experienced rewards.",

    "title": "Data Journalism in the Arab Region: Role Conflict Exposed",
    "abstract": "Abstract Can the promise of data-driven reporting as an empirical form of journalistic inquiry take root in the Arab region, where public data are often inaccessible, equipment and skills are in short supply, and civic-affairs journalism is hamstrung by wary governments? Sixteen data journalists working in Arab nations were identified through multiple inquiries and a snowball sample that achieved saturation. Informants described data journalism as the careful analysis of numerical evidence to provide credible and sometimes visual information to audiences on subjects otherwise off limits and which aligns journalists with perceived global professional standards. Four types of barriers emerged: two structural (insufficient data access and social/political expectations) and two individualistic (ignorance and resistance). Combined, those barriers affirm journalistic role conception research and the value of metajournalistic discourse theory to reveal that the fundamental obstacle in the region is not a paucity of data but the ontological limitation of the dominant loyal-facilitator role.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we assess the interactions between user metrics and journalists, as newsrooms shift towards “data-informed” models in which the main online news performance indicator becomes the “time spent” metric, instead of the number of clicks. The paper at hand applies a mixed methods approach combining components of ethnographic participant observation inside the newsroom of a leading Belgian newspaper, and a quantitative analysis of the media company’s overarching internal data platform. This approach allows us to shed light on user data of not one, but four very differentiated newspapers. Our results confirm that (a) journalists tend to remain hesitant at best and fearful at worst in accepting user data as an integral part of their daily work, (b) attempts of increasing the “time spent” in articles only rarely seem to pay off, and (c) the relationship between journalism and metrics cannot be assessed without properly addressing and tackling other existing gaps and differences between (groups of) journalists and titles under the same company.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates how COVID-19-related content, especially conspiracy theories, is communicated on “dark platforms” — digital platforms that are less regulated and moderated, hence can be used for hosting content and content creators that may not be tolerated by their more mainstream counterparts. The objective of this study is two-fold: First, it introduces the concept of dark platforms, which differ from their mainstream counterparts in terms of content governance, user-base and technological infrastructure. Second, using 8kun and Gab as examples, this study investigates how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been communicated on dark platforms, with a focus on conspiracy theories. Over 60,000 COVID-19-related posts were studied to identify the most prominent conspiracy theories, their themes, and the actors who promoted them, as well as the broader information ecosystem through network analysis. While pressure on social media to deplatform conspiracy theorists continues to grow, we argue that more research needs to be done to critically investigate the impacts of further marginalizing such groups. To this end, the concept of dark platform as can serve as a heuristic device for researching a wider range of fringe platforms.",

    "title": "“Flatten the Curve”: Data-Driven Projections and the Journalistic Brokering of Knowledge during the COVID-19 Crisis",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Coronavirus has prompted an urgent need for guidance and practical intervention. Newsmakers responded to this demand by providing outlooks that plotted the contagion’s contours against a host of parameters. The article looks back at this acute area of sensemaking where journalistic forecasts, epidemiological modelling, and policy measures intertwined. It examines how possible courses of the pandemic were displayed and discussed in the multimodal infographics and reports of data journalistic news products. The estimations predominantly choose to take the form of bell-shaped curves which conceived of the disease as a kind of wave that should, after reaching its peak, flatten out again. Confronted with an immense degree of uncertainty around the illness and an ambiguous environment of conflicting meanings and explanations, we argue that this predictive newswork fulfilled some of the journalistic functions of brokering knowledge. By giving cogent visual form to the incoherent prognoses, it raised awareness of the available models and rendered COVID-19’s potential developments accessible to policy makers and the public. By comparing sources, the data-driven forecasts fostered engagement with the spectrum of outlooks and the uncertainty they entailed. Furthermore, the news pieces connected consonant sources from science and public health institutions.",

    "abstract": "As an increasing number of reporters see databases and algorithms as appropriate means of doing investigation, journalism has been challenged in recent years by the following question: to what extent would the processing of huge datasets allow journalists to produce new types of revelations that rely less on normative assumptions? Drawing on the analysis of a particular investigation by the San Francisco-based Center for Investigative Reporting, this article points out the existence of epistemological tensions in the making of journalistic revelations that involve the processing of vast amounts of data. First, I show that the design of data-processing artifacts can match the traditional epistemology of journalistic investigation, but only with great efforts and resources from the organization. Second, I point out that the use of these artifacts by journalists follows two opposite paths to produce the revelation: a “hypothesis-driven” path and a “data-driven” path. Such findings contribute to a better understanding of how news organizations produce justified beliefs, as data-processing artifacts become major components of the newsroom’s environment.",

    "abstract": "The study examined the personal and social contexts which encourage or help to maintain individuals’ engagement in citizen journalism tasks. Drawing on the perspective of social capital, this study examines whether social media use, social network, social capital, and civic skills help to predict the degree of engagement in producing citizen journalism, especially on Twitter and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that bridging capital—connecting to gain new ideas and experiences—was a powerful predictor of citizen journalism activities on Facebook, whereas bonding capital—connecting with close, trusted acquaintances—strongly predicted less citizen journalism activity. Personal factors including social media use and individual civic skills were the most powerful predictors of citizen journalism activities on Twitter. In general, Twitter use fosters active citizen journalism behaviors, and those with civic skills prefer Twitter over Facebook as a medium for citizen journalism.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices allow users to keep ubiquitously connected to the internet. Consequently, they change the reception of information by faster access, greater timeliness, and new media usage contexts. At the same time, many traditional media organizations already produce content for mobile websites and apps in line with cross-media strategies. Reflecting severe structural changes in the journalism market, they are hoping to manage the digital transition successfully by mobile publishing, (re)gaining especially the digital natives. Referring to the media repertoire approach, we examine the role of mobile devices on two different levels. First, from a technical point of view, we consider the platform repertoire of mobile internet users for information. Focusing on the use frequency of online (computer, mobile devices) and offline media (printed newspaper, television set, radio set), a quantitative study (N = 498, face-to-face interviews) reveals six different user types. Second, we examine the new medium’s use for information purposes by drawing on the unique specifics of mobile devices compared to other media. Results show that the new medium is frequently used for information due to its particular qualities. Third, we look at the users’ selected mobile news sources from an institutional perspective. Our results indicate that, although new online-only providers are of a certain relevance to mobile internet users, traditional journalism’s content dominates the mobile information repertoire.",

This study contributes to the growing body of research by dissecting the multimodal structure of digital longform journalism, that is, how the emerging genre combines written language, photography, short videos, maps and other graphical elements, and joins them together into a seamless narrative using subtle transitions. The data consist of 12 longform articles published in 2012–2013, which have been annotated for their visual and verbal content, their underlying principle of organization and the transitions that hold between them. The annotation is stored into a digital corpus, which is then analyzed to examine the multimodal structures that enable the longform genre to establish a narrative, and to explicate how the longform attempts to captivate its audience by creating a distraction-free environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many are concerned with the proliferation of false information on social media. This article explores whether “social norm-based nudges” can help address this issue by changing the sharing behaviour of social media users. In order to do so, we conduct an online survey experiment (n = 1,003), where participants are randomly exposed to a social norm-based message while choosing to read and/or share a false news article. The message warns participants that there is an abundance of “false information” online and tells them that most responsible people think twice before sharing articles with their network. Our analysis finds that the nudge reduced the proportion of people willing to share the article by 5.1 percentage points, with a 46.7% increase in the proportion of respondents stating that they do not want to share the article because it is false or inaccurate.",

Taking an audience perspective and relying on a large four-wave panel survey from Sweden, this study examines orientation towards alternative news, paying specific attention to the potential reinforcing relationship with trust in mainstream media. Results show that increasing orientation towards alternative news is related to decreasing trust in mainstream media, and vice versa. In addition, the study highlights how alternative news orientation supplements rather than replaces consumption of traditional news. These findings provide valuable insights on the alternative news users and the dynamics of their media consumption, informing the debate on the role played by alternative news media in society.",

    "title": "Computational News Discovery: Towards Design Considerations for Editorial Orientation Algorithms in Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Computational news discovery (CND) is a particular application area within computational journalism related to the use of algorithms to orient editorial attention to potentially newsworthy events or information prior to publication. Previous work in this area has been concentrated on prototyping CND tools, which can, for instance, send alerts and leads to journalists about social media events, documents of interest, or salient patterns in streams of data. This article describes a qualitative interview study of journalists as they incorporate CND tools into their practices. Findings provide insights into how CND tools interact with the internal attention economy and sociotechnical gatekeeping processes of the newsroom and how future CND tools might better align with necessary journalistic evaluations of newsworthiness and quality, while ensuring configurability, human agency, and flexible applicability to a wide range of use cases. These findings begin to outline a conceptual framework that can help guide the effective design of future CND tools.",

    "title": "Challenges Facing Development of Data Journalism in Non-Western Societies",
    "abstract": "Abstract As shown by several papers in this special issue, there has been an increasing interest in data among journalism scholars and practitioners worldwide including those in the Global South. While papers in this volume include scholarly assessments of data journalism in Italy and the UK, the inclusion of papers focusing on the Arab region, Latin America and Africa in a well-respected journal like this should be commended. Research has outlined the benefits and challenges of data to journalism practice, transnational experiences in teaching data journalism and the changing nature of the profession in a data-dominated society, be it in practice, pedagogy and empiricism. However, up until this volume, very little was known about the developments of data journalism in non-Western societies. Noticeably, there is a small but significant developing interest in studies that seek to investigate the growing expansion of data journalism in the Global South. It is important to examine the development of data journalism beyond Western paradigm because every region and in some cases, country, seems to be adopting a specific culture orientation that best describes its position when it comes to data journalism.",

    "title": "Interested in Diversity",
    "abstract": "Using survey evidence from the Netherlands, we explore the factors that influence news readers’ attitudes toward news personalization. We show that the value of personalization depends on commonly overlooked factors, such as concerns about a shared news sphere, and the depth and diversity of recommendations. However, these expectations are not universal. Younger, less educated users have little exposure to non-personalized news, and they also show little concern about diverse news recommendations. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. We show that quality news organizations that pursue reader loyalty and trust have a strong incentive to implement personalization algorithms that help them achieve these particular goals by taking into account diversity expecting user attitudes and providing high quality recommendations. Diversity-valuing news readers are thus well placed to be served by diversity-enhancing recommender algorithms. However, some users are in danger of being left out of this positive feedback loop. We make specific policy suggestions regarding how to address the issue of diversity-reducing feedback loops, and encourage the development of diversity-enhancing ones.",

    "abstract": "The internet and social media have led to a change in the structure of the public sphere in comparison to traditional mass media. On the internet, private actors have the possibility to participate in public discourse and bypass news media to directly interact with each other as well as with public actors such as political representatives. The questions of the type of interaction, the degree of influence, and possible topic-specific differences, however, remain unclear. We conducted a content analysis of the user types, forms of interaction, and practices of retweeting and linking in 17,629 tweets on five topics and found topic-specific differences in the interaction between news media, public actors, and private actors. Overall, news media still hold an important role in information flow and are linked to and retweeted most often by all user types. However, in crisis situations, the messages of private actors also find uptake.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of computational journalism on the creation and dissemination of crime news. Computational journalism refers to forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical processes and systems for the production of news. It is one of a series of technological developments that have shaped journalistic work and builds on techniques of computer-assisted reporting and the use of social science tools in journalism. This paper uses the Los Angeles Times’ Homicide Report and its Data Desk as a case study to explore how technological adaptation occurred in this newsroom in the early twenty-first century. Our findings suggest that computational thinking and techniques emerged in a (dis)continuous evolution of organizational norms, practices, content, identities, and technologies that interdependently led to new products. Computational journalism emerges from an earlier and still ongoing turn to digital within broader organizational, technological, and social contexts. We place this finding in the local, situated context of the Homicide Report, one of the first crime news blogs to adopt computational journalism in North America.",

    "title": "Big Data and Journalism",
    "abstract": "Big data is a social, cultural, and technological phenomenon—a complex amalgamation of digital data abundance, emerging analytic techniques, mythology about data-driven insights, and growing critique about the overall consequences of big-data practices for democracy and society. While media and communication scholars have begun to examine and theorize about big data in the context of media and public life broadly, what are the particular implications for journalism? This article introduces and applies four conceptual lenses—epistemology, expertise, economics, and ethics—to explore both contemporary and potential applications of big data for the professional logic and industrial production of journalism. These distinct yet inter-related conceptual approaches reveal how journalists and news media organizations are seeking to make sense of, act upon, and derive value from big data during a time of exploration in algorithms, computation, and quantification. In all, the developments of big data potentially have great meaning for journalism’s ways of knowing (epistemology) and doing (expertise), as well as its negotiation of value (economics) and values (ethics). Ultimately, this article outlines future directions for journalism studies research in the context of big data.",

    "abstract": "Trust has long been considered an important factor that influences people’s relationship with news. However, the increase in the volume of information available online, together with the emergence of new tools and services that act as intermediaries and enable interactivity around the news, may have changed this relationship. Using Reuters Institute Digital News Report survey data (N = 21,524), this study explores the impact of individual trust in the news media on source preferences and online news participation behaviour, in particular sharing and commenting, across 11 countries. The results show that those with low levels of trust tend to prefer non-mainstream news sources like social media, blogs, and digital-born providers, and are more likely to engage in various forms of online news participation. These associations tend to be strongest in northern European countries, but are weaker elsewhere. Seeking alternative views and attempting to validate the credibility of news may be among the motivations behind these associations.",

Based on a synthesis of accumulated research, we differentiate between the realm of journalism as a business and a practice; and the realm of democracy, wherein news media may play a role as a public sphere and a means of political empowerment. By offering a comprehensive examination of key findings and themes arising from UGC research, the article seeks to advance our understanding of the evolving news media landscape.

    "abstract": "In offering personalized content geared toward users’ individual interests, recommender systems are assumed to reduce news diversity and thus lead to partial information blindness (i.e., filter bubbles). We conducted two exploratory studies to test the effect of both implicit and explicit personalization on the content and source diversity of Google News. Except for small effects of implicit personalization on content diversity, we found no support for the filter-bubble hypothesis. We did, however, find a general bias in that Google News over-represents certain news outlets and under-represents other, highly frequented, news outlets. The results add to a growing body of evidence, which suggests that concerns about algorithmic filter bubbles in the context of online news might be exaggerated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article develops the concept of engaged journalism outside a US context, comparing how engaged journalists in Brazil and Egypt discursively negotiate their professional positions in the face of far-right governments’ constraints. Engaged journalists are professional journalists working in alternative media and strongly committed to a political position. Inspired by Bourdieu’s field theory, the article investigates how engaged journalists legitimise themselves by contesting legacy journalism from the margins through innovative digital formats in times of blurred boundaries. A qualitative content analysis of 21 articles (editorials and op-ed pieces) published in The Intercept Brasil and MadaMasr from 2015 to 2020 (a) develops the concept of engaged journalism in alternative media, (b) reconstructs how two media initiatives in the Global South discursively negotiated editorial actions and distinguished themselves from legacy journalism, and (c) proposes a global transferable understanding of engaged journalism based on research in two media systems. Three themes emerge: raison d’être and purpose, tensions between democratic and authoritarian norms, and the establishment of legitimacy through an emphasis on journalistic practices, revealing that engaged journalists are driven by media criticism, but still position themselves within journalism, offering a radical new path. This article contributes to theory-building about engaged journalism in the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the promise of AI, the use of emerging technologies in journalism has gained momentum. However, the question of how such technologies can be interwoven with newsroom practices, values, routines, and socio-cultural experiences is often neglected. This article investigates the ways in which AI-driven tools are permeating newswork and design strategies for blending technological capabilities with editorial requirements. We followed a multi-method approach to investigate the deployment of AI in news production at two London newsrooms: (1) a design ethnography at the BBC with journalists and technologists, and (2) interviews with journalists at The Times. Our findings show that while journalists are generally open to try AI-driven technologies that benefit their work, technologists struggle to integrate them into journalistic workflows. The consensus was that human judgement is required to make complex decisions in journalism and that journalistic values should be prioritised in AI tool design. We claim that AI tools need to fit with professional practices and values in journalism in order to be fully accepted as an editorial tool. Embedding new technologies into journalistic workflows requires therefore a close collaboration between journalists and technologists, and a sociotechnical design that blends in work routines and values.",

    "title": "Invisible Friend or Foe?How Journalists Use and Perceive Algorithmic-Driven Tools in Their Research Process",
    "abstract": "Abstract The use of algorithmic tools by journalists for information-gathering has received particular attention in recent years. While it might facilitate the research process, there are also concerns about their impact on journalism. Based on reconstruction interviews with 27 journalists, we first answer the primary question to what extent journalists actually use algorithmic-driven tools for research purposes. Then, we analyze which folk theories journalists create during their use of algorithm-driven tools. Results show that algorithmic tools specifically designed for the journalistic research process are rarely or not at all used. Yet, more crucially, search engines and social media, that are driven by algorithms, play a major role when it comes to the search, selection, and verification of sources and information. However, journalists are not aware of this hidden research assistant facilitating their research process. When explicitly asked, they profess specific notions regarding the use of algorithmic-driven tools in the form of folk theories, which are predominantly negative regarding the influence of AI on journalism. At the same time, there is a still a strong feeling of a professional authority among journalists who feel they are able to work autonomously of any kind of influence, including algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a surge in research on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in news production and news audience engagement. Most of this research has focused on legal, ethical, and regulatory implications of UAVs in newsgathering, while paying less attention to the journalists’ perspectives. To fill this gap in the academic literature, this article explores the ethical principles that guide journalists who use UAVs, how they have worked within these ethical principles, and how they can serve as disruptive innovators. Semi-structured interviews with 13 UAV early adopters reveal that legal and regulatory restraints on UAVs facilitated the emergence of a new form of norm entrepreneur inside journalistic institutions. These individuals were able to experiment on the fringes of acceptable practice. In so doing, they seeded their organizations with the skill set and institutional capacity to engage constructively with the use of UAVs once constraints were lifted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People increasingly turn to social media to get their daily news updates. Still, we are only beginning to understand how this development affects people’s perceptions of consumed news stories. The article reports on an experiment designed to investigate the effect the distribution of a news story in social media (Facebook) has on news message credibility. A control group was exposed to a news story on an original news website, and treatment groups were exposed to the same news story shared on Facebook. Results demonstrate that distribution via Facebook affects the credibility of the news story. The effect is strongest when politicians are intermediary-senders, and to some extent depend on the party affiliation of intermediary-sender and the social media audience. In the context of fake news, the results are reassuring: people are less trustful of news they consume through social media. However, the results also suggest that social media news sharing can contribute to the long-term decrease in trust in news.",

    "title": "Automation, Journalism, and Human–Machine Communication: Rethinking Roles and Relationships of Humans and Machines in News",
    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we argue that journalism studies, and particularly research focused on automated journalism, has much to learn from Human-Machine Communication (HMC), an emerging conceptual framework and empirically grounded research domain that has formed in response to the growing number of technologies—such as chatbots, social bots, and other communicative agents enabled by developments in artificial intelligence (AI)—that are designed to function as message sources, rather than as message channels. While the underlying, but often unquestioned, theoretical assumption in most communication research is that humans are communicators and machines are mediators, within HMC this assumption is challenged by asking what happens when a machine steps into this formerly human role. More than merely a semantic move, this theoretical reorientation opens up new questions about who or what constitutes a communicator, how social relationships are established through exchange among humans and machines, and what the resulting implications may be for self, society, and communication. In the particular case of automated journalism—in which software assumes a news-writing role that has long been considered a distinctly central, and indeed human, element of journalism—the introduction of HMC offers a generative starting point for theory development, advancing our understanding of humans, machines, and news for an oncoming era of AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "The growing use of difficult-to-parse algorithmic systems in the production of news, from algorithmic curation to automated writing and news bots, problematizes the normative turn toward transparency as a key tenet of journalism ethics. Pragmatic guidelines that facilitate algorithmic transparency are needed. This research presents a focus group study that engaged 50 participants across the news media and academia to discuss case studies of algorithms in news production and elucidate factors that are amenable to disclosure. Results indicate numerous opportunities to disclose information about an algorithmic system across layers such as the data, model, inference, and interface. Findings underscore the deeply entwined roles of human actors in such systems as well as challenges to adoption of algorithmic transparency including the dearth of incentives for organizations and the concern for overwhelming end-users with a surfeit of transparency information.",

Or are they an opportunity, and, if so, how would news recommenders need to be designed to advance values and goals that we consider essential in a democratic society? These are central questions in the ongoing academic and policy debate about the likely implications of data analytics and machine learning for the democratic role of the media and the shift from traditional mass-media modes of distribution towards more personalised news and platforms Building on democratic theory and the growing body of literature about the digital turn in journalism, this article offers a conceptual framework for assessing the threats and opportunities around the democratic role of news recommenders, and develops a typology of different ‘democratic recommenders’.",

Following a normative approach to news recommender system design, we test utility and external effects of a diversity-aware news recommender algorithm. In an experimental study using a custom-built news app, we show that diversity-optimized recommendations (1) perform similar to methods optimizing for user preferences regarding user utility, (2) that diverse news recommendations are related to a higher tolerance for opposing views, especially for politically conservative users, and (3) that diverse news recommender systems may nudge users towards preferring news with differing or even opposing views. We conclude that diverse news recommendations can have a depolarizing capacity for democratic societies.",

    "title": "Who is Responsible for Stopping the Spread of Misinformation? Examining Audience Perceptions of Responsibilities and Responses in Six Sub-Saharan African Countries",
    "abstract": "Abstract While research on misinformation in Africa has increased in recent years, and despite a growing body of theoretical and empirical work that considers the role of governments, platforms, and users in stopping misinformation globally, there is still a lack of empirical research addressing ways to curb its spread on the continent. Research has coalesced around the idea that no single approach will work in all contexts, and effective strategies need to include media literacy, fact-checking, changes in how news is produced and circulated, government oversight, and regulations as well as responses that take local contexts into account. Using data from 36 focus groups in six sub-Saharan African countries, we examine audiences’ experiences with misinformation and perceptions of institutional and personal roles and responsibility for both preventing and intervening in the spread of misinformation. First, we examine perceptions of misinformation with a particular focus on whether misinformation is perceived as “a problem.” Second, we examine perceived responsibility for addressing misinformation and possible solutions to the problem. Findings suggest that participants perceive misinformation as a problem if it has real or potential negative consequences and express a sense of shared responsibility among individuals and institutions for stopping the spread of misinformation.",

    "abstract": "part of the history. I miss a clearer discussion from the authors if this in any way represents a potential conflict of interest. The advantage of Ball’s contribution, however, is that he also can shed some light on the dispute within WikiLeaks and the many conflicts with governments and other media, the most important one with Ball’s own workplace, The Guardian. Although Julian Assange’s main ambition was to create an organisation dealing with information and not practical politics, he no doubt wants to make a political difference through WikiLeaks. He is “enjoying crushing bastards”, as he has put it (p. 29). The book has a sober evaluation of the many ethical problems caused by the activities of WikiLeaks. Obviously there are several ethical dilemmas involved in WikiLeaks that should worry journalists who use the material in their work. One of them is the lack of transparency within the WikiLeaks organisation. As the book puts it: “So it is a paradox that WikiLeaks, which take advantage of the internet’s ability to hold power to account in a radically open way, is itself not open. By the standards of the internet as well as conventional journalism, WikiLeaks is not accountable” (p. 81). Another ethical problem is that members of the organisation are unknown to each other, and some even to Assange. The breakthrough and impact on journalism came when WikiLeaks entered into alliances with major news organisations such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Der Spiegel. These and other respected news organisations were given access to the material and published their own stories based on the same leaks, on the very day that the documents were leaked. The Epilogue in the book explains how this alliance was broken when WikiLeaks, because of internal mistakes and fear of losing the momentum vis-à-vis other news organisations, dropped an unedited cache of 251,287 documents in August 2011. The partners in the mainstream media in a common declaration condemned the action, partly because the unedited documents identified a lot of individuals who could potentially be seriously physically harmed by their publication. Will WikiLeaks survive? The authors doubt it, but they argue convincingly that the phenomenon of “major leaks” has come to stay.",

    "title": "What Journalism Could Be",
    "abstract": "Barbie Zelizer’s new book What Journalism Could Be is primarily a call to rethink journalism through the lens of imagination. By directing her call to both scholars and practitioners, she asks them to interrogate the generally accepted and widely unchallenged “contours of journalism’s practical accomplishment and intellectual conceptualization” (p. 1). But Zelizer also asks us to consider the possibilities of novelty and transformation. Drawing on current discussions around the world, Zelizer underscores the polarized nature of current shifts in the journalistic environment: the enthusiasts see recent change as the “omnipotent enabler of all things”, whereas the naysayers see change as the “elimination of a legacy gone too soon” (p. 1). Regarding both approaches as limited and one-dimensional, Zelizer positions her argumentation in between, and underlines that “imagining journalism into its margins, across its corners and beyond its limitations” (p. 1) allows for assessing change within a setting that is delineated by the gradual back-and-forth movement between what change can bring, and how it resonates with what journalism was. By underlining how this predominant frame of mind has unwisely and unproductively placed reason on one side of the fence, and imagination on the other, Zelizer suggests that the way to move forward is by bringing imagination to the centre of attention, or in her words “journalism needs imagination to survive” (p. 7). Zelizer examines imaginative thinking by relying on five attributes of the current moment, each offering a new vantage point that rejuvenates the discussion. As such, and by focusing on the idiosyncrasies of the craft, and on political, technological, economic and moral aspects, she highlights those characteristics that align with imagination in the journalistic context as: contingency, flux, noise, contradictions, emotions, inclusiveness, interdisciplinary sharing, but also those that “prevented imagination of taking flight (e.g. didacticism, insularity, binaries, absolutism, linearity)” (p. 7). This book brings together previously published articles and book chapters, however through extensive updates, Zelizer is able to offer new perspectives on her thinking. The book starts by conceptualizing journalism around 12 metaphors that demonstrate how the term “journalism” is perceived. Seven metaphors emerge from discussions among journalists on how they perceive their craft (as: sixth sense, container, mirror, story, child, service, and engagement), while the remaining five appear in the scholarly literature (as: profession, institution, text, people, and practice). Altogether, but also separately, these metaphors frame the discussion on how journalism could work better. The rest of the book is divided into three sections, covering a wide range of discussions. Starting with key contemporary tensions, Zelizer points to their importance and where they are directly connected with our understanding of journalism, in particular our understandings of its substance and the accompanying normative expectations. These tensions help to highlight the positive contributions of journalism, however, they",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the role of automated fact-checking on journalistic authority. Using metajournalistic discourse analysis, this article analyzes 137 articles from January 2015 to December 2022 about automated fact-checking to attempt to understand its role in the evolution of the profession’s boundaries. The data reveals three core themes: shifts of labor and experiences, social and civic responsibilities, and attribution and accuracy as contested issues. Each theme offers a different perspective on journalism’s dialogue of itself. Labor shifts illuminate making the work environment easier. Social and civic responsibilities represent the contention between fact and fiction. And attribution and accuracy highlight the need for human actors in the fact-checking process. The journalists welcome the AFCs for their assistance in labor and combatting misinformation. But the journalists draw a line in the sand to protect their autonomy and authority regarding the evolution of technology in ways like natural language processing and algorithmic accountability.",

    "title": "Algorithmic News Diversity and Democratic Theory: Adding Agonism to the Mix",
    "abstract": "Abstract The role news recommenders can play in stimulating news diversity is receiving increasing amounts of attention. Democratic theory plays an important role in this debate because it helps explain why news diversity is important and which kinds of news diversity should be pursued. In this article, I observe that the current literature on news recommenders and news diversity largely draws on a narrow set of theories of liberal and deliberative democracy. Another strand of democratic theory often referred to as ‘agonism’ is often ignored. This, I argue, is a mistake. Liberal and deliberative theories of democracy focus on the question of how political disagreements and conflicts can be resolved in a rational and legitimate manner. Agonism, to the contrary, stresses the ineradicability of conflict and the need to make conflict productive. This difference in thinking about the purpose of democratic politics can also lead to new ways of thinking about the value of news diversity and role algorithmic news recommenders should play in promoting it. The overall aim of the article is (re)introduce agonistic theory to the news recommender context and to argue that agonism deserves more serious attention.",

    "abstract": "The collection and reporting of audience data through Web analytics is reshaping the news construction process, with journalists now aware of what their online audiences want. A more important question than understanding this process of adoption of Web analytics in the newsroom is how access to audience metrics impacts on the journalism that journalists produce. In this essay, we pose three interconnected concerns about the use of Web analytics in journalism, guided by journalism’s communitarian role. First, we warn of the danger of viewing the audience as disaggregated segments based on consumer preference. Second, we argue against choice as a moral end and call for distinction between the public interest and what the public is interested in. Finally, we warn against the dangers of journalism studies romanticizing the audience and arguing too strongly against journalistic autonomy.",

    "abstract": "While digital networked media contribute to a substantial shift in the relationship between journalists and their audiences, current research still largely focuses on one side or the other. This paper aims to overcome this conceptual and empirical deficit by presenting findings from two case studies on German news journalism (a daily TV newscast and a weekly political talk show). They operationalize the concept of inclusion distance, which aims at the (in-)congruence of mutual expectations between journalists and audience members, in a series of standardized surveys among newsroom staff as well as their online users. The paper introduces three different comparative dimensions which this study design affords and illustrates them with findings (1) on journalistic role conceptions and (2) the (assumed) motivations for participation. Besides demonstrating the value of such a multi-level comparison, our findings also provide substantial and nuanced evidence concerning the relation between journalists and their audiences: in both cases we find high congruence regarding the importance of traditional journalistic tasks such as objective reporting on complex issues, while the inclusion distance is larger for tasks connected to new participatory practices such as opportunities for user-generated content. Regarding motivations for participation, we find a somewhat larger inclusion distance as journalists of both newsrooms overestimate emotional or self-directed goals, but underestimate the wish for expanding knowledge as reasons why users participate.",

    "title": "Bearing Witness While Black",
    "abstract": "Modern black citizen journalists have embraced the mobile phone as their storytelling tool of choice to produce paradigm-shifting displays of raw reportage that challenge long-standing narratives of race, power, and privilege in America. From the cellphone footage of fiery Ferguson, metaphorically ablaze with racial tension and literally erupting into nightly conflagrations of riotous frustration in August 2014; to the final images of a broken-legged Freddie Gray being shoved into a Baltimore police van in April 2015 where he died later in police custody, the familiar tropes of black against blue have transcended the twentieth-century loci of ethnic advocacy press, found formerly within slave narratives, abolitionist pamphlets, and black newspapers, to twenty-first-century sites of black rhetorical resistance, found now in selfies, tweets and, mobile video. What theoretical frames should media scholars use to understand this burgeoning form of mobile-mediated sousveillance? In this essay, I suggest a triangulated approach, where academics meld the literature on media witnessing, Black Twitter, and the black public sphere to explore the full landscape of black witnessing and all of its potentialities.",

    "abstract": "Investigative reporting is valued by consumers and journalists and is vital to a healthy democracy. However, it is a resource- and time-intensive practice that is often seen as financially inefficient. With resources dwindling at local US television stations, investigative news may be suffering. This article analyzes empirically whether social media websites help investigative reporters to do their jobs more efficiently, as has been suggested by critics and researchers. A survey (N = 165) indicated that a large majority of local television investigative journalists use social media as part of their regular newsgathering routine. When this project’s results were compared to similar surveys, data revealed that a significantly greater proportion of television investigative reporters were using social media to interact with the public, to generate story ideas, and to help produce stories, compared to other types of reporters. Yet this high rate of usage did not translate into increased investigative productivity. There was no association between greater social media use and greater investigative production, and investigative reporters at resource-poor stations mostly did not report higher levels of social networking. The findings suggest that social media practices have become common among television investigative journalists, but that traditional newsgathering methods still persist.",

    "abstract": "The future of journalism is hotly contested and highly uncertain reflecting developments in media technologies, shifting business strategies for online news, changing media organisational and regulatory structures, the fragmentation of audiences and a growing public concern about some aspects of tabloid journalism practices and reporting, as well as broader political, sociological and cultural changes. These developments have combined to impoverish the flow of existing revenues available to fund journalism, impact radically on traditional journalism professional practices, while simultaneously generating an increasingly frenzied search for sustainable and equivalent funding -- and from a wide range of sources - to nurture and deliver quality journalism in the future. This book brings together journalists and distinguished academic specialists from around the globe to present the findings from their research and to discuss the future of journalism, the shifting quality of its products, its wide ranging sources of finance, as well as the economic and democratic consequences of the significant changes confronting Journalism. The Future of Journalism details the challenges facing the press in contemporary societies and provides essential reading for everyone interested in the role of journalism in shaping and sustaining literate, civil and democratic societies. This book consists of special issues from Journalism Studies and Journalism Practice.",

    "title": "Worlding: identity, media, and imagination in a digital age",
    "abstract": "David Trend’s recent book, Worlding, is an engaging and provocative read about the blending of “real” and “virtual” worlds in a digital age. It considers the ways we envision ourselves and others—increasingly through media—and how this intertwining and intermingling of the virtual/real offers possibilities for utopian thinking in an era oftentimes marked by pessimism and very tangible issues surrounding consumerism, economic uncertainty, and global inequality. Trend’s idea of “worlding” is highly ambitious, as is the scope of the book itself. Over its course, Trend weaves backand-forth between big topics, famed thinkers, and grand ideas, effectively relating these back to contemporary society. He notes from the outset that Worlding is a broad vision, and the term stretches back to Heidegger who employed it to mean “being-inthe-world” (p. vii). When Trend invokes it, “worlding” is a “word, an argument, and a possibility” (p. vii), though this flexibility should not be misconstrued as apolitical. Its “undetermined character hardly makes ‘worlding’ innocent, deriving as it does from a noun referencing concepts of origins, boundaries, ethnicities, governance, and even consciousness itself” (p. viii). Trend elaborates further on this idea of “worlding” over the first two chapters and we are told it encompasses many theories and is many things, such that if we tried to reverse the process, it would be interesting to see what Trend says “worlding” isn’t. In Chapters 3–8, the notion becomes more concrete, and the many examples offered in these chapters to illustrate and substantiate complex ideas are the book’s greatest strength. Chapter 3, “Consuming Desires”, outlines the preeminent debates on consumption and capitalism, elaborating on the rise of consumer culture as “money brings real and virtual worlds together like nothing else” (p. 37). It incorporates contemporary questions on the influence of concentrated spaces of consumption and e-commerce, noting that the rise of internet shopping and banking means “the need to read details or think about shopping is minimized—making the process easier and, many would say, more efficient. But the ease of internet shopping also represents yet another way that reading and thinking are diminished in the digital era” (p. 52). Chapter 4, “Mapping Media”, looks at how real and virtual territories are demarcated, “exploring it as a continuum rather than a clear boundary “(p. 54). Discussing how technology extends our worlds and creates new ones, and how this relates to issues such as globalization and storytelling, Trend looks at “what goes on inside our minds as we see and inhabit a world of images” (p. 78). Chapter 5, “Destination America”, focuses on the American Dream and a case study of the “Americana” shopping and lifestyle enterprise in Glendale, California. The emphasis here is on how the “‘worlds’ we traverse are increasingly commercialized and ‘scripted’” (p. 85). Chapter 6, “Virtual Culture”, outlines the emergence of online communities via social media, the ubiquity of new media forms, and the rise of immersive video games. Its aim is “to recognize",

    "title": "Trials and Error: U.S. newspapers’ digital struggles toward inferiority",
    "abstract": "Most of us in the field of journalism are familiar with the view that print newspapers are nearing their death at an alarming pace, and that the future of journalism rests on digital technologies. Indeed, most newsrooms across the United States have been reallocating resources from their legacy product to digital media. It is only a matter of time, many scholars, news professionals and even readers believe, before we bid farewell to print newspapers. Iris Chyi begs to differ. In her book, Trials and Error: U.S. Newspapers’ Digital Struggles Toward Inferiority, Chyi questions the validity of the popular “digital first” strategy that characterizes most US newspapers’ managerial approaches over the past two decades. Synthesizing 20 years of audience research, she reaches starkly different conclusions. Chyi begins by asking if new media are the saviors of the newspaper industry, then why does the print product still outperform the digital edition by almost every metric? Drawing on industry data, she provides compelling statistics in terms of readership, engagement, advertising revenue, and willingness to pay. In Chapter 2, Chyi examines the changing dynamics of competition in the US newspaper industry, in the face of information surplus—the phenomenon where average users have so much more content to choose from than they are able to consume at the price of zero. Chyi investigates the economic nature of news as a commodity and raises another question: even if digital platforms were the solution to newspapers’ economic problems, would newspaper firms benefit from what new media have to offer, or would other digital companies, such as news aggregators and social media sites like Facebook, reap the benefits? Her research suggests the latter, and she argues it is an emerging phenomenon that deserves scholarly and industry attention. Revisiting the antecedents and consequences of the newspaper industry’s “digital first” approach, in Chapter 3 Chyi challenges Clay Christensen’s Theory of Disruptive Technology and the “Newspaper Next” project led by his consulting firm. Having gained a following among newspaper executives, Chyi argues, Christensen has been guiding the news industry’s struggling digital ventures. Since criticisms of Christensen’s managerial approaches are rare, Chyi’s dissenting angle is refreshing and notable. At the very least, it calls for more empirical evidence in debates about the future of the newspaper industry. To assess the performance of the newspaper industry’s multiplatform products, Chyi takes on an audience-centric approach by looking at different types of readers: print, hybrid, and online-only. Drawing on readership data, she finds that, for metropolitan papers, online-only readers make up only a fraction of overall readership. Most newspaper readers remain loyal to the print format.",

    "title": "The Generative Dialogue Framework and the Pursuit of Better Listening by Journalists: A Design-Centered Approach for More Constructive Conversations with Audiences",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article introduces the Generative Dialogue Framework (GDF) and explores its potential as a pedagogical intervention, one that could help reimagine the future of engaged journalism by bringing design-thinking practices, creativity, and deep-listening modalities into play. The framework is developed through design thinking and builds around principles from the field of design. It uses virtual meeting technologies to organize small-group conversations, allows for creative and playful activities to help people share stories and feelings, and aims to create an ambient atmosphere of mutual understanding and co-creative problem-solving. With this article, we aspire to initiate a conversation around the value of “pollinating” journalism studies with concepts and principles from design thinking and facilitation so that journalists could become empowered to connect with their audiences with greater empathy and compassion and thereby surface diverse and rich lived experiences using more active and reflective listening skills. To test the framework’s potential for enhancing engaged journalism curricula, we collaborated with 17 journalism students at a U.S. university in a series of activities, from initial training on the platform to hosting a conversation using the GDF to ultimately producing a news story based on the insights acquired through this design-centered approach.",

    "title": "Who Shared It?: Deciding What News to Trust on Social Media",
    "abstract": "Abstract Social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular news sources. They differ from traditional media as people are exposed to stories from a variety of people and outlets, including potential fake news stories. This raises a key question: What leads people to trust news on social media? Research indicates two cues that could impact opinions of news on social media: (1) the trustworthiness of the person who shares a story; (2) the credibility of the news outlet reporting the story. This study tests those factors simultaneously with a recent survey experiment of American adults that simulates social media posts by either a trusted or untrusted public figure and directs respondents to an article manipulated to come from either a reputable news source or a fake news source. The findings highlight the impact elites sharing a story has on views toward an article on social media compared with the effects of the news outlet reporting the story. The study has significant implications for researchers, citizens, and publishers trying to understand how people evaluate the trustworthiness of news on social media and the potential impact of fake news.",

    "title": "The News Sharing Gap: Divergence in Online Political News Publication and Dissemination Patterns across Elections and Countries",
    "abstract": "Abstract Are journalists and Facebook users equally interested in political news? Introducing the conceptualization and measurement of the “news sharing gap”, this study compares the sharing of political news by Facebook users to the production of political news by news media organizations. To paint a broad picture of these differences, we compare the news sharing gap (a) across election and routine periods and (b) across eight countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Analyzing 265,714 articles shared over 12 million times on Facebook, findings show that elections are broadly linked to increases in political news publication, but even larger increases in political news sharing. The study reveals how, overall, political news is shared more often than news publication patterns would suggest, proposing higher political interest by Facebook users than previously thought. In most cases, political news sharing far outpaces political news production in the form of a “negative” news sharing gap, with the relative demand for political news (in the form of news sharing) being higher than the supply. Lastly, building upon previous work, we propose and validate a distant supervised machine learning method for multilingual, large-scale identification of political news across distinct languages, contexts and time periods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study looks at the “cultural competency” efforts of one U.S. public media station as it attempts to shift a culture of whiteness and increase the representation of people of color within both staffing and online and broadcast coverage. Using a field theory framework and a combination of ethnographic observation and interviews, it follows a project that seeks to change sourcing and community engagement practices. The study charts where colorblind ideology and traditions of journalistic objectivity are and are not disrupted—and the challenges of moving from a project to an institutionalized process of culture change that embraces reflexive journalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article develops an analytical framework to examine the contingent power relations between news organizations and platforms. Eschewing one-sided, monolithic perspectives on platform dominance, we instead theorize power as relational. From this perspective, we observe important variations in news organizations’ degree of platform in/dependence. Examining these variations, we propose the concept of spaces of negotiation, which refers to the opportunities available to news organizations to determine how they produce, distribute, and monetize content vis-à-vis platforms. Building on research in journalism studies, platform studies, and related disciplines, we identify three key variables that shape these spaces of negotiation: (1) platform evolution, (2) stage of production, and (3) type of news organization. A systematic analysis of these variables, we contend, allows for a more nuanced, less deterministic understanding of the role of platform companies in transforming the news landscape.",

    "abstract": "The broadening reliance on algorithms to generate news automatically, referred to as “automated journalism” or “robot journalism”, has significant practical, sociopolitical, psychological, legal and occupational implications for news organizations, journalists and their audiences. One of its most controversial yet unexplored aspects is the algorithmic authorship. This paper integrates a multidisciplinary theoretical framework of algorithmic creativity, bylines and full disclosure policies, legal views on computer-generated works, and an empirical study of attribution regimes in pioneering organizations that produce journalistic content automatically. Fieldwork included quantitative content analysis of automated stories on 12 websites and interviews with key figures from seven of the organizations that agreed to be interviewed, despite the general reluctance of news organizations to be identified with such an endeavor. The study detects major discrepancies between the perceptions of authorship and crediting policy, the prevailing attribution regimes and the scholarly literature. To mitigate these discrepancies, we offer a consistent and comprehensive crediting policy that sponsors public interest in automated news.",

    "title": "A Conceptual Framework for Journalistic Identity on Social Media: How the Personal and Professional Contribute to Power and Profit",
    "abstract": "Abstract In traditional news media, professional journalists are expected to follow the norms and practices created and perpetuated in the field to maintain autonomy and authority. Social media spaces lay outside these institutional boundaries, serving as public, semi-public, and private spaces for connection, interaction, publication, and amplification, as well as the commodification of the personal for users, including news professionals. This has given rise to tensions in journalism over the boundaries between the personal and the professional, and the public and the private, vis-à-vis the erosion of separation between editorial and commercial functions in journalism. This article proposes an analytical model to theorize journalistic identities in social media and how they interact with internal and external forces in digital spaces. Specifically, we address the identity (de)construction of journalists along a spectrum from professional to personal as it intersects with elements that impact identity, from publisher to product. This study expands the scope of journalism research to analyse the blurring of editorial and commercial decisions at the individual level, accounting for a break in the established relationship between publisher and product that has formed the basis of the news business for more than a century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the potential added value of online news media in reporting European Union (EU) politics. Precisely, it examines the extent to which online reporting could generate more prominent, more pluralistic and less ethnocentric coverage of EU politics. The above issue is scrutinised in the Cypriot context. A context where the economic crisis has negatively affected both the working conditions in newsroom and the public opinion on EU. The study is based on a corpus of news reports delivered by online news media that vary regarding their journalistic culture, political identity, organisational structure and volume and degree of establishment. Drawing on a multi-method research design, this article argues that online news media in Cyprus do not make effective use of online medium in favour of more prominent, comprehensive and pluralistic reporting. Instead, they exploit the online potential for decreasing their investment in both personnel and time for the coverage of “not so important” topics as EU politics. The article highlights how journalistic processes of news production and journalism culture in synergy with digitalisation processes contribute to the persistence of narrow coverage and ethnocentric framing of EU news.",

    "abstract": "This article demonstrates a method of cultural–historical analysis in which digital archives of magazines and newspapers play a central role. It addresses the formation of broadcasting as a particular complex of social relationships and, further, that can be addressed by investigating changes in the concept of broadcasting itself. Primary sources include digital archives of newspapers and magazines, supplemented by appropriate additional primary and secondary sources. The key question is how a late-1700s agricultural conception of broadcasting as the hand-spreading of seeds in a field emerged in the 1920s radio era and beyond as the indiscriminate electronic distribution of messages. The study documents a gradual, sedimented, radically historical process of mystification and naturalization, in which broadcasting is transmogrified from a human practice of agriculture (an intrinsically human activity) into the electromagnetic basis of modern media systems (a phenomenon of nature and thus by definition outside human control and beyond question or change). The article concludes with reflections about the research process described here, as well as about the value more generally of critical commentary regarding historical methods.",

    "title": "Some Ideas to Update “Comparing Media Systems” to the Digital Age",
    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, we have enjoyed a flourishing of studies, books, and articles on comparative research on “legacy” journalism. Fewer have been the attempts to study in a comparative way how digitalization is changing journalism and how national digital spheres differ from each other. In this commentary, I argue that the limited number of comparative studies on digital journalism has several reasons. First of all, we face a new phenomenon that scholars are just starting to investigate, and therefore the number of already published research is obviously very small. More studies are under way but they are not published yet. The second reason has to do with the very difficulty of recovering the corpus to be investigated: Digital sources are mostly unofficial and informal, they do not depend on established organizations, they are dispersed and very volatile. It becomes therefore very difficult to choose the corpus to be investigated, also because of the dramatic differences existing in the nature and structure of different digital spheres. I conclude by emphasizing the necessary interpretive changes that have to be introduced into the comparative studies of digital(ized) media systems.",

In this environment, journalists and journalism educators have an opportunity to play a stronger role in designing stories and interactions that achieve social and democratic goals. Technical training, critical skills and entrepreneurial thinking are among the ways scholars and educators have grappled with this issue. In this article we add to these approaches, outlining a design-led initiative that introduces sketching as a method for exploring the use of technology in a journalistic context and imagining new possibilities. Rather than teach technological competency, we use sketching as a way to develop enterprise skills and foster creative thinking about how journalism might evolve in light of new and emerging technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the reconfiguration of news work during the COVID-19 pandemic in selected newsrooms in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It looks at how newsrooms operating in different media systems responded to the structural impediments that accompanied the imposition of lockdown measures. Using technology-mediated interviews, the article investigated how COVID-19 reconfigured news work in Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe and how this was shaped by contextual factors in each of these countries. Our study found that COVID-19 severely affected news work in terms of newsgathering, processing, distribution and the funding of media organizations. It created a situation where most news sources were unreachable, marginalized groups and communities excluded, government unaccountable, and advertising revenue reduced. To remedy the situation, media organizations in Southern Africa responded by accelerating the adoption of digital media technologies, by-passing advertising agencies, launching new content distribution channels, implementing paywalls and subscriptions and monetizing virtual events.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the role of code in the process of news distribution and the degree to which code and algorithms can filter and prioritize news, much as an editor would. The discussion focuses specifically on the context of mobile news applications that filter news for consumers. Given concerns raised by the intersection of computer science and journalism, analysis moves away from the common notion that code is replacing humans as producers of news and shifts toward the role of code in helping journalists order and communicate the news. Thus, the focus of this research is on code as technological actants, filtering news based on decisions imbued into the code by human actors. This article reports the results of an investigation of code contained in 59 open source mobile news apps and an analysis of the content of that code. Findings highlight the journalistic decisions made in code and contribute to discussion surrounding the relationship between algorithmic and traditional news values.",

    "title": "The Future Of Journalism",
    "abstract": "The “age of digital media” is witnessing innovation and radical change across all aspects of journalism, creating economic difficulties for legacy media and a frenzied search for alternative business models to fund a sustainable journalism for the future. The global recession since 2007 continues to deepen the sense of economic uncertainty arising from a period of unprecedented change with significant and wide-ranging consequences for the journalism industry as well as scholarly research in the field of journalism studies. The Future of Journalism conference hosted by Cardiff University on 12 and 13 September 2013 was convened by the School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, to address these concerns via five broadly framed questions concerning the current circumstances and future prospects for journalism. How are developments in digital and mobile media, for example, creating new possibilities for producing, distributing and consuming journalism and, in turn, informing an innovatory journalism practice? What are the implications of these changes for traditional business models and for the emergence of new financial strategies to fund journalism? How are these developments evidenced in particular national contexts with their bespoke journalism cultures, histories and professional practices? What are the consequences for journalism education, training and employment, along with journalists’ changing perceptions of their professional roles? Finally, what are the implications of this fundamental restructuring of journalism for the ethical, political and democratic life of communities locally, nationally and globally? The subtitle of the conference, “The Future of Journalism: In an Age of Digital Media and Economic Uncertainty”, was chosen to encourage a particular focus on developments in digital media, but also on the financial strategies designed to resource a viable and democratic digital journalism. The presence of Robert Picard as plenary speaker was intended to underscore that latter focus. The 2013 conference attracted 200 scholars from more than 35 countries, with 184 authors presenting 113 researchbased papers in 30 seminar sessions across the two days.",

    "abstract": "For more than two years now, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the world, also affecting the field of digital journalism studies, including practitioners, media organisations, audiences, and the scholars that study them. The magnitude of the global health crisis has been so immense that it has led to a veritable explosion of research into the impacts of the pandemic on journalism. This journal has already published a special issue on the topic (Quandt and Wahl-Jorgensen 2021), and the response to its original call was unprecedented, containing so many strong studies that the editors decided this warranted a second special issue. Indeed, this second special issue is evidence of the field’s highly sophisticated and in-depth attention to one of the greatest global societal challenges of our time. Across ten immensely insightful articles, authors from diverse national backgrounds shine a spotlight on important questions related to the pandemic’s impact on digital journalism in relation to issues such as disinformation, emotionality, journalism and trauma, changes in practices, press freedom as well as audiences’ perceptions of news. Perhaps most strikingly, while all the studies included here deal with events within a timeframe of the past two years, their insights go much deeper, feeding into and – crucially – advancing debates that have been going on in the field for some time. This is important, because historically, digital journalism scholarship has been arguably a little too fascinated with change coming from the outside. Barbie Zelizer (2019) has recently pointed to this danger in the context of the relationship between digital journalism and technology, warning that it limits our understanding of what remains stable through such changes. In the context of Covid-19, there may be a similar risk and potential blind spots in our scholarship. While the pandemic has undoubtedly had massive societal repercussions around the world, including in journalism, focusing only on how the virus has changed journalism may obscure our understanding of deeper processes that may have been going on for some time. In this sense, the articles in this special issue make an exceptional contribution to understanding the relationship between Covid-19 and digital journalism without placing mere primacy on the disruptive aspects of the pandemic, but rather use the",

    "abstract": "Abstract The proliferation of misinformation in social media has raised concerns on the veracity of news that citizens consume. Recent scholarship has therefore emphasized the importance of news literacy as higher levels imply greater competence in navigating the streams of information in the social media space. Drawing from subsamples of respondents who use social media for news in seven democracies (UK, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Norway, and the US, N = 6774), this comparative analysis examines the dynamics of social media news platform use that influence news literacy. After controlling for demographics, news interest and news use frequency, analyses show that social media news engagement and connections to news organizations and journalists exhibited both positive direct and indirect relationships with news literacy. Multi-platform use of social media for news was also related to engagement, but in five countries the relationship with news literacy was negative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyses news sources used by women to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK parenting website Mumsnet. By using a non-political online “third space” aimed at women, Mumsnetters are able to avoid the aggression women face when they attempt to discuss news in the wider public sphere of the Internet. This third space can also act as a “trusted friend,” allowing women to access important news via a third party. Mumsnetters’ discussion of the news around COVID-19 complicates previous studies’ findings that women prefer to discuss news relating to health, education and the local community rather than politics and international affairs. Mumsnetters discuss the COVID-19 pandemic as both a health story and a political story. They use mainly digital journalism sources, either directly from the mainstream news media or indirectly via social media such as Twitter, thus participating in a hybrid media system. However, some Mumsnet discussants demonstrate a hostility and distrust towards mainstream news sources, even suggesting collusion between the media and the UK government, which has implications for the clear dissemination of government messages around the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the extent to which the online photo-sharing service Instagram assists professional and citizen photojournalists in the performative construction of a hyperreality in accordance with Baudrillard’s theory. Based on a visual analysis of the Instagram photo feeds of six citizen photojournalists and six professional photojournalists, this research aims to identify the various simulations and discourses used by professional and citizen photojournalists alike to stage their photographs and to characterise the differences demarcating the professional–amateur divide. It also examines how the interaction between technology, photojournalistic practices and subjectivity stimulates the mediations and negotiations that condition the construction of this hyperreality. The study demonstrates that by producing, uploading, sharing, commenting upon and promoting these altered photo reportages, the Instagram community inadvertently creates a hyperreal depiction of the world that challenges both, the sense of authenticity characteristic of citizen journalism and amateur photography, as well as the realism to which professional photojournalism has historically subscribed. Moreover, it argues that in order to create their images, Instagram photojournalists use a series of aesthetic conventions and performative discourses that correspond to their roles as either amateurs or professionals. Nevertheless, each group tries to simulate the aforementioned conventions and discourses of the other in an attempt to get closer either to the sense of amateurish authenticity or to professional neatness. As a result, this paradoxical interaction has the potential to transform today’s visual imagery by means of a simulated reality that needs further explanation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aims to predict audience-rated news quality with journalistic values and linguistic/formal features of news articles, based on the theoretical rationales derived from information processing models, journalism and news consumption literature, and linguistic studies. We employed a traditional social science survey of over 7,800 news audiences and implemented natural language processing, text-mining, and neural network analyses for 1,500 news articles concerning public affairs. Results suggest that the journalistic values of news articles are stronger predictors of audience-rated news quality than their linguistic/formal features. The impact of journalistic values overrode that of the news audience attributes which served as a baseline for comparison. Specifically, believability, depth, and diversity were more important in predicting audience-rated news quality than readability, objectivity, factuality, and sensationalism. Regarding linguistic/formal features, bylines, sources, subjective expressions, and article similarities were influential. This study provides an additional support that news audiences regard journalistic values highly as substantial factors of news quality. It also provides empirical evidence for the normative news reporting guidelines. Methodologically, it serves as an example of integrating computational and textual methods with traditional social science approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social media like Twitter have become critical tools for public discourse and journalistic practice as they are assumed to enable equal conversations and engagement between different societal actors. However, recent studies have found that Twitter reproduces existing networks and hierarchies, indicated through homophily where dominant journalistic users with high symbolic capital tend to amplify and engage more with colleagues of similar symbolic status, which legitimizes their authority and dominance in the public sphere. Still, an in-depth understanding of how this manifests and might be rectified is lacking. To fill this gap, we explore the tweeting behaviour of 356 journalists in Austria, as social capital and personal networks are especially relevant to be recognized by peers. Our findings show strong homophilous tweeting behaviour for those with high professional reputation and for men. New entrants aim more towards gaining visibility in these tight-knit groups.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the politics of digital archives focused explicitly on women journalists and their work. A key question is here the wider implications and value for journalism historiography. A qualitative analysis is conducted of the online presence of two illustrative archives, one an oral history project called Women in Journalism and the other a women’s history database called Kvinnsam. The analysis finds that whereas the archives do not lend themselves to participation as agency in co-constructing history, they give access to otherwise nonsearchable, nonvisible, and nonaccessible material of relevance to the history of women journalists and their work. The agency and political power of the archives are dependent on institutions, first, to simply materialize as online archives and, second, to (potentially) affect political matters and express political acts of resistance. For journalism history studies, this means engaging with the archives that exist, what forms they have, and how they are used. For digital journalism, this also implies a discussion of how archival experimenting could develop the field.",

    "title": "Digital Opportunities for Local Journalism: A Panel Data Analysis on the Economic Performance of Online-Only vs. Print Newspapers",
    "abstract": "Abstract Digitalisation led to a structural crisis in the newspaper industry, undermining revenues from both readers and advertisers. Economies of scale play a central role in the newspaper business, but in a context of falling incomes, the major route to take advantage of them is the reduction in the asset size and operating costs. The digital business model can be a way to increase companies’ profitability, as online-only media publishers do not need as many assets and costs as their print counterparts to operate. Digitalisation is particularly interesting for local news outlets, since they operate in small markets and could have difficulties to reach an optimal size. However, there are little empirical evidence on how digital business models influence the profitability of newspapers. Using a sample of 198 and 69 Spanish print and online-only media publishers, respectively, during the period 2008–2018 and applying a dynamic panel data methodology, this article analyses the extent to which the main features defining print vs. digital business models affect firms’ profitability. Empirical evidence reveals a better performance of digital publishers, with lower material costs being the route through which the digital business model benefits from the economies of scale and achieves greater efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a case study of the possibilities of slow photojournalism. Over the past decade, award-winning photojournalist David Burnett has used a 60-year-old Speed Graphic film camera to document US political events, several Olympic Games, and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, among other projects. His photographs reveal a significantly different aesthetic from contemporary photojournalism and he is celebrated for the perspective his analog photographs offer. This analysis is based on two points of examination: first, a textual analysis of articles and videos discussing the work; and second, a semiotic analysis of the imagery. The examination suggests Burnett’s photo aesthetic signifies a longing for an imagined analog, journalistic utopia of yore, where individual journalists had the time and freedom to put care and attention into their work.",

This study uses a lab experiment to address whether and how traditional editing processes affect audience perceptions of the quality, professionalism, and value of news articles. Articles were presented in a mixed design in which participants saw four articles in the edited condition and four in the unedited condition. Results indicate that standard newsroom editing practices have a significant positive effect on a digital audience’s perceptions of news quality and of whether material is worth paying for.",

    "abstract": "Many politicians as well as journalists are using Twitter regularly and are connected on the microblogging platform. We use the agenda-building approach as conceptual background because political tweets can serve as information subsidies if they are used by journalists, indicating an agenda-building influence by politicians. It has not yet been systematically investigated which functions of a political tweet make it more likely for it to be used by a journalist and to which extent the journalist’s Twitter network plays a role in this process. We analyze which functions of political tweets explain their use as information subsidies and integrate the influence of the journalists’ Twitter networks. The study is based on a unique combination of an online survey of Swiss journalists in 2014 with an analysis of the journalists’ Twitter metrics. It demonstrates that political tweets are most likely to be used by journalists if they can quote the politicians’ tweets, which fosters their significance as information subsidies. Also, journalists who have many politicians as followers perceive that they can influence politicians they do not know personally. This underscores that if the Twitter network is included in the analysis of agenda-building processes, potential reciprocal influences can be detected.",

    "abstract": "This study takes the context of the Syrian war and media blackout as a pertinent case to investigate issues of transparency and graphicness when mainstream news media incorporate citizen-generated images. More specifically, we investigate (1) relative proportions of citizen and professional images used by news media through time; (2) source references, and indications of the non-professional origin of images; and (3) topic and explicitness of the depictions provided by citizens versus professionals. In order to do so, we conducted a systematic-quantifying content analysis of the visual coverage of the Syrian war in three Flemish mainstream news media between March 2011 and December 2012 (N = 768). Citizen-generated images prove to be an invaluable source for traditional news media exceeding the urgency of the initial period. Moreover, it seems that professional and citizen imagery fulfill a complementary role in representing different visual framings of (the Syrian) war. Yet the study also confirms non-professional imagery to be more graphic, and news media to be lacking in transparency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the GameStop episode by contextualising the discussion in the structure-agency interplay to understand the role of social news sites in informing, mobilizing, and giving voice to different social and political actors. First, the GameStop squeeze might be conceived as both an individual and collective agency-led form of resistance to the domination of elite power represented by hedge funds. Second, it might be interpreted as an expression of empowerment thanks to the combination of public affair journalism, coordination among people (Power with), and diffusion of a new awareness and information (Power within) through apps and social site news that “democratise” the access to the news related to the trade market. Third, the episode might be interpreted as a structural-led evolution of resistance/empowerment that is driven by market mechanisms and empowered by social news sites. The case of GameStop highlights the impact of UGC on both global agendas and the conceptualisation of digital journalism, challenging traditional news-making as the pillar of public debate, and the nation-state as the main units of analysis for media studies.",

    "abstract": "This essay presents a practice theory perspective, and the analogy of journalistic culture as a kind of woven fabric, to explain to describe the current state of journalism. On this view, journalistic culture is viewed as a woven fabric which contains warp and woof threads. Within the practice of weaving, warp threads represent the vertically organized threads that lend a fabric shape, while cross-cutting woof threads lend it diversity. When applied to the disruption taking place within journalism, there appears to be fewer warp threads and more woof threads in the field today: fewer threads that tie the field together, and more threads that lend it diversity. Yet, even as woof threads are introduced, they depend upon warp threads to maintain the integrity of the fabric. Indeed, the more woof threads introduced, the more they may depend upon the few remaining warp threads. This perspective is illustrated using data from an analysis of local online news in the San Francisco Bay Area. Overall, the perspective suggests that as new practices are introduced into journalism, some traditional practices may become even more consequential than they had been in the past.",

Drawing on research about online harassment and censorship, we link mob violence in physical spaces to harassment encountered on social media from the perspectives of women journalists. We illustrate that the different forms of harassment enabled by online platforms present serious challenges for individual journalists, and the journalism profession. Our findings suggest that online attacks on reporters include comments that denigrate women’s bodies, and discredit journalists’ reportage. The harassment compels women journalists to engage in online hibernation and censorship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the context of increasing dissatisfaction with the role of public-facing social media in democratic life, recent years show a growing number of non-public digital spaces in which people can produce, discuss, and share news. This article focuses on what we term a meso news-space: an online space, located between the private and public realms, where a group of people are involved in news-related processes. This space combines aspects that have long drawn participants to online communities—sociability, a sense of intimacy, and creative expression—with news engagement, an aspect considered important in democratic life. Potentially, meso news-spaces can facilitate greater reciprocity—mutual exchanges—between news workers and audience members, thereby promoting shared benefits. In this article, we explicate the concept of a meso news-space by considering its four key dimensions: platforms, topics, actors, and rules/guidelines, and discuss its value for journalism studies and practice.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examined how message features and social endorsements affect the longevity of audience news sharing by analyzing behavioral data of social retransmission of New York Times health news articles, and associated article content and context data. The results showed that information utility-related message features increased the duration for which articles prompted email-based sharing, whereas emotional positivity and controversiality increased the longevity of social media-based sharing. Expressed emotional evocativeness and the absence of death-related words lengthened the duration for which articles prompted both email- and social media-based sharing. News retransmission, via either email or social media, was more likely to persist when the articles stayed on the “most-emailed” list for a longer time, showing social endorsement-driven cumulative advantage effects. The results further revealed synergistic interaction effects between social endorsements and message features. While social endorsements produced strong cumulative-advantage effects on the longevity of news sharing, articles with certain message features that are diagnostic of their inherent share-worthiness generated even stronger effects than those articles that appeared on the “most-emailed” list for the same amount of time but lacked such features. These features were expressed emotional evocativeness (email-based sharing), the absence of death-related words, and exemplification (social media-based sharing).",

    "abstract": "This study investigates news consumption on mobile devices with the goal of identifying where mobile devices fit into people’s media repertoires and how consumption patterns on them are different from those on other platforms. Results suggest that mobile devices are almost always used along with other platforms for getting news, that news sessions on smartphones are shorter than on other platforms, and mobile news consumption happens more times per day and is spread throughout the day. Implications for the study of news consumption, news producers, and consumers are discussed.",

    "title": "Facebook in the News",
    "abstract": "In May 2016, two stories on Facebook’s Trending Topics news feature appeared on the site Gizmodo, the first exposing the human curators working surreptitiously to select news and the second containing accusations that certain curators censored conservative voices. These revelations led to public outcry, mostly from conservatives upset at possible bias and journalists critical of Facebook for its largely secretive and haphazard approach to news. This study examines the response to the controversy as metajournalistic discourse—talk about news that seeks to define appropriate practices and legitimate news forms. It identifies a fundamental divergence in the public articulation of Facebook’s role in the larger news ecosystem. Facebook reacted to the controversy by formulating an approach to news as a form of content that, like other content on the site, should be personalized, organized according to popularity in the form of user engagement, and free of editorial control from the social media site. By contrast, journalists positioned news as purposively selected and shared while placing Facebook as an active participant within the news ecosystem and therefore beholden to an enhanced institutional commitment to public responsibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The conceptual article can make a valuable contribution to the scholarly conversation but presents its own special challenges compared to the traditional article that reports empirical findings or interpretive analysis with a familiar organizational structure. This article provides a guide to this task, organized around the process of concept explication—the development of theoretical concepts with careful attention to the interplay between their definition and measurement. From ideation to the final writing stage, one must carefully specify how these concepts are connected together in a broader theoretical argument. Examples of this kind of conceptual work are drawn from the field of journalism studies and communication to guide writers in moving beyond an essay that summarizes literature to an article that makes an original contribution, writing in such a way that the key argument is communicated effectively.",

    "abstract": "While a multitude of polls indicate that trust in all forms of journalism is low in Western societies, the problem with trust seems to be especially prevalent in the context of online journalism. At the same time, more and more people are turning to online journalism in today’s digital age, and hence trust in online journalism is increasingly important. To assess the difference in offline and online trust, this paper develops a conceptual model of trust in online journalism that illustrates how the developments in journalism reflecting digitization impact on trust. While some developments enhance and others impede trust in the online context, the overall impact is negative. Results from a propositional inventory support the model. Ultimately, this paper contributes to a better understanding of trust in online journalism and outlines future avenues for research based on the proposed model as a heuristic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores how acts of citizenship are negotiated across populist, political, and networked mediascapes. This is done through a discursive analysis of rights-claims originating in a YouTube video depicting a young boy, who is denied broccoli at a refugee detainment and repatriation centre in Denmark. Besides the video the data consists of digital views and comments, texts sourced from citizen media publications, social media sites, digitally born and mainstream media. We make a distinction between alternative/citizen media, digitally born and mainstream media to examine how different types of media play a role in discursively constructing populist logics. Our key findings show that alternative/citizen media forward political acts and rights-claims for the people by the people, whereas mainstream media generally invite elite sources to speak for the people. Finally, digitally born media encompass elements of both, thus questioning journalistic boundaries. The networked media thereby produce the discursive construction of “the rights of the people” as an empty signifier.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the rise of government-sponsored content, a recent development in the branded content model, in which government agencies assume the role of sponsors of editorial content. Theoretically, branded content blurs the boundary between strategic messages and communicative ones. As such, it embodies an inherently manipulative essence. By examining three case studies of government-sponsored content deals in the Israeli market (2014, 2016, 2017), the article seeks to understand the implications of such blurring once government agencies adopt this practice. Based on triangulation of sources (government documents, media content and reports in the press) the study follows the formation of these deals and dissects the consequences of their implementation. Findings suggest that government-sponsored content promotes the infliction of new types of harm that differ from those customarily associated with commercial sponsorship. It impels media bodies to adopt the role of government agencies at the formation stage. Subsequently, it allows these government campaigns to establish a ubiquitous presence within media space. Most important, the deals open a path for stealth propaganda, either for personal promotion of politicians or advancement of political agendas concerning controversial topics. As such, they corrupt both media outlets and the public sector.",

    "title": "Finishing the “Unfinished” Story",
    "abstract": "Discussion threads published beneath articles on news websites have only lately become the subject of serious scholarship. While early research preoccupied itself with the hostile nature of comments posted on such forums, and the issue of moderation, recent studies have focused on two interlocking questions: the extent to which professional news organizations, and the journalists they employ, are “buying into” the value of encouraging audience-members to comment on their articles and how successfully (or not) news-makers are using threads to forge virtual “communities”. While the purpose of constructing such communities has largely been viewed through a utilitarian prism—as a means of drawing in traffic, building brand loyalty and generating income—consideration has also been given to threads as vehicles for empowering citizens, by allowing them to debate and/or contest the authority of professionally written news texts and/or establishment narratives. This article aims to go further, by building on an emerging strand of research which conceives of discussion posts less as adjuncts, or mere responses, to journalists’ articles than extensions of them. It argues that the most valuable “evidence-based” posts add background detail, colour and context that can greatly enhance—and help make complete—otherwise “unfinished” stories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Confirmation bias is the predisposition to only consume the news, or what appears to be news, that confirms our pre-existing attitudes and beliefs, e.g. anti-vaxxers reading only anti-vaccination material. This plays out, for example, in reading only the news/postings that fit our political or social leaning. It is done to avoid cognitive dissonance as well as eventual disfavor from our social network. Confirmation bias is an important element supporting the diffusion of false news via digital platforms. It is important that we understand the underlying cognitive as well as the social mechanisms and dynamics, e.g. can the news of COVID-19 disrupt or eventually further entrench the cognitive and social dynamics of anti-vaxxer individuals and groups?",

    "title": "Finding the Data Unicorn",
    "abstract": "Understanding how data and computational journalism are affecting news norms, practices and organizations is essential for journalists and researchers. We explore the development of data journalism in Canada through interviews with 17 data journalists and freelancers at six of the country’s largest legacy news organizations. Our central question is how these journalistic identities are both shaping intra- and inter-organizational and professional boundaries and being shaped by them. We draw from systems thinking approach to understanding media hybridity across time and place as well as the traditional sociology of news to assess technological adaptation and agency in this emerging domain. Findings suggest that encounters between emergent and legacy logics have created a hierarchy of hybrid cultures. Two organizations—the public broadcaster and a legacy print organization—showed early stage evidence of blended techno cultures similar to some in the United States. In others there were tensions with professional labeling, resourcing, protective economic strategies and labor policies, limiting options to mobilize power and experiment with technological adaptation in more generative ways. These shifts were occurring within a context of increased cooperation within, across and beyond traditional organizations, pointing to a new degree of networked collaboration in Canadian journalism.",

    "abstract": "Data journalism is an evolving form of investigative journalism. In previous research and handbooks published on this topic, this form of journalism has been called computer-assisted reporting and data-driven journalism, as well as precision, computational or database journalism. In Sweden, data journalism is still fairly uncommon. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the development of data journalism at seven Swedish traditional media companies, using action research methods. The content of this paper is based on an online survey of journalists and in-depth interviews with editors at these participating companies. The results indicate that, based on how this field is currently perceived by journalists in the interviews, there is a common definition of data journalism. Furthermore, the survey shows that the attitudes towards data journalism during the process of introducing new methods and genres of journalism into “old” organizations are correlated with the level of perceived experience in data journalism working methods. The main challenges facing the working methods of data journalism today are a shortage of time and the need for training and developing data journalism skills.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article studies the algorithmic project News values at Swedish public service radio, from the perspective of datafied managerialism. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interviews with managers the study shows how the project, that outwardly works to automate news-sorting algorithmically, was employed to generate data about a number of internal journalistic activities, for a variety of purposes. Data was perceived of as a type of capital that could engender, amongst other things, increased knowledge about the internal workings of the organization, thus making it easier to audit its activities, and to standardize the practice of news-valuation throughout SR. Importantly, these goals were not planned in advance, but emerged over the course of the project. The results show how longitudinal approaches to algorithms and data-collection could benefit journalism studies, as they provide a more comprehensive picture of how data are operationalized in journalistic organizations.",

    "abstract": "Many journalism professionals and researchers have recently argued that newsrooms adopt “audience engagement” as one of their chief pursuits. Yet those who hope to make audience engagement both normative and measurable face enormous barriers to success. Their efforts therefore present an opportunity to learn how journalism is changing, as well as who within the field have the power to change it. This study investigates one such effort with an ethnographic case study of Hearken, a company that offers audience engagement services to news outlets worldwide. Due to news industry confusion surrounding how audience engagement should be defined and measured, Hearken is unable to quantify the benefit of its offerings. Instead, Hearken’s pitch to newsrooms relies primarily on appeals to intuition. Drawing on Giddens’ structuration theory, it concludes that the gut feelings of individual agents can prove more powerful than the structures constraining them, at least during periods of institutional uncertainty.",

In celebration of International Women’s Day this year, the Digital Journalism editorial team led an initiative involving some of the world’s leading journals in journalism, communication, media studies, and media management, to provide free access to a series of important articles by female authors. In continuation of what was started on International Women’s Day, this editorial and this virtual special issue presents a collection of research providing some of the best examples of groundbreaking, leading research in Digital Journalism Studies by women. These articles have been selected because they represent different cultural perspectives and/or offer excellent theoretical or empirical scholarship for us to utilize and extend as a global network of scholars. They show why we need to embrace, not ignore, our full community of researchers and their work, as they make it clear that doing so will only enrich the quality of research and encourage a more global, inclusive conversation about digital journalism in these times.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the gender distribution of sources and the factors associated with women’s representation in news stories on eight Argentine online news sites and their respective social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter. Content analysis of 3010 articles shows that men are approximately twice as likely to be cited as sources as women. The analysis also finds a negative association between articles about public affairs topics and the presence of women as news sources. It also yields an increased use of women sources in stories with a female byline. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between the presence of women as sources and whether the article was posted on the homepage of a news organization or its social media accounts. We draw on these findings to theorize on the role of technological change in the dynamics of gender inequality, and to reflect on how the relative dearth of women’s voices in news stories may hinder diversity and inclusion in the public sphere.",

    "title": "How the Trick is Done – Conditions of Success in Entrepreneurial Digital Journalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract Entrepreneurial journalism is often ascribed the potential to partly close the supply gap in digital journalism caused by the effects of digitization. Decreasing fixed costs on the production stage, in particular, have enabled smaller entities, entrepreneurs and start-ups to produce high quality journalistic content. While there is a broad stream of literature on entrepreneurial success in general, empirical research says little about the reasons for digital journalistic entrepreneurs’ success (or lack thereof). This study aims at empirically investigating success conditions associated with entrepreneurship in the digital news business. Seven broader “super”-conditional prerequisites are considered: Experience, skills, personality, product, business model, company organization, and broader environment. The data, collected through 49 interviews with digital journalistic entrepreneurs in Germany, is analysed with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), a set theoretical method to determine necessity/sufficiency of preformulated conditions for a respective outcome (i.e., entrepreneurial (non-)success). The results indicate high importance of, first, the experience of the founder, and, second, the functioning organization of the company, while, interestingly, third, only absence of support from the broader environment and/or government contributed to the success.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates whether the Local News Map, a crowdsourced digital tool that tracks changes to local news outlets, influenced policy making that resulted in new government supports for Canadian journalism. It demonstrates how scholarly research informs government decision making and identifies a more nuanced approach to tracking research impact at a time when funders are increasingly demanding evidence that research dollars are well spent. We argue that research knowledge is used for various purposes at different points in policy making and that its impact should not just be assessed in terms of influence on a final outcome. Using a mixed-methods approach to chronicle opportunities for research influence, we found that map data were incorporated into news and social media content that helped push the news industry’s problems onto the government’s policy-making agenda. The data were also used by officials to understand what is happening to local newsrooms and to develop a policy rationale for government aid. The results suggest that when impact is defined as situations where scholarly knowledge raises consciousness of an issue, informs thinking or leads to the application of that knowledge, the result is a more realistic assessment of research impact on the policy process.",

    "title": "Placeification: The Transformation of Digital News Spaces into “Places” of Meaning",
    "abstract": "Abstract News websites, apps, and immersive environments have increasingly become places that extend one beyond her physical geography. Digital Journalism Studies requires ways to consider how journalism both shapes and is shaped by the places in which it is produced, practiced, and consumed. Current understandings of place in the news set a foundation for such understanding, though this work usually expresses meanings after a geography is demarcated and characterized whereas in digital journalism, newsmakers and users are frequently creating or reinforcing connection to “place” through mediated experience, interactivity, and amid new territories of online news environments. This article, therefore, argues for the concept of placeification that encourages scholarship examining how places evolve in digital news environments. For this article, we define placeification as “the array of processes and practices in which digital news spaces transform into places of meaning and significance. The term employs ification, a suffix that represents a process of becoming and which acknowledges the structure-agency of the place-making process.",

    "abstract": "Although interactive features, such as comment sections, used to be rare on news websites, they are now the norm. Based on theoretical concepts of interactivity and convergence, we analyze whether diverse sites are similar in the provision and use of interactive features online. We conduct a content analysis of 155 news websites to examine the presence and use of social media buttons, lists of hyperlinks, polls, comment sections, and mobile sites. Television news and newspaper websites are compared, as are local and more broadly targeted news sites. The findings provide little evidence for interactive convergence. Rather, results reveal many differences in the adoption and use of interactive features based on medium and target. Reasons for differences across these sites are discussed.",

    "title": "Editorial",
    "abstract": "This first editorial of 2018 is a slightly unusual one. Firstly, because it is the same across Journalism Studies, Journalism Practice, and Digital Journalism. Secondly, because it is the first in any of these journals — beyond guest editorials — that is not written at least in part by Bob Franklin. The reason, of course, is that, as of this issue, Bob Franklin is no longer their editor, having decided, after 18 years, to pass stewardship of the journals over to individual editors. As a result, Folker Hanusch is now editor-in-chief of Journalism Studies, Bonnie Brennen is editor-in-chief of Journalism Practice, and Oscar Westlund is editor-in-chief of Digital Journalism. As this is a significant moment in the history of these three journals, we decided to co-author this editorial in order to outline and pay tribute to Bob Franklin’s editorship, as well as his wider influence on the field of journalism studies. We also want to address, very briefly, how we see the transition to individual editors and what readers may expect from the journals in the future. While we will deal with individual journals’ approaches in separate editorials, there are some mutual ideas and values we would like to articulate. It is important to acknowledge the work of Professor Bob Franklin in developing the journals into the field-leading publications they have become. The story began in the year 2000, when the first issue of Journalism Studies was published. This came at a time when one barely spoke of a scholarly field of journalism studies, and Journalism Studies — as well as Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism, first published in the same year — played a pivotal role in establishing this field. Back then, journalism was studied not as a field in itself, but rather as a part of other, larger communication fields. The International Communication Association, for example, was still six years away from establishing a Journalism Studies Interest Group, which would later become one of its most popular divisions. These were pioneering times and Bob Franklin was certainly one of the key scholars in promoting and advancing the nascent field of journalism studies. In the early days, the team of founding editors included Franklin, Gerd G. Kopper, Elizabeth Toth, and Judy van Slyke Turk. Together, they edited the journal, publishing four issues per year, until in 2006, when Franklin became sole editor and the journal moved to six issues per year. One year later, he became founding editor of Journalism Practice, a journal established to “provide opportunities for reflective, critical and research-based studies focused on the professional practice of journalism” (Franklin 2007, 1). Originally publishing three issues per year, it quickly attracted the attention of the scholarly community and, as a result, a steadily growing number of high-quality submissions. This meant the journal expanded over time to the current 10 issues per year. Meanwhile, the increasing focus on digital developments in journalism made it important to establish a third journal. Thus, Digital Journalism launched in 2013, with Franklin again its founding editor. It experienced similar growth to the other journals, quickly moving from three to 10 issues per year. With Journalism Studies having moved to 12 issues per year in the meantime, the suite of Franklin-edited journals in 2017 published a total of 32 issues. All three journals have become incredibly successful. The journals contain ground-breaking empirical research, and also offer revised and even entirely new",

    "title": "Digital Innovation During Terror and Crises",
    "abstract": "Terror attacks are moments of chaos and destabilization. From a journalistic perspective, terror attacks disrupt everyday news work where journalists find themselves struggling to restore order and report the event at hand as accurate and speedy as possible. From the perspective of the affected audience, journalism fills vital functions in making sense of the attack, by responding to a complex and rapidly changing mix of social needs. In this article, we explore how such disrupting events as terror can contribute to newsroom innovation in terms of journalistic processes, journalistic products, and even journalistic genres. We use the terror attack and massacre in Norway on 22 July 2011 as a case study, as it to a large extent forced journalists to think outside the box in order to meet the audience’s informational and rhetorical needs. The study shows that innovation is tightly connected to the development of the rhetorical situation through three phases: shock, start-up, and transformation. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews with journalists who covered the attack, as well as a rhetorical exploration of the evolving situational context and the texts that were created in response.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Taking the failing two-sided market model of commercial news media as its point of departure, this article introduces a value creation model that unpacks the dynamics of local newspapers’ value creation from a business, social responsibility, and audience gratification perspective. The integrated value creation model shows how local news publishers’ role as civic institutions and as commercial operations generate both value flows and value flow gaps between audiences, newspaper businesses and society. Specifically, the model illuminates how local newspaper businesses’ value capture strategies and audiences’ perceived value of the digital news product affect local newspapers’ societal role and their business sustainability. The article provides insight into the possibilities and perils of a funding structure for digital journalism in a triple market setting where state subsidies, audiences and advertisers contribute to news publishers’ revenue.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to explore and discuss how newsroom restructuring in favour of cross-media news production is changing news production practices and to what extent media-specific norms, values and practices impede the strategy for change. In doing so, we use the structuration theory of Anthony Giddens as theoretical framework. With his concept of the dynamic relationship between structures and agency, and the analytical division of structures into recursively organised rules and resources, we look at planned newsroom reorganisation in order to analyse aspects leading to its implementation as well as factors resistant to change. Overall, our findings show that conflicts between journalistic norms (accurately researching content) and values (reliably informing citizens on socially relevant topics), and the requirement to produce more content within an ever shorter time, influence the implementation of the intended cross-media news production. Moreover, interviewees suggest that in addition to allocative resources (notably financial and human resources), authoritative resources, such as competencies and expert knowledge, have been relevant for adaptation or maintenance of newsroom structures.",

The study focuses on two Moscow-based correspondents, Shaun Walker and Alec Luhn, and a photojournalist, Paul Hansen, all of whom created parallel conflict narratives on Twitter while reporting on the Ukraine conflict for legacy newspapers. Their use of Twitter is examined here in the context of “personalised reporting” that allows for more opinion and displays of emotion than are typically acceptable in traditional news reporting. The results demonstrate the coexistence of the traditional media’s visualisation of conflict with that driven by social media logic.",

    "abstract": "Social network sites (SNS) like Facebook have become an integral part of accessing news. However, as most users come across news on Facebook when using the site for other reasons (incidental news exposure), they will not necessarily engage with the content they encounter. Although there already is some evidence on the role of single factors that can inform news engagement decisions on Facebook, integrated findings—considering the highly personalized information environment—are still missing. Addressing this, the following study adopts a qualitative approach and relies on self-confrontation interviews with German Facebook users (N = 16). Results of the observations/interviews show that engagement decisions (i.e. the decision to attentively read an encountered news article) are mostly guided by users’ perception of the news content and whether they are (already) interested or invested in the issue of the linked article. Yet, in some situations, this “Matthew effect” can be overshadowed by users’ perceptions of the recommending friend, leaving at least some room for social influence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The production and consumption of online news are usually under a bursty temporal pattern. However, little is known about the psychological and cognitive impacts of such bursty consumption of online news. The study employs a 2 (filled-interval length) × 2 (empty-interval length) × 2 (empty-interval burstiness) mixed design experiment to examine how temporal characteristics in online news consumption influence audiences’ cognition and retention. Specifically, three temporal characteristics in online news consumption—filled-interval length, empty-interval length, and empty-interval burstiness—are controlled in the experiment. We instructed fifty-two participants to read a sequence of health-related news posts under various temporal settings while tracking their eye movements. The results showed that (1) empty-interval length increased retention, (2) empty-interval burstiness increased retention but did not have a main effect on cognitive load, and (3) filled-interval length, empty-interval length, and burstiness jointly influence cognitive overload and retention level. The study highlights the holistic perspective in considering the information exposure effect, thus revealing the complex relationship between temporal information characteristics and cognitive reactions and offering empirical suggestions to improve information system design.",

    "title": "Strategic Rituals of Loyalty: When Israeli Journalists Face Digital Hate",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines how and why Israeli journalists use their military service as a shield in response to online violence and digital hate. This practice, termed here the military-as-alibi strategy, is highly consequential. First, it excludes Israeli citizens who are exempt from military service (mostly Palestinian citizens of Israel and ultra-orthodox Jews). Second, it affirms the presumption that “good journalists” are not to be measured by their reporting, but rather by external loyalty tests that allegedly demonstrate their commitment to the national cause. Drawing on analyses of interviews with 20 Israeli journalists, media coverage and social media content, this article frames the military-as-alibi strategy within the local context of a militarised society, but also as part of journalists’ global struggle to win the hearts of their audiences in challenging times. Building on Tuchman (1972), the article labels journalists’ references to their military backgrounds as a strategic ritual of loyalty. The article proposes an alternative strategy to counter anti-press attacks: if journalism is indeed a public good (Pickard 2019), then “good journalism” should be considered “good citizenship”. This approach could free journalists from surrendering to nationalist loyalty tests, and lay better foundations for journalists–audiences relationships in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory, this study investigated how the quality and reputation of news outlets were related to their social media capital. Social media capital is conceptualized as the resources that news organizations can generate via social media efforts, and measured by examining each outlet’s audience size and engagement metrics on Twitter. To triangulate findings, we used social media metrics extracted from (1) the entire population of Twitter users, as well as (2) a representative sample of U.S. Twitter users whose demographics were identified through a survey. Our results suggest that journalistic reputation is a reliable predictor of a news outlet’s social media capital. News site quality, however, was not significantly associated with social media metrics. In fact, the quality of news sites was at times related negatively to social media capital, such that, controlling for other factors, news from low-quality sites received more retweets than news from high-quality sites. This pattern was especially pronounced among politically conservative users.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Digital first strategies at newspapers raise complex questions of temporality and scheduling. Yet there is a lack of ethnographic accounts for web-to-print newsmaking. While research has long been concerned with time in analog newspaper production, and online news time has mostly been studied through the prism of immediacy, almost nothing is known about dual-platform workflows. What happens to temporalities when web and print production factors and logics collide? Ethnographic research at legacy Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps provides a novel insight. Using a newsmaking reconstruction approach, we conducted an in-depth case study of a single day’s news production with a view to understanding publication times and scheduling. Despite their much-publicized shift to web-to-print production, the impetus for producing stories largely remained subordinate to filling the print pages via backwards scheduling. Tools, meetings and temporal labels defined broad categories of stories that reflected temporal publication objectives and associated production requirements. Many outside forces restricted scheduling options, while publication frequency invariably accelerated late in the day. When publication times were not imposed by external forces, the logics key newsworkers applied to scheduling involved smoothing the output curve, building sequences with variation in form and content, and catering to reader habits and preferences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Focusing on the Egyptian Journalists’ Syndicate crisis in 2016, this article examines how non-traditional journalists contest their peripheral position and push journalism’s boundaries within an asymmetrical context beyond political-legal control. As digital and freelance journalists are excluded from legal journalism definitions, outdated regulations divide professional journalists into a hierarchical system. Rigid boundaries and blurred practice exist side by side. Power imbalances, media patrimonialism, and an ambivalent professional association divide the journalists’ community over recognition and benefits. A qualitative media analysis of three newspapers and interviews revealed a contested spectrum. Journalists demanded professional autonomy but did not push for boundary expansion. Radical critique was missing. Beyond the regional focus, this article offers a contextualized analysis of how severe exclusion and power imbalances shape journalism boundaries. It brings journalists themselves, not just politics, as a force into the foreground to be reckoned with as journalistic divisions block change and sustain inequalities.",

Findings show that complicated organizational arrangements between traditional and online media conditioned the adoption of digital technology, the transition of television media to online settings, and the production of online content at Caracol TV and Citytv. Likewise, the relationship between online teams working for TV stations and online users mimics the traditional relationship between television professionals and TV viewers in national and local contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this introduction, we draw together the articles in the special issue on the platformization of news, highlighting that the articles contribute by answering two central questions. First, what is the extent of contemporary journalists and news organizations’ platform dependence, and how does this vary according to geographic context, organizational resources, and other factors? Second, what is the nature of journalism’s platform dependency? Platforms’ most overt editorial influence on news publishers (e.g., dictating areas of coverage, reshaping headlines, and so on) has arguably waned in recent years – and was never straightforward to begin with. The articles in this special issue encourage us to consider how the platform/publisher relationship is now defined by more subtle, or even hidden, dependencies that are nevertheless impactful. We further argue that various forms of power are at play in the shifting, contextual and embedded configurations of dependency and autonomy in the platform/publisher relationship. The forms of power, which we can observe across the articles, and which matter for dependence/autonomy configurations, are infrastructural, cultural, and geopolitical.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger are an essential part of people’s communication practices, but have thus far received only little attention as a tool for data collection. In this article, it is argued that using established messaging apps in audience research can help to better make sense of everyday information and news use practices. Being already integrated into most smartphone users’ daily routines, providing easy-to-use solutions for the sharing of rich and context-sensitive data as well as an instant feedback channel, messaging apps make the documentation of one’s information/news use a familiar and convenient experience for participants that can easily be incorporated into their day-to-day life. Drawing on insights from two research projects focussed on young adults’ information and news use practices, it is illustrated how messaging apps can be utilized in qualitative and mixed-methods diary study designs. Reflecting on methodological and epistemological issues, the advantages and challenges of using messaging apps in audience research are discussed from the researchers’ and the participants’ perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Journalism researchers and professionals are increasingly focused on the mobile platform, which many believe has become the most popular method of digital news consumption. However, few studies that examine digital news use draw from observed audience behavior. Furthermore, little is known about whether or not different digital platforms affect how audiences actually attend to news. This article addresses these gaps. Using online audience data, we find that over the past year, the mobile news audience has indeed surpassed the desktop news audience in size, and that a subset of this audience devotes an enormous amount of time to news apps, especially compared with time spent on desktop devices. In light of our findings, we argue the mobile news audience should be seen not as one homogenous mass, but as two distinct groups—mobile news browsers and mobile app users. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for news production.",

The findings demonstrated that the solution-oriented story elicited more positive affect, issue interest, self-efficacy, intentions of sharing the story on social media or researching the issue, favourable attitudes towards the advertisement and the brand, purchase intention, and recommendation intention. Irrelevant advertising elicited significantly less favourable attitudes towards the advertisement and the brand, purchase intention, and recommendation intention. However, pairing the solution-oriented story with the irrelevant advertisement elicited significantly more brand recall.

    "abstract": "Abstract Scholars have come to understand fake news as content packaged to look like mainstream news but which is deceptive and low in facticity. This study focuses on the textual self-representations of 50 prominent sites labelled ‘fake news’ following the 2016 US election campaign, with an eye to understanding their stated values and how such sites might mimic other journalistic forms. Findings from a qualitative textual analysis reveal an open commitment to ideological, activist and value-driven reporting by the sites. Outlets openly disclose their biases, attack the mainstream media and privilege truths from subjective perspectives, appealing to partisan audiences disillusioned with the mainstream press. In light of our analysis, we argue that fake news producers should be understood as hybrid actors mimicking features of both mainstream and alternative journalism in a manner that results in interpretive partisan news communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Building on the field theory, this study examined how disclosure of native advertising at popular U.S. news websites may relate to their organizations’ positions in the journalistic field. The study found divergent disclosure practices across websites, between language and visual disclosures, and between native ad links on the homepage and native ad posts on story pages within a website. Overall, older organizations with more Pulitzer awards and younger organizations with relatively more Pulitzer awards and social media followers seemed to execute clearer disclosure. Moreover, the organizations with more Pulitzer awards seemed to impose a clearer disclosure language on native ad links at gateway locations than those with fewer awards but lessened disclosure of native ad posts on the landing pages. The older news websites with more social media followers adopted an obscurer disclosure language of native ad links but distinguished native ad posts more once audiences landed on the content page. This study recommends media effect scholars take a holistic approach to assess ad recognition and suggest publishers build on cultural capital as an ultimate defense against heteronomous forces.",

    "title": "Egyptian Women Journalists’ Feminist Voices in a Shifting Digitalized Journalistic Field",
    "abstract": "Abstract This qualitative feminist study analyzes Egyptian women journalists’ articulations of their shifting roles, struggles, and resistances to the political, legal, socio-economic, and professional challenges in a shifting, hybrid, and digitalized journalistic field. Through analyzing 16 interviews with women journalists representing different media affiliations, experiences, and demographics, this study explores their varied perceptions of the shifts in journalistic professionalism and press freedom in Egypt, their equally shifting professional roles and struggles, and their varied resistance mechanisms. On the one hand, this study unpacks the multiple challenges facing them, such as restricted journalistic autonomy, limited access to information and technology, sexual harassment, lack of job security, and other forms of professional discrimination, in a male-dominated profession and a patriarchal culture. On the other hand, it investigates the parallel resistance mechanisms they deploy to overcome these challenges. We argue that the amalgamation of these cyclical, push-and-pull dynamics gave birth to a new “differentiated media landscape” (Schroeder 2018), representing a third space between mainstream media and citizen journalism, the online and the offline, and the old and the new, in a rapidly evolving journalistic field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study takes an empirical approach to analyze how journalists perform the roles of promoter, celebrity, and joker on social media. These roles already play out in print and broadcast, but much less is known about how they are performed outside of traditional media contexts. This study addresses this gap in the literature through a content analysis of 4,100 posts by 23 Chilean journalists in 2020 on Twitter and Instagram. The analysis draws on key variables derived from the literature, including frontstage and backstage performance, personal context, platform, follower count, gender, and type of parent media organization. Results suggest that Twitter tends to serve as a space for professional performance bounded by established norms and practices, while Instagram tends to offer a space for a more fluid performance beyond the institutional boundaries of the news media. Findings indicate that professional social media contexts are more suited spaces to perform the promoter role, while personal or backstage contexts are more suited for the celebrity and joker roles. Results indicate how journalists take on specific roles on Twitter and Instagram, considering the affordances of these platforms.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how audience members are using “alternative journalism” websites. Based on case studies of four “alternative journalism” sites, two based in Australia and two based in the United States, it examines how and why the audience uses these sites. Traditionally research into journalism and, in particular, “alternative journalism” has focused on the civic role of journalism. However, to consider the individual audience member’s engagement with the site, an approach similar to that which has typically been associated with fan studies is more useful. Using this fan theory, the paper focuses on the role of personal satisfaction and emotional engagement, as central factors in participation on alternative journalism websites. Ultimately it argues that a new definition of participation must be considered for these websites, which does not privilege participation that involves active contributions, but is inclusive of audience members who “internalise” their participation.",

    "title": "The Networked Freelancer?",
    "abstract": "Despite much debate around disruptions in journalism and its future, scholarship is often less inclined to consider the role of freelance journalists on the future of the craft. The increasing trend towards atypical employment in labor markets is also reflected in journalism practice: the number of freelance journalists increased by 67% in the UK from 2000 to 2015. In several Central and Eastern European countries, freelancing is the major form of work in journalism. The advent of social media has given rise to new questions and considerations around journalistic practice. This paper considers the concept of ‘digital labor’ and how this may be applied to the contemporary freelance journalist. Digital labor is not solely considered in a techno deterministic fashion but also includes broader issues such as contractual conditions and work/life balance. To explore these issues, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 freelance journalists working in the Republic of Ireland; 10 established freelance journalists and ten new entrants. We found some salient issues around freelance journalism and digital labor and some notable differences in both attitudes and practices between established freelance journalists and new entrants to the field.",

    "title": "The Creation of Branded Content Teams in Spanish News Organizations and Their Implications for Structures, Professional Roles and Ethics",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, top media organizations have restructured their newsrooms and created branded content teams, or studios, devoted entirely to the production of new native advertising formats in order to leverage this business opportunity. The goal of this exploratory study is to analyse how news organizations in Spain implement this strategy and create branded content teams, changing the structure of their newsrooms and shaping the practices and roles of the editors and journalists involved. Semi-structured interviews with professionals (n = 11) who work at news outlets (n = 8) were carried out in order to explain their structural, professional and ethical challenges. The results show that branded content teams can be classified into three organizational models (integrated, autonomous and emerging) and they are usually formed by hybrid professionals, linking commercial, editorial and design practices. The study participants justify the new practice adopting the role of norm entrepreneurs. Despite the warnings and risks, the interviewees asserted that by inserting an appropriate disclaimer in these new formats, credibility and transparency are not endangered. They also believe that sponsored content will become a fundamental pillar for the business models of their news organizations.",

    "abstract": "Research into the impact of new digital technologies on African journalism is scarce. In particular, very little is known about the influence of digitisation, the internet, mobile communications and social media on the daily routines and practices of journalists in their “natural habitat”—the newsroom (Paterson and Domingo 2008). This gap in empirical research has often resulted in scholarly conjectures that, among other things, seek explanatory frameworks in the uneven distribution and use of technological resources between the economically developed North and the poor South. The resulting discourses invoke the “digital divide” as the default explanatory framework—seen by many as a chasm that prevents journalists in Africa from “drinking at the fount” (Berger 2005) of the unfolding digital revolution. Thus, African journalism is seen as being “in deficit as regards the emerging global information order” (Berger 2005, 1). The dominant discourse, as Berger further contends, is that “some of us have arrived in the land of plenty; the rest lag behind, empty-handed and hopeless, and urgently need to play catch-up or even leapfrog” (2). In short, “when seen in comparison with the First World, there are indeed shortcomings and a dire need for catch-up in [Africa]” (1). While this sense of backwardness aptly relates to setbacks associated with the realities of “access” to digital technologies, it also connects to the complexities and contradictions connected to the “localised” diffusion and permeation of digital technologies in African newsrooms. Collectively, these challenges, as Berger argues, inform much thinking about Africa in the global “Information Society”, and often project an image of helpless journalists, who operate in conditions well below the purported level of their colleagues in the global North. Yet, despite these challenges and prevailing assumptions, there is no denying the fact that African newsrooms (as elsewhere) are experiencing the disruptive—somewhat cataclysmic—impact of new digital technologies on the way news is generated, disseminated and consumed by their audiences. There are clear indications that a number of countries on the continent have functioning new technology facilities and indeed dimensions of internal newsroom creativity and adaptations to the digital revolution (however small) are emerging (see Accone 2000; Chari 2009; Berger 2011; Mabweazara 2011; Mudhai 2011; Mabweazara, Mudhai, and Whittaker 2014). Digital technologies are changing the informational needs of citizens and newsrooms (alongside their journalists) are being forced to adapt in various ways. As Berger (2005, 1) puts it: African journalists",

    "abstract": "What kind of news time does a public need? The production, circulation, and interpretation of news have always followed timelines and rhythms, but these have largely been seen as artifacts of press sociology, not central aspects of journalism’s public mission linked to the design and deployment of journalism infrastructure. Since different types of news time make possible different kinds of publics, any critique of the press’s material cultures of time-keeping is a critique of the press’s power to convene particular people and issues, at particular times. Motivated by the temporal needs of one type of public (a pragmatic public that ensures a public right to hear), this paper proposes a unit for studying news time (the temporal assemblage), and traces it across four intertwined sites in the contemporary, networked press: labor routines, platform rhythms, computational algorithms, and legal regulations. Beyond this article’s investigation of this public in relation to these dynamics, my aim is to contribute to the emerging “slow journalism” movement by asking: how slow—or fast—do different publics need news to be? And how are networked press paces set?",

    "abstract": "The “right to be forgotten” recognizes that people may have some degree of control over information about their pasts. Under this recently enshrined principle of European human-rights law, the rights of the subject must be balanced against both the public interest in the relevant information and the economic freedom of companies making the data available. The European Court’s landmark 2014 decision required only search-engine companies, rather than news organizations, to remove designated personal information from public view, but, meanwhile, news organizations have gradually become increasingly willing to grant requests for the unpublishing of damaging reports. The principles of free expression, historical integrity and accountability favor continuity of publication, while opposing values include harm reduction, privacy and redemption. To reconcile conflicting principles, it may help to distinguish between truthfulness and relevance, and between the mere availability of information and ease of searchability. But emerging ethical implications of news’ durability include a recognition that news producers and news subjects share autonomy over expression choices, and that news sources deserve to exercise a reasonable degree of informed consent regarding their collaboration in journalists’ work.",

    "title": "Narrating Networks",
    "abstract": "Networks have become the de facto diagram of the Big Data age (try searching Google Images for [big data AND visualisation] and see). The concept of networks has become central to many fields of human inquiry and is said to revolutionise everything from medicine to markets to military intelligence. While the mathematical and analytical capabilities of networks have been extensively studied over the years, in this article we argue that the storytelling affordances of networks have been comparatively neglected. In order to address this we use multimodal analysis to examine the stories that networks evoke in a series of journalism articles. We develop a protocol by means of which narrative meanings can be construed from network imagery and the context in which it is embedded, and discuss five different kinds of narrative readings of networks, illustrated with analyses of examples from journalism. Finally, to support further research in this area, we discuss methodological issues that we encountered and suggest directions for future study to advance and broaden research around this defining aspect of visual culture after the digital turn.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates whether sharing of or commenting on online news enhances loyalty toward online news outlets. We identify two mediators of audience integration and loyalty: satisfaction and trust, which are measured by attitudinal attributions toward a news outlet. Loyalty is measured by frequently and exclusively using an online news outlet and an absent willingness to change to another online news outlet in the future. The relations between audience integration, satisfaction, trust, and loyalty are estimated with a mediation model. Results from an online survey with N = 1825 Swiss online news users reveal small but significant effects of sharing and commenting quantities on loyalty. Sharing tends to increase satisfaction, which in turn enhances loyalty. In contrast, commenting deteriorates satisfaction and trust, but directly improves loyalty. Overall, sharing and commenting slightly increase loyalty. In conclusion, sharing has a small, positive attitudinal relationship-building capacity for online news outlets, whereas commenting does not. Nonetheless, commenting features should not be abandoned by news outlets.",

    "abstract": "Digital Journalism has enjoyed a rapid rise in its reputation and standing during the past four years. While metrics should never be the sole measure of success, the journal in 2021 boasted a two-year SSCI impact factor of 7.986, a Scopus 9.8 CiteScore, and ranked number one on Google scholar’s top publications for Humanities, Literature and the Arts. DJ’s success has required an immense amount of hard work but we are pleasantly surprised by how quickly it has rocketed up the publication charts in the field of Communication. However, it is not the metrics that we are proud of most, it’s the global and meaningful network that has developed and the breaking down of some cultural barriers such as language. In the sections that follow we fuse theoretical insights from our former associate editor Scott Eldridge II (2018–2021) around core and periphery tensions with some of our own observations to reflect on our journey to date and challenges ahead. Scott announced his decision to step down from the team early in 2021, and also to end his association as the journal’s book reviews editor. He became a dear friend and collaborator, contributing immensely to the journal, and we will outline his journey with us in more detail shortly. Our decision to privilege his theoretical voice here is a careful and deliberate one.",

    "title": "Dealing with Opinion Power in the Platform World: Why We Really Have to Rethink Media Concentration Law",
    "abstract": "Abstract The platformised news environment affects audiences, challenges the news media’s role, and transforms the media ecosystem. Digital platform companies influence opinion formation and hence wield “opinion power,” a normatively and constitutionally rooted notion that captures the core of media power in democracy and substantiates why that power must be distributed. Media concentration law is the traditional tool to prevent predominant opinion power from emerging but is, in its current form, not applicable to the platform context. We demonstrate how the nature of opinion power is changing and shifting from news media to platforms and distinguish three levels of opinion power: (1) the individual citizen, (2) the institutional newsroom and (3) the media ecosystem. The reconceptualization at the three levels provides a framework to develop future (non-)regulatory responses that address (1) the shifting influence over individual news consumption and exposure, (2) the changing power dynamics within automated, datafied and platform-dependent newsrooms, and (3) the systemic power of platforms and structural dependencies in the media ecosystem. We demonstrate that as the nature of opinion power is changing, so must the tools of control.",

    "abstract": "Bourdieu-inspired journalism scholarship, and journalism studies at large, could benefit from an approach that can holistically explain how journalists make sense of technology-related change in the journalistic field. By merging key insights from field theory with philosophy of technology, and by analyzing 40 qualitative interviews with agents across a wide range of positions in the Swedish journalistic field, we uncover how journalists view technological change in relation to the field ’ s autonomy, capitals and habitus. At the macro-level, the analysis shows how technology is constructed in the journalistic field at large, indicating a digital heteronomy. At the meso-level, findings indicate that positions become rearranged when new skills such as metrics and engagement management become collectively recognized as capital. Field-specific, journalistic, capital is supplemented with a viral-ity capital. At the micro-level, we unravel an emerging journalistic habitus formed in relation to structural transformations in the field – the feel for engagement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social sciences are facing a crisis of replicability, and concerns about the confidence in quantitative findings have resulted in an increasing interest in open science practices across many fields. In this article we introduce scholars of (digital) journalism studies and communication science to multiverse analysis while addressing the possible reasons of heterogeneity in the findings of research on engagement with news on social media. Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the contemporary issue of newspaper paywalls. The paper aims to analyse different paywall models and how they impact on media corporations’ revenues in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland (Piano Media), Australia, New Zealand and Finland. The paper finds that newspaper paywalls provide roughly 10 per cent of media companies’ publishing/circulation revenues. The paper also finds that paywalls are softening and prices in some cases are decreasing as news corporations fight for new digital subscribers and revenues. The argument here is that the revenue generated by paid online news content is not substantial enough to make paywalls a viable business model in the short term. Media corporations do not disclose information about their digital subscription revenues and this lack of transparency might impact on research findings.",

    "title": "Taking Stock of the Toolkit",
    "abstract": "When analyzing digital journalism content, journalism scholars are confronted with a number of substantial differences compared to traditional journalistic content. The sheer amount of data and the unique features of digital content call for the application of valuable new techniques. Various other scholarly fields are already applying computational methods to study digital journalism data. Often, their research interests are closely related to those of journalism scholars. Despite the advantages that computational methods have over traditional content analysis methods, they are not commonplace in digital journalism studies. To increase awareness of what computational methods have to offer, we take stock of the toolkit and show the ways in which computational methods can aid journalism studies. Distinguishing between dictionary-based approaches, supervised machine learning, and unsupervised machine learning, we present a systematic inventory of recent applications both inside as well as outside journalism studies. We conclude with suggestions for how the application of new techniques can be encouraged.",

    "title": "The Neighborhood Hyperlocal",
    "abstract": "Closure of local newspapers and other community weeklies across the United States has severely affected local news coverage, leading concerned citizens and journalists to start hyperlocal news sites in their neighborhoods. Similar to community weeklies, these sites focus on a small, geographically defined area and are usually created to fill a certain gap in news coverage. Few studies, however, reveal much about these sites especially in the United States, including information about those who work for them and whether they are a harbinger of new forms journalism or simply reflections of traditional media. This study examined the social characteristics of those who work in these sites, their perceptions of journalistic behaviors they follow when working with user-generated content and their attitudes towards user-generated content within the theoretical framework of hierarchy of influences and gatekeeping. Findings reveal that journalistic routines and behaviors of the respondents working in hyperlocal media are similar to those practiced by journalists in mainstream media. Implications and future studies are addressed.",

    "title": "The Material Traces of Journalism",
    "abstract": "This paper explores how the study of objects of journalism, retraced through the material traces left in metajournalistic discourses, might constitute a robust basis to investigate change and permanence in contemporary journalism. We delineate a research program focusing on materiality that requires foremost that objects should not be taken for granted and, therefore, that each object’s social history be minutely retraced. Stemming from two specific objects (the blog and the hyperlink), the paper argues that beyond their idiosyncrasies, both follow a similar rationale that could be extrapolated to other objects and lead to a materially focused social history of journalism in a digital age. The paper first clarifies how we approached the notion of “objects of journalism” and which objects we chose to study. Then, we show how different theoretical frameworks led us to adopt a similar research stance and a shared hypothetico-inductive path: determining how objects are parts of a series and analyzing metajournalistic discourses to retrace each object’s history on an empirically grounded basis. The resulting attention to filiations and context ultimately produces a contextualized socio-history of objects.",

    "abstract": "Local news is nothing new, but there is an unmistakable hype around its reinvention in the digital age through the hyperlocal phenomena. This article applies the lens of subculture theory to move beyond questions related to who produces hyperlocal news, how to pay for it and its democratic potential, to focus on its social and cultural values and meanings. In doing so, it engages with the normative and political economy approaches that dominate this niche of journalism studies. We argue that a cultural approach can generate much-needed critical perspectives on the significance of what we term “excessively local news” and the future of mainstream journalism in this globalized world. In the process, it challenges media scholars and practitioners who cleave to traditional hierarchies of value about what hyperlocal news is and should be, even at the risk of being unfashionable in the digital age.",

The first part offers a review and critique of influential claims arising from self-styled new studies of convergence culture, media and creative industries. The second part discusses the contribution of critical political economy in examining digital journalism and responding to celebrant claims. The final part reflects on problems of restrictive normativity and other limitations within media political economy perspectives and considers ways in which challenges might be addressed by more synthesising approaches. The paper proposes developing radical pluralist, media systems and comparative analysis, and advocates drawing on strengths in both political economy and culturalist traditions to map and evaluate practices across all sectors of digital journalism.",

    "title": "Data “Objectivity” in a Time of Coronavirus: Uncovering the Potential Impact of State Influence on the Production of Data-Driven News",
    "abstract": "Abstract News reports on the Covid-19 pandemic have largely been data-driven, with coverage on infection numbers, deaths, recoveries, tests administered, economic impacts and vaccine trials; data for these stories tend to be disseminated from top-down, by governments and public health organizations, and often viewed as scientific and precise. This article examines critically the “objective” nature of data and discusses the social constructionist nature of data journalism, where data access and presentation may be shaped by power and social relations. This study focuses on Singapore, a global city in Asia that received praise in international media at the start of the pandemic when it was able to keep its infection numbers low while other cities went into lockdown; the turning point came when numerous infection clusters developed in the migrant worker dormitories on the island. Through in-depth interviews with newsworkers, this study maps out the potential extent of state influence on press coverage and journalistic sensibilities during the coronavirus pandemic through the stages of news production – from the news gathering and selection stages, to the newswriting and presentation stage – and offers an assessment of how data “objectivity” may be a powerful tool to shape public opinion in times of crisis.",

    "title": "Can Immersive Journalism Enhance Empathy?",
    "abstract": "Major news outlets such as the New York Times and the Guardian have recently launched ambitious immersive journalism projects. Adopting the technologies and rhetoric of immersive journalism first presented by Nonny de la Peña in 2010, these news outlets seek to use virtual reality and 360 video to create deeper engagement and empathy with their audiences. Yet can immersive journalism enhance empathy? This question is unanswerable without a thorough discussion of the concept of empathy, a discussion that so far has been missing in the academic literature and popular commentary. This article addresses the gap by presenting current debates about the definition of empathy and using these debates to critically assess de la Peña’s immersive journalism projects “IPSRESS” and “Hunger in Los Angeles,” and the recent New York Times “The Displaced” and Guardian’s “6 × 9” immersive journalism projects. The conclusion is twofold: On the one hand, I will argue that some immersive journalism projects are approaching a format that may enhance empathy, and on the other hand, I will propose that the project of immersive journalism needs to go beyond this goal and into adopting a more forceful role in shaping the future of virtual reality.",

This paper investigates how journalistic practices, cultures, business models, and institutions approach Twitch through three empirical sites: The Washington Post’s experimentation with the app, left-leaning political influencer Hasan Piker, and the pro-QAnon 24/7 “news” channel, Patriots’ Soapbox. The cases demonstrate how newsmaking on Twitch flouts traditional journalists’ ideological and occupational boundaries, exploiting the platform’s features and affordances to enroll the audience in a live broadcasting experience.",

    "abstract": "Labor remains sidelined in journalism studies, especially the working conditions and experiences of journalists in digital-first newsrooms and those whose work primarily involves engagement with social media. This article reports on the findings of an exploratory study on the work of digital journalism. Based on interviews with self-identified digital journalists in Canada and the United States about their daily work experiences, the paper outlines entry points for understanding what it is like to labor in networks of high-speed information production and circulation. Drawing on a critical political economy framework, the paper begins with an overview of the structural dynamics shaping digital journalists’ working conditions, then examines how these dynamics manifest in daily working conditions, including issues of control, speed, analytics and measurement, intensification, commodification and resistance. The paper aims to contribute to furthering a labor-focused agenda in digital journalism studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Immersive journalism (IJ) is often assumed to be inherently emotion-inducing. Through using inclusive technology, interaction possibilities and immersive narratives, the audience should ideally experience what feels like to be in a certain situation. However, for the most part we do not know to which extent and in what form IJ influences the experience of emotions. We wanted to investigate, whether, and if so, which characteristics of IJ are related to the experience of emotions, and which role the personality trait empathy tendency plays in this respect. This is important, as the evaluation of IJ often relies on the emotion-inducing assumption thereof. Four different experiments comparing one immersive journalistic characteristic (level of inclusion, interaction possibilities, immersive narratives) to the respective non-immersive counterpart were conducted. Results indicate that while the level of inclusion and interaction possibility increase the intensity of the experience, the immersive narrative influences the valence dimension of emotions. Additionally, empathy tendency is found to be a relevant moderator for these effects. Conclusions are threefold. First, the narrative form of IJ is key; second, the analysis of IJ needs to go beyond the level of inclusion; third, including emotions when assessing IJ is fundamental to understand its impact.",

    "title": "On the Mainstream/Alternative Continuum: Mainstream Media Reactions to Right-Wing Alternative News Media",
    "abstract": "Abstract Using the mainstream media as a starting point, this article argues that the ongoing changes in the mainstream/alternative continuum are not just dependent on how right-wing alternative news media relate to certain journalistic practices but also on mainstream media reactions to their emergence. The following questions are thus asked: Are right-wing alternative news media accepted or rejected as journalistic actors, and are their ideological orientation deemed legitimate or deviant? this article combines insights into how the boundaries between mainstream and alternative media have become increasingly blurred in the digital context and uses the concepts of boundary work, interloper media and Hallin’s three-sphere model to examine these questions in a Scandinavian context. Based on a quantitative content analysis of 430 online mainstream news articles, this study demonstrates striking differences between the Scandinavian countries. While there are few or no reactions from the Danish mainstream media, the Swedish mainstream media largely reject right-wing alternative media as journalistic actors and position their ideological orientation as deviant. The Norwegian case is found in between. The results contribute to developing the scholarly understanding of the mainstream/alternative continuum and, thus, right-wing alternative news media’s position in the wider digital media landscape from a mainstream media perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although data journalism is practiced globally, data journalism research has traditionally focused on a limited set of countries, primarily within the liberal and democratic corporatist media systems. Many recently published studies illustrate a growing scholarly interest in data journalism in other parts of the world, but these studies are still limited in number. This special issue brings together five new empirical studies of data journalism around the world, as well as two commentaries and two book reviews on the topic with the aim of broadening the theoretical, empirical, and geographic perspectives on data journalism. The core of the special issue consists of five national and comparative case studies studying data journalism in Africa, the Arab world, Italy, the UK, and Argentina. Combined, these articles and the other publications in this special issue point to three important contextual factors that shape data journalism worldwide: journalistic cultures, media markets, and the political environment. After a discussion of each of these three factors, areas for future research are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the uses of sources in coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in social media posts of mainstream news organizations in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. Based on computational content analysis, our study analyzes the sources and actors present in more than 940,000 posts on COVID-19 published in the 227 Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts of 78 sampled news outlets between January 1 and December 31 of 2020, comparing their relative importance across countries, across media platforms, and across time as the pandemic evolved in each country. The analysis shows the dominance of political sources across countries and platforms, particularly in Latin America, demonstrating a strong role of the state in constructing pandemic news and suggesting that mainstream news organizations' social media posts maintain a strong elite orientation. Health sources were also prominent — consistent with the defining role of biomedical authority in health coverage—, while significant diversity of sources, including citizen sources, emerged as the pandemic went on. Our results also revealed that the use of specific sources significantly varied over time. These variations tend to go hand in hand with specific global milestones of the pandemic.",

    "title": "Participative Gatekeeping: The Intersection of News, Audience Data, Newsworkers, and Economics",
    "abstract": "Abstract The use of metrics and analytics is becoming pervasive in newsrooms the world over. However, there is a lack of consistent terminology in scholarly literature with regards to such practice and a dearth of studies that compare practice on a wider scale that prevents more holistic understanding of how audience data are being used on the newsroom floor. These issues are addressed with the development of a new participative gatekeeping model with three previously unidentified channels of gatekeeping specifically related to the use of audience data: promotional, for the type of short-term gatekeeping done on news site homepages that involves tracking real-time metrics to position content, often tied to traffic targets; developmental, or longer-term strategies that shape future coverage and are grounded in hypotheses of audience behaviour gleaned from analytics; and a third more porous channel of experimentation where such hypotheses are tested. These channels were observed in ethnographic research in six newsrooms in three different countries at media outlets with diverse sources of revenue: Norway’s public broadcaster, NRK; Canada’s subscriber-based national news agency, The Canadian Press (CP); and two local newsrooms working within larger media organizations, The Hamilton Spectator in Canada, and The Bournemouth Daily Echo in England. Through a sociological lens, this article distinguishes language to best document the complex processes interconnected with audience data, identifies similarities in practice that override media or revenue systems, and explores how the audience, through the participatory mechanisms of metrics and analytics, shapes newsroom practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article proposes a definition of alternative news media and suggests routes for further research. It complements and extends previous conceptualizations in research on alternative media and outlines an umbrella definition of this phenomenon aimed to inspire contemporary research and scholarly debate. Previous research has been guided by a “progressive” perspective as a form of resistance against “bourgeois” hegemonic discourse. Such normative evaluations have in turn limited how the phenomenon has been studied empirically, by limiting the scope of research so that important contemporary phenomena fall outside the theoretical map. Conceptualizing alternative news media in the present hybrid and polarized media environment, we first propose a non-normative, multilevel relational definition: Alternative news media position themselves as correctives of the mainstream news media, as expressed in editorial agendas or statements and/or are perceived as such by their audiences or third-parties. This counter-hegemonic alternativeness can emerge on the macro-level of societal function, the meso-level of organizations and/or the micro-level of news content and producers. Second, demonstrating why this umbrella definition is fruitful in the changing media environment characterized by boundary struggles, crisis in legacy news media and mushrooming of alternative news outlets, we highlight research gaps and propose future research.

    "abstract": "News-writing bots have been applied in news production. However, findings remain equivocal about how machine authorship is received by readers. To understand the inconsistency in past findings, this study conducted a 2 (purported writer: human vs. machine) × 2 (news organization: the New York Times vs. Fox News) × 2 (news type: spot news vs. interpretive news) between-subjects online experiment (N = 355) to examine how the identity of news writers, human vs. machine, would impact the processing and evaluation of the news writer and the news as context varies. Findings suggest that machine-written news induced less emotional involvement and was perceived as more objective. However, machine writer was perceived as of less expertise compared with its human counterpart. On the selected issues (Obamacare, LGBT rights, and refugee admission), news purported to be released by Fox News was less trusted by the participants than the New York Times. For a media organization whose news was more trusted, utilizing news-writing bots enhanced perceived news objectivity. Otherwise, employing bots further reduced perception of the writer’s trustworthiness and expertise. Furthermore, machine authorship enhanced perceived news credibility more prominently when writing a genre that demanded more information processing. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Journalists in democratic societies perceive their role as guardian of the public’s trust. This ethic of social responsibility has been infused into all tasks related to news production—particularly the act of convening debate surrounding salient issues. The entry of data journalists into the newsroom has upended this shared occupational schema. In processing big data for a lay audience, data journalists place greatest emphasis upon their role as translators of abstract and technical knowledge. While these newsworkers still perceive their work as operating in the public good, data journalists are shifting their professional boundaries when promoting conversation around data products—particularly in the social space. This work, based on in-depth interviews with data journalists in America’s top newspapers, illuminates how data journalists perceive their social responsibility role in fostering democratic conversation with the audience.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current research investigated (a) if political identity predicts perceived truthfulness of and the intention to share partisan news, and (b) if a media literacy video that warns of misinformation (priming-video) mitigates the partisan bias by enhancing truth discernment. To evaluate if heightened salience of misinformation accounts for the effects of the media literacy intervention, we also tested if recalling prior exposure to misinformation (priming-question) would yield the same results as watching the literacy video does. Two web-based experiments were conducted in South Korea. In Study 1 (N = 384), both liberals and conservatives found politically congenial information more truthful and shareworthy. Although misinformation priming lowered perceived truthfulness and sharing intention of partisan news, such effects were greater for false, rather than true information, thereby improving truth discernment. Study 2 (N = 600) replicated Study 1 findings, except that the misinformation priming lowered perceived truthfulness and the sharing intention across the board, regardless of the veracity of information. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the robust operation of partisan bias in the processing and sharing of partisan news. Misinformation priming aided in the detection of falsehood, but it also induced distrust in reliable information, posing a challenge in fighting misinformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alternative digital media typically provide a counter-public sphere by opposing the contents generated by the mainstream media as well as political elites. While previous research has mainly explained the usage of alternative digital media, we particularly lack research on its association with key political outcomes relevant to democracy. Using two-wave panel data (N = 524), we looked at over-time relationships of alternative digital media as well as mainstream media use on political interest and political knowledge. Furthermore, we also examined the interplay of alternative digital media and mainstream media use. We found that alternative digital media use is positively related to political interest over time, confirming the mobilizing nature of alternative digital media. More importantly, our findings suggest that alternative digital media use erodes political interest in mainstream media users. Therefore, mainstream media audiences may gradually become disinterested in politics when they are heavily exposed to alternative digital media. Both alternative digital media and mainstream media use were unrelated to political knowledge, yet political interest was positively related to political knowledge over time. Implications are discussed.",

    "title": "BREAKING BOUNDARIES",
    "abstract": "This paper reconceptualises the role of the small “local” newspaper in a new media environment and argues that definitions and concepts currently used to describe and define such publications are becoming increasingly problematic as newspapers shift into both print and online formats. The paper highlights the continued importance of geography for such newspapers at a time when there is wide academic debate on the relevance of territory and boundaries and the impact of time–space compression in a new media world. It argues, however, that a focus on a newspaper’s geographic connection must also acknowledge the increasing boundlessness and openness of the social space in which a newspaper operates. Ultimately this paper suggests the concept of “geo-social” news may be a more appropriate framework for scholars to consider such publications. I draw on the work of geography scholars, and discussions around “space” and “place” to construct the notion of “geo-social” news, highlighting some exemplars of small commercial newsroom practices in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada and discussions with newspaper editors in Australia to demonstrate the relevance of the “geo-social” concept.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The consumption of news increasingly takes place in the context of social media, where users can personalize their repertoire of news through personal news curation practices such as following a journalistic outlet on Twitter or blocking news content from a Facebook friend. This article examines the prevalence and predictors of curation practices that have the potential to boost or limit social media news exposure. Results from a representative online survey distributed across thirty-six countries demonstrate that more than half of all news users on social media engage in such practices. Significant predictors of news-boosting curation are news interest and the willingness to engage in other news-related activities on social media. News-limiting practices on social media are linked to general news avoidance and, in the case of the US, political extremism, which might decrease the chances of incidental news exposure. News-boosting and news-limiting curation practices relate to a wider and more diverse repertoire of news sources online. Personal news curation practices can be conceptualized as forms of news engagement that have the potential to complement or counteract algorithmic news selection or partisan selective exposure, yet, these practices can also solidify existing divides in news use related to interest and avoidance.",

    "title": "Paying Attention to Attention: A Conceptual Framework for Studying News Reader Revenue Models Related to Platforms",
    "abstract": "Abstract Digital journalism has become entwined with the platform ecosystem as news companies distribute their news through platforms to gain audience attention and reader revenue. To understand where, how, and by whom individual user interaction is collected, measured and monetised, the concept of attention is critical. However, attention is a scarce and fluid commodity. It shifts between platforms and news sites, and is affected by new technologies and algorithmic changes. All this makes extracting monetary value from platform attention challenging. This article explores attention as a core concept to study digital journalism revenue models which are dependent on harvesting user attention on platforms. Three aspects of attention are considered as a part of the conceptual framing offered: attention as a scarce and fluid commodity; attention as a unit for measurement; attention as a source of monetisation. This framework is especially useful for understanding evolving attention patterns for news; news content monetisation opportunities, shifts in power balances between platforms and news companies, and associated risks with platform news distribution.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the “fake news” problem in China where the media environment is tightly controlled. Focusing on online rumors that are not politically sensitive, this article seeks to shed light on a commercialized dimension of China’s online media landscape in addition to a highly politicalized one that previous research has emphasized. Based on an intermedia agenda-setting analysis of the top ten rumors circulated on China’s Internet in 2016, this study demonstrates that although the government-controlled news websites challenged the rumors to a great extent, they also contributed to the perpetration of misinformation. Even the national official media advanced some rumors themselves and induced other media outlets to do so.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between journalism and social marginalization is a relatively understudied area in digital journalism studies. Our case study of Dalit Camera (DC), an online news archive and chronicle based in India, examines how historically disadvantaged Dalits, or “Untouchables,” are leveraging digital tools to narrate their oppressive past to the outside world parallel to the rise of political censorship in India. As part of its archiving process, DC is preserving footage of Dalit resistance against hegemonic domination by caste Hindus. Through their grassroots network of citizen journalists, DC is also engaged in reporting caste-based discrimination and violence today, contributing to the Dalit social movement for equality and justice. Our study provides the first examination of Dalit social protest as a function of digital news archiving, in the process bringing a non-Western subject typically reserved for Subaltern Studies to digital journalism studies as a potent example of citizen journalism and participatory online culture in a censorious media climate. We argue that the growing field of digital journalism studies must leverage productively with area studies scholarship, such as Subaltern Studies, in order to advance a deeper understanding of journalism cultures in the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Social network sites are becoming essential to how people experience news. The social media feed is made up of a mixture of private and public postings, and news is intertwined with all sorts of activities. What people are exposed to partly depends on the behaviour of their fellow networkers. Drawing on theories of opinion leaders and the concept of incidental news consumption, this article examines news-gathering on social media using a combination of representative survey data and qualitative interviews with young people aged 16–19. Regression analysis of the survey data reveals the primary factor explaining use of news on social media is the habit of using online news services. Interest in news and age also contribute to this phenomenon. The qualitative study reveals that interviewees’ news consumption through social networks is frequent. While incidental, they nonetheless seem to count on being informed through this medium. There is a widespread presence of opinion leaders in the respondents’ social media feeds, bringing attention to news they otherwise would have missed, and just as important, delivering interpretation and context. The study also indicates that these opinion leaders are perceived as central or even crucial to the news-gathering process.",

    "title": "Mapping the field of Algorithmic Journalism",
    "abstract": "With software automatically producing texts in natural language from structured data, the evolution of natural language generation (NLG) is changing traditional news production. The paper first addresses the question whether NLG is able to perform the functions of professional journalism on a technical level. A technological potential analysis therefore uncovers the technological limitations and possibilities of NLG, accompanied by an institutional classification following Weischenberg, Malik, and Scholl. Overall, NLG is explained within the framework of algorithmic selection and along its technological functionality. The second part of the paper focuses on the economic potential of NLG in journalism as well as indicating its institutionalization on an organizational level. Thirteen semi-structured interviews with representatives of the most relevant service providers detail the current market situation. Following Heuss, the development of the NLG market is classified into phases. In summary, although the market for NLG in journalism is still at an early stage of market expansion, with only a few providers and journalistic products available, NLG is able to perform tasks of professional journalism at a technical level. The analysis therefore sets the basis to analyze upcoming challenges for journalism research at the intersection of technology and big data.",

    "title": "News Avoidance during the Covid-19 Crisis: Understanding Information Overload",
    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the degree of news avoidance during the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Based on two panel surveys conducted in the period April–June 2020, this study shows that the increased presence of this behavior, can be explained by negative emotions and feelings the news causes by citizens. Moreover, news avoidance indeed has a positive effect on perceived well-being. These findings point to an acting balance for individual news consumers. In a pandemic such as Covid-19 news consumers need to be informed, but avoiding news is sometimes necessary to stay mentally healthy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the face of increasing public distrust for journalistic institutions, stories sourced from artificially intelligent (AI) journalists have the potential to lower hostile media bias by activating the machine heuristic—a mental shortcut assuming machines are more unbiased, systematic, and accurate than are humans. An online experiment targeting issue partisans found support for the prediction: a story presented as sourced from an AI journalist activated the machine heuristic that, in turn, mitigated hostile media bias. This mediation effect was moderated: perceived bias was more strongly reduced as partisan-attitude extremity increased.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rising numbers of online attacks against journalists have been documented globally. Female, minority reporters and journalists who cover issues interwoven with right-wing identity anchors have been primary targets. This trend reflects growing forms of mob censorship linked to the demonization of journalists and the press by populist leaders. Based on recent cases in the United States, I define mob censorship as bottom-up, citizen vigilantism aimed at disciplining journalism. Effective responses are hard to come by given the pervasiveness of digital hate speech and the limitations of traditional approaches to the problems it represents for democratic communication.",
