    "abstract": "Technology has culturally localized meanings. In other words, technology stands out in people's modes of living and particular social sensibilities grounding the local history and social structure. In Korean society, technology is manifested as an image of humanity, happiness, and even romance, so that one's happiness and success in a lifetime are compatible with their levels of technological progress. I define this particular local tendency in Korea as “Confucian technological culture.” Specifically, I examine a phase of Korea's technological culture applying semiotic analysis to Korean mobile phone advertisements.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study develops upon recent scholarship about subversive design that emerged in response to hegemonic structures such as capitalism, by introducing how racial identity informs disruptive design practices. Based upon a two-year ethnography with nine black artists during a period of racial unrest, this study presents how their experiences as black Americans informed distinctive, critical design dispositions. The participants’ deeply personal and labor-intensive design processes were both technical and political processes that involved intense prototyping, research and self-reflection. Their designs resulted in oppositional films, photography exhibits and paintings that contested racial metonymy through visceral and visual discourses that present black identities and histories within a more complex racial language. The participants also designed empathic spaces where oppositional discourses could take root and that supported communal healing, mourning and celebration. The ethnographic accounts of this study offer a meaningful way to engage and bridge scholarship about race, design and oppositional art.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Why Be Critical?",
    "abstract": "Almost 60 years ago, Lasswell (1949) asked, ‘‘Why be quantitative?’’ and vigorously argued that ‘‘the study of politics can be advanced by the quantitative analysis of political discourse . [b]ecause of the scientific and policy gains that can come of it’’ (pp. 40, 52). He suggested that severe ‘‘limitations of qualitative analysis,’’ such as imprecision and arbitrariness, could be overcome by quantification. A decade later, Lazarsfeld (1957, p. 41) pleaded for a more balanced view, suggesting that empirical research cannot only provide ‘‘sharper conceptual tools’’ that would bring to light ‘‘new implications of all sorts’’ (usually championed by representatives of the empirical paradigm; Noelle-Neumann, 1979, p. 144) but also that ‘‘the very act of inspecting this classical material brings to our attention ideas which might otherwise have been overlooked’’ in the process of empirical research. He concluded that ‘‘[t]heorizing itself can make progress, and the logic of empirical research can contribute to it.’’ Ironically, perhaps, I would offer a similar answer to ‘‘why be critical’’: because critical theory and research can provide higher scientific and policy gains than ‘‘conventional research’’ to use Halloran’s term. The role of critical theory cannot be reduced to that of describing and explaining empirical reality, and it has to question existing conditions in terms of their historical preconditions and future possibilities. It cannot live with what is or was empirically existing, prevalent or ‘‘normal,’’ or ‘‘anomalous’’ in a given period of time and historical context; it has to permanently broaden the horizons of what is relevant today and possible in the future, identify the seeds of what may stimulate social transformation, and trace its directions. Similar to Gramsci’s idea of ‘‘integral journalism,’’ critical research (including theory) should be considered ‘‘integral research’’ in the sense that it seeks not only to satisfy some given (existing) needs but also to create and develop those needs, to progressively enlarge the population of its users, and to raise civic consciousness. It is inseparably connected to politics (and thus, often both opposed to and by politics) because it is focused on contradictions and conflicts in contemporary societies, which are often rooted in the alienating conditions of individuals and social groups. Such an integral form of critical communication research is emancipatory because it strives to explain how the historical processes of alienation and subordination are reproduced (in constantly changing patterns); more specifically, how they penetrate",

I advance this argument by historicizing Guy Debord’s notion of the Spectacle via Autonomist Marxism and Voloshinov’s materialist semiotics. Shedding light on the tensions inhabiting the post-Fordist labor process its users are involved in—such as autonomy/heteronomy, sociability/alienation, and display/concealment—I show how Snapchat points to a Spectacle that consistently operates through a dialectic of socialization, which enables and compels, consorts and estranges, and deceives and exhibits.</jats:p>",

This article extends intensified scholarly interest in game spectatorship, offering a materialist consideration of the embodied work involved in spectating competitive game play. Most readily associated with the discursive alignments between competitive gaming and/as sport, the active camera mode used by esports competitors and “shoutcasters” facilitates analyzing the highly kinetic action of team-based combat in first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arenas. Here, we draw from microanalyses of audio-visual recordings taken as individual participants spectated a Dota 2 match. Examining the cognitive and perceptual competencies they draw from, we argue that participants are incorporated into apparatuses of perception associated with militarized optical media. While at a discursive level esports spectators may be watching sports, at a material level they are playing with the logics of drones.</jats:p>",

PISSED/Fountain offer audiences a new strategy for both exposing and contesting state violence: these pieces can be read as a politically strategic disidentification with the state's classification of certain bodies and their excretions as ``deviant'' and ``toxic'' in order to purposefully ``terrorize'' the state's bio- and necropolitical aims.</jats:p>",

These examples demonstrate how foiling one’s adversary relies on the power of naming; applies tremendous pressure to the target through identification and invocation of vulnerabilities; and employs tone and verbal aggression in what Burke identified as ‘‘the kill’’: the definition of self through the symbolic purgation and/or negation of another.",

The specificity of “shadow politics” emerges from ongoing transformations that are deeply interwoven with the digital, first with the data driven confidence around the “total certainty” of tracking and calibrating voter sentiments, and second, with the ideology of digital participation and related claims that data machines are merely tapping into people’s sovereign expressions online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the 19th century, Shakespeare references have recurred with surprising consistency in experimental forms of media. This article considers the role of references to and adaptations of Shakespeare texts when a media form takes on a new valence for a set of users in a particular time and place. We consider two different moments at length: a commercial interactive game from 1984 that made novel use of cassettes and sound, and the production and reception of early Twitter adaptations of Shakespeare in 2010. By standing in for the aesthetic possibilities and limits of a changing media space, Shakespearean references and deviations from them serve a key role for artists and critics in debates over the legitimacy and significance of creative work in emergent media. Thus, cultural producers, critics and audiences thus use these sometimes-awkward appearances of Shakespeare as a means of describing their aesthetic potentials and limits.</jats:p>",

Building on masculinity studies and branding discourses, I explore representations of Tide’s dads as part of a wave of “dadvertising,” or advertising that uses fathers to represent ideal masculinity centered on involved parenting and emotional vulnerability. The advertisements in my case study show a spectrum of performance, from dads who justify their domestic labor with appeals to hegemonic masculinity to dads who seem at ease in historically feminized roles. All of these examples reveal dadvertising’s root in neoliberal gender politics and commodity activism, wherein evolving masculinities are personalized and commoditized into consumerist actions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, a number of fashion and beauty brands have developed promotional content that circulates an aspirational quality imbued with unstudied “cool” around their product. Despite the appeal of this conceit to tropes of the everyday, authenticity, and belonging, it presents a superficially relatable ideal whilst exploiting digital media’s capacities to foster intimacy and promote a postfeminist subjectivity based on consumption.</jats:p><jats:p>This article examines three brands that circulate “aspirational realness” around their product: Glossier, Reformation, and Maryam Nassir Zadeh. All remediate the conventions of prior fashion media to communicate discourses of neoliberal femininity to a media-savvy consumer. Aspirational realness is thus read as a means by which consumption is both encouraged and situated as a means of self-realization in the likeness of other aspirational “cool girls.”</jats:p>",

This article explores the digital circulation of these affects and considers how the outpouring of tweets about sexual harassment and abuse contribute to a feminist politics centered on collective healing. The particular emotions expressed in the #MeToo Twitter archive subvert the logics of quantification and visibility that undergird popular feminism and the attention economy, and produce an affective excess that works toward movement founder Tarana Burke's original project of “mass healing.” At a moment wherein popular feminism emphasizes individual empowerment and consumption, and carceral feminism relies on criminalization and incarceration, the #MeToo movement's focus on shared emotions represents the potential for a feminist politics rooted in collective support and restorative justice.</jats:p>",

The article examines a group called EuropeanUnity565 (EU565) which maintained several social media accounts, most prominently a YouTube channel, to distribute white nationalist video content which they subtitled in English and other European languages. Intended to foster racial harmony across ethno-linguistic lines in order to resist perceived racial imperilment—a sentiment captured in their motto, “We act as one lest we perish alone”—EU565’s activism fits into a larger tradition of urging the importance of racial community and belonging. The article thus also situates EU565 within a broader tradition of white nationalist activism called metapolitics. The potential for this networked activism, of which EU565 is only a part, to reach larger publics makes research in this area important, a task to which this case study contributes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This study examines news coverage of violence against Muslim women in English-language newspapers in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait. Using discourse analysis, it asks whether coverage reflects traditional Islamic or Islamic feminist perspectives. The findings indicate the news overwhelmingly reflected traditional Islamic beliefs concerning the secondary status of Muslim women. Coverage minimized the violence, blamed victims, omitted women's voices, and treated sympathetically men who committed honor crimes. However, an Islamic feminist perspective was evident in some content that challenged women's segregation in Saudi Arabia. This study concludes that this news coverage shares many of the same characteristics of news reporting of violence against women in the West by ignoring its systemic nature and relation to male supremacy and patriarchal ideology.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In public discourse, there has been hostile communication between Asian and Black communities in the US. This article proposes co-racialization as a lens in examining Asian and Black Americans’ relationality. Co-racialization occurs in and across space and time, in that individuals and groups with various and uneven resources shape their views of themselves and their counterparts. Seventy-two Asian Americans and Black Americans were interviewed. Through the concepts of “racial project” and “hydraulic and nanoracism,” I trace the ways in which these co-racializations are mediated. Themes of their “home and neighborhood as space of mediation;” “segregated learning institutions with hydraulic racism mediated by pop culture;” and “perpetual tensions and nanoracism in the ‘fuzzy zones’” emerged. This article calls for nanohealing—an intentionally sustained relationality-building rooted in on-the-ground spaces of interactions and mediation—as an imperative part of co-racialization to resist the thin relationality between racial minorities.</jats:p>",

Using a content analysis of their videos and textual analysis of fan comments and social media engagement, I argue that RDCWorld’s performance as Black nerds subverts traditional notions of identity, play, and space by resisting notions of the stereotypical cool Black aesthetic, integrating transnational media with Blackness to create new modes of self-representation, challenging hegemonic constructions of public play, and by normalizing spaces of free Black expression through their anime and gaming convention, DreamCon.</jats:p>",

To date, however, we know too little about the ways in which populist discourse is constructed by citizens on social media.

The results indicate that Facebook offers a discursive opportunity structure for Dutch citizens to vent their populist discontent and to interact with like-minded others. Online populist discourse on Facebook is hostile and uncivil, predominately targeted at the elites and marginalized groups in society. By providing insights into how ordinary citizens construct the boundary between “us” and “them,” this article enhances our understanding of the construction of citizens’ populist discourse on social network sites (SNSs), and how these expressions contradict the principles of democratic communication.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Reopening the Postwar Settlement for U.S. Media: The Origins and Implications of the Social Contract Between Media, the State, and the Polity",
    "abstract": "Drawing from archival research, I historicize current media policies and reform efforts by analyzing the 1940s critical juncture when policymakers, social movements, and communication industries grappled over commercial media's role in a democratic society. By focusing on policy formations around the Hutchins Commission and the FCC's “Blue Book,” I propose that a suppressed media reform movement resulted in a “postwar settlement” marked by three assumptions: media should remain self-regulated, practice social responsibility, and be protected by a negative freedom of the press. This social contract consolidated an industry-friendly arrangement that contained reform movements, foreclosed on alternative models, discouraged structural critiques of the U.S. media system, and privileged media owners' rights over those of the public's—a relationship that continues today. \n \n \n \nRevisitando el Arreglo de Posguerra de los Medios de los Estados Unidos: Los Origenes y las Implicancias del Contrato Social entre los Medios, el Estado, y la Politica \n \n \n \nVictor Pickard \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nBasado en una investigacion de archivos, investigo historicamente las politicas corrientes de los medios y los esfuerzos de reformas mediante un analisis de la coyuntura critica de 1940 cuando los creadores de las politicas, los movimientos sociales, y las industrias de la comunicacion lidiaron sobre el rol de los comerciales en los medios en una sociedad democratica. Mediante la focalizacion en las formaciones de las politicas alrededor de la Comision Hutchins y el libro azul del FCC, ’’ propongo que un movimiento de reforma de los medios suprimidos resultante del “arreglo de posguerra’’ esta marcado por tres asunciones: los medios deben permanecer auto-regulados, practicar la responsabilidad social, y ser protegidos de la libertad negativa de la prensa. Este contrato social consolida un arreglo de la industria amistoso que contiene los movimientos de reforma, la quiebra de los modelos alternativos, desestimula la critica estructural al sistema de los medios de los EE.UU. y privilegia los derechos de los duenos de los medios sobre los del publico—una relacion que continua hoy. \n \n \n \nRevisiter le reglement d’apres-guerre des medias americains : les origines et les consequences du contrat social entre les medias, l’Etat et la politique \n \n \n \nVictor Pickard \n \n \n \nA partir d’une recherche d’archives, j’historicise les politiques mediatiques et les efforts de reformes d’aujourd’hui grâce a une analyse du moment critique des annees 1940 ou decideurs, mouvements sociaux et industries de la communication luttaient autour du role des medias commerciaux dans une societe democratique. En me concentrant sur l’elaboration des politiques autour de la Commission Hutchins et du « Livre bleu » de la Commission federale americaine des communications (FCC), je propose qu’un mouvement reprime de reforme mediatique a conduit a une « entente d’apres-guerre » caracterisee par trois postulats voulant que les medias devraient s’auto-reguler, etre socialement responsables et etre proteges par une liberte negative de la presse. Ce contrat social a consolide un arrangement favorable a l’industrie qui a reprime les mouvements de reforme, evite les modeles alternatifs, decourage les critiques structurelles du systeme mediatique americain et privilegie les droits des proprietaires contre ceux du public : une relation qui se poursuit aujourd’hui. \n \n \n \nNeue Betrachtungen zum Nachkriegsabkommen der US-Medien: Ursprunge und Implikationen des Gesellschaftsvertrages zwischen Medien, Staat und Gemeinwesen \n \n \n \nVictor Pickard \n \n \n \nBasierend auf einer Quellenanalyse stelle ich aktuelle Medienpolitik und Reformbestrebungen in einen historischen Kontext, indem ich den kritischen Punkt der 1940er Jahre analysiere, als sich politische Entscheidungstrager, soziale Bewegungen und die Kommunikationsindustrie uber die Rolle der kommerziellen Medien in einer demokratischen Gesellschaft auseinandersetzten. Ich befasse mich mit der Politikgestaltung der Hutchins Kommission und dem ,,Blue Book“ der Federal Communication Commission (FCC) und schlage vor, dass eine unterdruckte Medienreformbewegung in einem ,,Nachkriegsabkommen“ gekennzeichnet durch drei Annahmen resultierte: Medien sollten selbstreguliert bleiben, sollten soziale Verantwortung praktizieren und sollten durch eine negativen Freiheit der Presse geschutzt werden. Dieser Gesellschaftsvertrag konsolidierte ein industriefreundliches Arrangement, das Reformbewegungen beinhaltete, alternative Modelle ausschloss, die strukturelle Kritik des US-Mediensystems abschreckte und die Rechte privilegierter Medienbesitzer uber die der Offentlichkeit stellte – eine Beziehung, die bis heute fortgefuhrt wird.",

This analysis illuminates Morris-Cafiero’s work of transgressive feminist art, using the body as a means for subverting the gaze of online misogyny and fat-shaming and presenting it anew. Morris-Cafiero uses self-portraiture to remark on the subject of online harassment as both the recipient and the sender. Bringing gendered histories of monstrosity into conversation with contemporary gendered online harassment, this article argues that the work of The Bully Pulpit exemplifies a new conception of polysemous monstrosity through which to understand the presentation of self, both for the artist and her trolls.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Premiering on Saturday nights in summer of 2018, the barely-promoted Random Acts of Flyness (RAOF) was buried in HBO’s schedule. The highly experimental series combines many forms, including late night talk show, documentary, claymation, and sketch show, amongst many others. With stylistic techniques such as Afrosurrealism and self-reflexivity alongside discursive tools that heighten the series’ claim to “quality,” I argue that RAOF utilizes its surreal and distinctly black creative production to critically examine representations of blackness and whiteness in the media and American culture. I further contend that, for HBO, independent filmmaker and series creator Terence Nance’s pedigree fits the channel’s long-standing association with “higher” art forms, even as the series does not fit into historically white and affluent notions of “quality.” As the television landscape becomes broader and markers of “quality” become harder to pin down, the series’ incisive look at blackness proves to be an exceptional case study.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Since the dawn of the millennium, public debate on multiculturalism has intensiﬁed in Europe. Many countries known for their multicultural and tolerant attitudes, began to tighten their immigration and integration policies. The purpose of this article is to analyze European multicultural discourses by focusing on critical evaluation of the Prix Europa Iris, the yearly awards competition that celebrates multicultural television programming in Europe. Although submissions are also received from independent ﬁlmmakers and commercial television, public broadcasting corporations play key roles in the Prix Europa organization and its deﬁnition of the event. I examine how jury reports, speeches, and other material in the Prix Europa Iris website deﬁne and signify multiculturalism and antiracism. These texts inﬂuence multicultural media policy throughout Europe. The study demonstrates that the role of the media in creating mutual understanding among cultures and in unifying European identity has been emphasized by this event. The position taken in the Prix Europa Iris overlooks structural aspects of racism and power relations in society. There has been a discursive shift in the 21st century from recognition of racism and marginalized position of ethnic minorities and immigrants to a focus on individual integration.",

    "abstract": "Scholars writing about communication and information have increasingly turned their attention to the changing nature of work and of worker organizations. This is a welcome development as there are important issues to address and because it provides some balance to the emphasis that has traditionally been placed on content, including the companies that produce it and the audiences that consume it. These two books provide valuable contributions in two specific areas: the history of information labour and the ways contemporary workers are using communication and information technology to improve their position in the workplace. Labour that is based on the use of communication and information, or what is increasingly called knowledge labour, has captured the attention of writers for quite some time. In the West, Henri comte de St. Simon (1952) established a tradition of serious reflection in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries by arguing for a shift in power to the technology-based thinking professions. His work influenced Karl Marx (1974) whose idea of the “general intellect” foreshadowed talk of an information society, and on Charles Babbage (1961) whose “difference engine” and the “attendants” who worked it would literally power this transformation. It was not until the end of World War II that a critical mass of scholars focused their interest on the increasing growth in communication, information, and service occupations. These included Jean Fourastié (1954), Fritz Machlup (1962), and Marc Uri Porat (1977) who produced important statistical analyses of the changing occupational structure and their work led to theoretical and critical",

I also historicize zines’ proliferation through punk, do-it-yourself (DIY), and White, feminist communities. Using critical discourse analysis as my analytical approach, I illustrate the interpellation of capitalist ideology in online questionnaires completed by 11 queer, White, feminist zinesters from Chicago. By harnessing a DIY production model, respondents said they resisted mass-mediated expectations of normative sexuality and gender identity, but zinesters also reflect and reify the systems they attempt to transcend.</jats:p>",

Drawing from a discursive archive comprising cultural artifacts, the movement’s policy statements, and augmented by interviews, this Foucault-inspired study reveals how “propaganda of protest” became a “pillar” of the Solidarity movement’s campaigning. This study analyzes propaganda strategies and tactics for mobilization and political engagement among Poles, and how campaigning aided power shifts between the movement and the authorities. Contextualizing this analysis in the Sovietized settings, this study shows that propaganda was inherent to Solidarity’s transgressive and subversive campaigning in multiple areas of the movement’s agency: mobilization and support building, construction of collective identities, coalition-building, issues management and policymaking, and implementation. Finally, I argue, that the qualities of Solidarity’s propaganda were culturally-grounded, based on the self-presentation strategies as well as the zeitgeist belief in engagement of workers’ with trade unionism rather than policies of the state socialist regime.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article turns a critical eye on the arguments deployed by Pitchfork, one of the most popular music websites, when reviewing two artists: Vampire Weekend and Lil Wayne. Rhetorically analyzing the reception of these two artists is illuminating because both had indie breakouts in 2008, both release genre-spanning music, and both have had over a decade of commercial success. However, Vampire Weekend’s whiteness enables them to benefit from authenticity tropes that are unavailable to Lil Wayne. The analysis will show how Lil Wayne is essentialized as a rapper who is unauthorized to move beyond that genre. Overall, this article examines authenticity as the rhetorical move by which exclusion is constructed and highlights how assumptions about the relationship between race and performance are key to arguments about artistry.</jats:p>",

My discussion sheds light on its multilayered queer-transnational characteristics, as well as the controversies surrounding its transcultural mediation of queer women. Rather than simplifying it as an anti-heterocentric Chinese convergence culture in an age of globalization and digitization, I highlight GL webtoons’ role in stimulating various voices concerning women during transnational encounters of gender and sexual knowledge.</jats:p>",

Some nationalist netizens are dedicated to accusing Squid Game of plagiarism or dismissing it as a “cultural invasion.” Another group of fans, due to the ever-tightening Chinese Internet governance, use fandom nationalism as a disguise to protect themselves against cyberbullying by declaring an anti-Korean political stance before posting positive comments about Squid Game. Therefore, two such divergent attitudes eventually led to a negotiation between fan culture and state power, where on the one hand fandom nationalistic practices were accepted by the mainstream for party-state propaganda, but on the other, in order to prevent being censored, fan culture had to be subordinated to the state’s governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In June 2015 Gawker Media became the first for-profit digital news organization to unionize its editorial workforce. True to their bombastic style, they did so publicly, publishing a post where staff commented on how they were going to vote regarding the union and why. This article examines the ensuing discussion to understand how this group of culture workers perceived their labor, and the value they sought not just from collective bargaining, but from doing so publicly. Gawker’s unionization was aimed not exclusively at Gawker, but spoke to a vision for the entire sector. Gawker staff were motivated to collective action by the precarity that besets digital media, while the publicness of the effort was aimed at their peer organizations. The public performance of unionism at Gawker may signal a shift in the discourse around collective bargaining among young creative workers as more digital outlets come to organize their workforce.</jats:p>",

Digital migration practices emerge as complex negotiations in the digital media sphere between infrastructural bias and agential opportunities, contesting racial practices as well as enabling digitally mediated bonds of solidarity and intimacy. The issue offers nuanced critical perspectives ranging from surveillance capitalism, extractive humanitarianism, datafication, and border regimes to choreographies of care and intimacy in transnational settings, among other aspects. Renowned international scholars reflect on these issues from different vantage points. The closing forum section provides state-of-the-art commentaries on digital diaspora, affect and belonging, voice and visibility in the digital media sphere, queer migrant interventions in non-academic settings, and datafication and media infrastructures in “deep time.”</jats:p>",

Witnessing a growing number of TV representations of masculine girls and women worldwide, we present a summary of the four articles which comprise this themed Forum and address a number of key issues in their case studies, including televisual imaginaries of heterosexual, masculine women, the cultural legitimization of global female masculinities on reality TV, and the racialization and stigmatization of masculine women in White heteronormative societies. The Forum thus promotes a critical dialogue that aims to stimulate further interest in this interdisciplinary field by emphasizing the mutual implications of gendered TV genres and tropes, cross-cultural currents of gender, sexual, and racial knowledge and politics, and the intersectionality of female gender, sexuality, race, and nationality in TV representations.</jats:p>",

Taking fashion media as a case study, I look at trans representation between 2013 and 2020 in the print editions of U.S.-based fashion publications Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, and Women’s Wear Daily. I argue that trans representation in fashion magazines produces competing discourses about trans identity as simultaneously conforming to gender norms and subverting the gender binary. Further, fashion magazines employ a neoliberal logic of visibility and self-empowerment, positioning trans individuals—particularly trans women of color—as exceptional figures and role models. Finally, I find a recent shift towards a social justice framework as trans activists of color are given greater voice in the pages of fashion magazines.</jats:p>",

Google draws on “local” knowledge through its Local Guides platform to add location-based data in the form of reviews and rankings to Google Maps. Through a critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) of the Local Guides platform’s rhetoric and Local Guides’ reviews across varying sites in Toronto, we compare and contrast the ways the platform constructs user-mediated local participation with the actual content the platform produces. We complicate Google’s claims to supporting the local by identifying review practices and patterns that use the platform to target and harass workers. We argue that the reviews reveal who and what belongs to the platform’s construction of “the local,” while at the same time rendering hyper-visible what it constructs as not belonging.</jats:p>",

In addition to being a set of forensic-minded exploratory practices and a spatially-layered arena of play, drillable immersion is also being used as an industry strategy to encourage additional capitalistic consumption and to further entrench symbolic conceptions of awe and wonder into commercialized experiences. By outlining how new media and convergence logics are being extended and mapped onto physical spaces, the article opens up new ways of thinking about the relationships between media industries and fans, adjacent cultural sites of experience, tourism, and broader histories of immersive culture.</jats:p>",

This is surprising given perfume-ad characteristics that incentivize racialized representations, especially ads using celebrities, and racist constructions of smell and scent. Using critical advertising studies, sensory studies, and bell hooks’ concept of the racialized Other, this article argues that perfume ads are markedly racialized. The racial semiotics of 10 print ads—five with BIPOC celebrities and five with White—are critiqued, with BIPOC celebrities essentialized as inherently exotic, wild, and primitively sexual, while White celebrities symbolize elegance, classic beauty, and uniqueness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article examines women’s dissonance and refusal of gender hate on LIHKG, a platform converged with local and Global North manospheres that gained prominence for political communication during Hong Kong’s Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill movement. Despite criticism for its misogyny, LIHKG witnessed women’s participation during the movement. However, women’s agencies are underexplored by its critics and studies on the manosphere. This study argues that acknowledging dissonance within manospheres redirects focus on the targets of gender hate, specifically women, accentuating the possibilities of feminist intervention within gender hate networks. Employing a digital ethnographic approach, this study contributes by: (1) providing a relational and contextualized understanding of the convergence between manospheres beyond the notion of homogenization; (2) redressing the injustice in hate which obliterates the hated bodies; and (3) breaking the unintended repetition of such injustice in the literature on the manosphere, which has paid little attention on the repugnant women’s agencies.</jats:p>",

This study reveals that while viewers employ a shared interpretive strategy of queer reading to identify queer opacity, the effect of queer interpretation is contingent upon the queer interpretive subcommunities’ familiarity with Chinese culture. Moreover, different cultures possess sub-strategies of queer reading: visibility reading is often practiced in the global northwest to initiate visibility politics in society, while opacity reading is used in the global southeast in an unconfrontational manner within fictional worlds. By examining a layered interpretive phenomenon that involves transcultural reaction videos towards the Chinese dan’gai web series The Untamed (TU), alongside the danmu from Chinese viewers on these videos, this study contributes to scholarship on transcultural queerness through the lenses of queer opacity and transcultural reader reception.</jats:p>",

Through semi-structured interviews with 34 full-time rural streamers and two rounds of fieldwork spanning approximately a year in a southwestern Chinese county, this research elucidates three categories of visibility-based uncertainties that prompt streamers’ cognizance of algorithmic surveillance and inform their strategic responses. Participants interpret algorithmic surveillance through the lens of three predominant observers: curation algorithms, human moderators, and the audience. These perceived observers work on coordinating three forms of visibility—algorithmic visibility, moderator visibility, and audience visibility—aimed at regulating the independent streamers’ activities. Contrary to the common belief, we found that heightened online visibility in agricultural product live streams on Taobao Live does not always yield advantageous outcomes.</jats:p>",

But it also ignited an immediate synchronized effort at counter narration that criticized the Queen’s tenure and the institution of the British monarchy. Employing critical discourse and conjunctural analysis, I argue that the Queen’s death was a moment in which the state-driven “media event” was challenged by a grassroots “viral event.” Media events, I argue, deploy nostalgia, which masks history, as their prevailing tool, while the viral event of the counter commentary deploys critical memory, which highlights and parses history, to make its case—the latter upsetting the perceived dominance of the former.</jats:p>",

The analysis is theoretically embedded in the model of the discursive-material knot, which is a non-hierarchical articulation of the discursive and the material, and it is contextualized by a reflection on post-digital culture, which allows revalidating the role of the material in zine production and distribution more. The case study combines the analysis of personal interviews and zine content with an ethnography of the production and distribution processes, including zine fairs. This analysis shows how the alternative media discourse, with its focus on particular aesthetics and amateurism, intersects with networks of bodies, spaces, paper and related objects, many different machines and scarce capitals. This allows arguing that the material is omnipresent in zine production and distribution, also in intermaterial and transmaterial ways, but also that zines then use the particularity of this material component to signify their cultural specificity.</jats:p>",

This process, referred to as the “tropicalization of concepts,” is scrutinized for its consequences, which include the unequal significance of concepts, the naturalization of certain realities, the one-sided flow of ideas, and their solidification in public policies. In response to these challenges, the eight articles included in this special issue contribute valuable insights into innovative approaches for studying, theorizing, and engaging with the unique digital realities of the Global South. These articles shed light on diverse aspects of digital media use in different regions and offer fresh perspectives on how to conceptualize and address the associated issues.</jats:p>",

Rather than an extension of state propaganda, I argue that buzzers are a “twilight institution” straddling the boundaries between state and society. As cybermilitias, they are rooted in the historical conjuncture of Indonesian state practices in deploying privatized violence for extractive capitalist accumulation, exhibited by two cases in this article: the reclamation of Benoa Bay in Bali and the Ciliwung forced evictions in Jakarta. Informed by ethnographic fieldwork, I delve into buzzers’ experience of computational propaganda as an avenue for political agency. They conceive their clandestine labor into a play, conjuring the political metaphor of dalang (master puppeteers) pulling strings from behind the scenes. These shadow play theatrics constitute the ludic aspect of buzzers as ludic cybermilitias. By exploring how computational propaganda is shaped by and shapes state power in Indonesia, I problematize the notion that political buzzers signify “democratic regression” or “digital authoritarianism.” Instead, I propose that buzzers represent the latest manifestation of privatized violence within the predatory logic of post-authoritarian states in the Global South.</jats:p>",

    "title": "(Re-)Inventing<i>Home Affairs</i>: Feminist Solidarity and the South African Nation",
    "abstract": "The South African-produced television show, Home Affairs, foregrounds the challenge of creating a united and homogenous notion of nation. The heterogeneous images of 9 female protagonists set within the discourse of nation-building draws attention to issues of equality and empowerment. However, these representations also expose ruptures within feminism, and the project of nationalism as feminist sensibility is often criticized as a betrayal of the nation. Locating these tensions within feminist and historical contexts, I argue Home Affairs allegorically represents the rebirth or rebuilding of the nation. However, although Home Affairs can be read as representative of the nation that valorizes middle-class values, it simultaneously demonstrates the competing interests of national solidarity and free-market forces that perpetuate socioeconomic and educational segregation. \n \n \n \nLa (re)invention de Home Affairs : Solidarite feministe et la nation sud-africaine \n \n \n \nLa serie televisee sud-africaine Home Affairs met en relief le defi que constitue la creation d'une idee de nation unie et homogene. Les images heterogenes de neuf personnages feminins, campees dans le discours de construction de la nation, attirent l'attention sur les questions d'egalite et d'autonomie. Toutefois, ces representations exposent aussi des ruptures au sein meme du feminisme. On reproche au projet nationaliste entendu comme sensibilite feministe de trahir la nation. Situant ces tensions dans leur contexte feministe et historique, je soutiens que Home Affairs represente une allegorie de la renaissance ou de la reconstruction de la nation. Cependant, bien que Home Affairs puisse etre vue comme representante de la nation qui valorise les valeurs de la classe moyenne, la serie demontre aussi les interets rivaux des forces de solidarite nationale et du libre-marche, qui perpetuent la segregation socioeconomique et educative. \n \n \n \nErfindung und Wiederentdeckung von Home Affairs: Feministische Solidaritat und die sudafrikanische Nation \n \n \n \nShelley-Jean Bradfield \n \n \n \nDie sudafrikanische Fernsehsendung Home Affairs (Heimatangelegenheiten) betont die Herausforderung, eine geeinte und homogene Vorstellung von Nation zu schaffen. Die heterogene Darstellung von neun Protagonistinnen, die in diesem Diskurs der Nationenbildung angelegt ist, lenkt die Aufmerksamkeit auf Themen wie Gleichheit und Empowerment, welche innerhalb der feministischen Praxis und Theorie elementar sind. Allerdings zeigen diese unterschiedlichen Reprasentationen auch Bruchstellen innerhalb und zwischen Feminismus und dem Projekt des Nationalismus auf, da eine feministische Sensibilitat oft als Verrat der Nation kritisiert wird. Indem ich die Spannungen innerhalb der feministischen Diskussion und dem historischen Kontext von Sudafrika herausarbeite, argumentiere ich, dass Home Affairs als Allegorie fungiert, um die Wiedergeburt oder Wiederherstellung einer Nation zu reprasentieren. Auch wenn das Projekt Home Affairs als Reprasentant einer Nation, die die Werte der Mittelschicht aufwertet, gelesen werden kann, zeigt es gleichzeitig die konkurrierenden Interessen von nationaler Solidaritat und den Kraften des freien Marktes, welche okonomische, bildungsbezogene und soziale Segregation aufrechterhalten. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Re-)Inventando Los Asuntos de la Casa : La Solidaridad Feminista y la Nacion de Sudafrica \n \n \n \nShelley-Jean Bradfield Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47401, USA \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEl programa de television “Los Asuntos de la Casa” producido en Sudafrica, pone en primer plano el desafio de crear una nocion unitaria y homogenea de la nacion. La heterogeneidad de las imagenes de 9 protagonistas femeninos colocados dentro del discurso para armar la nacion, llama la atencion sobre los asuntos de igualdad y el fortalecimiento del poder. No obstante, estas representaciones exponen tambien las rupturas entre el feminismo, y el proyecto de nacionalismo como una sensibilidad feminista a menudo criticada como una traicion a la nacion. Localizando estas tensiones dentro de los contextos feministas e historicos, sostengo que “Los Asuntos de la Casa” representan alegoricamente el renacimiento o reconstruccion de la nacion. No obstante, aunque “Los Asuntos de la Casa” pueden ser leidos como una representacion que valoriza los valores de la clase media, simultaneamente demuestran los intereses competitivos de la solidaridad nacional y las fuerzas del mercado libre que perpetuan la segregacion socioeconomica y educacional.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article uses a discussion of the currency of the word “wog” in Britain to identify a pivotal, racialized position used to contain alien incomers so as to exclude them from belonging to the national community. The argument invites readers to focus on the affective energy specifically endowed in contemporary European “populist” politics by race-talk and the anti-Muslim rhetoric which share common roots in absolutist conceptions of culture and “ethnicity.” It is suggested that those developments have conditioned the digital and virtual politics of contemporary racism. They connect with the deployment of machine learning and the growing application of Artificial Intelligence to build trans-national networks among White supremacists and ultranationalists in order to promote their allyship and coordinate their activities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In February 2007, U.S. media outlets covered the coming out of retired NBA player John Amaechi, one of only 6 professional male athletes from the four major U.S. team sports to have announced that he is gay. This study analyzes newspaper columns by prominent U.S. sportswriters about Amaechi's announcement. Textual analysis found that although the columns could be read as progressive, they were not; they condemned individuals who expressed overtly homophobic views while reinforcing the status quo in a variety of ways. The neo-homophobic discourse can be compared with that of new racism, a strategy that maintain racial hegemony in the U.S. As such, these columns effectively rendered Amaechi's announcement as having little value in addressing homophobia in the sports/media complex.",

    "title": "Marcha das Vadias: performing disidentification in transnational protests",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In 2011, protests against rape culture ignited across the globe. Inspired by SlutWalk Toronto (SWT), organizers planned protests that adapted the rhetorical features of SlutWalk to their local contexts. This article examines the visual rhetoric of Marcha das Vadias (MDV), a series of satellite protests in Brazil. I argue that protestors enacted disidentification as a response to the constitutive rhetoric of SlutWalk, bringing into focus how ideologies of race, class, and religion interact with norms of sex and gender to reinforce rape logic. The translation of “slut” to “vadias” centered the linguistic and cultural contexts of contemporary Brazil while maintaining solidarity with the broader SlutWalk movement. Protestors deploy seven rhetorical personae that resituate the constitutive narrative of the movement. Altogether, their performances of personae enact a rhetoric of survivance, which utilizes collectivity, structural critique, non-linear temporality, and storytelling to resist systems of oppression.</jats:p>",

The study entailed content analysis of five Turkish newspapers. A keyword search of the words Syrian (Suriyeli) and refugee (mülteci) were entered into the archives of these newspapers.

The results display the significance of Cultural Fusion Theory principles and challenges that exist to achieve effective cultural fusion.</jats:p>",

For many, Anti-Phandom provides an online space where personal concerns about female Asian beauty standards can be negotiated through Michelle Phan. Within these conversations, I argue Anti-Phans display forms of resistance to Phan's postfeminist forms of female empowerment on racial and ethnic terms. However, these counters to Phan's notions of beauty also produce a rubric of the beautiful Asian woman which renders difference as ugly, creating idealized definitions of racial beauty and Asian/American cultures based on essentialized categories that police diasporic women.</jats:p>",

How do you enable such a scholar to traverse boundaries national and disciplinary with the selfassurance that ostensibly comes from feeling at home? Briefly discussing the history of the institutionalization of Communication as an academic discipline, I ask what it means to mentor scholars of color engaged with transnational work within a space that centers the nation-state as a bounded territory, in general and the U.S. in particular. Drawing on transnational and women of color feminist theorization and praxis, I also draw out the productive collaborations and relationships forged when mentoring reveals the processes through which the discipline reiterates its boundaries.</jats:p>",

As the figure of the “maid” changes in contemporary popular culture, how do more elite, middle-class employers understand domestic workers in the “new India?” This article draws on inter-textual discussions on social media platforms such as Quora and Twitter where most discussants are urban, class and caste privileged, and display Hindu nationalist identities. It examines representation of recent conflicts at large condominium complexes to argue that new infrastructure projects become a crucial terrain on which class, caste and religion-based struggles are mapped, Second, it focuses on popular narratives of “entrepreneurship” for domestic workers and argues that these narratives worsen structural inequities. Finally, it studies new technology as a means of creating inclusion for domestic workers that serve to further mark them by class, caste and other marginalized identities.</jats:p>",

This multiple address highlights how the lauded qualities of cult texts are standard in feminine narratives that need to appeal to a large cross section of women. Cult discourse still depends on misogyny and masculinized distinction even when the mainstream mode seems to break down gendered fandom. Contradictions emerge because cult was traditionally defined against the mindless consuming of women. However, the cultish consumption patterns for FSOG are deliberately fostered by merchandising strategies. Thus, the same element that shows cult tendencies is used to denigrate the film as the antithesis of cult: women as consumers.</jats:p>",

The five-episode web drama, which claims to be “inspired” by Korean television, positions a diasporic story of multiracial, inter-diasporic love between a Zambian Australian woman and a Korean Australian man. Despite its short length, the web drama’s counter-representational choices weave together global media flows and diasporic interpretations of race and family in multicultural Australia. I argue that the show’s explicit counter-representational centering of a Black woman and an Asian man subverts gendered racialization, and its assertion of diasporic communities as commonplace disrupts ideas of Australia as White and Anglophone. However, its representation of immigrant family conflict displaces racism onto the immigrant mother that stands in contrast to Australia as a multicultural nation that is progressive in its acceptance of difference.</jats:p>",

Using disability and these painting “remediations” as methods, I argue that digital interfaces function by sensorially training users to smoothly integrate as part of their operation. Disability is merely a word for the failure of a medium to properly interpellate a subject into the orientation necessary to facilitate its smooth functionality. Instead of suggesting accommodating upgrades to Zoom, I refuse the ableist demands of increased productivity that Zoom turns into requirements, and that require Zoom in order to register as norms. Using Zoom as a case study, my goal is to push back against the expectation that bodies passively adapt to the roll-out of technical systems, and the norms they operationalize.</jats:p>",

In this article, we draw on interviews we conducted with journalists and writers of color who produce newsletters to better understand the opportunities and limitations of contemporary newsletter platforms. We find that studying the experiences of journalists of color reveals a nuanced and somewhat ambivalent picture of the journalism industry and people of color’s place within it. We find that the Substack models favors the status quo, a reality that further entrenches the success of White journalists. Yet writers of color value the safety enabled by sending writing directly to a small, defined, private audience, a contrast with social media logics and their compulsory visibility.</jats:p>",

Applying Brian Massumi's understanding of affect as intensity, I examine how the site's rhetoric amplifies affect. The memorial pools and many signifiers of destruction magnify affective intensity through scale and repetition. The 9/11 MM continues its affective onslaught through an excessive number of shocking visuals and narrative details in its historical exhibition. The site’s affective intensity culminates in a non-linear and non-narrative memorial space of seemingly infinite individualized mourning. The article discusses the site's political and social impact by considering Nigel Thrift's idea of affect in the built environment as imbedded thought and Georg Böhme's theory of atmosphere, understood as the reciprocal relationship between affective urban space and its impact on people.</jats:p>",

Their designed traits of “heterosexuality” and/or “the feminine” are used as countering affects to undermine the female masculinity and queer ambiguity of these characters. Through Detective Dessel, I demonstrate how race further complicates readings of female masculinity. I argue that television depictions of cis-woman characters are ill-served when the possibilities for masculinity or sexual ambiguity is obfuscated by conventionally feminine appearance, heterosexual love interests, and other narrative components.</jats:p>",

Engaging key institutional structures and epistemic formations through which the field remains so white, this article considers the mechanisms by which critical race and gender scholars are positioned as eternally foreign, always just arriving, to the field of communication. Addressing the implications of these “epistemologies of ignorance” on the development of the discipline, this article outlines an intellectual and institutional archeology of Communication to reveal, instead, a field marked and shaped, from the start, by ethno-racial encounter. Communication, I suggest, remains so white because its experts and leaders continue to ignore its own institutional DNA, deliberately not knowing profoundly raced elements of its own intellectual history.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The nearly $300 million a year Nollywood culture industry in Nigeria has become transnational in its access to African audiences all over the world. The films and the industry remain a credible site for cultural analysis because of their popularity and resonance with their audiences as well as their moralizing mission. It is an important industry to examine for its contributions to the struggles of African women for opportunities for equality, self-actualization, and self-determination. Although these movies do not hesitate to portray the progress African women have made in climbing the political and socioeconomic ladders of society, they are constantly reminded that everything they have worked hard to achieve is irrelevant without conforming to the cultural construct of a good woman in their domestic lives. Women are constantly portrayed as having power in these video-films, but the power of women is considered diabolical, particularly in social and domestic relations.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study investigates a battle over music and identity at Radio Zapotitlán, a community radio station in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. An analysis of over 20 interviews with station organizers, volunteers and listeners conducted in 2009 and 2010 indicates that while organizers and older listeners celebrated Ranchera music as the station’s predominant musical content, younger listeners fought to broadcast contemporary Banda music. An historical and theoretical analysis of Ranchera music explores its cultural role in mediating experiences of migration and nostalgia. This study finds that Radio Zapotitlán organizers promoted Ranchera music in order to engage the national and transnational nostalgia of Zapotitlán’s displaced migrants, and to meet the expectations of government regulators and transnational nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). It concludes that local, regional, national and transnational interests cannot be disentangled in musical articulations of identity at Radio Zapotitlán.</jats:p>",

Recently, she returned with her revised bestseller Women and Money (2018a) and a weekly podcast timed to coincide with #metoo. Across media, Orman has utilized the affect associated with feminine media genres, including self-help and makeover shows, to promote a lifestyle based on proper financial self-management. Her advice to women about marriage, motherhood, and filial duty makes it clear that such discipline is particularly gendered. Orman both uses and chafes against feminist discourses to frame finance as another problem to be managed for women. I understand Orman’s advice as affective through her use of fear, shame, and pride to promote individualized financialization at the expense of interpersonal relationships. My unique approach brings affect theory to financial media through analysis of Orman’s media texts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This essay asserts that the discourse on globalization—as filtered through the social science oligopoly of Britain, France, and the United States—is an extension of the dominant (classical) modernization/development paradigm*, traceable to Weber and Hegel, whose views contributed much toward what critics identify today as Orientalism* and Eurocentrism*. Anthropocentrism* and the belief that progress involves emulating the West (center) by the rest (periphery) are part and parcel of social science,* which tends to project its European universalism as universal universalism. This essay argues that an alternative view of globalization is possible through the perspective of Eastern, particularly Buddhist, philosophy,* which sees globalization as an ongoing dynamic process involving the entire environment in which humanity is only one actor. Daoism sees globalization as increasing diversity (engendered by the interaction of yin and yang) in perpetual interaction within unity, which the ineluctable Dao represents. \n* The terms marked with an asterisk are defined in the Appendix.",

While representation-oriented theories and methodologies help scholars think about the visual and narrative components of a game, analysis of representation fails scholars when we examine video games as simulations. With imperial play, I reimagine Laura Mulvey's male gaze through the lens of post-colonial theory and through Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric. While I acknowledge two key participants in the practice of imperial play, the game developer and game player, within this article, I demonstrate the framework by focusing on the experience of the player. Using examples from popular console and PC video games, I analyze embedded colonial attitudes within game missions, within the nature of the avatar, within the construction of the gamescape, and in regard to non-playable characters (NPCs).</jats:p>",

Our article explores these events in the context of “millennial India,” particularly in terms of the networks that emerged in the course of climate action in two different regions. By using evidence from Delhi in the north and Bengaluru in the south, we also develop a comparative sociology of digital-first environmental movements and show how the significance of Twitter can only be understood in relation to the formations of social capital on the ground.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article uses the concept of media populism to analyze the sophisticated role of networked platforms in organizing political discourses. Building on the scholarship on mediatization and mediated populism, it examines the mediated appeal of the God metanarrative—Religious Duterte, Catholic Church, Apollo Quiboloy, and Daily Prayer—and shows how God-related posts amplify the communicative style of populism in the Philippines. The God metanarrative on Facebook inspires communal engagement much as it polarizes the civil consensus on free expression and inclusive nationalism. The embedding of non-conflictual sentiments in the digital sphere blurs the precarious line between free expression of religious views and of political support, enabling political entrepreneurs to exploit the former as a way to consolidate the latter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Digitalization, digitization, and datafication—referred to as the three Ds transforming forced migration management—are composed of practices of abstraction which constitute socio-spatial processes and the imaginary supporting these processes. Against the backdrop of migration management initiatives in Germany and in the European Union, the article highlights how practices like data sharing and predictive modeling create a space of abstraction which is consolidated by the imaginary of quantification and automation. This space and imaginary, based on the premises of efficiency, transparency, and control and actualized by a technocratic apparatus, define the management of migration as well as the figure of the migrant. The article concludes that the three Ds will increasingly shape forced migrants’ lives through the leveling logics of technocratic control. Academic attention to data ownership and data justice is more important than ever.</jats:p>",

Scholars of celebrity endorsements in political contexts have primarily focused on the efficacy rather than the rhetorical content of these endorsements and what latent social structures make them effective. Through close readings of two SIENs of Vice President Kamala Harris by American celebrities of Indian descent, I draw upon social identity theory to elucidate the ways in which these endorsements create valuable networks of support for Indian Americans, but simultaneously create homogenizing articulations of Indian American identity that exploit caste, ethnolinguistic, and racial differences. Analyzing how Indian Americans and other minority groups present themselves/connect with their community provides insights into what it takes to succeed in America’s diversifying political and media landscape.</jats:p>",

I highlight the nuances of such abjection through a “lacking personality” metanarrative imposed on Asian-American finalists on the reality television show, So You Think You Can Dance (SYTYCD). I forward an Asian-American rhetorical approach informed by critical rhetorics of race by Lacy and Ono (2011. Critical Rhetorics of Race. New York University Press) and Ono and Pham (2009. Asian Americans and the media, Vol. 2. Polity) to problematize rhetoric that abjects Asian-Americans. I suggest that depictions of Asian-Americans as lacking personality in popular media are part of the same continuum of racialized yellow peril abjection, upholding a conditional belonging that allows anti-Asian racial violence to flourish, particularly in moments of crisis and public moral panic.</jats:p>",

However, literature shows that in South Africa there are more people migrating internally than those migrating into South Africa from other countries. In this article, I draw on 15 interviews with BlackQueers who moved from rural to urban areas in South Africa to explain their Queer-centric motivations for migrating internally, which enabled them to “confront what it means to be Queer” through physical and digital interactions. The digital world is important because it surpasses fixed geographies. Digital spaces offer a refuge that may not be available in offline spaces even when there are legal protections that state that this should not be the case. This article provokes transnational scholarship to pay equal attention to movements within countries and digital spaces as it does to cross-country flows.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon Foucauldian poststructuralism, we then demonstrate how the Asian drama, narrated through three forms of otherness—ideological (Japan/Indonesia vs. China); developmental (Japan/China vs. Indonesia); and a geopolitical imaginary (the West vs. Asia)—revealed the perpetuation of Eurocentric hegemony in the knowledge of science and technology.</jats:p>",

The article explores multilingual and multimodal practices on Polish trans YouTube and discusses their role in localizing the transnational LGBTQ+ discourse within the local socio-cultural context. Applying the perspective of translation studies and exploring the role of translation (and non-translation) in localizing the transnational concepts of gender and sexuality makes it possible to trace the process of trans-creating the new language of the Polish trans community, a language that emphasizes trans social media users’ agency and is capable of expressing their individualized and localized gender transition experiences.</jats:p>",

It describes a qualitative study that suggests that aesthetic representations provoke affective responses and, to some degree, empathy for migrants, in turn contributing to these students’ civic engagement. These responses speak to the presence of what I term “border affects,” a dimension of affective cartography that is produced by and, in turn, reproduces a cultural imaginary that situates the citizen’s relationship to migration and has the power to both override and promote empathy. These affects suggest that the southern border is not an ontological category that is implicitly known, extant, or eternal but a cognitive phenomenon filtered through experience.</jats:p>",

Focusing on the demonetization drive undertaken by the BJP-led government in India in 2016, this forum piece makes the case for memes as a kind of memory culture. By this, I mean not only the representation of historical events in memes, but also memes themselves as memorial objects. Memes made in 2016 resurface even now as a form of humorous political critique and demonetization memes are further folded into critiques of current events such as the ongoing farmers' protests. Through an examination of such processes of recontextualization, repurposing and resurfacing, I demonstrate how the seemingly fragmented form of the meme impacts the way we remember through digital media. In effect, meme-culture in India accrues a “sticky” temporality that makes them powerful forms of digital “folk” archiving.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Drawing insights from the sociology of expectations and recent studies on future visions in communication studies, this article traces and analyzes how Wired—a technology news provider and socio-technical vanguard whose vision is to uncover technological innovations—anticipated socio-technical visions of online ratings and reviews over two decades (1998–2018). The qualitative textual analysis of Wired’s coverage revealed two socio-technical visions, namely, promissory futures and problematic futures. The former embraced neoliberal discourses of consumer empowerment and accountability, whereas the latter entailed a pessimistic evaluation of the manipulation of online ratings and the potential of adopting online ratings beyond e-commerce platforms. The visions represented in Wired largely followed the logic of “technological solutionism.” This study affords opportunities for thinking about the role of popular media discourses and temporalities in shaping imagined futures of emerging technologies.</jats:p>",

We provide a general framework for the nascent yet growing body of work that locates industry researh on particular organizations, agents, and practices within vast media conglomerates operating at a global level. We mark out the most general boundaries of such an endeavor by synthesizing the extant research in critical media industry studies, the ways in which concepts and methods of cultural studies have been adapted to the study of industry practices, and address the main gaps and trajectories of such research.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Scholars and advocates often cite media as a mechanism to change culture, especially related to contested issues in American politics such as abortion. While there is mixed evidence in support of this claim, it is not clear how media content creators conceptualize their abortion plotlines. We identified television shows available to U.S. audiences that included abortion plotlines and purposively recruited the creators who worked on them. Forty-six American creators completed in-depth interviews. Respondents’ primary reasons for including abortion plotlines were: (1) to normalize abortion; (2) to deploy abortion as source of character development; and (3) to respond to politics. Some respondents reported barriers to getting abortion content from page to screen, including stigmatizing attitudes towards abortion from colleagues and network executives. Respondents did not necessarily aspire to reflect the reality of abortion access in the US, instead seeking to destigmatize abortion by portraying televisual representations of compassionate, shame-free abortions.</jats:p>",

The show features well-known and up-and-coming music artists alongside a studio band who cover contemporary and familiar songs. Some of the popular songs are fusions of traditional compositions and Western instrumentation. The Sufi renditions on the show are popular as well. The music produced on CSP is not necessarily unique to the nation state’s mediascape. Notwithstanding, the music is a novel presentation of Pakistani culture to a transnational audience. The following article positions the show in the dominant Western discourses that construct the nation as an intolerant and orthodox Islamic state harboring terrorists. The author argues that CSP composes an oppositional discourse by showcasing transgressively gendered performances and a mystical and subversive Islam.</jats:p>",

We argue that these characters personify a new type of underdog, one that has internalized the ideologies inherent in neoliberal capitalism in Korea. The “winner takes all” system accelerated the polarization of wealth and inequality, which is in part the result of what scholars called “neo-poverty,” or the collapse of the middle class caused by the 1997 financial crisis. Neoliberalism was adopted to address neo-poverty, but rather than cure the crisis, it has ushered in a second phase of neo-poverty that is manifest in the underdogs’ narratives in Squid Game.</jats:p>",

From large corporations to small universities, leaders recognize the importance of those with more experience guiding junior employees and students. Colleges and universities have taken the lead nationwide in mentoring efforts, with many having exemplary peer mentoring programs for undergraduates, and some institutions deploying mentoring to support faculty and students. The discipline of Communication has also begun to place more emphasis on mentoring. Yet, some populations, specifically women of color and other minoritized people, do not always have access to networks or programs and are left on their own to navigate institutions and processes. That few women of color faculty inhabit academic spaces in Communication departments, as in other departments across campuses, creates additional challenges for students and faculty, who often lack mentors and yet carry the additional burden of mentoring. This introduction to the special forum in CCC brings sets up the critical insights on mentoring our senior and emerging contributors offer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Itinerant films represented a substantial media and cultural phenomenon during the first half of the 20th century, and provided a localized form of a mass culture product. Through an analysis of archival materials and newspaper accounts related to the production of 11 itinerant movies filmed in the Midwestern United States in the 1920s, this article examines the relationship between the itinerant films and community newspapers. By supporting these productions, these newspapers used a relatively new communication technology as a way to solidify their civic position. They helped create an intensely local product featuring recognizable landmarks, businesses and people that offered readers a way to combat the loss of community and place in an increasingly networked society.</jats:p>",

By examining the discursive chasms of Turkish Press and entertainment media through a critical discourse analysis (CDA), we investigate how the Turkish dailies take a position to determine the boycotting issue to the public, and enquire into the politics around the boycotting discourse which created an illusion that markets are not embedded in political relations, which can be considered separate domains under capitalism. The concept we called “depoliticizing the politics” denotes that Turkish agents framed the boycott as a solely economic crisis by dismissing the conflict’s political dimension.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This article examines how decisions are made and justified within cultures of contribution using an “operational pragmatics.” Peer-production and contribution cultures are enfolded in a dynamic of resistance and appropriation in relation to capitalism. Open-source and contribution-based cultural processes have been critiqued as tending towards bureaucracy or becoming enfolded in a never-ending neoliberal imaginary from which escape or transcendence become impossible. An examination of the values expressed within a peer-production community challenges these perspectives and shows how “operational pragmatics” can provide moral justifications through reference to matters of principle and matters of design. Conflating these matters complicates claims about the inherent virtues of participation, especially in technical cultures. A qualitative analysis of an open-source hardware project shows how competing moral justifications unfold, and how the challenges that they pose to capitalism may be tenuous or temporary because of the way that justificatory regimes work within technology development under capitalism.",

    "abstract": "Many science and engineering fields in Anglo-American countries have been pursuing aggressive diversity and inclusion programs to redress historical marginalization of underrepresented minorities. Though Communication has and continues to make important strides through various initiatives, the discipline has much more to do to achieve inclusivity. Examining tweets posted during the International Communication Association (ICA) 2019 annual conference using social network analysis and content analysis, this essay illustrates how the Twitter-based discussion around diversity was not heard enough outside the ghettoized spaces of the discipline. Therefore, I argue that we urgently need, as a discipline, to work more actively towards greater diversity and inclusivity. The future diversity of the Communication discipline depends on concerted efforts now.",

We examine how the television economy transformed the organization behind the coup (FETÖ) from a public secret into a spectacle. We investigate the televised confessions of former Gulenists, who revealed the scandalous FETÖ’s inner workings live on television. We argue that former Gulenists’ media performances based on confession, apology, and spectacular secrecy captured public affect to justify their complicity with the putschists rather than bringing political justice. The government capitalized on these confessions as part of its strategic information warfare to tame the opposition after the coup, while reconstructing Gulenists as a weird cult rather than a political network. As the citizens were bombarded with affective televisual confessions, politicians secured authoritarian futures without a glimpse of justice, because these shows spectacularly erased the networks behind the coup.</jats:p>",

Bound up in this struggle is how collective memory—or rather whose collective memory—shapes the practices of news-making. Here I interrogate how television news shapes collective memory of Black activism through analysis of a unique moment when protests over police abuse of Black people became newsworthy simultaneous with widespread commemorations of the civil rights movement. I detail the complex terrain of nostalgia and misremembering that provides cover for moderate and conservative delegitimization of contemporary Black activism. At the same time, counter-memories, introduced most often by members of the Black public sphere, offer alternative, actionable, and comprehensive interpretations of Black protest.</jats:p>",

For racial privilege to exist three conditions are required: (1) structural control; (2) racial invisibility to hide power; and (3) direct benefits of a structural racist system. For Asian Americans, the accrued “benefits” in some areas of social life, what we call contextual advantages are indirect, based on the shape-shifting of White supremacy, not Asian American self-determination. This is not, however, to excuse or deny some Asian Americans’ cooperation with White supremacy, settler colonialism, and U.S. empire, but to note that hegemonic usefulness to White supremacy is not equivalent to racial privilege.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>How do Black women engulf themselves in the politics of being and becoming through everyday existence, aesthetics and media practices in creative, pleasurable, diasporic and resistant ways? How is the hegemony of North America, Eurocentrism, anti-Blackness and sexism implicated in this? We consider such questions in relation to Black women's media and aesthetic practices, and their related scholarship, by examining the Ghana-based web series An African City. Our work echoes calls for the decentering of media and communication studies rooted in white and Western perspectives but positioned as “universal.” We explore Black women's experiences (in Britain, the United States, Ghana, and Nigeria) as active producers in their communities; beyond the dominant epistemological hierarchy of whiteness in contrast with Blackness. Framing visual communication as a community-based source of self-expression, we emphasize the liberatory possibilities of aesthetics (fashion and screen depictions) for Black women, while tarrying with how capitalism constrains such radical potential.</jats:p>",

Using a sample of 10 widely viewed online videos and over 2,700 public comments in reply to these, I provide an analysis of boundary work in a context of extreme privilege. I do this with a critical eye towards the ways in which commenters leverage envy and aspiration to both bridge boundaries and draw distinctions online.</jats:p>",

Through an engagement with affect theory and digital mourning studies, this article critically analyzes the limitations of affect in the digital moment, as the complex lives of the victims were reduced to simple but highly resonate icons. Despite the limitations of these affective icons, I argue that the contradictory emotions of successful happiness and unimaginable grief that adhered to these images enabled Muslims to cultivate feelings of resonance. At the same time, Muslims were expected to perform constant affective labor to prove the worth and equality of their lives. Finally, my analysis of this case illustrates how these heavily affective images reinforced that Muslim lives are only valued if they are positive, harmless and apolitical.</jats:p>",

It reports on one year of participatory action research (PAR) with six undocumented migrants living in Brussels, Belgium, which included participatory video-making and a combination of walking interviews and visual artefact production. The findings revolve around three counter-documentation tactics developed during the study to oppose hegemonic ways of representing (undocumented) migrants. The article aims to make a methodological contribution by reflecting on ethics and the pragmatic combination of different participatory methods while offering a conceptual vocabulary for approaching mediation, migration, and alterity from the perspective of progressive social change.</jats:p>",

Memes about the series were frequently shared across social media, as users interpolated themselves into the Squid Game universe. We argue that the memes produced by Black Twitter users are a form of meme play that can be read as a significant moment in the shared cultural and activist lineage of Black and Korean communities. Although racial tension is often at the center of the relationship between these two marginalized groups, we suggest that Black Twitter users’ interpolation of themselves into a distinctly Korean cultural product provides us with a chance to imagine how interracial solidarities can be visualized. This is significant in the age of the Black Lives Matter and Stop Asian Hate Movements, which are supported by members of both communities.</jats:p>",

They are managed through a juridico-political process called Refugee Status Determination (RSD). Under the surveillant gaze of RSD, refugee subjects are forced to narrativize their lives using the language of persecution in exchange for state protection. This article contributes to critical refugee studies (CRS) scholarship which challenges the dehumanizing impacts of RSD’s surveillant gaze. Extending Vinh Nguyen’s concept of refugeetude, I develop a framework for refugee sousveillance. I define refugee sousveillance as the co-optation of refugee narratives such that they consciously defy the juridico-political surveillance of RSD towards a creative, open, coalitional future with other refugee subjects and marginalized groups. Refugee sousveillance applies bell hooks’ oppositional gaze (1992) and Browne’s (2015)  dark sousveillance to refugeetude. Identifying a noteworthy collection of essays written by a coalition of elite refugee writers, I provide examples of refugee sousveillance as both process and product.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>With the rise of advanced biometric technologies, the surveilling of populations who do not match racial and gender norms has increased. Modern-day biometrics make assumptions about gender and race based on skin color, facial structure, body type, and body parts, which are encoded in predictive algorithms and other AI-driven systems. Growing empirical evidence points to the obstacles this poses for trans and non-binary individuals in several spheres, including border security, healthcare, and social media. Drawing on autoethnographic vignettes, semi-structured interviews, and survey responses, we look to the increased use of binary-based biometric technologies and automatic gender recognition (AGR), which rely on outmoded understandings of gender as static, measurable, and physiological. Our ethnographic data demonstrate how trans and non-binary bodies are forced to bend to these systems; meanwhile these technologies and algorithms increasingly extract data on trans and non-binary users, which may then be used as challenge sets to refine their accuracy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article advances the notion of “extractive humanitarianism” to designate the role played by data extraction and knowledge extraction operations in refugee governmentality. It argues that extractive operations rely on refugees’ active participation to their own governmentality—what I define as participatory confinement. The piece engages with feminist literature on unpaid labor and shows that participatory confinement implies that refugees perform unpaid labor activities, which are disguised as voluntary work. It moves on by conceptualizing participatory confinement through the lens of the invitation to governmentality. In order to develop this, the article focuses on two modes of participatory confinement: unpaid labor that asylum seekers do as “voluntary” activities and knowledge and data extraction. It concludes by questioning extractive humanitarianism in light of the subtle coercion and invisible exploitation that asylum seekers are exposed to.</jats:p>",

These developments occur at the intersection of various intertwined geopolitical scales: urban, regional, national, continental, and global, as well as physical and digital. This introduction synthesizes various theoretical and methodological discussions to highlight the ambivalences of contemporary queer cultures, focusing on their intrinsic transnational and digital conditions. The authors contributing to this issue demonstrate that understanding queer cultures in the digital age requires examining the roles of various actors, including big tech employees, online platform volunteers, queer influencers, audiences, and migrants. They also highlight how queer digital cultures transcend national borders and challenge oppositional binaries, such as local vs. global and the West vs. the Rest, all while maintaining a critical perspective on the ambivalences of digitality.</jats:p>",

Focusing on a group of essential workers, this study examines how mainland Chinese low-skilled labor migrants discursively manifest their everyday lives via WeChat Moments. From analyzing social media posts and interview data, this study demonstrates that these labor migrants’ stay in Macao was a period of unsought and undesired time of waiting, impacted by socio-structural constraints of class, age, gender, and outsider identity. Participants experienced positive (happiness with newfound opportunities) and negative emotions (anxiety and entrapment) during forced immobility due to border closures. This study contributes to understandings of border-crossing as interpreted and experienced via social media discourse.</jats:p>",

I examine intersectionality within the Ghanaian context using African feminisms as a backdrop. I argue that to drive African feminisms toward emancipatory praxes, it is imperative to center identity categories that are often erased from feminist conversations and to pay attention to organizing from these margins to amplify the erased narratives about marginalization. I theorize these silenced narratives drawing on my experiences as a Muslim Dagbana woman and my work in African and Ghanaian feminist digital spaces. Here, I focus on ethnicity as an identity category that is often overlooked within feminist discourses in national contexts in Africa. I point to organizing strategies that can facilitate the centering of identities and feminist issues that have historically been pushed to the margins.</jats:p>",

They learn users’ behaviors and tailor content to individual interests and predicted tastes. These algorithms, in turn, categorize and represent these users back to society—culturally, politically, and racially. Researchers audit personalization algorithms to critique the ways bias is perpetuated within these systems. Yet, research examining the relationship between personalization algorithms and racial bias has not yet contended with the complexities of conceptualizing race. This article argues for the use of racialized discourse communities within algorithm audits, providing a way to audit algorithms that accounts for both the historical and cultural influences of race and its measurement online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>During the pandemic many aspects of our life were recalibrated through the digital—highlighting the paradoxes of the digital for both empowerment and exploitation. In particular, the pandemic demonstrated the increasing role of the digital in shaping, and being shaped by, kinship. Kinship is a complex term that captures our relationality, intimacies and connections. Kinship is always in action, always becoming. Throughout the pandemic, some cohorts such as older adults (65 years +) were disproportionally disadvantaged due to the uneven digital literacies skills. In this article I expand upon the role of digital kinship as part of human and more-than-human choreography of (informal) care for older adults in Australia. I also reflect on the role of creative forms of knowledge transmission such as illustrations and placemaking games to curate public awareness and enact change.</jats:p>",

Women’s and feminist movements in this context have developed situated knowledges and strategies that make them distinct from the hegemonic (neo)liberal feminisms of the Global North. Furthermore, the recent successes of Global South feminisms demonstrate their ability to influence national and transnational politics in ways that expand freedoms and rights for marginalized constituencies across the world. This special issue offers a glimpse into some of these movements and their political communications, showcasing the political and theoretical value of feminist and women’s rights advocacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Drawing on ethnographic research I conducted between May 2022 and January 2024 with queer migrants in Athens, Greece, I offer the conceptualization of “glitchy transnationalism” as a corrective to the transnational promise of queer digital media—the notion that these platforms can seamlessly facilitate connections across national boundaries among queer individuals (e.g., Grindr). I explore how this promise falters for two queer migrant individuals, Ziri and Tilila—both of whom I interpret as encountering two glitches. I argue that understanding these perceived transnational “failures” as glitches showcases the interplay of factors such as legal status, migrancy, race, sexuality, and gender identity in shaping the lived realities of queer migrants within transnational digital spaces. Ultimately, this research underscores the relationship between state dynamics and digital media in the lives of queer migrants, urging scholars to adopt a lens that recognizes glitches as diagnostic of power dynamics within queer digital realms.</jats:p>",

I show that contemporary mainland Chinese TV representations of tomboyism have often softened its subversive edge in a hetero-patriarchal-structured society with growing knowledge in feminist and queer cultures. Thus, while adult women’s embodiment of female masculinity might have been tolerated and even commercialized in post-2010 Chinese society and entertainment, there exists an uncomfortable disjuncture between the tomboyism on TV and certain T identities in the off-screen world.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>For this study, we analyzed the changing images of women characters involved in extramarital affairs in three Chinese TV dramas—Come and Go (CG; Hubei TV &amp; Guangxi TV, 1998), Dwelling Narrowness (DN; Beijing TV &amp; Dragon TV, 2009), and Nothing but Thirty (NT; Dongfang TV &amp; Tencent Video, 2020). We argue here that shifting gender relationships, evolving political, economic, and technological conditions relating to the media industry, and a transition in the broader social environment have motivated a return to patriarchal moral discourse on Chinese TV. Specifically, in keeping with this discourse, extramarital affairs have come to be presented as immoral, primarily for the women involved—the “little third” of the title, this being the literal translation of the Mandarin term for “mistress.” We documented this return to patriarchal moral doctrines that are intended to discipline women and limit the diversity and nuance of culturally accepted forms and expressions of sexual attraction and romance on Chinese TV in case studies of the three programs.</jats:p>",

Opponents point to infrastructural breakdowns as evidence that refugees and migrants do not belong and are a drain on national resources. Through a comparative case study analysis of the refugee camp in Calais, France, and at the U.S.–Mexico border, this article argues that infrastructure and infrastructural breakdowns mediate and communicate claims to territory, political recognition, and legitimacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, academia worldwide resorted to the remote teaching–learning alternatives in the form of online classes, virtual tutoring, and online learning software. To ensure the sustenance of education systems, educators exploited Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to facilitate continuity in teaching at all levels. However, in the Indian-administered Kashmir region, the disputed territory between India and Pakistan, online teaching was marred by the political instability in the region, thanks to the stringent communication blockade imposed by the authorities (“Kashmir,” 2019). The Kashmir conflict dates back to the historic partition of the Indian subcontinent between India and Pakistan, after the British withdrawal in 1947. Ever since the partition, the Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir remains contested between India and Pakistan and the two nuclear rivals have fought three wars in 1947, 1965, and 1999 to consolidate control over the disputed region (Schofield, 2021). In August 2019, Indian Parliament unilaterally removed the autonomous status of the disputed Kashmir region and to preempt any backlash, the authorities unleashed an unprecedented curfew, suspended phone networks and Internet services while putting the entire region under strict lockdown (“History’s longest,” 2019). During the lockdown, the region witnessed the longest e-curfew in history with more than 13,600 public and private educational institutes remaining closed for almost six months, restricting students and teachers to their homes with no means of correspondence with each other (Wallen, 2020). It was only in January 2020 that the government approved limited 2G-speed Internet access to 301 “white listed” websites with no access to any social media platforms (Sareen, 2020). When schools and colleges were resuming after some ease in the restrictions, the Indian",

    "title": "The Angel as Wish Image: Justin Bieber, Popular Culture, and the Politics of Absolution",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In the early 21st century, the angel became a recurrent image within the visual economy of pop music stardom. By considering the case of Justin Bieber (whose angel invocations give expression to his struggles with celebrity, faith, and the pathology of Whiteness), the author reveals how biographical factors alone cannot account for the angel’s contemporary resonance. Instead, and drawing upon Walter Benjamin’s concept of wish image, the author argues that this invocational pattern reflects a general desire for a one-to-one correspondence between being and doing—here understood as a manifestation of the ur-historical longing for absolution. Because this desire is ambivalent, the angel has historically been invoked to symbolize wishes as divergent as fascism’s ideal gender relations and radical utopia’s equality. In this way, the angel’s current ubiquity alerts us to the role resonant myths often play in the elaboration of collective desires, while pointing toward their implications for emancipatory strategy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Media governance has been attracting growing interest among communication scholars. However, there is uncertainty as to what exactly governance is. This article aims at clarification. One definition of media governance is developed that captures the entirety of rules that aim to organize media systems. However, media governance is characterized as a new concept suited for the analysis of media policy and regulation. This concept is argued to be not only of heuristic value by offering an integrated view on rules in the media sector but also adaptive to various theoretical approaches. In particular, the article shows the merits of connecting media governance to new sociological institutionalism and concludes by emphasizing the potential of a theoretically grounded concept of media governance.",

Their study has taken on considerable life over the past 20–25 years, beginning with the ‘‘resource mobilization/rational actor’’ and the ‘‘New Social Movements’’ schools, and continuing on with the current ‘‘Contentious Politics’’ network, along with studies of solidarity movements (Giugni & Passy, 2001), social networks and movements (Diani & McAdam, 2003), and transnational social movements (Keck & Sikkink, 1998). The journals Social Movement Studies and Mobilization are significant though not exclusive fora for debate on these issues. The global social justice movement and religious revival movements have been two major contemporary spurs to these analyses.",

Many modern professional wrestlers are more frequently and openly breaking with traditional masculinity in not just their in-ring/on-screen performances, but also in mediums that blur the lines of the fiction. I detail how one performer, Eddie Kingston, articulates masculinity alongside his own real-life struggles with and the importance of mental health, vulnerability, and violence. In doing so, I contend Kingston performs what I call a nascent masculinity, an emergent reconfiguration or articulation of masculinity that positions key characteristics of traditional hegemonic masculinity in such a way that at least potentially produces something non-hegemonic, and non-toxic. Crucially, such examples reflect the complex relationship between violence and meaning.</jats:p>",

Through a textual analysis of these shows and industrial analysis of the strategies deployed by the network, the authors argue that Univision’s targeting of “billennials”—bicultural and bilingual millennials—prompted a linguistic flexibility that challenges the traditional lineup of neutral, Spanish-only, television, and is more inclusive of Latina/o audiences’ language use.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Talk About Terrorism and the Media: Communicating With the Conduit Metaphor",
    "abstract": "The conduit metaphor is the primary expression of linguistic communication in our culture (M. J. Reddy, 1979). It structures theories and frameworks based on the “Code Model” (from C. E. Shannon & W. Weaver, 1949) such as the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (R. E. Kasperson et al., 1988; N. Pidgeon, R. E. Kasperson, & P. Slovic, [Eds] 2003). The conduit metaphor structure objectifies source, receiver, and messages, which are talked of as “objects” or “substances” passed along a conduit to a receiver to be recovered. Metaphor analysis of 6 semistructured interviews with laypersons about terrorism and the media showed how the conduit metaphor structures a subjective process of reification, quantification, comparison, and judgment. This interpretation suggests that the demands of the conduit metaphor structure for the transferred message to be “invariant” and “pure” can influence relationships of trust and blame between media and public. The authors suggest that a notion of interactive communication between the media and the public should take into consideration the power of the conduit metaphor structure to shape understandings.",

Our framework is part of a GMP mapping project that has been developed within the context of the International Association for Media and Communication Research, to address the issues faced by researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers and advocates operating in this domain. In this article, we present an overview of the conceptual journey through which the GMP mapping project has evolved. \n \n \n \nMapeando la Politica Global de los Medios: Conceptos, Encuadres, Metodos \n \n \n \nMarc Raboy & Claudia Padovani \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste articulo busca considerar lo que vemos como dificil pero necesarios pasos hacia el encuentro de los desafios de analizar las transformaciones en la politica de los medios y la comunicacion: definiendo las fronteras de lo que significa “la politica global de los medios” (GMP) actualmente, proveyendo una conceptualizacion de la GMP como un dominio, elaborando un encuadre analitico consistente, y tratando las implicancias metodologicas. Nuestro encuadre es parte de un proyecto de mapeo de la GMP que ha sido desarrollado dentro del contexto de la Asociacion Internacional de los Medios y la Investigacion en Comunicacion, para tratar los asuntos que encuentran los investigadores y los practicantes, asi como tambien los hacedores de politicas y los defensores operando en este dominio.

    "title": "The Limits of Media Advocacy",
    "abstract": "This article argues that the theory and practice of media advocacy suffers from some inherent pragmatic and conceptual limits. One limit is practical: Media advocacy's reliance on journalists working in commercial media radically constrains advocates' ability to reach policy makers and citizens in anything more than an episodic way. Another limit is conceptual. By implicitly endorsing an elitist theory of democracy and focusing on mainstream journalism, media advocacy fails to theorize the crucial role media resources and strategies play within local social change movements. The article concludes by exploring what the theory and practice of media advocacy might look like if informed by an alternative, more participatory theory of democracy as well as a commitment to promoting media reform. \n \n \n \nLes limites de l'action au sein des medias \n \n \n \nTimothy A. Gibson \n \n \n \nCet article soutient que la theorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des medias souffre de limites pragmatiques et conceptuelles inherentes. L'une des limites est d'ordre pratique : la dependance des acteurs vis-a-vis des journalistes œuvrant dans les medias commerciaux restreint de facon radicale la capacite des militant d'atteindre les responsables et les citoyens a un rythme autre qu'episodique. Une autre limite est d'ordre conceptuel. En soutenant implicitement une vision elitiste de la democratie et en se concentrant sur le journalisme dominant, l'action au sein des medias omet de theoriser le role crucial que jouent les ressources et les strategies mediatiques dans les mouvements locaux pour le changement social. L'article conclut avec une exploration de ce dont pourrait avoir l'air la theorie et la pratique de l'action au sein des medias si elles etaient informees par une theorie de la democratie alternative, plus participative, et par un engagement envers la promotion d'une reforme mediatique. \n \n \n \nDie Grenzen des Medienlobbyismus \n \n \n \nTimothy A. Gibson \n \n \n \nMedienlobbyismus wurde als ein Ansatz der Gesundheitskommunikationskampagnen von Public Health Wissenschaftler Lawrence Wallack entwickelt und sollte fur den kritischen Medienwissenschaftler von grosem Interesse sein. Medienlobbyismus bedient sich Agenda- Setting und Framing-Theorie, um Aktivisten fur die Bevolkerungsgesundheit dabei zu unterstutzen, Nachrichtenberichterstattung in kommerziellen Lokalmedien herzustellen und zu gestalten. Diese Berichterstattung wird dann wiederum genutzt, Druck auf Politiker auszuuben, wichtige soziale und gesundheitsbezogene Probleme zu beseitigen. Es gibt viel, was man bezuglich dieses politikzentrierten Ansatzes von Gesundheitskampagnen bewundern kann, insbesondere wenn man den individualisierten und freiwilligen Charakter der meisten anderen Ansatze der Gesundheitskommunikation dagegensetzt. Dennoch argumentiert dieser Artikel, dass die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus an einigen ihr inharenten pragmatischen und konzeptuellen Grenzen leidet. Eine Grenze ist praktischer Natur: Die Abhangigkeit der Medienlobbyisten von Journalisten der kommerziellen Medien beschneidet ihre Moglichkeiten, Politiker und Burger anders als auf episodische Art und Weise zu erreichen. Eine andere Grenze ist konzeptuell: Indem implizit einer Elitetheorie von Demokratie angenommen wird und indem auf Mainstream-Journalisten und Medien fokussiert wird, versaumt es der Medienlobbyismus theoretisch zu bedenken, welche zentrale Rolle Medienressourcen und Strategien in lokalen Bewegungen gesellschaftlichen Wandels spielen. Diese Artikel schliest mit der Untersuchung, wie die Theorie und Praxis von Medienlobbyismus wohl aussehen wurde, wurde sie aus einer alternativen, mehr auf Teilhabe ausgerichteten Demokratietheorie und einem Engagement fur die Forderung einer Medienreform gespeist werden. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLos Limites del Apoyo de los Medios \n \n \n \nTimothy A. Gibson \n \n \n \nDepartment of Communication, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030, USA \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste articulo sostiene que la teoria y practica del apoyo de los medios sufre de algunos limites pragmaticos y conceptuales inherentes. Un limite practico es: la dependencia en el apoyo de los medios de los periodistas trabajando en medios comerciales que constrinen radicalmente la habilidad de los defensores para alcanzar a los creadores de politicas y los ciudadanos en nada mas que una forma episodica. Otro limite es conceptual. Al avalar implicitamente una teoria elitista de la democracia y focalizar en el periodismo de la corriente dominante, el apoyo de los medios falla en teorizar el rol crucial de los recursos de los medios y las estrategias que juegan dentro de los movimientos sociales de cambio local. Este articulo concluye con una exploracion de como la teoria y la practica del apoyo de los medios seria si estuvieran informadas por una teoria de la democracia alternativa, mas participativa asi como tambien un compromiso hacia la reforma de los medios.",

    "title": "American Football, Flags, and âFunâ: The Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl and the Rhetorical Production of Militarism",
    "abstract": "The Armed Forces Bowl provides a troubling integration of commercial sport and the American culture of militarism. The game features patriotic displays and symbols that have become increasingly central to sporting events during the ‘war on terror,’ represents the first time a military manufacturer has been the official sponsor of a college bowl game, and depends on a ubiquitous rhetoric of ‘‘support the troops.’’ By expanding the familiar conflation of sport and war, the Armed Forces Bowl simultaneously trivializes the seriousness of war as it emphasizes the seriousness of supporting the American military. This rhetorical division offers a delimited conception of appropriate American identity, thereby normalizing war in general and endorsing the ‘war on terror’ specifically. doi:10.1111/j.1753-9137.2009.01046.x There can be little doubt that war is, in part, a rhetorical proposition. In the years since U.S. troops invaded Afghanistan in 2002, rhetorical critics have examined the various dimensions of America’s ‘‘war on terror,’’ largely concluding that it has been characterized by a series of false claims or argumentative failures. These analyses range from Bostdorff’s (2003) examination of the rhetoric of covenant renewal that justified public support of war, to West and Carey’s (2006) critique of the Bush administration’s enactment of frontier justice, to Jamieson’s (2007) account of the faulty evidence used by President Bush in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003. Most emphatically, Hartnett and Stengrim (2006) define the ‘‘war on terror’’ as an ‘‘operation of deception,’’ through which millions of lives have unjustly been altered. These scholars, and many others, have demonstrated persuasively that American military actions since 9/11 have been highly problematic.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This analysis explores how a liberal mainstream news outlet—MSNBC—grapples with the overt racism of the current right-wing populist presidential administration in the United States. With a plethora of “good” conservatives and its stable of liberal pundits, the cable network has painted the president as mentally ill or declining, an incompetent purveyor of chaos. In perpetuating a mantra of “this is not who we are” in coverage of overt racism, MSNBC pivots to a more comfortable mainstream space of post-race, an ideological stance that places racism as a fringe anomaly. The post-race pivot belies the country’s ongoing racist legacy, and potentially lulls viewers toward acceptance of official antiracisms that serve hegemonic interests. Thus, the news coverage of the current presidency plays a role in forestalling a meaningful reckoning with the country’s ongoing history of institutional and everyday racism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this article, I propose that we think of the recent concern over fake news, misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories as a moral panic. I revisit Stuart Hall and his co-authors’ concept, updating it in two ways. First, I focus on how the current panic has altered what they called “primary definers” (which now includes professional journalism, as a result of their own waning authority). Second, the new alliance of panic actors (journalism, technology companies, intelligence agencies, politicians, civil society organizations) are expressions of a crisis policing that is now martialized. I assess this new nexus in terms of a breakdown of civil peace into outright hostilities; as a counterinsurgency operation. I draw on Michel Foucault’s strategic analysis of power and society that challenges boundaries between politics and war. This nexus is waging what I call a war of restoration, one that has significant implications for dissent and oppositional knowledges.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This article presents a study of the implementation of new elements of media governance in the UK, Germany, and Norway. Seeking to amend the existing models, the three states have introduced different versions of so-called “public value tests” to assess the relevance, market impact, and cost/value of any new public service. The cases represent a meeting of national and supranational actors struggling to fit a staple of media policy into novel settings, developing new methods in the process. In discussing the development and organization of the tests, substantial differences are identified within a shared framework. Scrutinizing the specific implementations of the tests, it is argued that the actors involved, the measures, as well as the scopes vary across the cases. \n \n \n \nGobernando la Emision de Servicios Publicos: ‘‘Las Pruebas de Valor Publico’’ en Diferentes Contextos Nacionales \n \n \n \nHallvard Moe \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste articulo presenta un estudio de la implementacion de los nuevos elementos de gobierno de los medios en el Reino Unido, Alemania, y Noruega.

Based on 25 interviews with users and an inductive analysis of their practices and profiles on the platform, we discuss five dynamics through which this mutual domestication occurs: personalization, or the ways in which individualized relationships between users and the platform are built; how algorithmic recommendations are integrated into a matrix of cultural codes; the rituals through which they are incorporated into spatial and temporal processes in daily life; the resistance to various aspects of Netflix as a form to enact agency; and the conversion or transformation of the private consumption of the platform into a public issue. The conclusion elaborates on the theoretical and analytical implications of this approach, to rethink the relationship between algorithms and culture.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Polysemic Scaffolding: Explicating Discursive Clashes in Chappelle's Show",
    "abstract": "This article explicates the discursive foundations that bubble up multiple meanings in racial humor, describing three prominent discursive clashes at the heart of Chappelle's Show’s polysemic comedy: Egregious stereotyping versus subtler mediated racism, inverted racial stereotypes versus traditional stereotypes, and serious versus nonserious discourse. Throughout the article, I make a case for “polysemic scaffolding,” a method that positions polysemy as a taken-for-granted interaction among text, author, and audience, and instead seeks to understand the discursive patterns that will eventually have their polysemic meanings activated. This article underscores the importance of not only undertaking polysemic criticism, but also of uncovering the discursive scaffolding upon which the polysemy is based. \n \n \n \nEl Andamiaje Polisemico: Explicando el Choque Discursivo en el Programa de Chappelle \n \n \n \nLisa Glebatis Perks \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste ensayo explica las fundaciones discursivas que emergen de los significados multiples del humor racial, mediante la descripcion de 3 choques discursivos prominentes en el corazon de la comedia polisemica del programa de Chappelle: el estereotipar en forma flagrante versus el solapado racismo mediatico, los estereotipos raciales invertidos versus los estereotipos tradicionales, y los discursos serios versus los no serios. A traves del articulo, afirmo el caso del “andamiaje polisemico,’’ como un metodo que posiciona a la polisemia como una interaccion no tenida en cuenta entre el texto, el autor y la audiencia, y en cambio busca entender las pautas discursivas que activaran eventualmente los significados polisemicos. Este articulo subraya la importancia de, no solo asumir una critica polisemica, sino tambien revelar el andamiaje discursivo por el cual la polisemia esta basada. \n \n \n \nL’echafaudage polysemique : une explication des accrochages discursifs dans le Chappelle’s Show \n \n \n \nLisa Glebatis Perks \n \n \n \nCet essai explique les fondements discursifs d’ouemergent des significations multiples dans l’humour racial, en decrivant trois importants accrochages qui sont au cœur de la comedie polysemique du Chappelle’s Show : la stereotypification flagrante contre un plus subtil racisme medie, les stereotypes raciaux inverses contre les stereotypes traditionnels, et le discours serieux contre le discours non serieux. Tout au long de l’article, je defends l’«echafaudage polysemique », une methode qui traite la polysemie comme une interaction tenue pour acquise entre le texte, l’auteur et l’auditoire, et qui cherche plutot a comprendre les schemas discursifs dont les significations polysemiques seront rendues actives. Cet article souligne l’importance non seulement d’entreprendre une critique polysemique, mais aussi de reveler l’echafaudage discursif sur lequel s’appuie la polysemie. \n \n \n \nPolysemisches Rustzeug: Die Explikation von diskursiven Reibungsflachen in der Chappelle’s Show \n \n \n \nLisa Glebatis Perks \n \n \n \nDieser Aufsatz expliziert die diskursiven Grundpfeiler, die in den verschiedenen Bedeutungen von rassistischem Humor zum Vorschein kommen. Beschrieben werden diese anhand von drei diskursiven Einwurfen als Kern der polysemischen Komik in der Chappelle’s Show: hervorragende Stereotypisierung versus mediatisierter Rassismus, verkehrte rassistische Stereotype versus traditionelle Stereotype und ernster versus nicht-ernster Diskurs. Im Laufe des Artikels argumentiere ich fur ein ,,polysemisches Rustzeug“ als eine Methode, die Polysemie als eine selbstverstandliche Interaktion zwischen Text, Autor und Zuschauern positioniert, und bestrebt ist, die diskursiven Muster, welche moglicherweise ihre diskursiven Bedeutungen aktivieren, nachzuvollziehen. Dieser Artikel unterstreicht nicht nur die Wichtigkeit, polysemische Kritik anzubringen, sondern versucht auch, das polysemische Rustzeug als Basis von Polysemie, herauszuarbeiten.",

This project analyzes profiles of Greta Thunberg to understand how journalists constructed the persona that has become “Greta.” We argue the paradoxical framing of Thunberg as exceptional and fierce and childlike contributes to an alternative construction of girlhood grounded in the positive portrayal of her Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. While featuring ASD as her “superpower” is potentially progressive, we argue foregrounding Thunberg’s whiteness and age cements her construction as the iconic voice of the climate crisis movement, potentially downplaying the need for collective action to end climate change.</jats:p>",

This article builds from and intervenes in podcasting research, studies of Black women and media, and popular romance studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The premier of Empire in January 2015 drew 9.8 million viewers and became FOX's highest-rated series debut in three years. In this episode, we are introduced to the terminally-ill CEO of Empire Entertainment, Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard), who must decide which of his three sons will inherit the family business. To further complicate the decision, his ex-wife, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), is released from prison after 17 years. The strength of the performances from the main cast, and those of celebrity guest stars, bolster the drama that unfolds, explaining why Empire was incredibly popular with audiences, and black audiences in particular. We examine the series's representations of blackness through focus group interviews with 31 black women viewers, exploring how they made sense of Cookie and compared her to black female leads on other series. Our interviews reveal that Cookie's complexities inspire identification and anxiety, engage broader debates about popular culture representations, and clarify black women's desires to see multifaceted images of themselves and their communities on television.</jats:p>",

It addresses the current outbreak of anti-Palestinian racism in Germany as the latest expansion of an archive of criminalization that targets young people who, far from innocent and deserving of care and education, are constructed as folk devils that require heavy-handed punishment, segregation and deportation. While former panics have singled out the problematic heterosexualities of Muslim populations that fail to catch up with women-and-LGBT-friendly communities that care about diversity, the debate about the “Middle East conflict in Berlin schools” foregrounds media use as a central determinant of cultural pathology. This departure from languages of care and diversity, the article argues, reflects a dehumanizing tendency in racial capitalism that appears increasingly undisguised.</jats:p>",

Samuels’s positionality as a black woman leveraging her essential oils storyline into building a brand for herself brings the franchise into new cultural terrain: “the new momism.” Douglas and Michaels (2004) describe the new momism as a celebration of motherhood that encourages agency and autonomy but ultimately centers on intense devotion to childrearing. Samuels’s TRHOP storylines and extratextual self-fashioning deploy the tenets of the new momism and disrupt its inherent white supremacy to authenticate her identity through essential oils as a wellness commodity and curate an affective space for black women with her NFLM lifestyle brand.</jats:p>",

It argues that the version of empathy envisioned by the champions of the technology—one in which care for the other is a function of being able to collapse the other’s experience into one’s own—runs counter to the very concept of empathy, as originally construed, which preserves otherness in its alterity. The point is not simply to invoke a historical concept of empathy to contrast with the VR version, but to emphasize its enduring salience in response to recent technological developments. There is little doubt regarding the need for empathy, in the sense explored in this article, as we confront the pathologies of political fragmentation and social polarization facilitated by the current iteration of social media. However, this article argues that the VR version is more likely to exacerbate than redress these concerns.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper investigates the sociotechnical imaginary surrounding Uber’s supposedly imminent arrival in Winnipeg, through an examination of communication in the public sphere. We examine how actors mobilized their communicative resources in efforts to either bring ride-hailing or keep it away. For some advocates, ride-hailing technology was less important than Uber’s symbolic value of building Winnipeg’s image as an innovative city. Media coverage contrasted innovation and Uber with Winnipeg’s anxieties about being behind other cities and its taxi industry’s reputation as stuck in the past. These visions of Winnipeg’s future addressed an unspoken White, middle-class city dweller. While Winnipeg’s transportation industry was shaped by the socially located experiences of racialized immigrant men as taxi drivers and Indigenous women as passengers, these actors had less power to shape the imaginary. Our analysis suggests that cities like Winnipeg view Uber as an image-making product as much as a beneficial service for their citizens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The growing presence of trans people in popular culture, including television series, is a well-established fact. However, its broader social impact and particularly consideration of what constitutes a positive representation of the trans community has received little attention from academic literature. This research addresses this gap by focusing on the experiences and interpretations of trans individuals regarding the way they are portrayed in TV series. It does so by conducting a qualitative study of 19 trans Spaniards who participated in two focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that the participants view their increased representation as a form of retribution for past under-representation. They also associate positive representation with realism, with two of their primary areas of concern being the need to depict authentic situations and individuals, and lack of involvement of trans people in the creative process. Ultimately, this research highlights the role of television series as amplifiers of trans experiences, voices and stories.</jats:p>",

As we assume our responsibility to guide this journal and impact our fields, we would be remiss to ignore the glaring epicenter of the prevailing global order’s efforts to reproduce itself: the State of Israel’s ongoing campaign of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and its gradual expansion into the West Bank. As scholars of communication, media, culture, and technology, we cannot remain silent nor neutral in the face of livestreamed genocidal violence. We invite scholars of conscience to join us in calls for ceasefire and divestment against Israeli apartheid.</jats:p>",

Contextualized within the UK, US and Israel’s historical and ongoing colonial violence within Palestine over the past 75 years, we assess coverage that stands in contradiction to the often fetishized notion of PSM’s role in serving a broadly conceived and normatively accepted “public,” and challenge the independence afforded to existing PSM structures via a critique of the notion that PSM organizations operate at “arm’s length” from government. Throughout our analysis, we find evidence of systematic failures and highlight PSM’s use as an instrument perpetuating state power and control.</jats:p>",

I employ theory from Black feminism and transgender media studies to analyze Sophia’s medical transition, interpersonal relationships, and political ideologies. Ultimately, Sophia Burset’s narrative functions as a non-threatening trans woman to alleviate transphobia and render Blackness invisible in Laverne Cox’s embodiment of Sophia Burset.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Influencers are highly visible tastemakers who professionally publish content on social media platforms. In their work, influencers are tasked with reconciling their contradictory positioning—they are both promoters of consumption, and marshals of “authentic” sociality and community. Influencers thus organize their social world in ways that enable them to justify moving between two contradictory poles of commerciality and authenticity. In this article, we argue that these navigations necessitate “influencer imaginaries.” This concept was drawn from, first, in-depth interviews with 35 Chilean social media influencers, and second, from participant observation with advertising agencies who hire them. The influencer “imaginary” sheds light on how individuals experience and justify the commodification of the self and forms of knowledge as subject to valuation in markets when they communicate their brands. Thus, the imaginary was shown to emerge from three intertwined narratives: to resolve information asymmetries in markets; differentiate influencers from celebrities and advertisers as average people; and negotiate self-definition with regard to agencies, audiences, and themselves.</jats:p>",

And how do users engage with the language of intersectionality to either reify, contradict, or complicate the intersection of the Palestinian and Black experiences on the platform? We find that intersectionality is mediated by elite users via branded communication, as well as invoked to highlight or deny the intersections of the Black and Palestinian experience by the most peripheral users on the platform.</jats:p>",

Joining a recent shift toward decolonizing the study of the flow of digital technologies in the Global South, this article calls for a new approach that prioritizes specific historical, cultural, and epistemological contexts in the Global South and acknowledges the fragmentation left behind by colonization and divergent economic policies.

Instead of simply assuming the “end” of neoliberalism, I explore the potential ideological and communicative affinities between neoliberal political rationality and online media practices that exemplify the emboldening of racist, misogynistic, and authoritarian discourses. I ground the argument by examining how the notion of social justice has been articulated in two distinct contexts: in disparaging representations of “social justice warriors” that originally circulated in “alt-right” sub-cultures, but which have since been increasingly mainstreamed, and in the critique of social justice formulated by the neoliberal theorist Friedrich Hayek. After clarifying my core argument about neoliberalism and the far right, I end by reflecting on how the figure of the social justice warrior has also been a site of intra-left antagonisms.</jats:p>",

This article examines the case of anti-caste activism, especially in the context of its transnational potentials which have blossomed with the ubiquitous uptake of digital technology worldwide. We examine anti-caste activism in the US through the work of Equality Labs, an anti-caste civil rights organization that works with digital and non-digital activist strategies. Analyzing a range of material including surveys and reports, online chatter, and journalistic discourse we show how the organization’s work is part of a larger, transnational network of anti-caste activism—something we term the anti-caste alter-network.</jats:p>",

This affirms tokenism and the government’s feigned commitment to gender parity. Reckoning that women’s political participation should augment their political representation, this article interrogates the political communication tactics of selected women in politics and non-state actors who fought for the bills. By engaging methods of critical analysis and reconstructive argumentation, we use the concept of “Feminist African Political Communication” (Feminist Afropolicom) to: (1) foreground African communicative experiences and tactics adopted by the women; (2) interrogate how tokenism trumps women’s political communication; and (3) examine how such tactics address questions of agency, space, and power.</jats:p>",

Queer communities are particularly affected by these processes; therefore, it is crucially relevant to research transnational digital projects that involve them. In the Wikidata Gender Diversity (WiGeDi) project, we are looking at practices of gender representation in the Wikidata knowledge base, a collaborative online project managed by a worldwide community. Working from the idea that gender is a complex social construct, we investigate how the Wikidata community has approached the complex issue of modeling and populating gender data, progressing from a very narrow interpretation of gender as a binary to a representation that is more inclusive of a multiplicity of gender identities.</jats:p>",

Drawing on a qualitative analysis of Asian Australian beauty vlogger Tina Yong’s vlogs, I explore how national, ethnic, and racial identities are negotiated through platform logics, commercial imperatives, and community participation. Yong’s vlogs offer tangible ways to narrate the mundane, everyday experiences of Asian Australian identity that are underrepresented in mainstream Australian media. At the same time, Yong’s self-representation is made legible through her engagements with the commercialized beauty vlogosphere and her transnational audience, which tend to reduce the potential for illuminating hybrid and culturally specific Asian Australian experiences, communities, and politics. While Yong’s vlogs generate productive dialogue on race/ethnicity and race-based affinity communities, platform and commercial logics hinder her representational capacity as an Asian Australian subject who is doubly marginalized within the global beauty vlogosphere.</jats:p>",

We argue that Kū Kiaʻi Kahuku’s livestreaming inspired movement within the space of digital connectivity, a civic rhythm, forging symmetry and reciprocity within sociospatial ties. Moanan peoples inscribed within social media a distinct Moanan rhythm. In this case, the vibrations of the protecting, an affectively charged tā, engaged the community and diaspora in a moment of rupture—opening up a space for symmetry within the dissymmetry of colonial capitalism.</jats:p>",

This article examines the ways in which Modi’s celebritized politics is strategically constructed and performed, honing in on Modi’s utilization of media, technology, and popular culture.

We look at these violent white women as Smith &amp; Wesson feminists, empowered by whiteness and their capacity for physical violence and death. As refigurations of the mythical Atalanta, their fighting power is understood as part of a feminine arsenal for managing romantic or sexual partners. This is a particular kind of white (post)feminism, prominent in the US and Canada, that may be empowering on some level, but only to the extent that women are enabled to enjoy the privileges of and assist in policing the boundaries of white heteropatriarchy. In addition to buttressing the alliance between whiteness and heteropatriarchy, it rationalizes intimate partner violence and other forms of violence, including state sanctioned violence, against women who fight back.</jats:p>",

Thus, on a global scale, the public health crisis has been converted into various spectacles of ostensible border “crisis.” Rather than seeing borders as purely a matter of control, however, it is instructive to situate the tactics of border enforcement in relation to the primacy, autonomy, and subjectivity of human mobility. If we start from the human freedom of movement and recognize border enforcement as a reaction formation, various tactics of border policing can be seen to introduce interruptions that temporarily decelerate cross-border mobilities. Compelled to revert to a kind of “standby” mode, migrants are temporarily immobilized and must find ways to convert their waiting from “dead time” into more or less productive time. Waiting to be re-activated, their mobilities remain an intractable and always potentially disruptive constitutive power.</jats:p>",

It analyzes Twitter-networked interactions as FemCo was unexpectedly thrust into hypervisibility when asked to endorse Peter Obi, the Labor Party’s presidential candidate, despite prior criticism of their #EndSARS activism. Employing close feminist reading and social network analysis of Twitter data, informed by a contextual feminist/computational approach, this article explores how processes of unpredictable digital intimacies and virtual backstabbing unfold when feminist political subjects are exploited by opposing clusters online. Investigating how affects circulate and transform feminist political subjects into bodies of hate/value, this article sheds light on the affective contexts of political communication in Nigeria, beset by a range of actors, including, activists, influencers, and citizen-users, wielding central power.</jats:p>",

With a vibrant social media following, the Nap Ministry builds upon a strong history of Black feminist activism that centers the lived experiences of Black women. According to Hersey, rest is personal and political, a fight against the commodification and exploitation of laboring Black folks from chattel slavery to contemporary grind and hustle culture. This article explores how Hersey builds upon a lineage of Black women’s activism in digital spaces while also exploring rest, “soul care,” and communal healing as ideologies rooted in Black (cyber)feminism. I argue that Nap Ministry constellates Womanism, Black (cyber)feminism, and Black liberation theory by promoting the power of rest, encouraging resistance against what bell hooks describes as the “imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy” that exploits Black women’s labor and renders their voices invisible.</jats:p>",

The group is identified as alternately exemplifying and challenging neoliberal logic and the article considers the relationship between neoliberalism and different forms of cosmopolitanism. The cosmopolitan ethos fostered by the group’s founder and reinforced through members’ practice offers preliminary but hopeful evidence of a cosmopolitanism that challenges neoliberalism and the uneven distribution of cultural/economic capital.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article examines the representation of same-sex attracted women in contemporary Thai culture by using the television series Club Friday To Be Continued: She Changed (2016) as the prime example. The show’s portrayal of the tomboy protagonist is not uncontroversial, given that her unfolding love for a man betrays the tomboy’s original self-identity as a woman-loving woman. It invokes the heteronormative specter that sees female homoeroticism as temporary or situational while same-sex attracted women will turn “straight” so long as they meet the right men. This article, however, urges us to look beyond the seeming political incorrectness and focus on the changing signification of “tomboy” in the Thai culture. I argue that the series dramatizes the expanded meaning of tomboy: now detached from a firm association with female homoeroticism (tom) to become a form of women’s gendered self-fashioning (tomboyism) that is mediated by trendy intra-Asian cosmopolitanism in contemporary Thai society.</jats:p>",

His pronouncements are often not just the taking of an ideological position, but a moral one which borders on the theological, conceptualizing the entrenchment of inequality as a normative evil. It is a form of activism where he uses his platform to exhort his audience to fight back against large, impersonal forces that he portrays as taking advantage of them. This article analyzes the program’s mentions of the institutional effects of these policies on individuals and the economy and how mainstream media sources have either amplified or ignored his claims. “Serious” journalism is more likely to cover his stories that have simple, dramatic villains rather than complex causes.</jats:p>",

Such approaches leave to the periphery ambiguities and inadvertent forms of participation that characterize recent concerns about misinformation, disinformation, and manipulation. This article argues that content that has been labeled as “propaganda” or “fake news” can be seen as wicked content: content that, by its circulation, signals the presence of wicked problems. As an implication of wicked content, this article argues for a sensitizing conceptualization of the term “propaganda” as an index of whether an observer considers the power exerted through media over matters of public relevance to be legitimate.</jats:p>",

While Ali has been celebrated for increasing South Asian representation in Korean media, we contextualize his portrayal through the lens of Korean multiculturalism. In doing so, we consider how the representation of Ali reflects the conditional acceptance of migrant men established by state-led Korean multicultural policies and politics. Through a close reading of the conditions that humanize Ali as both worthy of sympathy and unequal to his Korean counterparts, we argue that Ali’s acceptance hinges upon his relation to Korean protagonists in ways that further a vision of ethnocentric nation-building through the racialization of dark-skinned masculinity.</jats:p>",

Through the lens of Foucauldian bio-politics, the study explores how discursive practices surrounding family planning policy are manipulated to sustain authoritarian rule, linking it with loyalty to the state and fostering an anti-feminist support base that attributes collective feminist movements to “excessive education.” The “optimization” of the family planning policy is analyzed as a discursive construct that conceals dehumanizing policies reducing women to mere reproductive machines, and portraying children solely as future labor force. This paper argues that the digital feminist movement in China is sustained by women’s constant engagement with, and resistance against official narratives that co-opt feminism to serve the state’s bio-political agenda of managing and controlling the female body.</jats:p>",

Combining analysis of the show’s episodes with archival research and interviews with The Emerald City co-producer Steven Bie, this article argues both for the potential of public access to produce liberatory affective experiences of pride, as well as its role in idealizing a gay imaginary of New York limited by racialized and classed hierarchies.

My analysis presents three related sources of evidence: user-generated content satirized by the Cosas de Whitexicans account, political cartoons that reference the term, and celebrity posts that use the term in anti-racist activism or that express backlash against it. Through this analysis, I demonstrate an emergent vernacular conception of Whiteness connected to yet distinct from US–European contexts and illustrate how online media interactions continue to shape the process of racialization in different national contexts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The public discourse surrounding obesity in the United States reveals a great deal about contemporary cultural tensions and anxieties. In this essay, I assess that discourse as shaped by and in contemporary mainstream media. I argue that the obese body serves as a field on which broader tensions relevant to consumption, which prominently characterize this historical moment in the U.S., are reflected, negotiated, and rationalized. Specifically, the obese body has both prompted discourse regarding consuming patterns and practices and mobilized the discourse of neoliberalism by engaging key cultural imperatives of citizenship—namely, privacy, individualism, and freedom. This rhetorical crafting of and by the obese body has significant cultural implications, as well as theoretical implications for the relationship between body and discourse.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the spring of 2014, the consumer virtual reality (VR) industry has once again been racing to reach the public, providing an opportunity to track an emerging medium’s cultural integration in real time. We examined three sites on the sales chain that stretches from the laboratory to the living room: industry developer conferences, industrial prototypes, and end-user experiences. At each of these sites, marketers renegotiate VR’s novelty in order to sell it to specific constituencies. Paradoxically, these negotiations reveal how VR, typically presented as a disruptive innovation, has been called upon to stabilize and ensure the continuity of the past: that is, of particular cultural forms and of the industrial and technological infrastructures that sustain them. We argue that the enculturation of VR demonstrates that the processes that summon new technologies and construct them as novel also reinforce existing—and often unspoken—agreements about the ways that culture should be organized.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Hook and Eye",
    "abstract": "In her voiceover narration during episode 5, “Faithful,” The Handmaid’s Tale’s main character Offred (Elisabeth Moss) recalls a poem she once read: “You fit into me like a hook into an eye. / A fish hook. / An open eye.” The poem’s first line reads like a declaration of love, using a simile to compare the design of a hook-and-eye closure to the compatibility of lover and speaker; we can read it as a sexual metaphor or, more figuratively, signaling comfortable companionship. As Jes Simmons (1993) points out, the most common use of such a closure is on the back of a bra, making it particularly familiar (and occasionally vexing) for women readers (p. 259). However, the next two lines abruptly reverse the meaning of the first, creating a repugnant image. Employing wordplay to link a romantic relation with a violent one, the poem mirrors the traumatic social transformation the characters in The Handmaid’s Tale endure, from a society that sanctions romantic love to one in which fertile surrogates are ritually raped by elite men. Like many successful works of art, the poem produces pleasure through the fresh and bracing way it plays on language; similarly, the series telegraphs its political meanings by way of its visual style. I’d like to look more closely at the way The Handmaid’s Tale addresses the question of the eye and how it can be hooked, bearing in mind the poem’s jarring imbrication of romance with violence. In adapting the source novel to television, the series must find ways to “hook” the viewer, to draw her into the character’s world: it coerces viewers to watch its horrors and rewards them with its aesthetic accomplishments. The Handmaid’s Tale constructs an affective scenario in which we accompany Offred through the early stages of transition from contemporary U.S. society to the authoritarian theocracy of Gilead.",

This article examines how the borders of Italian identity have been gradually stretched and challenged in the music of contemporary artists such as Mahmood, Ghali, and Amir Issaa. Through their beats, their lyrics, and, in the case of Issaa, his writing, these artists have given voice to a facet of Italianness that is rarely spotlighted in the media. In this sense, these cultural productions complicate the Italian collective memory by adding a layered understanding of contemporary identities, rooted in different cultures, speaking different languages, and embracing a way of being Italian that is looking to the future through the lens of the country’s colonial past.</jats:p>",

Further, this article attempts to move us to the Global South by calling attention to media objects and the mediated lives that function through those objects, that have not received any place in media history. Nor are they recognized as a media object. The basic questions that this article raises are: (a) what happens to our understanding of media’s development when we complicate the temporality (North Atlantic Western) through which we narrate the history of media, and (b) What happens to our understanding of what media is when 24/7 electrification is not taken as a norm in our recognition of a media or technology object. What other media objects and mediated lives might then become visible?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Amid a rapidly growing wave of anti-neoliberal protest emerging in late 2019, Chile’s government scrambled to respond to the massive scale of this dissidence by attempting to find some external agent to pin the blame on. Initially seeking evidence of Venezuelan or Russian involvement, the state eventually pinned the blame on K-pop as an agent of “social rupture.” This article examines this framing of K-pop by Chilean authorities and what this says about the position of Korean media’s integration into a Latin American pop-culture landscape that is growing ever more globalized and non-Western. It likewise examines the contestatory embracing of K-pop by Chilean anti-neoliberal activists, their broader integration of globalized cultural objects, and how this reflects on wider current anti-neoliberal activist cultures operating in the Global South.</jats:p>",

The hyper-lean storyline that streamlined all the indulgences of Steven Soderbergh’s original transformed the franchise into a spectacle for women. The goal of this article, then, is to examine how MMXXL’s sonic and visual structures create the resonance that then translates to pleasure and a more holistic kind of representation for female viewers. By exploring how this film deploys not only the visual cues of beautiful male bodies to create bodily responses in its largely female audience but also querying how the sound cues create sonic visibility, I aim to illustrate how MMXXL enables women viewers from a cross section of intersectional identities the opportunity to not only feel seen but also desired.</jats:p>",

    "title": "An “Arranged Love” Marriage: India's Neoliberal Turn and the Bollywood Wedding Culture Industry",
    "abstract": "In the last decade of the 20th century, coinciding with India's economic deregulation, the Hindu wedding became a core attraction in popular Indian cinema. Weddings in real life, in turn, became more elaborate organized by a wedding industry, which professionalized and commodifed work that was previously done by an informal economy or outside of it by members of the family. Evoking the Frankfurt School, this paper locates the big wedding as a product of the emerging Bollywood culture industry and its ideological redefinition of nationalism/citizenship as both acts of consumption and the re-enactment of patriarchal and caste-based identities. Challenging the explanatory power of the notion of hybridity and its rejection of “totalization” narratives, the paper asks for a reconsideration of the meta-narratives of class and gender, capital and patriarchy to understand the ways in which global capital is most intimately experienced and lived.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article analyzes paratextual strategies deployed by Taylor Swift in her transition from country to pop in the context of her articulation of her authorship as a female songwriter. This was a transition complicated by the gendered hierarchies of pop music, wherein male producers carry significant discursive weight. The article frames the “Voice Memos” included with her 2014 album 1989 as a form of paratextual feminism, reiterating the authenticity she developed as a country star and pushing back against claims her collaboration with male producers like Max Martin and Ryan Tedder threaten her autonomy as a female voice in the music industry. However, the article goes on to consider how these and other paratextual feminisms are inherently tied to neoliberal values of post-feminism, demonstrating that their potential as a gendered critique of the media industries is limited by the lack of actualization within Swift’s broader star text and industry practice.</jats:p>",

However, the franchise has been critiqued for the lack of racial diversity in its contestant pool. This article examines the racialized and gendered logics of representation that frame the casting of the first black Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay. This article discusses the industrial conditions of possibility at the ABC network that led to Lindsay’s casting in 2017, which center on the cultivation of diversity in primetime programming. Yet the courting of a black female lead is done without a commitment to the specificities of targeting a black woman to be at the forefront of the competition to find love. This article details the construction of the African American female lead’s romantic journey and audience response at the intersections of race, gender, and the cultural politics of desire.</jats:p>",

Given the increase in right-wing political “news” sites as originators of trolling activity and their propensity to espouse anti-intellectualism, we are interested in understanding more deeply how particular instances of this targeted outrage become rhetorical. Our analysis reveals how metaknowledge circulates misinformation through commentary that carries anti-intellectual ideologies rapidly across time and space. This process of detachment reveals important implications about the (re)production of anti-intellectual ideologies, the evocation of collective outrage that manifests as sexism and transphobia, and the gatekeeping of academic knowledge production.</jats:p>",

Martin has developed a particularly loyal following among black millennials, many of whom were too young to watch the show during its original network television run. In this article, I explore the series’ representations of black women through individual and focus group interviews with 26 black viewers. My interviews reveal that participants have ambivalent relationships with the show. While several cite Martin as their favorite show of all-time, they were disturbed by the show’s troubling depictions of black heterosexual romantic relationships and its reliance on stereotypical representations of black women.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Crossing Boundaries: New Media and Networked Journalism",
    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that today’s news media are changing radically. New forms of what is coming to be known as ‘networked journalism’ are increasingly visible. These new forms of journalism raise many ethical issues not the least because, as we argue in this paper, they encourage new forms of boundary crossing on a scale not possible until recently. We suggest that these developments contain the seeds for the possibility to better understand differences and distinctions among people, but that they also heighten the possibilities for misunderstanding. Networked journalism does not yet provide a fully open space for dialogue. However, as journalists take on new roles and more voices are heard, there is a growing need to understand the implications of the new forms of boundary crossing that are being encouraged by this new form of journalism. Emerging forms of journalism may provide a foundation for public dialogue that enables stories about distant others to be told and better understood. The consequence may be that there will be new opportunities for enhanced sharing of viewpoints. Although convergent media platforms create opportunities for new exchanges, there are reasons to question whether the potential will be met.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this article, I investigate how two paintings—Big Baby Balam and Danza Ocelotl—represent the potential for embodied reclamation for Chicanas/os. Through these paintings, the artist Yreina D. Cervántez situates her body as a site for decolonization through a process which I describe as embodied reclamation. In decolonizing her body and situating her body as a site for decolonization, Cervántez represents the body as a physical and material location that was colonized and can be reclaimed. This article extends decolonial theories to discuss embodied reclamation, which reconceptualizes the body as a physical site for reclamation rather than colonization. I am looking at the way these paintings represent a wrestling with embodied identity, and from that I call for more work exploring the “art of identity” as a strategy of self-making in contexts where particular bodies are Othered and brutalized.</jats:p>",

In this article, I examine 51 such videos and argue that the visual of a minority male made abject reifies state might while building an aesthetic of peacefulness that Western Muslims are compelled to demonstrate.

Even as California debates halting oil extraction, the Biden administration approved large new drilling projects on federal land, in keeping with the United States’ policy of “energy independence” (also called “energy dominance” under Trump). This article examines the Janus face of fossil fuels’ future, reading recent cultural moments in the western US. It shows oil producers (oil lobbyists and oil workers) appropriating acts of signification that affirm life (in particular, in domains of civil rights and environmental justice), inverting language and aesthetics of liberation and resistance to circulate microfascist petroleum supremacy. Such projections of strength may belie a moment of existential precarity for the industry, but these weaponized cultural significations still aim to do harm.</jats:p>",

Many accused the NFL of using the celebrity reputation of Roc-Nation founder, Jay-Z, for cultural capital to recoup from the negative press received following the 2016 protest of Colin Kaepernick. This article examines the media discourse following the announcement of the partnership and how it perpetuates a long-existing ideological feud within Black social justice that questions if the path to racial progress must be achieved with the help of white institutions. I argue that the adoption of neoliberal ideologies into contemporary activism has shifted focus from the needs of the communities being served to the brand image and market profits of celebrity activists and corporations.</jats:p>",

We argue that these affordances encompass the gendered transactions, negotiations within sociocultural contexts, and politics of censorship (state, platform, and self-censorship). To do so, we highlight the self-reflexive practices of creators and their commercialized social life that shape content creation, commissioning, circulation, and popularization of India’s platform productions. Through illustrative examples we demonstrate that Indian content creators are deeply influenced by social, political, and gendered interactions across both local and global networks within Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Digital India’s various converging, overlapping and interconnected new media industries.</jats:p>",

Our study details how this grassroots feminist uprising faced an attempted co-optation by a monarchist Coalition’s rhetoric of unity for regime change. Through an analysis on X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram, we illustrate how apolitical influencers center Man, Homeland, Prosperity (MHP), a far-right mantra alongside WLF to perpetuate a patriarchal Persian nationalism. Given that language and hegemonic politics are closely intertwined, we argue that MHP is WLF’s ontological and epistemic opposite as it violates and oppresses the progressive ethos of a feminist movement. By invoking a sense of nostalgia for a glorious and imperial past (God, King, Homeland), Reza Pahlavi and his Coalition reproduce discourses of a populist, romantic, and patriarchal nationalism around the Persian identity. While WLF is committed to a pluralistic “solidarity,” MHP revolves around a monolithic “unity.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>By examining digital representations of motherhood, we can chart the emergence of what I refer to as the “digital maternal gaze,” a style of visual and narrative representation that highlights connections between mother and self, mother and child, and mother and audience. In contrast to the conventional male gaze, in which pleasure is derived from voyeuristic observation, the digital maternal gaze generates and depicts the pleasure that comes from connection and care. In this article I develop a theory of the digital maternal gaze and explore its implication for the subjective experience of mothers, the markets for digital representations of motherhood, and the feminist politics of pleasure-in-connection.</jats:p>",

This article explores digital expressions of retreat, refusal, remixing, and reclamation which are central to diasporic feminist practices. We analyze three illustrative digital practices via two vignettes: (1) Quote tweets and digital anonymity as expressions of subaltern excess; (2) diasporic meme culture as a callout praxis of refusal; and (3) digital opacity as feminist retreat and reclamation of time, interiority, and intimacy. Throughout our analysis we incorporate reflections on the contours of “diasporic feminist excess” and the parameters of public, private, and personal spaces. Overall, by extending the vocabularies of feminist commoning to include certain digital diasporic feminist practices, we conceptualize the fluid and fraught ways that contrapublic discourses move in, between, and beyond, digital publics.</jats:p>",

Respondents employed various coping mechanisms to navigate the impact of such offenses while simultaneously grappling with the dissonance arising from negotiating alienating rhetoric and their own cultural identities. Criticism of cultural appropriation incidents was met with severe backlash, particularly exacerbating the marginalization faced by Native American fans who encountered underrepresentation and limited support. Drawing attention to the paradoxical interplay of globalization and ethnic nationalism in Korea, this research unveils a troubling cycle in which incidents of cultural appropriation in K-pop silence and render fans of color invisible within hostile environments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic greatly exacerbated already existing disparities for women in the academy (Guy & Arthur, 2021; Hayden & Obrien Hallstein, 2021; Sills, 2020). This is seen most prominently for mothers of infants, toddlers, or school-aged children who are expected to take on the bulk of childrearing and maintain their academic prowess. Institutional efforts to stop the tenure clock may do little to help these women “catch-up” or address the fact that they are more likely to fall behind their male counterparts. Even still, such accommodations do not change the fact that delaying tenure and/or promotion will increase pay inequities. For contingent women faculty, such a blow to productivity may halt the ability to secure long-term employment. These gaps have reached every corner of academe and threaten the future of the professoriate and our discipline. Women in academia are forced to choose between having a successful career and being a good mother. Or they are expected to perform the idea that they can “have it all.” The pandemic has made this discourse more evident. As a cisgender white woman in a heteronormative partnership, I am privileged in many ways and am able to escape the harsh realities of racism, neoliberal multiculturalism, and poverty that have disproportionately impacted BIPOC and international faculty on U.S. campuses. In some ways, I can ride the pandemic wave and appear unscathed on the other end. Yet, as a mother who struggles with an anxiety disorder and moderate depression, COVID-19 was mentally destructive. When I was visibly pregnant, my colleagues would tell me how lucky I was to be taking a “sabbatical” after my maternity leave. They used air quotes. They assumed I was not taking a sabbatical, but rather, an extended maternity leave. Both my maternity leave and sabbatical were deep privileges afforded to me and yet, the gendered expectation that I temporarily leave the workforce to set up house was sexist. In each of these encounters, I would respond with frustration, thinking to myself that none of my male colleagues would be accused of taking a “sabbatical.” I had a",

An archaeological approach to infrastructure posits that media infrastructures do not spring into action fully formed, and neither is there ever a moment when they would be fully formed. We propose the perspective of deep time of infrastructures as a way of opening up unresolved questions about what critical researchers can and should do with historically-informed inquiry of media technologies across migration contexts. We specifically operationalize the deep time of media and migration infrastructures by addressing the three dimensions of: (1) materialities; (2) practices; and (3) imaginaries.</jats:p>",

The case of one district government, which partnered with a large, corporate food delivery platform is explored here to investigate the platform functionalities that were the most useful to the local government. My exploration highlights how the developmental state mobilized commercial platforms for their constituent socio-technical infrastructural elements. What happens when corporate platforms are unexpectedly ushered into the realm of public values? Addressing this question, I argue that the government’s instrumental re-tooling of the private sector’s platforms to manage a public emergency contests absolute formulations of corporate platform power.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The release of Coco in 2017 came as a cultural reaffirmation for many Mexicans who have previously seen themselves represented in animation as heavily-accented maids or comedic sidekicks included to forward the narrative of the White hero. Coco brought to screen the first animated Disney feature film with a Mexican protagonist. If previous animated Latinx representation has consistently relied on the same repeated archetypes (bandidos, bad hombres, machos, the constantly pregnant Latina, etc.), Coco took a different approach: celebrating mestizaje and contradictions of Mexican identities, and embracing a culturally nuanced portrayal of Mexicanidad. We explore how exactly those contradictions and paradoxes happen, and what they mean for the affected community. We argue that Coco subverts negative, narrow stereotypes by highlighting the complexities of Mexicanidad, while simultaneously paving the way for improved Latinx representation in children’s animation.</jats:p>",

By employing cluster criticism analysis of the Korean health authorities' official reports, I argue that Korean health authorities discursively construct their ICT-based tracking infrastructure as democratic technologies of control. They also position Korean citizens as data subjects entitled to the right to know about vitality and caring subjects responsible for the vitality of others through their provision of data, an exchange which this paper terms as vital dataveillance.

The issue includes five research articles that, collectively, address research gaps in studies of post-2010 Chinese televisual-cultural discourses to do with ethnic minority women, women’s media authorship, women’s extramarital romance, and national heroines of the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose novel focuses for examining women’s plural roles and subjectivities on and off the TV screen. We thus call for complex understandings that move beyond the predominant attention of existing scholarship on conventional depictions of women as (virtuous) wives, (good) mothers, (inspirational) female professionals or heroines, and masculine feminist girls. Instead, this special issue sheds light on the polyvalent and contested positionality of Chinese women as gendered, ethnicized, (trans)nationalized, and romanticized subjects during a (post-)globalization and (post-)pandemic age.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent discussions on “decolonizing” knowledge production have often foregrounded the importance of centering “marginal” perspectives, which is crucial but insufficient as it risks leaving the canon untouched. Jürgen Habermas’ book on the bourgeois public sphere is one of the most frequently cited and debated canonical texts in media and communication studies. Drawing on the case of London’s coffee houses and newspapers, this article argues for a critical re-engagement with canonical thinkers. It examines what the emergence of a bourgeois public sphere in 17th- and 18th-century England looks like if we re-read it within the context of slavery and the slave trade. The article demonstrates that race does not simply provide another “prism” to examine the bourgeois public sphere but instead enables and is constitutive of it. The reproduction of canonical silences through the continued circulation of influential texts has implications for how we conceptualize racialized publics in contemporary times.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In 2014, former cheerleaders from five separate National Football League (NFL) teams in the United States sought legal reparations for wage theft and gender-based harassment. Within these claims, the women sought to bring to light the culture of fear, mistreatment, and silence that they experienced while working within the NFL. Using reports on these lawsuits as a case study, this study critically examines the sensemaking strategies rooted in postfeminist sensibilities and constructed through Whiteness. In particular, through identifying three paradoxes—victim/accomplice; normalization/sensationalism; objective/subjective—we offer a critique of mediated sensemaking that is organized in and around postfeminist discourses of choice, sexuality, and subjectification. Theoretically, we engage Weick’s theory of sensemaking, while offering new insights into the nuanced ways in which gender-based harassment is discussed.</jats:p>",

Clicks are figured as communicative gestures that platform engineers decode and analyze as part of ongoing experiments for refining algorithms and interface design.

However, we also interrogate the political possibilities of identity spaces and understand them as a symptom of what Angela McRobbie has called “the cultural politics of disarticulation.” Ultimately, we argue that the same platform affordances that allow for identity spaces to thrive also limit their political potency and we frame this within Lauren Berlant’s theorization of “cruel optimism.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Amidst worsening precarity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, this article analyzes my employment crisis to highlight the critical value of communication in solidarity efforts. My case is set in U.S. academia, where graduate assistant labor is increasingly necessary for universities to function (Kroeger, McNicholas, Wilpert, & Wolfe, 2018, January 11). However, due to their student–worker identity, graduate assistants are also vulnerable to job loss amidst contestations around their employee status and rights to unionize and collectively bargain (McNicholas, Poydock, & Wolfe, 2019, December 19). Accounting for one-third of graduate assistants (McNicholas et al., 2019, December 19), international students also face unique vulnerabilities tied to travel, citizenship, and work restrictions. These precarities surfaced during the pandemic when the United States closed borders and universities furloughed graduate assistants sheltering abroad (e.g., Redden, 2020, August 11). My experience illuminates broader job insecurities and inequalities in higher education while also drawing attention to the role of communication in solidarity efforts aimed at combatting injustices. I illustrate how communication facilitated solidarity through information exchange, action coordination, transparency mobilization, and emotional connection.",

The online discourses exemplified the dynamics of networked framing, where activists reshaped their framing of issues through crowdsourcing practices. While both sides focused their attention on defining violence and deservingness, the impact of abortion on democracy, and the appropriate geopolitical scope of the debate, they developed stark oppositional views. Supporters of legalization defined illegal abortion as state-sponsored violence against gestating people and highlighted transnational solidarities. On the other hand, pro-life users identified legal abortion as state-sponsored violence against the unborn and accused pro-abortion politicians of subverting the democratic rights of the pro-life majority. Both movements portrayed themselves as embodying reason and righteousness while projecting negative connotations onto their counterparts. Our findings provide a nuanced examination of the discursive work of Global South feminists whose advocacy shifted policy against formidable opposition.</jats:p>",

While this dominant theorization of aspirational labor is sometimes helpful for explaining the precarity of digital media labor in countries of the Global South, its uncritical application could also be severely limiting. I undertake a close textual analysis of select web shows created by the entertainment brand and YouTube content creators The Viral Fever (TVF) to demonstrate how it would be imprecise to see them as just victims of an exploitative economy. My article shows how TVF web shows consistently imagine elaborate cinematic narratives that valorize and embody the neoliberal values of aspiration and individual growth that in turn is complicit in the machinations of platform economy’s extractive affordances.</jats:p>",

By focusing on the promotional and reception materials about a female director/producer, Yu Lei, and her authorship in National Treasure (NT), a current Chinese variety show, this article analyzes how extratextual material operates in relation to female authorship in Chinese television. By examining how gender politics are incorporated in the construction of female authorship, we identify the problematic aspects of how Yu Lei’s authorship is framed, which serve to promote neoliberal postfeminist ideas of women’s empowerment and are bound up with current iterations of official neonationalist ideology. While acknowledging its limitations, we argue that Yu Lei’s position as a woman in a male-dominated industry who has substantial visibility in media and enjoys some authority over a TV production still constitutes noteworthy if only partial agency.</jats:p>",

Its case study is an artwork that creates a data visualization from social media analytics related to American Idol, America’s Got Talent, America’s Next Top Model, and America’s Best Dance Crew. Using discourse analysis, the article unpacks how the installation establishes connections between televised contests, social media activity, and U.S. national identity. The author argues that the installation predicates its critique of reality television and social media on collapsing the differences between disparate programs, animating hierarchies of taste between various publics, and simplifying emergent industry practices related to big data.</jats:p>",

However, this usage faced fierce criticism, particularly due to complex tensions surrounding racial and ethnic identity, solidarity, and history. This article critically evaluates these tensions and the meaning behind BAME through 10 interviews with activists working in the field of British race relations. My principle focus amid this debate revisits the foundations of the term BAME, which, I argue, is rooted in the rise and fall of Political Blackness. Additionally, I examine the broader strategic purposes of BAME as well as emphasize the importance of colorism within our discussions of racialization in Britain. Ultimately, this discussion seeks a richer account of our current climate around ethnic identification that considers both the potential and the limits of the term BAME.</jats:p>",

I instead explore the political utility of agentic reclamations and negotiations of queer/trans identity by marginal queer/trans users. At the same time, drawing on participant experiences of content moderation, censorship, and corporate and state surveillance, I examine how the potentials of Instagram as a site to mediate articulations of a radical politics of queer liberation are restricted, thwarted, and reconfigured by platform design and policing.</jats:p>",

Processes of othering, the identification of a set of ideological enemies, fear mongering and a type of populism that articulates “the people” in a very exclusionary manner characterize this discourse. Even though journalists tend to be critical of the extreme right discourse, they are also to some extent complicit in amplifying the extreme right discourse and providing a platform for populist politicians using a politics of provocation. It is argued that public journalism tradition might be a productive resource to combat this mainstreaming of extreme right discourses and protect democratic values.",

Framed by media, policy makers and academia as “suspects”, members of this silenced overrepresented minority are dual distancing themselves from the stigmatizing radicalization-label and perceived radicalized individuals.

Although most research on such workers focuses on careers birthed by social media (i.e., influencers, YouTube creators), many cultural producers work in legacy industries where traditional and platformized practices coexist, come together and influence each other (i.e., publishing, music, film). Both groups—born-digital and “confluencers”—must negotiate precarious labor conditions, but confluencers can draw on both digital and pre-digital networks and traditions to do so. This project shows how one such group—indie romance authors—draws on its history to create collective imaginaries regarding Kindle Unlimited (KU). These imaginaries offer an emergent, if weak, base of resistance to Amazon’s platform power. I contribute to literature on platformized cultural production by: (a) distinguishing among groups of platformized producers; and (b) showing how historic context informs strategies for negotiating platform power.</jats:p>",

Researchers have recently begun to apply the advertisement-based framework to a new context: user-generated social media photos. Despite findings that gender display appears prevalent in such images, deeper critical examinations of how the framework changes when applied across media contexts have not been meaningfully undertaken. Drawing from the interplay of Goffman’s concepts of hyper-ritualization and commercial realism, I argue that the manifestations and interpretive implications of gender display are contingent upon the standard of realism at play, proposing a standard of networked realism that differently modulates gender display in user-generated photography. Ultimately, I suggest that gender display must be more thoroughly contextualized in networked media research and provide a groundwork for future feminist studies of visual gender stereotyping.</jats:p>",

Using a qualitative approach, we analyzed 74 ads from a women’s magazine from 1967 to 2021. The results reveal changing gender role discourses, showing a nuanced interplay between progressive components and neo-conservative principles across historical periods. The evolution of female-focused advertising within post-feminist narratives depicts portrayals of women isolated or alongside family, highlighting individuality but implying limited representations of collective empowerment. The findings underscore the need to analyze media messages aimed at women in shifting temporal contexts. We argue that analytical frameworks must critically assess the progression, or lack thereof, in women’s (misleading) emancipation amidst the transitions from commodity feminism to post-feminism and femvertising.</jats:p>",

By reducing media to their material forms and tracing their journey from use to disuse, the stories behind media activism start to appear. This article studies where Beirut’s media waste goes and who brings it there. A women-only beach, a refugee camp from the early 20th century, and some of the most vulnerable populations in Lebanon all exist alongside Beirut’s trash. They are part of the story of media in the Arab world because media are waste. While media activism in the Arab world is often marked by the visibility of bodies in protest, media waste in Lebanon is governed by a politics of invisibility that covers and hides the very social problems that media activism seeks to address.</jats:p>",

The photography exhibits in Rome and Sorrento anchor our study, but in order to understand more fully how they invite or reinforce cultural meaning, we evaluated these works in their larger architectural, regional, and urban contexts. We conclude that the exhibits communicate contrasting versions of italianità in order to subvert patriarchic tendencies in society, withstand globalization, challenge pan-European transnationalism, and create a strong sense of shared, yet diverse, identity by Italians, as well as manifest national pride to the visitors of the Belpaese.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This study critically examines explicit and implied romantic relationships between Asian females and White males in television advertisements, using several examples to illustrate the historical and contextual impact of these images. This interracial relationship, popularized in the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, depicts the subservient Asian female prostitute having a romantic relationship with the White male. The Asian female being subservient and romantically associated with the White male has become internalized in society today, an assumption often extending to modern relationships. The critical textual analysis of the selected advertisements will add another element to understanding and interpreting the depiction of the relationship between Asian American females and White males. \n \n \n \nLa Nueva Suzie Wong: Las Suposiciones Normativas de las Relaciones entre Los Hombres Blancos y las Mujeres Asiaticas \n \n \n \nMurali Balaji & Tina Worawongs \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste estudio examina en forma critica las relaciones romanticas explicitas e implicitas entre las mujeres Asiaticas y los hombres blancos en los comerciales televisivos, usando ejemplos para ilustrar el impacto historico y contextual de estas imagenes. Esta relacion interracial popularizada en el film de 1960 El Mundo de SuzieWong, representa a una servil prostituta Asiatica teniendo una relacion romantica con un hombre blanco. Esta mujer Asiatica servil romanticamente asociada con el hombre blanco ha sido internalizada en la sociedad de hoy, una suposicion a menudo extendida a las relaciones modernas. El analisis textual critico de los comerciales seleccionados agregara otro elemento al entendimiento e interpretacion de la representacion de la relacion entre las mujeres Asiaticas Americanas y los hombres blancos. \n \n \n \nLa nouvelle Suzie Wong : les suppositions normatives a propos des relations entre hommes blancs et femmes asiatiques \n \n \n \nMurali Balaji & Tina Worawongs \n \n \n \nCette etude examine d’un œil critique les relations amoureuses explicites et implicites entre des femmes asiatiques et des hommes blancs presentees dans les publicites televisees. Elle s’appuie sur plusieurs exemples pour illustrer l’impact historique et contextuel de telles images. Cette relation inter-raciale, popularisee par le film Le monde de Suzie Wong en 1960, montre la prostituee asiatique soumise dans une relation amoureuse avec l’homme blanc. La femme asiatique soumise et liee de facon romantique a l’homme blanc est aujourd’hui une image interiorisee dans la societe, un postulat qui s’etend souvent aux relations modernes. L’analyse textuelle critique des publicites selectionnees ajoutera un autre element a la comprehension et a l’interpretation des representations des relations entre femmes americaines d’origine asiatique et hommes blancs. \n \n \n \nDie neue Suzie Wong: Normative Annahmen zu Beziehungen zwischen weisen Mannern und asiatischen Frauen \n \n \n \nMurali Balaji & Tina Worawongs \n \n \n \nDie Studie untersucht kritisch explizite und implizite romantische Beziehungen zwischen asiatischen Frauen und weisen Mannern in der Fernsehwerbung und nutzt verschiedene Beispiele, um den historischen und kontextuellen Einfluss dieser Bilder zu illustrieren. Diese Beziehungen zwischen Rassen, welche im Film ,,The World of Suzie Wong“ von 1960 thematisiert wurden, zeigen die unterwurfige asiatische Prostituierte, die eine romantische Beziehung mit einem weisen Mann hat. Die asiatische Frau als unterwurfig und romantisch leiert mit dem weisen Mann ist in der heutigen Gesellschaft internalisiert und eine Annahme, die auf moderne Beziehungen ausgedehnt wird. Die kritische Textanalyse der ausgewahlten Werbespots erganzt ein weiteres Element um die Darstellung der Beziehung zwischen asiatisch-amerikanischer Frau und weisem Mann zu verstehen und zu interpretieren.",

Research has sought to unpack the push–pull factors and adhesive elements that exert influence on such residential configurations. This forum piece ventures to articulate empirically one such pattern that has not been approached in the literature, but has, as the title portends, been addressed in anecdote gently (read: cautiously) for some time: the link between an individual’s stated racial preference in sexual-partner choice and that individual’s selection of a neighborhood to live in that has a high percentage of residents of the preferred race.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Communication researchers from a range of methodological backgrounds are studying the relationship between communication and sexual health. The present study contributes to this line of research, offering a rhetorical history of the earliest conversations about public sexual education in the United States. By analyzing highly circulated texts from figures representing three of the major ideological positions on public sexual education in the late 19th century (i.e., supporters of vice reformer Anthony Comstock, social purists, and free-love advocates), this study identifies the discursive ground for these early conversations. More specifically, the present article demonstrates how polysemous language (i.e., language containing multiple meanings as intended by authors or interpreted by audiences) often functioned to confuse the debate about public sexual education and disguise race, class, and gender biases in legal and educational policies. This analysis offers communication scholars information about the historical antecedents to contemporary debates about public sexual education content.",

    "title": "The Giver of Life and the Griever of Death: Women in the Israeli TV Coverage of the Second Lebanon War (2006)",
    "abstract": "This article discusses gender aspects of the journalistic coverage of the Second Lebanon War by Israeli TV. The findings reveal that, in the social reality presented in the TV news during the war, women were relegated to the periphery by a complex process of exclusionary representation. Three primary subprocesses produced this exclusionary representation of women: concealing, transparency, and constructing women's presence and gendered images. This representation framed the war as “men's business,” and unjustly legitimizes as well as normalizes their marginal position in the context of the Israeli–Arab conflict. An analysis of the symbolic reality devised by the media exposes the gender and ethnic components of Israel's inclusion (and exclusion) regime. \n \n \n \nEl Dador de la Vida y el Deudo de la Muerte: La Cobertura de las Mujeres en la Segunda Guerra del Libano en la Television Israeli (2006) \n \n \n \nHagar Lahav \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste articulo discute los aspectos de genero de la cobertura periodistica de la segunda guerra del Libano en la TV Israeli. Los hallazgos revelan que en la realidad social presentada en la noticias de TV durante la guerra, las mujeres fueron relegadas a la periferia por un proceso complejo de representacion excluyente. Tres sub-procesos primarios produjeron esta representacion excluyente de las mujeres: el ocultamiento, la transparencia, y la construccion de la presencia de las mujeres y las imagenes de genero. Esta representacion enmarca a la guerra como “un asunto de hombres,” e injustamente legitimiza asi como tambien normaliza su posicion marginal en el contexto del conflicto Israeli–Arabe. Un analisis de la realidad simbolica concebida por los medios expone a los componentes de genero y etnicos de la inclusion (y la exclusion) del regimen Israeli. \n \n \n \nCelles qui donnent la vie et pleurent la mort : les femmes dans la couverture televisee israelienne de la deuxieme guerre du Liban (2006) \n \n \n \nHagar Lahav \n \n \n \nCet article traite des aspects genres de la couverture journalistique de la deuxieme guerre du Liban par la television israelienne.

Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Frauen in der sozialen Realitat der TV-Nachrichten wahrend des Krieges durch einen komplexen Prozess ausgrenzender Reprasentation an die Peripherie verdrangt wurden. Drei primare Unterprozesse fuhrten zu dieser ausgrenzenden Reprasentation von Frauen: Verschleiern, Transparenz und die Konstruktion der Prasenz der Frau und geschlechtsspezifische Bilder. Diese Reprasentation rahmte den Krieg als ,,mannliches Geschaft“ und legitimierte und normalisierte unberechtigterweise ihre marginale Position im Kontext des israelisch-arabischen Konflikts. Eine Analyse der symbolischen Realitat der Medien zeigt die ethnische und Geschlechterkomponente der israelischen Herrschaft der Inklusion (und Exklusion).",

    "abstract": "In this essay, we examined the interactions of Anakin Skywalker during moral dilemmas in the Star Wars narrative in order to demonstrate the avoidance of responsibility as a characteristic of hegemonic masculinity. Past research on sexual harassment has demonstrated a \"gray area\" that shields sexual harassers from responsibility. We explored how such a gray area functions as a characteristic of hegemonic masculinity by shielding one male, Anakin Skywalker, from responsibility for his immoral and often violent actions. Through our investigation, we found three themes integral for the construction of a gray area that helped Anakin avoid responsibility: phantom altruism, a clone-like will, and the guise of the Sith.",

    "abstract": "Televised political campaign advertising remains the most influential means for candidates to communicate with the public. One of the most closely watched political races in the United States played out on TV during the fall of 2006, matching Missouri senatorial candidates who held widely diverse ideologies yet championed very similar issues that were hot button topics nationwide. We applied symbolic convergence theory with its critical method, fantasy theme analysis (FTA), because of its facility to explore and understand meaning constructed through the convergence and competition of alternate symbolic worlds. Through this method, not previously used as a means of tracking the rhetorical visions of competing political campaign TV spots, we explain the master analogue that underpins the advertising rhetoric and offer insights into how candidates and voters make policy choices and the rationales they use to defend them. We illustrate that both the verbal and the visual narratives depict the vastly diverse rhetorical visions of the candidates and, by extension, their supporters based on opposing views of morality associated with Republican and Democratic worldviews. This study extends the reach of FTA in studying the visual signs and symbols of political advertising.",

Characterized by the emergence of post-racial discourses, an ongoing commitment to warfare, and an embrace of diversity and inclusion within the U.S. military as hallmarks of American exceptionalism, the late-stage war on terror was represented in recruiting ads as a war fought by a racially representative Marine Corps dedicated to benevolence. Identifying primary themes through which race was constructed and contested in Corps recruitment advertising between 2012 and 2016, this article makes visible the processes through which racial ideologies manifest in cultural production. Though seemingly guided by a commitment to inclusion, the production of recruitment materials consolidated Whiteness while making limited space for the representation of a racially diverse military.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This study explores the identity construction of London-based Filipinos across the media of news and karaoke. In bridging the “public knowledge project” with the “popular culture project,” I argue that the seemingly innocent social practice of singing involves raising and erasing of symbolic boundaries. As national identities are constantly flagged in everyday life, I examine how Filipino audiences negotiate multiple attachments in both media practices. From participant observation and qualitative interviews, I discover that news reception generally enables both banal nationalism and banal transnationalism, whereas karaoke functions more as a homeland-directed “high holiday.” I demonstrate how audiences weave in and out of their loyalties to British and Filipino publics across the media of British news, Filipino news, as well as karaoke.",

It surveys the scholarly conversation on the politics of American sitcoms, noting how existing research has only provided a partial accounting of conservatism in television comedy. It expands the notion of conservative comedy by considering the sitcom Last Man Standing’s (LMS) place in post-network television, an industry increasingly driven by financialization, corporate consolidation, and the tendency to treat intellectual property—i.e., television shows themselves—as commodities. Finally, it examines several key episodes from LMS centered on property ownership, financial struggle, and precarious labor. The program works to normalize conservative ideologies about these subjects, seamlessly resolving their tensions by making the wisdom of the show’s patriarch and that of free market capitalism one and the same.</jats:p>",

Drawing on scholarship in trans studies including Eva Hayward’s work on the scar as a site of trans possibility and Lucas Crawford’s examination of the relationship between architecture and trans subjectivity, I read Anatomy as one ludic form of trans worldmaking which unsettles the relationship between the trans body and the space of the house, and the relationship between the player and the act of play, invoking a trans ethos of indeterminacy that rejects coherent narratives of progression and legibility in favor of the refusal and possibility of the glitch.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The world of journalism has always been privileged—for good and bad—by the prisms through which we have recognized its parameters. In acting as more than just the provision of some kind of shared repertoire of public events, journalism can be fruitfully understood by bringing to the forefront of its appropriation the notions of communication, culture, and critique that go into its shaping. Each offers different but complementary parameters through which to think about journalism’s practice and, by extension, its study.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the 2000s, calls for de-Westernizing the international communication research have been common, but their practical result has been very modest, as the share of non-western countries remained minimal. This article explores the hypothesis that structural factors hamper the diversity in international media research, based on the analysis of the membership of journals listed in Clarivate's Journal of Citation Reports. The data demonstrate a strong unbalance in favor of the US -- and a particular group of US universities in special -- to the detriment of the non-Western countries. The article discusses these findings in reference to the emergence of academic capitalism and the global rankings logic, which is based on ``universal'' defined from a US (and secondarily Anglophonic) viewpoint. The JCR system plays an important role in this schema, as it artificially introduces scarcity in the international publishing system and, therefore, concentrates symbolic power in the hands of a few.</jats:p>",

I explore how they (re-)negotiate their racialized identities vis-à-vis Black Americans and in relation to anti-Black racism, critically reflecting on historical, discursive, and structural contexts around Whiteness, caste, and colorism. This study provides a lens into (anti-)racism among the South Asian American community, demonstrating a need for continued research into conversations around race within it and other communities of color.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article develops a critical analysis of Instagram’s influencer economy by introducing and unpacking a phenomenon we call shoppable life. The term shoppable life is intended to capture the ideas that: (a) social media users perform lifestyles whose constituent elements can be bought; and (b) sociality increasingly unfolds within platforms that encode marketplace logics and capacities into their designs. Drawing on literatures about consumer culture, celebrity, and digital labor; interviews with 25 participants in Instagram’s influencer economy; and industry texts, we elucidate the power dynamics and contradictions manifested in constructing a shoppable life. We emphasize how social media users navigate the imperative to produce an “authentic” but branded and monetizable self, the personal risk they bear in doing so, and the stakeholders who mediate and profit from these productions. We also highlight conceptual points of entry for critical attention to the logic of shoppability, which increasingly pervades spaces and cultures.</jats:p>",

It attends to how, in China, the term for “web traffic,” liuliang (流量), is utilized in rich and creative ways. Instantiating bottom-up epistemic practices, the taxonomies, collocations, and wisdom related to liuliang reveal alternative and locally relevant ways in which people imagine, apprehend, and deal with digital media and data in everyday life. They unleash a set of reinvigorating vocabulary for the theorization of web traffic—liquidity, manipulability, portability, socio-spatial differentiation, ideological valence, and mystified power, among others. These new lenses enrich a genuinely global understanding of digital media, enable those in the Global North to comparatively rethink their taken-for-granted experiences of datafication, and democratize the making of media knowledges by addressing the inequality between the Global North and South(s), between experts and non-experts.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Engaging With Media—A Matter of Literacy?",
    "abstract": "This article considers the continued relevance of critical research on audience reception and audience ethnography to today’s study of complex media and communications environment. Although much of the work addressing people’s engagement with new media is now framed not in terms of audiences but rather in terms of literacies, there are many parallels between the critical analysis of literacy and of audiences. Both examine the interface between the interpretative activities of ordinary people and the powerful institutions, texts and technologies they engage with. Both identify forms of stratification and exclusion while recognising the micro-tactics of marginalised audiences/ the digitally excluded. On the one hand, the notion of literacy offers some advantages over that of audiences, for it draws on a long history of theorising knowledge in relation to emancipation and democratisation. On the other hand, literacy occasions critical scrutiny, particularly when, as today, it is mobilised in support of by neo-liberal, deregulatory policies in the media and communications sector. Insofar as audience research directs its energies towards the analysis of new media literacies, it is vital to follow the principles of critical analysis, explicating research assumptions, scrutinising how our work is used, and asking whose interests are thereby served.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Growing identification by U.S. Latines with the Republican Party has been of interest since the 2020 presidential election, especially in South Texas. This article presents a rhetorical criticism of three Republican Latina candidates for Congress in the 2022 midterms. Utilizing Latine rhetorical criticism of their campaign ads, we identify the strategic deployment of conservative ethnic identity that disavows racialized identity through anti-immigrant rhetoric. Instead of moderating anti-immigration discourse, as has been suggested by observers on how to attract Latine voters, these candidates instead redirect the immigrant threat narrative towards other subgroups of Latines. Also key in the deployment of ethnic identity for right-wing appeals is the construction of a political persona that emphasizes traditional Latine gender roles in the service of political activism. Finally, there is a mystification of the underlying reasons for economic precarity that is nevertheless based on local histories of exploitation in South Texas.</jats:p>",

The legislation fueled mob attacks on women wearing miniskirts in public, sparking public protests documented with images of demonstrators bearing placards voicing their dissent. Unlike the traditional public sphere where gatekeeping remains pervasive and entrenched, social media’s loosely regulated platforms give interested users unabated access to issues and the public. Images, text, and hashtags play a vital role in conveying grievances. Through critical discourse analysis (CDA) relevant to communication through images, findings reveal how the circulation of protest images online shapes public opinion and legislative outcomes on contested issues such as sex, morality, and women’s rights. The images operationalize a visual grammar of resistance that negotiates and contests the meaning of women’s bodies in defiance of the repressive government.</jats:p>",

We employ a misogynoir framework to investigate the U.S. media narratives that Black women, particularly in politics, must redefine. Finding discourse on racialization, the masculinity of Blackness, and prominent misogynoir, our research sheds light on the communication surrounding Black female candidates on Twitter and their efforts to court Black male voters.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This article theorizes about how platform cooperativism is landing in Brazil, challenging dominant notions and presenting a more diverse meaning of worker-owned technologies from below. Drawing on research with platform co-ops under construction in Brazil, the article argues that, in Brazil, platform cooperativism does not necessarily present itself as either a cooperative or a platform. They are prototypes and experiments of worker-owned technologies anchored in local communities and their values. Instead of all these experiences being condensed and captured from Global North epistemic frameworks, there is the production of knowledge by the workers in search of autonomy. The article analyzes potentialities and critiques of platform cooperativism, especially from three dimensions of critique (economics, politics, and technology). It presents perspectives towards diversifying and expanding the meanings of technology in/from Latin America for understanding worker-owned technologies. It discusses two examples of worker-owned technologies: Senoritas Courier and the Homeless Worker Movement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study explores practices of digitally mediated critique and resistance at the intersection of race and religion. Drawing on theories of intersectionality, silence, erasure, and marginality, I analyze discourses from three online communities focused on Black Muslim experiences within the US. Against the backdrop of systemic anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, my analysis highlights themes related to the (re)centering of Black Muslim experiences to resist the invisibility resulting from dominant assumptions about Muslim identity. Based on these findings, I argue interrogations of unity play an important role in challenging such invisibility. I discuss the implications these findings have for theorizing the intra-categorical complexity inherent in marginalized groups and conclude by identifying future work to advance our understanding of this complexity in global contexts.</jats:p>",

However, by examining both babes’ multiplatform branded personas as technologies of self-governance under postfeminist, neoliberal brand culture, I show that the Food Babe/SciBabe case is more than a struggle over “science versus pseudoscience.” This case study illuminates a gendered double bind that is intensifying in the so-called “post-truth” era as obligations to maximize oneself and one’s family come into conflict with longstanding and deeply classed anxieties about feminized media culture.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Frozen in Time: Gender, Fan Culture, and a Young Widow’s Icy Terrain",
    "abstract": "In the opening scenes of Douglas Sirk’s 1955 melodrama All That Heaven Allows (Hunter & Sirk, 1955), the precocious, college-aged daughter of the movie’s heroine describes the ancient Egyptian custom of ‘‘walling up the widow alive in the funeral chambers of her dead husband along with his other possessions, the theory being that she was a possession, too.’’ When she adds that ‘‘it doesn’t happen any more,’’ her widowed mother, played by Jane Wyman, asks wryly, ‘‘Doesn’t it?’’ As the film depicts, metaphorical walls still circumscribe the cultural and economic spaces inhabited by widows. This occurs in particularly telling ways for those whose late husbands, and/or the manner in which they died, are public and iconic. According to Bird (1992), supermarket tabloids sanitized the image of the late President John F. Kennedy after revelations of his marital infidelity, preferring to render him as the ‘‘heroic lover’’ while intimating that his widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had driven him to it by being an insecure, overly demanding, pill-popping ‘‘bitch’’ (p. 187). A review in The New York Times reproduced popular myth when it suggested that artist‐musician Yoko Ono, widow of murdered exBeatle John Lennon, had ‘‘brainwashed’’ him into marrying her, thereby ‘‘destroying the most popular music group of the century’’ (Witchell, 1994, p. AE 1). Similarly, conspiracy theorist fans of Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain allege that his death, judged to be a suicide, was actually orchestrated by his widow, actor‐musician Courtney Love (Wallace & Halperin, 2004). The ‘‘Jersey Girls,’’ Kristen Breitweiser’s Family Steering Committee of September 11 widows, rallied to pressure the stonewalling George W. Bush administration to authorize a thorough, independent probe of the attacks (see Breitweiser, 2006). Their consequent political conversion was lambasted by the conservative punditry, most infamously by Ann Coulter (2006), who accused them of ‘‘enjoying their husbands’ deaths too much’’ and implied that said husbands would have divorced ‘‘these harpies’’ had they lived (pp. 103, 112). Less widely circulated but no less meaningful is the case of Russian figure skater Ekaterina ‘‘Katia’’ Gordeeva who, with partner and eventual husband Sergei Grinkov, dominated pairs competition throughout the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, winning Olympic Gold medals in both 1988 and 1994. Then, late in 1995, while the couple",

The music poster archive is a site to map the so-called “Chocolate City” of Washington, D.C., in the 1980s, explore its calendars, rhythms, textures, communication technology, history and movements of segregated black life. These posters advertising go-go music, the city's indigenous black popular music, asserted a territory of black economic, cultural and political power. They resisted the narrative of a sanitized “White City” designed for white tourists. The city's cultural entrepreneurs challenged false dominant narratives and public policies that marginalized black urban culture as dangerous and deviant. A crack-down on postering in the late 1990s was an early harbinger of gentrification.</jats:p>",

The annual user conventions and platform marketing of Esri, the global market leader in geographical information systems (GIS), acts as a site to observe how an imagined geospatial community of practitioners and investors is constructed. Branded content is unpacked to understand how the company’s image-making cultivates power relations between the public at large while negating itself as gatekeeper. These symbolic processes and collective practices help influence the uncritical investment and growth of the geospatial industry.</jats:p>",

As an episodic form of critical engagement, recaps provide new opportunities for emerging female writers and writers of color to comment upon television’s representational challenges and successes. As women-targeted media gains new traction in the marketplace, recaps can not only be an important vehicle for needed commentary about undervalued content, but they also may serve as a marker of the value of these programs for a historically underserved audience. Featuring interviews with five recappers and two editors from major entertainment-focused publications including The AV Club, Vulture, Vox, Hello Beautiful, Go Fug Yourself and Buzzfeed, this article explores the recap as a distinct genre with feminist potential to elevate new voices, to disrupt traditional taste hierarchies, and to embrace pleasure as a measure of quality.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Empowerment Through Endorsement? Polysemic Meaning in Dove's User-Generated Advertising",
    "abstract": "Although some have cited user-generated marketing campaigns as evidence of the “newly empowered consumer,” others have emphasized their exploitative nature. This debate becomes increasingly complicated when brought into dialog with a feminist rhetoric of empowerment, such as that underpinning a recent Dove user-generated ad contest. This paper examines how issues of power, labor, and leisure were articulated among various contest participants through interviews, analysis, and observation. Emergent from the data are themes of creativity, authenticity, and empowerment that converge and diverge. It is precisely because of the polysemic nature of these themes that the contest was able to simultaneously endorse the product, exploit participant labor, and give consumers a sense of power as individuals, as women, and as creative professionals. \n \n \n \nL'autonomie par la caution? Le sens polysemique des publicites de Dove creees par les utilisatrices \n \n \n \nBrooke Erin Duffy \n \n \n \nBien que les campagnes de marketing generees par l'utilisateur aient ete citees comme preuves du «nouveau consommateur autonome», d'autres ont souligne leur nature exploitante. Ce debat se complique lorsqu'il est mis en dialogue avec une rhetorique feministe d'autonomisation, comme celle soutenant un recent concours de publicites creees par les consommatrices pour l'entreprise Dove. A travers des entretiens, des analyses et des observations, cet article etudie la facon dont les enjeux de pouvoir, de travail et de loisir s'articulaient pour divers participants au concours. La creativite, l'authenticite et l'autonomisation emergent des donnees comme etant des themes convergeants et divergeants. C'est precisement en raison de la nature polysemique de ces themes que le concours fut en mesure de tout a la fois appuyer le produit, exploiter le travail des participants et donner aux consommatrices un sentiment de pouvoir en tant que personnes, en tant que femmes et en tant que professionnelles creatrices. \n \n \n \nEmpowerment durch Bestatigung? Polysemische Bedeutung in der nutzergenerierten Werbung von Dove \n \n \n \nBrooke Erin Duffy \n \n \n \nIm Kontext des digitalen Zeitalters der Massenkommunikation, lost sich die einstige Trennung zwischen Medienproduktion und Konsum anscheinend auf, und an dieser Stelle entsteht eine Kultur der Interaktivitat. Konsumenten nehmen nicht nur mehr an der Produktion von Nachrichten und Unterhaltung teil, sie werden auch aktiv in kommerzielle Initiativen einbezogen. Auch wenn einige nutzergenerierte Marketing-Kampagnen als Beweis fur den ,,empowerten Konsumenten“ anfuhren, betonen andere den ausbeuterischen Charakter dieses Produktionsprozesses. Diese Ausbeutungs-Empowerment-Debatte wird zudem durch die Verknupfung mit der feministischen Rhetorik von Empowerment verkompliziert, welche durch den aktuellen nutzergenerierten Werbewettbewerb von Dove verdeutlicht wird. In diesem Artikel untersuche ich mittels Interviews, Diskursanalyse und teilnehmender Online-Beobachtung, wie Aspekte von Macht, Arbeit und Freizeit von verschiedenen Wettbewerbsteilnehmern artikuliert wurden – Dove-Geschaftsfuhrer, Amateur-Werbeproduzenten und Online-Publikum. Aus den Daten ergeben sich Themen wie Kreativitat, Authentizitat und Empowerment, welche auf verschiedene Art und Weise zusammenhangen und divergieren. Genauer gesagt, lag es an der polysemischen Natur dieser Themen, dass es mit diesem Wettbewerb moglich war, zugleich das Produkt zu stutzen, die Arbeit der Teilnehmer auszunutzen und den Konsumenten ein Gefuhl von Macht als Individuen, Frauen und kreative Professionelle zu geben. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n?El Fortalecimiento del Poder a traves del Aval? \n \n \n \nEl Significado Polisemico de la Publicidad de Dove Generada por el Usuario \n \n \n \nBrooke Erin Duffy \n \n \n \nAnnenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nAunque algunos han citado las campanas de mercadotecnia generadas por el usuario como evidencia del “nuevo fortalecimiento del poder del consumidor,” otros han enfatizado su naturaleza explotadora. Este debate se hace mas complicado cuando es traido dentro del dialogo de una retorica feminista de fortalecimiento del poder, tal que apuntala una competencia reciente de un aviso publicitario de Dove generado por el usuario. Este articulo examina como estos asuntos de poder, trabajo, y placer, fueron articulados entre varios participantes de la competencia a traves de entrevistas, analisis, y observacion. Emergiendo de los datos son temas de creatividad, autenticidad, y fortalecimiento del poder que converge y diverge. Es precisamente a raiz de la naturaleza polisemica de estos temas que la competencia fue capaz de avalar simultaneamente el producto, explotar el trabajo del participante, y dar a los consumidores un sentido de poder como individuos, como mujeres, y como profesionales creativos.",

Based on accounts of industry professionals, it suggests that the digitization of the music industry in line with the logics of global streaming technologies is characterized by a spatial-temporal regime of “being behind,” which I refer to as “lag.” Lag is marked by a perpetual striving for that which is always just out of reach, and it demonstrates how streaming can act as a technology of temporal recalibration. I argue that lag is the lived experience of imperial power by showing how it is rooted in longer histories of colonial dominance and control in Egypt. Most broadly, this article suggests that theorizing digitization from the Global South invites greater attention to history and culture to avoid universalizing theories of streaming that uphold Western histories and ideologies as normative.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses two related changes in contemporary journalistic practice. First, there has been an increase in journalists’ use of technology to learn about the stories competitors and other players are working on and a parallel decrease in the reliance on face-to-face encounters with colleagues to gather this information. Second, this greater technology use has been tied to an intensification of monitoring and an expansion of imitation in the newsroom. Drawing upon an ethnographic study of editorial work in the leading online and print newspapers of Argentina, these changes are analyzed to make scholarly contributions about the role of technology in monitoring and imitation. This analysis also provides a window into the intersection of communication, culture, and critique in contemporary journalism by showing how recent forms of technological appropriation in the newsroom have shaped how journalists gather information and make meaning out if it in a way that affects their ability to be critical.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article examines and critiques digital media culture and its embedded postracial logics through the resistance strategies of Black women online. Specifically, I am interested in everyday resistance strategies as “seemingly innocuous” communication, which is understood from theorizations of “hidden transcripts” that black publics utilize to counteract dominance. In order to explore “everyday resistance” I employed focus groups with 20 Black women and present patterns of resistance strategies online, such as visual signifiers and posting news articles. Secondly, I interrogate how these resistance strategies “talk back” to and circumvent the underpinnings of digital media culture through the postracial logics of individuality and networked influence. Ultimately, Black women’s interconnected identities reveal the flaws of digital culture as postracial by demonstrating their resistance strategies that must work around any assumption of a “postracial parity.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This essay builds on research concerning networked activism, utilizing Couldry's theory of media pilgrimage to examine an activist event coordinated by a new social movement network, which was an “alternative media pilgrimage” to the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico. Using ethnographic narrative excavation, qualitative content analysis, and fantasy theme analysis, I explored resistance in testimonial narratives presented in Zapatista communities, as well as the rhetorical vision used by activists to make sense of such resistance. The research showed that the activists used a rhetorical vision based on conceptual narratives about ethical consumerism, which acted as a discursive blindfold hiding the resistance found in the Zapatistas communities and reinforced the resistance found in the alternative media world of new social movement networks.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The word activism tends to conjure different imagery depending on the institutional and geopolitical context. However, in left progressive circles it has usually connoted something challenging towards or resistant to injustice, and aligned with broadly progressive and democratic values. As recently as 2012, social media were being lauded as a new means of progressive social change in a bouquet of other tools against autocracy in the Global South. Based on original interviews over the past five years, this article outlines starkly, and from an intersectional socialist-feminist perspective, the dangers of allowing a warm fuzzy conception of activism to divert attention from the fascist politics being enacted online across vast swathes of the Global South, including in Brazil and India.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Between Public Responsibility and Public Relations: A Case Study of Editors' Attitudes Toward Media Accountability in Sweden",
    "abstract": "This article discusses the implementation and effectiveness of media accountability systems. Empirically, the article is based on a national survey of attitudes among editors-in-chief of the 24 largest Swedish newspapers. In this survey, different kinds of media accountability systems are evaluated and ranked by the editors: internal mechanisms, external activities, and cooperative systems. This case study of Swedish editors' attitudes toward different media accountability systems confirms that to some extent they prefer systems not perceived as “outside-in” regulations. When editors can pick and choose, the public relation dimension of media accountability is evident. But their ability to exclusively select accountability options becomes more limited because of media globalization trends, new technologies, and media regulatory efforts on the international level. \n \n \n \nEntre la Responsabilidad Publica y las Relaciones Publicas: Un Estudio de Caso de las Actitudes de los Editores hacia la Responsabilidad de los Medios en Suecia \n \n \n \nTorbjorn von Krogh & Lars W. Nord \n \n \n \nResumen \n \n \n \nEste articulo discute la implementacion y la efectividad de los sistemas de responsabilidad de los medios. Empiricamente, este estudio esta basado en una encuesta nacional de las actitudes de los editores en jefe de los 24 periodicos suecos mas grandes. En esta encuesta, distintos sistemas de responsabilidad de los medios son evaluados y clasificados por los editores: los mecanismos internos, las actividades externas, y los sistemas cooperativos. Este estudio de caso de las actitudes de los editores suecos hacia los sistemas de responsabilidad de los medios confirma que hasta cierto punto ellos prefieren los sistemas que no son percibidos como regulaciones “desde afuera hacia adentro.” Cuando los editores pueden elegir, la dimension de la relacion publica de la responsabilidad de los medios es evidente. Pero su habilidad para elegir en forma exclusiva las opciones de responsabilidad se convierten en mas limitada debido a las tendencias de la globalizacion de los medios, las nuevas tecnologias, y los esfuerzos regulatorios a nivel internacional. \n \n \n \nEntre responsabilite publique et relations publiques : une etude de cas des attitudes des redacteurs en chef envers la responsabilite mediatique en Suede \n \n \n \nTorbjorn von Krogh & Lars W. Nord \n \n \n \nCet article traite de la mise en œuvre et de l’efficacite des systemes de responsabilite mediatique (media accountability). Il s’appuie sur une enquete nationale au sujet des attitudes des redacteurs en chef des 24 journaux suedois les plus importants. Dans cette enquete, differentes sortes de systemes de responsabilite mediatique sont evalues et classes par les redacteurs : des mecanismes internes, des activites externes et des systemes de cooperation. Cette etude de cas des attitudes des redacteurs en chef suedois envers differents systemes de responsabilite mediatique confirme que dans une certaine mesure, ceux-ci preferent les systemes qu’ils ne percoivent pas comme des reglementations imposees de l’exterieur. Quand les redacteurs en chef peuvent faire leur choix, la dimension de la responsabilite mediatique ayant trait aux relations publiques est evidente. \n \n \n \nMais leur capacitea avoir l’exclusivite de choisir les options de responsabilite devient plus limitee en raison des tendances dans la mondialisation mediatique, des nouvelles technologies et des efforts de reglementation mediatique au plan international. \n \n \n \nZwischen offentlicher Verantwortung und offentlichen Beziehungen: Eine Fallstudie zur Einstellung von Chefredakteuren zur Medienverantwortung in Schweden \n \n \n \nTorbjorn von Krogh & Lars W. Nord \n \n \n \nIn diesem Artikel diskutieren wir die Einfuhrung und Effektivitat von Systemen der Medienverantwortung, empirisch basierend auf einer nationalen Umfrage zu den Einstellungen von Chefredakteuren der 24 grosten Zeitungen in Schweden. In dieser Umfrage wurden verschiedene Systeme der Medienverantwortung evaluiert und durch die Chefredakteure klassifiziert: interne Mechanismen, externe Aktivitaten und kooperative Systeme. Unsere Fallstudie zu den Einstellungen der Chefredakteure zu verschiedenen Systemen der Medienverantwortung bestatigt, dass bis zu einem gewissen Mas Systeme bevorzugt werden, die als ,,ausen-innen“ Regulierung wahrgenommen werden. Wenn Redakteure auswahlen, wird die Public Relations-Dimension von Medienverantwortung evident. Allerdings wird die Moglichkeit, Verantwortungsoptionen exklusiv zu wahlen, durch Medienglobalisierungstrends, neue Technologien und Medienregulationsbestrebungen auf internationaler Ebene beschrankt.",

    "title": "Commodifying Africa on U.S. Network Reality Television",
    "abstract": "Drawing on postcolonial studies, hegemony theory, Marxian commodification, and previous critiques of Africa’s portrayal in colonial narratives, Western news, and tourism advertising, this qualitative study examines Africa’s representation through January 2008 on three U.S. network reality television programs: the CBS hits Survivor and The Amazing Race and the FOX talent contest American Idol in its “Idol Gives Back” fundraiser. Specifically, I ask whether representations reveal Africa’s continued colonization via commodification in three ways: by erasing or including African specificity, by relying on static voiceless images or allowing Africans agency, and by placing American visitors in varied hybrid encounter roles revealing their complicity with or resistance to colonial and neocolonial Western dominance. As cultural mixture is a central feature commodified in these programs, the postcolonial concept hybridity is a particularly useful analytic tool. The notion of “hybrid encounter” is proposed to more accurately describe the contact represented in the texts. I argue that Africa’s representation on reality television reveals old narrative patterns as well as new ways of commodifying the continent. The programs also reinforce Western political economic dominance at a time of greatly increased tourism to developing countries alongside global product advertising aligned with the trendy lifestyle values of adventure travel.",

    "abstract": "There were 7 assassination attempts on U.S. presidents between 1973 and 2001. In this article, we critically examine coverage of each attack in The New York Times and The Washington Post , describing how the coverage employs therapeutic discourse frames that position the president as vulnerable and portray the attackers as lonely and demented outsiders. Noticing contradictions in this pattern, we also identify counter-frames, including those acknowledging the political motivations of the assassins, the diminished public sphere that is a context for those actions, and the contradictions in a legal system that denies the insanity pleas of those framed so extensively as mentally ill. Political science, psychology, and law enforcement researchers have recognized that assassination attempts are often driven by rational political and economic concerns. Our analysis thus points to the need for further research exploring therapeutic framing techniques of other instances of political violence that may discourage the public from thinking critically about protest, violence, and tragedy in the United States.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article analyzes the contemporary discourse that surrounds video games. Specifically, it confronts the rhetoric of “empathy,” which has become a buzzword in North American industry, academic, education, and media conversations about video games and their supposed power to place players into others’ shoes—especially those games created by queer or otherwise marginalized people. Scholars like Wendy Chun and Teddy Pozo and game designers like Robert Yang have spoken out against this rhetoric. Building from their writing, as well as critiques from the creators of queer independent games commonly mislabeled as “empathy games,” this article delineates the discriminatory implications of the term. Rather than simply dismissing “empathy,” however, this article unpacks it, turning to textual artifacts like news stories and industry presentations, as well as the 2016 video game Unravel (ColdWood Interactive), to deconstruct the term’s many meanings and to identity alternative (queerer) models of affective engagement with video games.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Framing Rape: An Examination of Public Relations Strategies in the Duke University Lacrosse Case",
    "abstract": "In Spring 2006, three White Duke University lacrosse players were charged with raping a Black female student from nearby North Carolina Central University at an off-campus party. Reports of the alleged crime captured news media attention, prompting a public relations campaign by Duke to maintain its image as an elite educational institution and an academic powerhouse. During the 15 months the charges were pending, the university framed its discussion in terms of reason versus emotion, with the university positioning itself as a calm voice amid diatribe and as a victim of unfair and untrue media reports. The charges ultimately were dropped. Although Duke was adept at speaking about its own integrity, it did little to discuss larger issues at play, such as sexual objectification of women, the risks of sexual violence on college campuses, and the perceptions of privilege in U.S. college athletics. In sum, Duke faced a public relations challenge that involved allegations of rape but spent little time actually discussing rape.",

However, less attention has been paid to their role within broader society. Using Brantner and Herczeg’s concept of “transcultural ethnic media,” this study identifies typologies of online English or bilingual ethnic media originating in Canada and explores their transcultural potential. A mixed methods approach, through the examination of these media’s mission statements and the analysis of interviews with media practitioners as well as news articles from New Canadian Media (NCM) and The Caribbean Camera (TCC), identifies a set of typologies (cultural, multicultural, and transcultural ethnic media) that can serve as a new conceptual lens through which ethnic media can be studied. Further, transculturality appears to primarily be a function, rather than an intention, for cultural ethnic media, and operates within and between communities for transcultural ethnic media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This article presents findings on the internet and maternal interpersonal connections in the critical ‘perinatal’ period before and immediately after childbirth. Drawing on qualitative interviews and online data from a range of digital sites, I advance the central argument that digitally mediated interpersonal connections are critical components of contemporary motherhoods, but that these ties have complex positive and less than positive nuances in the perinatal period. Unpacking this argument in three steps, I first discuss how the moral weight of motherhood in neoliberal societies, rendered particularly visible in the perinatal period, complicates a central boundary in the study of online interpersonal relationships between information and communication. Second, I note the relative significance, in emotional terms, of temporally-contained social ties in digitally mediated perinatal connections. Third, I consider how the material and emotional roles of traditionally held-to-be-important offline maternal support networks are re-negotiated, re-positioned and even bypassed through online ties.",

Second, we ask about the pertinence of these concepts in describing subaltern practices in the digital world. Third, we identify an urgent need to go beyond digital-centric research, to be attentive to the broader epidigital context from the perspective of marginalized populations. We conclude with a call to move beyond the topicalization of theories by developing new empirical and conceptual work that can represent the lived experiences of the digital subalterns, and thereby commence addressing gaps in existing epistemes.</jats:p>",

By attending to expos that showcase prison technologies and constitute “live theatres of technology” (L.

In doing so, we highlight the prison as one site of technology development and actors at technology trade shows catering to the prison and security sector as platforms for technological mediators that range from corporate prison tech companies to educators as well as representatives of the criminal justice system. The expos emerge as sites where technological development is negotiated through performative sociotechnical imaginaries of prison tech.</jats:p>",

Waisbord &amp; S. Jalfin, 2009) by examining a Mexican dubbing company and its translation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters for Latin American audiences. Gay, lesbian, and transgender characters’ identities are alternately maintained and mitigated because of industrial norms and technical constraints. While LGBT content has been censored in other national contexts, the current study demonstrates the confluence of factors that result in non-censorial manipulation of these marginalized identities in Latin America. This grounded analysis pulls from ethnographic research at the Mexican dubbing studio New Art Dub and discusses dubbing in terms of industrial practices and decision-making processes to articulate the ways local and global elements intersect. Dubbing professionals offer a point of entry to understand localization dynamics by highlighting to role of cultural mediators whose decisions can reinforce or challenge cultural expectations of LGBT people.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This paper critically examines how elderly people from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse(CALD) backgrounds in Victoria, Australia use visual-based platforms in navigating the lockdown in Melbourne, Australia. Based on conducting remote interviews among 15 participants in 2020, the findings show digital practices as integral to forge and maintain cultural identities and social connectedness. Using the mobilities perspective to interrogate digital behaviours, I coin the term ‘(im)mobile intimacy’ to articulate a sense of closeness enabled, felt and negotiated through modes of movements and stasis in and with online platforms. I contend that differential mediated mobilities and immobilities are informed by social, contextual, and technological factors, revealing the textures of affective and relational dimensions of enacting mobile intimacy. In sum, by locating both movements and stasis in digital environments, this paper sheds light on the (re)production of exclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>",

Their invitations to come make use of strikingly similar strategies: (1) the “adventurous” foreigner venturing to explore a new land; and the (2) proud, local citizen, telling the newcomer what is so special about their nation. The main goal of this study is to introduce the concepts of “hybridization” and “equalization” as powerful constructs to analyze hybridized representations of Latin American cultures and identities through nation branding. This study adds to existing research on cultural nation branding, as well as critical-cultural studies that focuses on analyses of the “Other,” outlining the limitations of branding as a mechanism to promote contested and multifaceted constructs such as countries.</jats:p>",

This study uses insights from the post-alteric frame to analyze the images of the Khitan empress Xiao Yanyan in the 2020 TV series the Legend of Xiao Chuo (LXC). It uses a critical multimodal discourse analysis of the series and viewer comments to examine three images of Xiao as her relationships with two romantic partners unfolds: the unruly and innocent child; the self-sacrificing political victim; and the pan-Chinese superheroine. Taming the great Khitan empress has created a spectacular matriarchal fiction for cosmopolitan Chinese post-feminists and endorsed the grand narrative of assimilating ethnic minorities into the building of China’s identity as a pan-Chinese “melting-pot.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Cable news has been critiqued as a problematic force that stokes partisan divides and threatens the kind of informed, civil discourse fundamental to democracy. Nevertheless, I argue that this perceived culture of incivility, or departure from traditional telejournalism practices, is in fact what allows some marginalized speakers to appropriate cable news as a space for subversive discourse. Using a Black feminist communication framework, this article analyzes how two Black women pundits—Angela Rye and Joy Reid—enact critical discord in their televisual performances. Critical discord is a discursive maneuver rooted in Black consciousness whereby pundits embrace their racial identity as a political subjectivity through which they engage a folk hermeneutic that deviates from hegemonic news values. These commentators operate as disruptors who refashion the tools of their genre—debate and sensationalism—to challenge dominant viewpoints which privilege colorblind interpretations of the news.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Pandemic Panic on the Tenure Track: Why Early Career Scholars Need Transformative Support After COVID-19",
    "abstract": "A quick look at Twitter is enough to fray my nerves these days. Peppered between joyful announcements of promotions, book contracts, and published articles are daily reminders of the pandemic’s unequal impacts. At one extreme, there is the productive-in-the-pandemic bunch. Somehow, these scholars have been able to keep up the pace with their research—sure, they are probably tired and frustrated like the rest of us, but they are still conducting analyses, writing consistently, and submitting and publishing their work where it counts. Then, there are my people— the staying-aﬂoat-during-the-pandemic bunch. Most of us quietly lurk and some-times like, share here and there, and maybe occasionally mock the productive bunch just a little, mostly because we are envious. Pandemic-induced anxiety in ac-ademia is at an all-time high and there are reasons for some of us to panic. Overall, college enrollments in fall 2020 were down 2.2% (Causey et al., 2020), institutions announced massive furloughs (Whitford, 2020), and some colleges facing pan-demic-era budget shortfalls closed permanently (Aspegren, 2021). As institutions respond to revenue losses, much of the burden has shifted to faculty who must adapt materials to new teaching modalities, cope with increased course capacities, and deal with restrictions on research funding and pauses on matching retirement contributions. The pressures of pandemic-era austerity measures come in addition to increased responsibilities at home caring for children, partners, and parents. In one faculty survey, 40% of respondents reported considering leaving their roles due to the impact of COVID-19, with early career academics being the most likely to consider leaving academia, at 48% (Flaherty, 2020). Why might this be? In this arti-cle I share some of my experiences as a woman, mother, ﬁrst-generation academic, and early career scholar",

Using sociocultural analysis of two programs featuring a Black Lady Therapist (BLT) from the past decade, we argue the BLT typically functions as a “false positive” representation and she is, in fact, a plastic character whose race is generally reinforced through a combination of boundary violations and asexuality. We aim to articulate how BLTs in television programming rely on and reinforce intersectional oppressions against Black women while simultaneously recognizing the ways their presence serves to advance progressive representations of Black women. Exceptions to these patterns point to the potential for more meaningful representations of Black women professionals on television.</jats:p>",

In this brief exploration, I navigate through the realms of queer African studies, African digital humanities, and African literary studies, using them as my guiding framework to uncover the digital emergence of an African transgender refugee diaspora. I suggest that this diaspora is producing content explicitly aimed back at the African continent to shape and deploy the reality of what it means to be transgender and African.

This article focuses on two high-profile and COVID-19-themed TV series that aim to rewrite the collective memories of the Wuhan lockdown as part of state’s affective governance strategies. Using a feminist textual analysis, the article examines the gendered nature of state narratives by dissecting the representation of national heroines of the pandemic. It demonstrates the centrality of heterosexual families and gender performances in romanticizing individual sacrifices and mass suffering. Unlike the socialist-era role models, the personal weakness and emotional flaws of China’s new heroines are tactically displayed to enhance emotional authenticity and resonate with contemporary audiences. Yet these state narratives reflect only stereotypical depictions of femininity within a hierarchical gender order in post-reform China, where moralized womanhood is imbued with a sacrificial attitude that serves to discipline China’s female citizens.</jats:p>",

By identifying a popular cultural discourse of “transnational ethnic imaginary” surrounding her celebrity images, I explore the ways in which her geo-cultural-ethnic-gender identity has been capitalized on by the Chinese TV industry and subjectively performed by herself within official and popular fantasies about a global, harmonious China. Ultimately, I argue that her success as a TV star in the post-2010 years exposes the artificiality and contingency of the self-imagined dimorphism of the dominant Han Chinese and ethnic minorities within the party-state’s interethnic, transnational, heteropatriarchal-structured fantasies about a global China and a homogenous Chineseness.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Robert Capa Myth: Hegemonic Masculinity in Photojournalism’s Professional Indoctrination",
    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This project examines the mythos of famed war photographer Robert Capa and its influence on the photojournalistic canon. Using Barthes’ concept of ideological myth as a foundation, the project examines four sets of discourses about Capa: his own self-promotion, biographies, exhibition reviews, and photojournalistic textbooks. The analysis suggests that the Capa myth is characterized by hegemonic masculinity, emphasizing risk-taking, strength and courage, in ways that may occlude the famed photographer’s humanity. The corpus chosen for this project enabled an ideological analysis and critique of the way the Capa myth permeates the field’s indoctrination. The project finds that the mythic portrait of Capa has had considerable influence on photojournalistic education but may no longer serve the larger field.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The question of what constitutes solidarity (and what does not) has been a persistent concern for feminist scholars. In this conceptual article, we develop a distinction between superficial feminist solidarity and substantive feminist solidarity, grounded in illustrations of digital resistance during the transnational “Woman, Life, Freedom” feminist movement. The categories of superficial feminist solidarity and substantive feminist solidarity provide a framework for critically distinguishing between the range of actions in the movement and understanding their respective logics, practices, and implications. Superficial feminist solidarity actions may raise awareness, but often do so in the service of building consensus for Western feminism. In contrast, substantive feminist solidarity manifests as anti-colonial praxis that advances demands for social justice through a horizontal dynamic with people subjected to inhumane conditions.</jats:p>",

Through an examination of corporate blogs and sponsored stories, this article argues these companies cultivate risk along two related axes: (a) fear of dangerous others; and (b) fear of the threat posed by personal information available to others. Through sponsored stories and promotional material, these companies encourage people to mitigate risk by using consumer background check services to seek out information about others and review available details about themselves. Consistent with other forms of risk anxiety in modern cultures, the advice offered by these companies encourages the acceptance of personal responsibility around the acquisition of and response to this information. This article concludes by arguing the cultivation of reputation anxiety around digital skeletons—belonging both to others and to oneself—is rooted in gendered notions of safety and personal responsibility.</jats:p>",

This co-assembled history documents the reliance on viral analogies and explanations honed in the HIV/AIDS crisis and its massive loss of life, widespread institutional neglect, and comprehensive technological failures. As the 1990s marked a period of intense domestication of computing technologies in the global North, we document how public figures, computer experts, activists, academics, and artists used the intertwined discourses surrounding HIV and new computer technologies to explicate the risks of vulnerability in complex, networked systems. The efficacy of HIV as an analogy is visible in the circulation of viral concepts, fears surrounding interdependence, and emergent descriptions of precarity in the face of a widespread “infrastructure crisis.” Through an analysis of this decade, we show how HIV/AIDS discourses indelibly marked the domestication of computing, computer networks, and nested, digitized infrastructures.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Between 2014 and 2017, the creation of hashtag syllabi—bricolage iterations of reading lists created by or circulated among educators on Twitter—emerged as a direct response for teaching about three highly publicized incidents of racial violence in the United States. Educators used hashtags as a means of sharing resources with their networks to provide non-normative literatures from marginalized scholars for teaching to transgress in the wake of Mike Brown’s slaying in Ferguson, Missouri; the massacre of nine congregants at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; and the fatal car attack on anti-fascist protestors in Charlottesville, Virginia. Acting on Chakravartty et al.’s provocation to center scholars of color in course syllabi as a pedagogical strategy to disrupt the reification of white supremacy in communication and media studies, I consider the creation of three hashtag syllabi related to these events as a form of critical resistance praxis in the emerging framework of digital intersectionality theory. I present a brief textual analysis of the aforementioned syllabi, triangulated with data from online conversations linked to them via their hashtags and derivative works produced by their creators and users to map two social media assisted strategies for doing critical public pedagogy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The 2010s saw the onset of the Black Travel Movement—an influx of travel companies aimed at a rising Black customer base, whose travel habits are redefining a traditionally White industry. This study interrogates how Black travel companies produce representations that create new possibilities for Blackness on a global scale. To that end, this article forwards the concept of differential spatial racialization. Differential spatial racialization builds from the Critical Race Theory (CRT) concept of differential racialization to explicate how race and racial meanings change across spatial contexts. This article undertakes a narrative analysis of the Instagram accounts of two prominent Black travel companies, Travel Noire and Nomadness Travel Tribe. Results reveal how Travel Noire and Nomadness Travel Tribe minimize the presence of differential spatial racialization by drawing on discourses of global Blackness. Simultaneously, their homogenous depictions and curated posts erase and idealize processes of differential spatial racialization in Black travel.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The 2010s saw a boom in television comedies, created by, written, and starring women, that explored the bawdy and chaotic lives of protagonists who were experiencing some form of arrested development. These comedies sought to build intimate connections with their imagined audiences by crossing boundaries—social, bodily, and physical—to produce comedies of discomfort. Drawing in part on Rebecca Wanzo’s consideration of “precarious-girl comedy” (2016) I examine how two British television comedies intensified these intimate connections through the use of direct address, binding the audience tightly to the sexual and social misadventures of their twenty-something female protagonists. Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum (E4, 2015–2017) follows naïve and desperately horny black working-class Londoner Tracey in her quest for sexual experience, and Phoebe-Waller Bridges’ Fleabag (BBC Three, 2016–) documents an unnamed upper-middle-class white woman’s sharply misanthropic journey through grief. In both programmes direct address serves to intensify the embrace of bodily affect and intimate access to interiority found in the “precarious-girl comedy” (Wanzo, 2016), producing moments of comic and emotional repulsion. Each program uses direct address’s blend of directness and distance to different ends, but both draw audiences at times uncomfortably close to the singular perspective of their protagonists, creating an intensely affective comic intimacy.</jats:p>",
