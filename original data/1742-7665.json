    "title": "Mediating solidarity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the apparent increase in the number of alternative political media, political pluralists are again faced with the question: does the proliferation of subaltern counter-publics lead to a multiplication of forces? Fragmentation in political culture is fuelled by the rise of identity politics that focuses on consumption not production. Party allegiances and class alliances give way to more fluid and informal networks of action. Postmodern theorists celebrate fragmentation because it allows the recognition of diversity in political desires, acknowledges difference between individuals and debunks the myth of homogenous political units leading ultimately to liberation. But for political efficacy there must be more than the apparent freedom that comes with embracing difference and diversity. This article argues that if we accept the description of society as fragmented, in order to create a viable political community then solidarity is crucial. In a global economy, solidarity can be mediated through new communication technologies but the challenge is to articulate the politics online with actual movements and struggles on the ground. </jats:p>",

    "title": "After the hate media",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past 15 years Central Africa, and specifically Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, have been through devastating wars in which the media became actors. In 1993, some Burundese newspapers were described as ‘hate media’ and one year later Radio télévision mille collines (RTLM) in Rwanda became the first of those described as ‘death media’, preparing minds for genocide and helping in its implementation. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, in1998, certain newspapers took to inciting ethnic hatred and violence towards some Congolese citizens. By 2006, when this research was completed, these three countries were undergoing fragile peace processes and trying to rebuild themsleves. The media certainly have a major role to play in helping to soothe the hatred and move people from different communities back into dialogue. But how should the media sector be reorganized in countries where the media have contributed to killings? What is the best way to find a balance between freedom and control in a context where the microphone and the pen have been weapons of murder? This is one of the main issues that must be addressed by the communications regulatory bodies which have been established to support press freedom and to organize and monitor the media landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In the new millennium, scholars are increasingly predicting that Asian film industries, particularly those of India and China, will wrestle control of global film flows from Western dominance. Fueled by the internet, satellite networks, cable television, and DVD distribution, it is argued that Asian production centers will increasingly exploit cinematic contraflows that draw upon structures of hybridity to meet increasing demand for glocalized content within globalized distribution networks (e.g. Bose, 2006; Curtain, 2007; Kumar, 2008; Lagerkvist, 2009; Mitra, 2008). As noted by Ritzer (2007), cultural hybridity is central to glocalization, where human agents self-consciously and creatively combine local with global cultural formations in a bid to subvert potentially homogenizing forces associated with cultural imperialism (Schiller, 1991). Within cinematic public spheres, filmmakers act as bricoleurs (Newcomb and Hirsch, 2000), mixing both global and local elements to appeal to audience tastes and trends (Bhabha, 1995; Burke, 2006; Volkmer, 2003). For Appadurai (1996: 35), global mediascapes provide the backdrop of ‘large and complex repertoires of images, narratives, and ethnocscapes’ used in cultural mixing. As hybridized content spreads, ‘contra-flows’ (Thussu, 2006: 175) emerge, shifting the direction of cultural influence to the Global South and blurring ‘the boundaries between the modern and the traditional, the high and low culture, and the national and the global culture’ (2006: 175).

    "abstract": "Western parts of the world. In addition, their historical awareness is laudable, not only in the historical Chapter 2, but also, for instance, where Freedman connects current celebratory writings to their 1970s counterparts. The book is indeed polemical. It has plenty of clearly formulated statements, such as: ‘Networks are not inherently liberatory; network openness does not lead us directly to democracy’ (p. 142). All these features make Misunderstanding the Internet a welcome contribution, and one that would fit well on the reading list of a range of courses. The book’s structure prioritizes independence rather than connections between the chapters. The first chapter does not offer an overview of the book, and there are few references across the chapters (notably more in Fenton’s chapters). Of course, being written by three different individual authors, the writing style also varies. For instance, Chapter 6 includes reviews or discussions of a broad range of theoretical contributions, not found to the same extent in the other chapters. As such, the chapters work well individually, but a different structure could have strengthened the book’s coherent argument further. When laying out the opposition – the representatives of the celebratory discourse – Curran, Fenton and Freedman draw on a range of sources. They use popular writings by the likes of Jeff Jarvis and Clay Shirky alongside older similar works (e.g. Negroponte), as well as politicians, journalists and other commentators. They also discuss similar views found in academic texts, but the impression is that we are dealing with popular views in the public discourse. We are never told why we need to use so much energy on countering their claims – why they matter. One answer might be that the popular optimistic views are being picked up by powerful people, forming a basis for actual policymaking, but it would be interesting to see the authors answer this question more explicitly. Throughout the book, the authors stress the importance of context. To understand the impact of the internet, we need to understand specific political and cultural surroundings. Yet, one dimension of the internet’s context gets little attention: the book does not systematically place the internet, its technology, politics, economics, content and uses, in a wider media landscape. While the authors prove that it is still possible to provide analyses which single out the internet, connecting its recent developments more clearly with other technologies and media seems to be the next challenge.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> What happened after the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) and the report prepared by the MacBride Commission: is it the case, in the words of the popular tango Volverby Carlos Gardel, that 20 years mean nothing? This article analyses the global discussions around the flow of information and communication from the NWICO to the WSIS. The aim of this article is to look at the movements, breaks and continuities which relate not only to the relationship between governments, but also to the main economic, technological, political and social trends in both historical moments. Additionally, the article notes the changes in the agents involved and conceptual shifts in the various stages of the discussion. The article reconstructs the evolution of the proposals aimed at democratizing the communication structures, to enable an analysis of their relevance to the current debate about the ‘Information Society’, a term which, though repeatedly used in recent years, gained momentum in the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) held in December 2003 in Geneva. Our hypothesis is that the frustration resulting from the NWICO debates at UNESCO in the 1970s is a key motivation for the new players at the WSIS summits in Geneva and Tunis – they do not want to repeat past mistakes. However, we consider that the struggle is still political; it is based on a dispute over economic and symbolic resources. It has become increasingly important to re-state the need to democratize the communicational resources of society. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Introduction: Between Macondo and McWorld: communication and culture studies in Latin America",
    "abstract": "Over the years the question of hegemony has been central to Latin American mass communication and culture scholarship (access to power, control, participation, and resistance). This emphasis has shaped various waves of theoretical development, such as a critique of modernization theory (Beltran, 1976; Mohr, 1975), the dependency model and cultural imperialism (Dorfman, 1973; Dorfman and Mattelart, 1984; Mattelart, 1972, 1974a, 1974b, 1977; Uribe, 1973), alternative communication scholarship (Gonzaga Motta, 1982; Reyes Matta, 1982; Rodríguez, 2001), and popular culture studies (García Canclini, 1982; Martín-Barbero, 1987; Nethol, 1982; Roncagliolo, 1986). However, as new hybrid cultural configurations reflective of recent ‘globalizing’ processes such as liberalization, privatization, and democratization have surfaced (García Canclini, 1989), theorists have been forced to reconsider the relationship(s) between culture and power. For mass communication scholars, this has meant rethinking how the cultural industries serve to enable certain kinds of social control while also stimulating the expression of cultural self-definition and political participation. As a result, the fractures in contemporary Latin American cultures, where neo-liberalism and consumer desire collide with popular memory and political agency, become crucial areas of analysis. To meet this investigative challenge, Latin American media scholars have begun to focus more deliberately on post-colonial sensibilities (the politics of race and ethnicity) and the vestiges of independence politics (nationhood, citizenship), in concert with established areas of inquiry such as the influence of external forces (e.g. international economic and political agendas and corporate expansionism), the role of the nation state, and social movements. This new, multilayered emphasis has demanded that scholars engage new terrains of research such as mediated memory, identity politics, and ‘otherness’ as areas central to understanding how people experience and negotiate globalizing forces.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, the regulation of mobility has seen marriage equality emerge as a homonational discourse of progressive gay and lesbian politics championed on the erasure of homophobia to end systemic discrimination. While homonational modernity promotes the superiority of a nation through sexual openness, it also mobilizes the fear of homophobia to marginalize racialized and sexualized minorities through sexual quarantine. Using media case studies on Indian student migrants and Malaysian transgender refugees from the Asian Australian diaspora, this article examines how homonational modernity regulates the queer mobility of diasporic Asian subjects. The article uses these case studies to interrogate homonational modernity and, in doing so, hopes to create a critical platform for a politics of queer Asian mobility. Critically illustrating how ‘Asia’ (e.g. Malaysia and India) and the Asian diaspora (e.g. Asian refugees and queer migrants in Australia) have been made present in Australian’s homonational modern imagination as sites of inclusion and exclusion, this article provides a critical approach to the regulation of mobility that allows for the intervention of and accounting for the uneven distribution of race, sex and gender that conditions personal mobility, revealing the institutional constraints and privileges that shape queer liberalism and homonormativity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "production and distribution will constrain the development of nonproprietary models of social production and thereby starve the ‘information commons’. As such, there is an urgent need for policies that define and protect the freedoms enabled by social production. Unfortunately, the analysis celebrates the inherent promise of social production without also considering some of the hidden costs and implications of the networked environment. Benkler suggests, for example, that the networked environment removes ‘the physical constraints on effective information production’; and more specifically, that social production and sharing can operate at the edge of the internet without the need for centralized and ‘capital-intensive bottlenecks’. And yet, it has been the rapid growth of the very trends under investigation in The Wealth of Networks – namely, the creation, storage and management of user-generated content – that has necessitated significant investments in data centres, which are both capital and energy intensive. These centres lie at the heart of the contemporary internet, and incur growing environmental costs. Similarly, the ‘feasibility spaces’ discussed in rather abstract and clean terms by Benkler are actually enabled by a diverse ecology of devices (from LCD displays to cheap processors and hard disks), which are produced and disposed in ways that impose terrible costs upon the environment. To be sure, much of the literature on social production and the information commons tends to suffer from an environmental blind spot. Therefore, a key challenge in this field will be to find ways of re-connecting the digital networked environment (as theorized by Benkler and others) with the rivalrous and often toxic resources that underpin its continued growth.",

    "abstract": "Indian politician Jairam Ramesh (2006) coined the term ‘Chindia’ to suggest that, as two surging economies, China and India have far-ranging mutual interests in business and cultural spheres. This term has been widely used in relation to the potential for common and complementary developments in the world’s two biggest countries, both by population and area. On 11 January 2006, a People’s Daily article entitled ‘New Term Chindia Suggests a Strategic Partnership between China and India’ indicated that this term ‘shows an image of China and India’s possible partnership’ (Ren Yan, 2006). Chindia has also been adopted as the title of the bestselling book by the BusinessWeek editor Pete Engardio, about the impact that China and India have made to the world’s business (Engardio, 2007). However, have the Chinese and Indian government, business thinktanks and other elites considered the interpretation of Chindia in other realms of discourse when they use this term? The internet, for example, is a space where nationalism easily finds its way. Have they considered then how netizens interpret this term, or in other words, what kind of image do these two countries impress on the minds of netizens from the other country? We conducted a content analysis by sampling discussion entries from Qiangguo Forum, which is one of the most influential bulletin board systems in the Chinese internet sphere. We sampled 162 entries that mentioned ‘India’, published in the period between 1 April 2009 to 1 May 2009. We focused on the following aspects in our analysis of these entries:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study of international and global news to date has focused on the operation of foreign news values, the unequal flows and emergent contra-flows of transnational news as well as the phenomenology of 24/7 live broadcasts. Today these debates are often played out under opposing `global dominance' and `global public sphere' positions. Each in its own way is concerned about communications democracy — whether its discerned curtailment by processes of geo-political economy or temporal-spatial extension by increased global cultural flows. In this article we contend that there is a `democratic lacuna' at the heart of these debates. This silence concerns how exactly leading world news channels — principally CNNI and BBC World but also international competitors such as Sky and Fox News — communicatively present the voices, views and values of contending interests and identities from around the world. Elaborating a new conception of `communicative frames' based on contemporary positions of social and political theory and applying this to a large corpus of news output, we begin to evaluate generalizing theoretical claims, both critical and celebratory, about the contribution of global 24/7 news to processes of global dominance or an emergent global public sphere. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reports the findings of a review and methodological critique of 96 Latin American empirical studies on television reception published between 1992 and 2007 in the most important journals of the region. The analysis compares the studies according to their theoretical approach, the research technique used, their sample size, the type of audience members studied, the type of television content researched and the scholars mentioned the most in their references. Findings show that Cultural Studies is by far the most popular theoretical approach in Latin American audience research, and that two of the topics covered the most were television and daily life and the importance of social and cultural mediations. The article also concludes that many studies lack a solid methodological base. Morley, Orozco, Martín-Barbero, García-Canclini and Lull were the scholars mentioned the most in the reference sections. The article ends with a diagnosis of the strengths and weaknesses of current Latin American empirical research on television audiences and points out the need for more methodological rigor and more emphasis on the analysis of ideological readings and impact. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> International broadcasting services are typically designed to serve public diplomacy and soft power objectives. Traditionally, Western powers have explored and benefited from this state-sponsored media category. However, countries in the Global South, like Brazil, have endeavoured to establish cross-border television services to bolster their international presence. This paper scrutinizes TV Brasil Internacional as a case study, examining its designated functions, management, and funding models. The research illuminates through document surveys and semi-structured interviews that while the channel initially reflected Brazil’s external policies and public service ideals, structural alterations enabling increased governmental intervention alongside budget cuts rendered the international service dormant. </jats:p>",

Viewers can be moved and placed in a discursive relation to the displaced when news stories construct what Arendt called ‘proper distance’. This possibility is explored in the article, which compares coverage of migration issues in 2019 on four global television news channels: Al Jazeera English, BBC World, CNN International and RT. The results provide evidence of approaches that differ in striking and thought-provoking ways, giving global television news consumers different resources for making sense of a complicated global crisis. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The revival of Chinese leftism online",
    "abstract": "China’s epochal transformation has been a phenomenon in which nationalism has played a crucial formative role. This has been particularly evident in the past few years in the emerging cybersphere. Nonetheless, to say that ‘nationalism is central to China’s online discourse and the evolving political identity of Chinese Internet users’ (Qiu, 2006: 125) would be both an analytical misjudgment and a rhetorical exaggeration. First, the complexity of China’s transformation extends beyond the explanation of the ultra-simplistic notion of (rightwing) Chinese nationalism, which assumes different meanings in different contexts for different social groups in different times. Second, because of the growing prevalence and intensity of online debates regarding the nature of Chinese reform, itself initiated as a nationalistic mission, what we are witnessing at present is not only the apparent tide of state-guided Chinese nationalism, but more importantly, the revival of Chinese leftism onand offline as both a less cherished but firm undercurrent and a persistent challenge to that tide. The formulations and connotations of Chinese leftism are in constant restructuration. Today, ‘leftism’ in China refers to allegiance to, and tendencies toward, the notion of social security, which entails meeting the most basic human material needs in food, housing, education, medical treatment and the like. This involves a wide coalition of leftisms at both elite (implicating the uncanny mixture of Party and intellectual leftism) and popular levels and as such, an association of various class fragments. Chinese leftism is as much historical as it is contemporary, and as much diversified and valid today as its ancestor in the 1920s. Hence, our current perception of Chinese leftism and the key role it occupies in online politics in China ought to be both dialectical and holistic. It is instructive to recognize post-Mao Chinese reform as a contested process of differentiated control and escalation of suppression and WEB REVIEW",

This study aims to assess the presence of the Hostile Media Phenomenon (HMP) among audiences of Ethiopian private, regional and federal television channels. Survey data were gathered from 600 participants living in Addis Ababa City, Amhara and Oromia regional states and were purposely chosen based on their historical and political dominance in the country. The study examined six different television channels found in the three regions: Oromia Broadcast Network (OBN), Amhara Broadcast Corporation, Addis TV, Wlata TV, Fana Broadcast Corporation (FBC) and Ethiopian Broadcast Corporation (EBC). The results of this study indicate that the regional states’ television channels play a major role in intensifying the hostile media phenomenon as well as in motivating violence and conflict among different regional states and groups of people. </jats:p>",

We study the role of the audience by analyzing the perceptions of two main actors: journalists and citizens. A two-fold methodology was adopted: a questionnaire survey of 228 active journalists in Spain and six focus group panels with media users. The main results show that the journalists are not optimistic about the effectiveness of accountability instruments used by the audience. The users value positively being able to participate in the journalistic process, although they believe that journalists should ultimately perform the role of fact-checkers of user-generated content. </jats:p>",

However, the question that arises here is, when adopting a post-structuralist position, taking Foucault as a point of reference and thus rejecting the Enlightenment legacy that forms the very basis of public sphere theory, is it not time to abandon the concept itself as well? This is not merely a plea for the use of spaces rather then spheres, but also for making the tensions, contradictions, conflicts and wider consequences of shifting between paradigms that are quite distinct at the level of philosophy as well as political theory, more explicit.",

    "abstract": "of Microsoft Word’s and Adobe Acrobat’s concrete mechanisms for tracking authorship, at both the level of algorithms and the code itself; and an analysis of manuals used to train criminal forensics experts on tracing identity – and criminal accountability – through metadata. Both historical and hypothetical examples are used to demonstrate the surprising (and terrifying) possibilities of this single metadata field – simultaneously updating the concept of the author-function in an era of automated authorship, while also teasing out the politics of a metadata field that few of us are even aware of. But sometimes, the tactics came together in less illuminating ways. The book occasionally seems to get so bogged down in the materiality of computation that it cannot raise itself back to its lofty goal of enacting a ‘critical and inventive politics’. For example, Chapter 7 (‘Computational Aesthetics’) dwells so much on aspects of the computational – discreteness, axiomatics, numbers, speeds, scale – that it fails to say anything novel about how these inform and constitute aesthetic works and experiences. But maybe it was just me. As a reader who focuses on human–computer interaction (HCI), design, and philosophical and literary aesthetics, I am aware of sophisticated debates about the topics that Fazi and Fuller were raising and was disappointed that the chapter did not go further than it did. At the same time, I recognise that the chapter achieves a level of technico-material precision that researchers of digital art often do not; possibly, this chapter might heighten the sensitivities of such scholars to the materiality of the art. It is not surprising that different readers might have wildly different responses to chapters because software studies engage ‘texts, ideas, objects, and systems from computer science and digital technologies in dialogue with those of cultural theory, digital media cultures, art, hacking, and elsewhere’ (p. 4). Who among us is equally strong with all of these? There but for the grace of Google go I. Perhaps, then, the best way to read this book is to soak in its surprising connections and the ways of reading, thinking and acting that they open up. The book is especially strong when it gets down and dirty with the materiality of specific systems – when it does, it is like reading the finest literary or film criticism. Examples of this include the book’s running emphasis on videogames (like Minecraft) and digital play (see, especially, Chapter 6, ‘Always One Bit More’) and online archives, such as GitHub (see Chapter 4, ‘Big Diff, Granularity, and Production in the Github Software Repository’). Another strength is the book’s revitalisation (as opposed to mere application) of critical theories and computing histories: Gilles Deleuze, Mikhail Bakhtin and Donna Haraway are read side by side with Alan Turing, Norbert Weiner and Mark Weiser. The collective power of these analyses – even more than the book’s accessible and engaging introduction – makes the case that software studies is highly relevant and, indeed, desperately needed in today’s condition of geek tragedy.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines Indian telecom policy from independence to the present. Dividing this period into three phases – from 1947 to 1984, 1984 to 1991 and 1991 to the present – the article explores the role of the state in India’s dramatic transformation from a telecommunications laggard to one of the world’s largest markets in mobile communication. It draws on a wide range of government documents, institutional surveys (domestic and international) of Indian telephony, memoirs and analyses by policy officials, and interviews with telecom executives. This article makes two arguments. First, it emphasizes the importance of external forces, including economic pressures, obligations to foreign creditors and the arrival of outsiders into key policymaking positions. Second, it provides an alternative to the simplistic argument that the state has ‘left telecommunications to the private sector’. Rather than abandon its role in network building and maintenance, the Indian government has deployed its power in specific and deliberate ways. While much of this policy development was unanticipated and at times accidental, Indian telephony has been transformed from an inward-looking and defensive statist monopoly to an internationalized, technocratic marketplace. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents an empirical analysis of the Australian media representation of terrorism using the 2014 Sydney Lindt Café siege as a case in point to engage with the notion of moral panic. Deploying critical discourse analysis and case study as mixed methods, insights into trans-media narratives and aftermath of the terrifying siege are presented. While news media appeared to collaborate with the Australian right-wing government in the reporting of terrorism, social media posed challenges and raised security concerns for the state. Social media heightened the drama as sites were variously deployed by the perpetrator, activists and concerned members of the public. The amplified trans-media association of Muslims with terrorism in Australia and its national and global impact, in terms of the political exclusion of Muslims, are best described in this article in the form of an Islamophobic Moral Panic Model, invented for a rethink of the various stages of its occurrence, intensification and institutionalization. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book review: <i>Networked Publics and Digital Contention: The Politics of Everyday Life in Tunisia</i>",
    "abstract": "The book contains very detailed research on these three cases, and the argument that China is under the cultural imperialist influence of global capitalism and needs to explore alternative imaginary resources in envisioning her future development is generally sound and well-grounded. However, I hope to point out a few instances where the author might be drawing an overly simplistic picture. First, the IPR regime as the hegemonic ideological power of global capitalism may be given too much credit in this book. Besides the case of the Silk Street, which directly involves the disciplining power of international brands, other cases do not exactly constitute an embracement of or resistance to the IPR regime by the Chinese state or ordinary people. The issue of shanzhai phones or popular movies imitating Hollywood genres is talked about in the Chinese context more or less in terms of creativity and originality, rather than in sharp legal terms of copyright or IPR. Although the IPR institution is established based on the modernist idea of creativity, individuality and originality, which is indeed a cultural imperialist force in contemporary Chinese understanding of cultural production, it does not mean that the Chinese state necessarily buys into the system sincerely and completely. The Chinese state is actually quite pragmatic in dealing with the international pressure from the IPR regime, using slogans of protecting copyright on one hand, and tolerating quite a bit of underground economic activities, on the other. And on this note, how much of these shanzhai or mimicry practices in the cultural realm necessarily represent resistance to global capitalism is also dubious and unsettled, and needs further discussion, analysis and debate. Could they also be alternative, not to capitalism per se, but to the Western style of capitalism, and constitute a capitalism with Chinese characteristics? A final point is about the dichotomy between the Chinese state that succumbs to the ideology of global capitalism and the national popular that carries on the memories and practices of socialist history. That is indeed an attractive way of mapping the ideological struggle and cultural contestation of today’s China, except that it is too simplistic. The state as a monolithic entity with unifying ideology, subjectivity and coordinated actions just does not exist in contemporary China. The intensifying divisions in Chinese society appear not only between classes, geographical locations, or between the state and society, but also within the state and the ideological spheres within the parameters of state influence. In the book, for example, the author uses CCTV or China Daily reports as evidence of the state position on certain issues, but it is very easy to find different media outlets, all seemingly state-sanctioned, fighting each other fiercely in the public arena. In studying the cultural and ideological trends in contemporary China, the state versus society dichotomy is perhaps more limiting than enabling for us to have a nuanced, historicized and reflexive understanding of the issue.",

It demonstrates how isolating critical actors can have a negative impact on society at large and its relationship to the state. At a time when journalists are being persecuted, disappeared and even killed in democratic and authoritarian countries alike, it is ever more crucial to break the dichotomous view of democracy–authoritarianism.

    "title": "Indian TV serials: between originality and adaptation",
    "abstract": "In the late 1980s, the Indian public television network, Doordarshan, already 40 years old, became a truly mass phenomenon, in both urban and rural areas. When it launched two major serials inspired by the principal Hindu epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Doordarshan brought several hundred million spectators to the small screen and experienced a popular success unequalled in the history of audio-visual media on the subcontinent. The Ramayana traces the life-story of the god Rama, one of the incarnations of Vishnu, and more broadly the battle between Good and Evil. The Mahabharata paints a portrait of the five Pandava brothers, sons of King Pandu, and of the Kauravas, the 100 sons of King Dhritarashtra, opponents in a fratricidal war. It is easy to see the multiple events of this long narrative also as a panoramic History of India.1 For Hindu television viewers, these programmes were a genuine religious experience. The actors became cult figures, indistinguishable from the gods whose roles they were playing, since darshan, a concept fundamental to Hinduism, sees divinity as existing within the very image representing it. More broadly, however, these two huge TV successes, broadcast on Sunday morning, rapidly became an unmissable rendezvous for the whole population, irrespective of language and religion.2 All activity in the country slowed during transmission, sales of TV sets soared, wedding dates were moved so as not to miss an episode. In short, these serials went right to the heart of Indians’ daily life and collective imagination. Through these programmes, the Indian authorities sought to bind the population into a homogenous whole, within which cultural and religious differences would be subordinated to the idea of the nation. The linguistic diversity of India, too, was put to one side, since the serials were broadcast only in Hindi. The transmission of these first myth-based serials, the Ramayana from 1987 and then the Mahabharata (93 episodes) during 1988 and 1989, was COMMENTARY",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study surveyed a convenience sample of Arab college students in five Arab countries regarding their perceptions of the news credibility of two US-sponsored networks targeting Arab audiences: Radio Sawa and Television Alhurra. To assess the credibility of these networks, the students were asked to use a 12-item credibility scale developed by Gaziano and McGrath. The study found no correlation between the respondents’ frequency of listening to Radio Sawa and their perception of its news as credible. Moreover the study revealed that the students’ attitudes toward US foreign policy had worsened slightly since they started listening to Radio Sawa and watching Alhurra. Many respondents stated that if the US desires to improve its image in the Arab world, it should leave Iraq and adopt an even-handed policy on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Results of this study show the need for the US administration to acknowledge that no matter how savvy its public diplomacy efforts in the Middle East, they will be ineffective in changing Arab public opinion if that public is dissatisfied with US policies on the ground. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Race, as Downing and Husband (2005) remind us, is a ‘social category’ without a ‘scientific basis’ (p. 2). And yet, for better or worse, race is a fundamental dimension of contemporary life, one of the few master tropes that define identities, elicit solidarities and operate as an instrument of othering. Though ‘more inclusive and less objectifying’ (Spencer, p. 45), ethnicity is a ‘transient concept’ (p. 47) that, perhaps more so than ‘race’, reflects public and scholarly understandings of difference. They can also be burning issues in the life of nations and regions. As I am writing these words, public discourse in the United States has for several weeks been agitated by radio talk-show Don Imus’s racist comments about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team, the French intelligentsia is enjoying a collective sigh of relief at the weaker-than expected performance in the 2007 presidential election of the far-right and xenophobic French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen, and sectarian polarization between Sunnis and Shi’as is gripping the Arab world, fuelled by the botched US–British occupation of Iraq, rhetorical war between the US and Iran and the consequences of the Israel–Hizbullah war in Lebanon in the summer of 2006.

    "abstract": "all of the other sectors of the countries studied, no more than four groups account for at least 50 percent of total earnings. The data show conclusively that the vast majority of Latin Americans still do not have access to most media and telecommunications, except for the traditional over-the-air radio and television. A very small percentage of the population has a more diversified access to different forms of media and technology. In 2000 each Latin American inhabitant, on average, went to a film theatre less than once per year, bought half a music CD, one book and ten newspaper copies per year, while listening to the radio and watching over-the-air television every day. According to Mastrini and Becerra, telecommunications (fixed and cellular telephone lines and internet) grew much more than paid television, cinema and books and represented the highest volume in gross earnings, especially in Brazil, a country that in itself accounted for 85 per cent of total earnings in the telecommunications sector of the nine countries combined. In a field dominated by cultural studies, it is refreshing to read a book done by hard-working political economists going beyond the widely available data and gathering a massive dossier that for the first time is presented and analysed in academic terms. Periodistas y Magnates is an important contribution to the field of the political economy of Latin American media conglomerates. It is recommended for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics and concentration patterns of the cultural industries and the telecommunications sector in this important region of the world.",

As China’s key diplomatic initiative, the BRI discourses provide us rich resources to understand how China wants the international community to see it, and how it intends to lead the world. The paper finds that China has developed a much clearer vision and more consistent discourse on the world order and its role in it. However, our data produces no evidence to support the claim that China wants to take over the existing global order. Rather, China seeks legitimacy to share global leadership. </jats:p>",

    "title": "British military media strategies in modern wars",
    "abstract": "The British military risk being trapped by their own media strategy. Independent scrutiny from the frontline is gradually diminishing. Media operations are focused on managing narratives to foster support for the military campaign and for securing the future of the military institution. Modern wars are complex and expert knowledge is needed to explain them. Wars are expensive to cover. There is a lack of resources to cover wars within many media institutions. Specialist knowledge is thus increasingly likely to come from the military themselves. Large-scale media operations drive the military approach to media information management in what Rupert Smith (2005) calls ‘war amongst the people’. Military–media relations are far from straightforward. This paper proposes that while modern wars are increasingly understood through the media, developing a sophisticated media strategy is also becoming more important from a military perspective. With this in mind, media portrayal of the war effort has become as significant as the war effort itself. And as Badsey (2010) argues, managing military narratives, and media information, is now an integral part of any military campaign, ranking it at the same level as the war fought on the ground. In addition, new and rapidly evolving media and warfare landscapes are pushing the military to manage warfare narratives.",

This hostility has challenged the media to deal with the issue of citizenship ( Al-Muwatana) in a responsible manner.

The results of this study show that Omani newspapers deal with citizenship positively when reporting news from Syria, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Iran despite press censorship, while Kuwaiti print media, with its greater freedom of the press, is more negative on the topic of citizenship. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Website Review: Iraqi websites",
    "abstract": "Iraq’s internet landscape has changed dramatically since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Before this date media companies owned by Saddam Hussein’s son Uday were the dominant sites hosted openly within Iraq’s borders. With internet access tightly controlled, even these sites, which mainly provided information on government ministries and online versions of official newspapers, were aimed at a largely foreign audience. Exiled opponents of Saddam Hussein maintained a vigorous presence on the internet, ranging from the websites of political parties (such as www.sciri.btinternet.co.uk) to sites showcasing Iraq’s history and culture, or reporting on news from expatriate Iraqi communities around the world (www.iraker.dk is one example). In addition, the relatively free media environment in Iraqi Kurdistan also allowed the development of a substantial number of Kurdish websites aimed at an Iraqi Kurdish audience both inside the three semi-autonomous Kurdish provinces and in the Kurdish diaspora. Since April 2003 there has been a rapid increase in the number and range of Iraqi sites. Many new or revived Iraqi publications have developed a presence on the internet, and new sites dedicated to reporting events in Iraq from a particular angle have appeared, in addition to sites owned by companies, government institutions, NGOs and political parties. There is also greater access to the internet: in the aftermath of the US invasion, internet cafes sprang up in many towns and cities, with 300 reported in Baghdad alone by May 2004. Despite greater openness, only 1 percent of Iraqis reported using the internet in a media survey carried out by Gallup for USA Today in April 2004. It is also unclear how far Iraqis’ responses to other media types are mirrored in their use of the internet. The explosive growth of new print publications in the aftermath of the US-led invasion conceals the fact that far fewer Iraqis regularly read newspapers than watch television: WEB REVIEW",

    "title": "Book review: The contradictions of media power",
    "abstract": "Araya, whose contribution could spark a whole research project, points to the European style of journalism that dominates in Chile and asks if it fails to incorporate ‘a cultural and situated perspective of newsworthiness’ and participative processes of communication (p.261). The challenge to current and future media reforms is, therefore, to promote the emergence of new subjects, communities and emancipated communicative practices, instead of replicating the logic of mainstream media. This is not far from the concerns of Matos and Benítez. Matos focuses on public service broadcasting and seeks to retrieve its mission to serve the public interest, instead of falling into the trap of using it ‘to reach out voters’ (p.214). Benítez emphasizes the need to link media policies with cultural policies in order to build democratic and multicultural media systems. The problem from this perspective is the local cultural industries’ tight connections with global companies and interests. In closing, Media Systems and Communication Policies in Latin America provides a wealth of information on Latin American media systems and ongoing discussions on media reforms. In addition, this book also connects the discussion of reforms with broader questions about journalistic practice, cultural policy and the relationship between national media policies and the public interest. Curiously, the issues discussed in this era of the Internet are not that far from those discussed by Latin American media theorists since the 1960s and 1970s when military regimes and later neoliberalism drowned Latin American hopes for emancipation. This only underlines how long and winding the road to media and communication emancipation in Latin America is.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study critically analyses how the film industry shapes cultural norms and values, particularly through political agenda-setting. Using Edward Said’s concept of orientalism and neo-orientalist discourse, it examines Hollywood’s portrayal of Iran and Iranians. While past research has focused on dominant themes, this paper explores ‘minor moments’ linked to Iran and ‘minor characters’ identified as Iranians in films where the central narrative is unrelated. By addressing these depictions, the paper seeks to understand Hollywood’s role in shaping perceptions of Iranians as non-Arab, Muslim, oriental ‘others’. </jats:p>",

The political officials outsource media relations to media themselves, turning them into public relations agents. This mission seems to homogenize the content of regional newspapers since the government becomes the main source of information. </jats:p>",

On 15 July 2016, reports emerged through social networking sites and other mainstream media of armoured military tanks blocking the entrances to the Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges in Istanbul. Appearing via FaceTime on CNN Türk, President Erdoğan called people onto the streets to confront the occupying forces. Following the foiled coup attempt, officials praised the public for using communication technology to topple the coup plotters. I juxtapose the different settings where the coup unfolded to argue these events are symbolic phenomena, underscoring how the imaginary of ‘national unity’ is mediated to (re)affirm state power. </jats:p>",

In summary, Sun and Grimes present a valuable examination of China’s participation in the globalized economic landscape, focusing on the ICT value chain. The book considers China’s success and struggle over the past 40 years since the 1978 economic reform and explores the opportunities and challenges the enormous country will likely face in the years to come. The book will prove useful to policymakers, corporate managers and researchers who seek to understand a nation’s, an industry’s or a firm’s evolving relationship with the increasingly integrated world economy or the role of the ICT sector in globalization.",

    "abstract": "While discussing the variations of democracy and democratization development, this book also takes into account the dangers of ‘exporting democracy’, which may include, for example, insufficient integration of new forms of governance into the traditional local customs. Thus, the author acknowledges different outcomes and definitions related to the transition to democracy. Voltmer also raises an important question of whether too much diversity may exacerbate disintegration in volatile societies. As noted in Chapter 4 on media’s role in political and social transition before regime change, this question is central not only in transitional democracies but also in the countries that are in a pre-transitional stage. Furthermore, Voltmer also discusses the dilemma of restricting media freedom for democracy’s sake and stresses that the different contexts of particular societies at a particular point in time must be taken into account when considering these kinds of measures. In many cases, new democracies are divided after ethnic, religious or ideological conflicts, and often democracy-building and nation-building occur at the same time. Restricting freedom of speech has in some countries arguably helped prevent intercommunity hostilities. Besides general theoretical insights, this book gives numerous examples of different procedures and outcomes regarding media’s role in a transition process. Spain is given as an example of a country where media helped the new government in the stabilization period, by not turning back to a critical stance until after the democratization process had ‘succeeded’. If the second part of this book is mostly on the democratization process and different forms of media systems in authoritarian regimes, the third and last part focuses on the transformations in the media after the end of the authoritarian regime. Here, Voltmer looks at media transformation from political, economic, socio-cultural and professional dimensions drawing on the comparative framework based on Hallin and Mancini’s (2004) work. One of the conclusions is that in addition to a large variety in the outcomes of democratization, there is also a diversity of media systems and different forms of journalism. Overall, The Media in Transitional Democracies is a comprehensive introduction to the media in countries that are or have been in the process of democratic transformation or transition. As such, it is valuable reading also from the perspective of the challenges these societal changes pose for media theories and media research.",

    "abstract": "Babe and James P. Winter) and McLuhan (by Joost Van Loon) all shift the focus away from media studies to the broader context of communication studies. With Mattelart this means relocating media within their precise historical circumstances and especially the history of colonialism and imperialism. With Innis and McLuhan the focus shifts to questions of technology and the relationship between media technology and conceptions of space and time. Van Loon makes a compelling case for re-reading McLuhan, although he did not convince this reader that the frequent charge of technological determinism levelled at McLuhan is entirely unwarranted. There does not appear to be in McLuhan’s conception of technology’s mediation of social relations, anything comparable to Walter Benjamin’s inscription of the contradictions of class relations into technology. There are perhaps a number of instances in the book where the work of key theorists is not adequately measured against the criteria of ‘radical’ criticism as defined by Berry in his introductory chapter. Radicalism, he suggests, means exposing ‘the limitations of assessments that normalise systems’ (p. 13) and ‘subverts all that is accepted as natural or legitimate’ (p. 14). This criterion is not always at work in the judgement of RMMC itself. At times advocacy of key figures in the tradition is rather more evident than a desire to identify and work through the contradictions of their positions. But nevertheless this is an interesting (re)construction of, and accessible introduction to, radical media critique.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of these valuable assets, there are a handful of issues that the book could have further developed. On the one hand, while the book suitably discusses the geopolitics surrounding early telecommunications technologies between the US and Europe, followed by the US and Latin America, it does not emphasize the significant relationships between the US and Asia other than intermittently discussing some historical facts, which remains a blind spot. On the other hand, it misses one key conceptual and theoretical framework, which is globalization. Although it discusses the importance of global communication with early telecommunications technologies, it does not provide any meaningful explanations about the notion of globalization. As this book convinces its readers to think about the globalization process that occurred in the early 20th century, it would be great to have had Zajácz’s notion of globalization, which would have strengthened the analyses in the book. Overall, Zajácz’s book is highly recommended for a wide range of readers who are interested in information policy, communication history and political economy. The analyses and discussions are extremely compelling, and the chapters are very informative and connected. Since the book offers insights into global communication by providing empirical detail and useful historical interpretations, it is presented as a welcome contribution to a growing body of literature on telecommunications studies, communication history, globalization and political economy.944857 GMC0010.1177/1742766520944857Global Media and CommunicationBook review",

Chinese IISPs collect and use information extensively in the guise of providing value to users, but have given insufficient consideration to transborder data flows and change of ownership.

    "title": "China’s digital diplomacy on Twitter: The multiple reactions to the Belt and Road Initiative",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines three aspects of China’s digital diplomacy efforts about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on Twitter between February 9th 2019 to January 3rd 2020. First, it explores the frequency and geographical distribution of tweets about the BRI. Second, it scrutinises the main topics discussed in such tweets. Finally, it describes the actors producing BRI content. Results show that Chinese digital diplomacy has been proactive on Twitter, driven by the posting practices of its main international broadcasting organisations and BRI partners. As such, China’s digital diplomacy is becoming more relational. However, the open nature of Twitter also paves the way to numerous counter narratives disseminated by other users critical of the BRI, namely, Western media, think tanks, academics, and citizens, who undermine the stories that China aims to convey. These criticisms expose the limits of China’s digital diplomacy and of the sensationalist reporting of its alleged direct effects on audiences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rival discourses on the ‘war on terror’: Afghanistan and Iraq wars in the opinion columns of liberal and Islamist newspapers in Turkey",
    "abstract": "Being the only Muslim member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and an ally of the US, Turkey had to make extremely tough choices in relation to the so-called war on terror in Afghanistan and Iraq. Although the governments of the day supported the US, opinion polls confirmed that public opinion in Turkey was strongly critical of both wars and opposed Turkey’s involvement in them. Turkish media were also divided. The mainstream liberal/secular media followed a more pro-US editorial policy (Belge, 2003) while conservative/Islamist media provided ample room for opposition. However, not all Islamists were categorically against the wars. Some advocated a policy of active participation though, they said, they regretted the wars. Similarly anti-war discourses were by no means restricted to Islamists. The Iraq war caused several liberal/secular commentators to join the anti-war front and deepened the disagreement between those who are for and against cooperation with the US. This paper sets out to investigate different point of views in the Turkish press in relation to Turkey’s position and her national interests in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Its main aims are twofold: the first is to outline the different arguments on the wars because ‘(o)pinion discourse is argumentative’; the second is to explore the strategies used to support them because ‘recipients expect or demand that opinions are made plausible, defended, supported or otherwise “backed up”’ (van Dijk, 1995). With these aims the opinion columns of four newspapers, Hürriyet, Radikal, Yeni Şafak and Zaman, were analysed during the first five week days after the launch of the military campaigns.1",

    "abstract": "Bringing the concept of Chindia into academic discussion of the impact of globalization on communication is a new but important task. While a number of scholars have provided valuable insight from a comparative and an Indian perspective (see other articles in the issue), I would like to focus on China. This short piece of writing will be based on my ongoing research on the internationalization of Chinese media and cultural initiatives in the context of China’s rise.1 This project focuses on China’s state news agency – Xinhua. By the end of 2009 Xinhua was operating 117 overseas bureaus (Xin, 2009). In 2010 it launched the China Xinhua News Network (CNC), a TV news network targeting foreigners and overseas Chinese (Xinhuanet, 2010). The project also focuses on other major national news organizations, such as China’s national TV broadcaster, China Central Television (the Chinese equivalent to VOA [Voice of America]), China Radio International (the Central Party organ), People’s Daily and the national English language newspaper, China Daily. In addition, the project examines what is arguably China’s major cultural initiative – the set up of Confucius Institutes around the world for the promotion of Chinese language and culture. The number of Confucius Institutes has grown very fast since the first institute was established in 2004 in Soul, South Korea (Wang, 2008). By mid-July 2010, the total number of Confucius institutes, including 337 Confucius classrooms, had reached 653 and covered 94 countries and regions in the world (Huang, 2010). These initiatives share an underlying objective – to expand China’s media and cultural influence abroad. They are widely regarded by scholars as effective cultural and diplomacy tools deployed by the Chinese government for enhancing the country’s ‘Charm Offensive’ across the world (Kurlantzick, 2007).",

    "title": "Deepening shadows: The eclipse of press rights in Kyrgyzstan",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In March 2005, a relatively nonviolent uprising ousted an authoritarian president in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan. In the aftermath of the so-called Tulip Revolution, press rights advocates and journalists welcomed the promise of greatly enhanced freedoms. However, the new regime proved to be as authoritarian and corrupt as its predecessor and little liberalization of the press system was evident five years later. Physical assaults continued, including murders, as did harassment, libel suits, impediments to access to information, license denials and self-censorship. There was only slow movement toward privatizing of state-owned media. Independent and oppositional media also remained in financial peril due to the country’s weak economy and high poverty level. Thus, 20 years after independence and a half-decade after the Tulip Revolution, the Soviet propaganda model for a press system was dead in name, but many major attributes survived, with significant implications for the continuum of authoritarianism in other postcommunist nations. The degree to which the April 2010 coup and subsequent constitutional change to a parliamentary democracy will spur an expansion of press rights and sustain market-based independent media outlets remains speculative amid grave concerns about continuing anti-press events. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "On 28 April 2004, CBS 60 Minutes II broadcast a few shocking photographs taken over the previous months by US soldiers within the prison of Abu Ghraib, near Baghdad. The pictures showed Iraqi prisoners naked, tied, hooded, wounded and bleeding, constrained in unnatural positions, piled up or dragged along the floor and forced to suffer sexual violence, as well as soldiers posing with amused looks and thumbs up, even while closing a black sack containing a dead and tortured body. In the following days, the diffusion of the images generated tragic effects, most cruelly the beheading of US worker Nicholas Berg, abducted in Baghdad by Iraqi militants as an explicit reaction to the acts represented in the pictures. In the following weeks, The New Yorker published a series of articles written by Pulitzer prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, while newsrooms throughout the world were flooded by dozens of bitterly auto-commemorative amateur snapshots. Between May and June 2004, the Abu Ghraib torture photographs occupied the frontline of the international political debate. Many influential voices within US civil society asked President George Bush and Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld to resign. In a very short time, the Abu Ghraib photographs became a public scandal threatening the White House’s political-military hierarchy. However, at the moment of the initial publication, their reasons, meanings and consequences were not easily definable or predictable. Temporarily hidden from the political debate until Bush’s re-election in November 2004 thanks to an aggressive strategy of news management, the Abu Ghraib photographs have persistently re-appeared throughout a strikingly wide variety of processes of creative appropriation, re-articulation and re-contextualization within different spheres of action over the following years, triggering an interpretative struggle over the responsibilities for",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the effect of foreign media on publics’ psychological activeness during a foreign media–spurred national problem: air pollution in China. Building on theories of media diplomacy and public relations, it finds that affinity with foreign media significantly activates Chinese publics to engage communication actions against air pollution, as it relieves publics’ constraint recognition. Dependency on foreign media also mediates such an effect. Moreover, the results show that perceived accessibility of foreign media heightens such mediation, such that when access to foreign media is low, the direct activation effect of foreign media vaporizes. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Assessing the prospects for an Asian re-configuration of the global news order",
    "abstract": "Some 30 years following the acclaimed, sometimes lamented NWICO debates (McBride, 1980), the President of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA), also head of Antara, the national news agency of Indonesia, Ahmad Yusuf (2009), complained of continuing dependence of national news agencies on the big agencies of the developed countries. By contrast, research reported in 2010 from the News Agency Promotion Foundation at Hallym University, South Korea, found that the Chinese news agency, Xinhua, accounted for as many stories in a sample of nine Asian news agencies as the total number of stories coming from the Western major news wires, and that most Asian news and most news of North America and Europe was coming from Asian news agencies (Choi, 2010). I shall address the paradox of continuing perceptions of dependency on Western sources, on the one hand, and evidence of a shift in patterns of dependency on the other. Which news agency voices (will) dominate in the age of Chindia, and how is this problematic? Until recently, and perhaps still today, the infrastructure of global news, comprising many institutions but inter-networked within a hierarchic structure of information dependency at whose apex stood a number of Western news organizations gathering and distributing news to other news media and non-media clients on a global basis, has been led by agencies based principally in New York, London and Paris. These include Agence France Presse (AFP), Associated Press (AP), Bloomberg, and Reuters (now Thomson Reuters). Singly or together those organizations have dominated the markets in global textual news for news media clients, online and offline; global audiovisual news for broadcast news media clients; and financial, business and economic news services for non-media and media clients. They have been the news ‘wholesalers’, even as their traditional business-to-business operations evolved to include business-to-business-to-consumer or simply business-to-consumer ARTICLE",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Large corporations and media companies can form corporate networks through directors who hold positions on multiple boards, potentially enabling business elites to influence the media. This article investigates the relationship between corporate networks and media capture in two Latin American countries. We performed a network analysis of interlocking directorates to uncover these corporate networks, and conducted in-depth interviews with elites to identify two varieties of media capture: coordinated and competitive. Our findings indicate that media companies embedded in cohesive corporate networks are subject to coordinated media capture, whereas media outlets in fragmented corporate networks experience competitive media capture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> What’s new in Cultural Studies in France these days? Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in a research tendency long neglected in this country, in particular with the publication in French of some fundamental texts and a new critical reading of these in the framework of the new ‘médiacultures theory’ propagated by a group of young researchers. In this article, we present médiacultures theory and consider its strengths and weaknesses. Much to be welcomed is its epistemological subjection of high culture products to the same analysis as mass culture. Nonetheless, the omission of reception contexts and the simplification of Marx’s and Gramsci’s insights into the socio-political dimensions of culture — these being authors who deeply influenced Anglophone Cultural Studies research — have meant that the work currently being done in médiacultures is not as far-reaching as it might be. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mediating terror: Hollywood narratives of terrorism and young Moroccan audiences",
    "abstract": "Conventional wisdom has it that we now live in an age of globalization, marked by the collapse of old concepts of time and space (Giddens, 1990) and the rise of a global popular culture. The media in this new age assume a critical role as they become the vehicle of circulating cultural goods (films, music, magazines, books, etc.) throughout the globe. Yet, notwithstanding the steady rise of media exports from such countries as India, Brazil, Korea, Egypt, and Turkey, media flows for many countries continue to be American par excellence. In much of the Arab world today, American Rock and Rap music videos, videogames, and Hollywood movies have become part of the everyday cultural life of young Arab men and women. Apart from a boom in transnational satellite television channels and radio stations specializing in American popular culture (i.e. MBC2, Radio Sawa, Fox Movies, etc.), the growth of internet users, the abundance of computer software, and the availability of Chinese hardware (mainly VCD and DVD players) have given rise to a vibrant film piracy market. This has made American media products more readily available than local ones. The questions this situation raises for the media researcher is what happens when such media products as Hollywood movies, primarily intended for American audiences (given their size and thus economic significance), are consumed by non-American audiences? What communication processes are involved in moments of encounter between global media/cultural products, and local audiences throughout the globe? What meanings are constructed in this abundance of media materials, not by Americans, but by other audiences, who are just as concerned with the issues treated in those media texts and the representations they carry? In an attempt to answer some of these questions, this paper will discuss two major findings of a research study conducted in the summer of 2009 which examined encounters of young Moroccan audiences with American movies. The focus of this study was on post 9/11 Hollywood narratives of terrorism, particularly Peter Berg’s The Kingdom. The script of this film, written by Michael Carnahan, is inspired by the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing",

    "title": "Televisa and Univision, 50 years of media post-nationalism",
    "abstract": "Mexico’s media powerhouse Televisa recently announced it had entered an agreement to purchase up to 40 per cent ownership in Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the US and the fifth from a list that includes giants ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. The latest deal marked Televisa’s institutional return to the world’s wealthiest Hispanic market, which it had abandoned in March 2007 after selling its remaining 11 per cent equity stake in Univision, a company that is far more popular than any of the other Spanish-language broadcasters in the US. Televisa had sold its remaining shares in Univision after Broadcast Media Partners (BMP), a private consortium, acquired it for $13.7 billion in June 2006, thus outbidding Televisa in its attempt to secure a controlling position in the company. After Televisa disposed of its shares in Univision and given the fact that the latter had been ‘snatched’ from the former’s grasp (The Economist, 2006), it was easy to think this was the end of the Mexican firm’s role in shaping the Spanish-language televisual landscape in the United States. Nearly 50 years after Televisa’s founder – Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta – started Univision, however, it seems clear it will have a part to play for many years to come, thereby constituting a case study that is certain to continue, providing elements of interest for the study of transnational communication. The latest developments in Televisa’s partnership with Univision can be read in the context of an interaction between national and post-national forces that have been at play in the development of the Spanish-language television industry in the US. This intervention focuses on the former as they have shaped the milieu in the last three decades, but concludes that a few post-national aspects guarantee Televisa’s continued influence in the country.",

    "title": "Policies of media and cultural integration in Germany: From guestworker programmes to a more integrative framework",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> After the arrival of the first labour migrants in Germany in the 1960s, a gradual change in the perception of migrants in German politics took place: from guests ( Gastarbeiter) and foreigners ( Ausländer) to citizens as members of a new form of ‘us’ that is constructed within diversity. These transformations were reflected in Germany’s migration-related policies throughout recent history. This article focuses on media-related policies for cultural integration, which go hand in hand with the developments in the general migration policy framework, analysing different phases after the 1960s. In general, we observe an increasing institutionalization of integration policies, a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the media for integration purposes and a diversification of measures, even more rapidly after the enactment of the Immigration Act in 2004. Cultural diversity is now emphasized as an enriching factor for the German mediascape. However, there continues to be a need for long-term policies in order to improve media diversity in practice. </jats:p>",

The impact of ICTs does not conform to the globalization paradigm’s suggestions. To address this issue, this article argues that glocalization and localization should be viewed as autonomous processes. Glocalization offers a means for the interpretation of the ICT revolution in techno-social relationships. It leads to the reconstruction of places through digital means or newfound third spaces of glocality. In the first instance, ICTs often lead to a reconstruction of local places, whereas in the second instance, ICTs lead to glocalities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ness and domestic class conflict but, again, specifics are lacking. When, in 1989, Schiller concludes that human beings’ ‘capacities are overwhelmed’ when they are ‘confronted with a message incessantly repeated in all cultural conduits’ (Schiller, quoted on p. 113), one is struck by the intellectual–strategic (structural) straightjacket at hand. No critical assessment is offered of this or related conclusions. Nor, for that matter, are we offered any insight into Schiller’s awareness (or lack thereof) of the conceptual and political limitations of his own work. Perhaps Schiller, as an American public intellectual, thought that a direct engagement with contemporary Marxism would have been strategically detrimental to the widespread dissemination of his ideas, particularly in the United States? Such questions, had they at least been raised, would have given the reader more insight into the man and, indeed, might have opened up new ways of interpreting Schiller’s body of work. For those interested in Schiller’s writings and legacy, Herbert Schiller is a worthwhile read: it contains useful insights and, it should be noted, a tidy bibliography of his publications. But in light of Schiller’s own critical mandate, Maxwell’s book is lacking. The critically engaged reader likely will be both stimulated and frustrated by it.",

This article probes this question through the example of the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) information campaigns (ICs) in Cameroon, through which it seeks to ‘manage the perception’ of potential illegal(ized) migrants to the European Union (EU). Taking the self-reflexive perspective of a filmmaker who has documented migrants’ rights violations in several projects and is thus struck by the use of imagery of suffering migrants as a deterrent, I first draw a comparison with the practice of colonial educational cinema, which I argue bares many similarities with the IOM’s ICs. Second, I inscribe them within broader trends in migration management, which have in common a simultaneous spatial expansion beyond the EU’s boundaries and a broadening of the domains they attempt to shape. I then attend to the particular ‘media dispositif’ the IOM constitutes in its campaign in Cameroon and question the actual effects of its campaigns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google, and Jared Cohen, Founder and Director of Google Ideas, contend that ‘for governments and companies’, the user-generated content that constitutes big data is ‘a gift, enabling them to better respond to citizen and customer concerns, and, within the emergent field of predictive analysis, to predict what the future will hold’. In this article, I interrogate what it means for data from our social lives to be interpreted as a ‘gift’ by private enterprises such as Google. Who is giving what to whom? What is the nature of the transaction? Whose property is this data? By putting into conversation Schmidt and Cohen’s gift thesis with an analysis of the ‘value’ of participation in digital communication networks, this article seeks to uncover an intellectual property conundrum that legitimizes the rise of new kinds of labour vulnerabilities in the digital age; intensifying the extension of the logic of privatization into our digital social lives; and, in doing so, the importance of intellectual property as a language of critique and resistance. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Measuring media criticism of war and political elites: A response to Florian Zollmann",
    "abstract": "In his 2011 article, ‘Managing the elite consensus’, Florian Zollmann takes issue with a number of arguments put forward in Pockets of Resistance: British News Media, War and Theory in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq (Robinson et al., 2010). This book was the endproduct of a research project1 that examined UK television news and press coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, focusing mainly on the invasion phase (mid-March to midApril). Our central conclusions were that most UK news outlets, for reasons of humanitarian warfare ideology, over-reliance upon official sources, and patriotism, failed to maintain their independence (pp.161–172). But we also noted that there were exceptions, and, due to factors such as professional autonomy, event-driven news and UK mediasystem characteristics, a minority of media outlets (Channel 4 News, The Mirror, The Guardian and The Independent) were able to exercise meaningful levels of independence from the government position (pp.172–176). We also noted that both patriotism and humanitarian warfare ideology were limiting factors on the degree of independence exercised by these media outlets (p.177). In criticising our account, Zollmann argues that by over-measuring media criticism, we incorrectly claim that UK media performance deviated, on occasions and across a minority of media outlets, from the predictions of elite-driven accounts of media-state relations (e.g. Herman and Chomsky, 1988). In this response, we first identify several issues in need of clarification and correction. We then pick up and expand on the matter of procedural vs substantive media criticism,",

More specifically, it suggests that Radio Tierra makes evident the emergence of a new form of social communication which, in contrast to the traditional liberal model of communication of, and for, information, is more attuned to the new functions of culture in the expansion and implementation of citizenship under conditions of (neo-liberal) globalization. After a discussion of the contemporary media scene and the role of public journalism and alternative communication in Latin America, the article then focuses on the communicational, political and cultural work of Radio Tierra. In 1990, along with the transition to democracy, Radio Tierra (RT) was born in Santiago as an independent station. Using its trajectory, I will try to concretely show some important connections between globalization, neo-liberalism and culture in contemporary Chile. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship between culture and mass media has received much attention among communication scholars in Latin America, especially during the 1980s and 1990s. This period witnessed a shift from understanding culture and mass communication as domination, to an exploration of the complex and politically nuanced roles played by the mass media within the cultural and political fabrics of the region. As such, the ideological and deterministic moorings of the old debates were considerably softened, as writers such as Martín-Barbero redefined the media in terms of cultural mediations. From this perspective, cultural mediations shape the manner in which subjects articulate their relationship to modernity. This article continues this agenda by exploring the complex relationship between culture, politics and democracy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media systems around the world have changed in significant ways in the early 21st century. In this article, I analyse how various forms of media subsidies have changed in response to these transformations in a sample of six different affluent democracies. On the basis of interviews, official documents and secondary sources, I show that media subsidies have largely remained frozen in their late-20th century form. The absence of major reform means that media subsidies are increasingly subject to policy drift, a process by which the operations and effectiveness of policies change not because of deliberate reform, but because of changing conditions on the ground. Analysis of interviews with relevant stakeholders suggests that the main obstacles to reform across all six countries are: (1) limited political attention to the problem; (2) strong incumbent industries protecting their interests; and (3) a perceived shortage of desirable, cost-effective, and governable alternatives to existing policies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "standings are outside of this project and the pressure rationally to justify beliefs is not a universal given, thus the playing field is not ‘level’. Downey also critiques overly egalitarian conceptions of the internet by pointing out the economic and geographical imbalances in its use, as well as reminding us of the corporate ownership of apparently ‘free’ networking sites like MySpace. The attempts to reconcile plurality with commonality is the essential puzzle, with inclusiveness, openness and reflexivity alternately strengthening and eroding those threads of commonality which make genuine democracy tenable. While there is no doubt that radical democracy is politically enabled by the presence of internet media, and that radical democracy can square its project with the internet’s promotion of difference and lead to a new kind of democracy altogether, this book also stands out by acknowledging that, just as the military and academic personnel who invented the internet for secure communications inadvertently created the opposite, so too will the internet bear mixed blessings for those who seek political change. It offers everything we asked for, but a lot more that we did not.",

It does, however, provide an indication of van Es’ larger research programme (see, for example, her 2017 edited collection with Mirko Tobias Schäfer, The Datafied Society). The conclusion clearly rearticulates the book’s thesis – that liveness is a productive construction made possible by the interactions of institutions, platforms, users and social contexts. The cases largely contribute to supporting this claim and provide triangulation by highlighting distinct aspects of liveness. On the whole, the book deftly imposes a tentative order on a complex and wide-ranging set of issues without enforcing an arbitrary boundary or set of immutable rules. While the text falls somewhat short in answering the difficult question posed by its title (what is the future of live?), it is nonetheless effective in introducing advanced students and mass media researchers to the complexities of liveness, and itself makes a lively contribution to the field.",

But how do aid workers conceptualize and operationalize a politics of voice within media production processes? How do ideas about giving voice to others shape aid agencies’ engagement with mainstream news organizations? This article explores two contrasting news production case studies which took place in South Sudan and Mali, involving Save the Children, Christian Aid and their local partners. It finds that different approaches to giving voice exist in aid work, creating tensions within and between agencies. In addition commercialized notions of value for money, the influence of mediated donor reporting, and aid workers’ weak understandings of linguistic and intercultural interpretation combined to make aid agencies’ values-in-action far less empowering than they assumed. </jats:p>",

The body of laws regulating digital content today does not show across-the-board vagueness, but an ‘unbalanced’ development with elaborated rules in some legal areas, yet ambiguous stipulations in some others. The ‘vagueness’ of the law is part of the political and ideological ambiguity of China’s reform and development and will not be resolved independently of larger and more profound transformations of the Chinese state and society. The development of digital content laws in China can only make sense in specific historical contexts rather than by comparing against an idealized Western legal order. </jats:p>",

The article pays special attention to the development of the internet in Egypt, examining such issues as online connectivity, content and its Arabization. It argues that as a major provider of media content in the Arab world, and particularly with a new technocrat government, Egypt has the potential to lead the way towards greater democratization of communication and strengthening of civil society in the region. </jats:p>",

In light of the general elections in 2019, veteran Indian journalists, during in-depth interviews, discussed how social media influenced political discourse and enabled a polarized political narrative that gave rise to aggressive nationalism and majoritarian viewpoints. Journalists asserted that social media were instrumental in setting the agenda for the mainstream media and that social media had redefined their professional roles as the platforms enabled the politicians to bypass the mainstream news media and reach the voters directly. </jats:p>",

It studies a protracted engagement between Google and nation states on the ability of the newly launched software Google Earth to zoom in on classified locations. Reading this tussle as an engagement between an older form of sovereignty and a newer one, this article argues that new media entities such as Google represent a new modality of power, increasingly making inroads into the Westphalian nation-state system. This new mode of power operates by presenting itself as ‘centerless’ thus claiming to operate in the interests of the larger global good. Given their architecture as a ‘distributed network’ they are increasingly difficult to regulate, thus making their challenge hard to counter. Interrogating their claim of having no interests of their own, this article argues that digital networks continue to reify older hierarchies within the global order even as they claim to erase those very hierarchies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Alter-globalization movement (AGM) studies have been thus far focused almost exclusively on the left movements’ struggles against neo-liberal globalization. This article uses the Tea Party movement to demonstrate how a right-wing movement reacts to neo-liberal globalization. It discusses the grass-roots Tea Partiers’ (TPers) diagnoses and prognoses of neo-liberal globalization’s impacts in three realms: the US economy, popular control of the political processes and the preservation of the national community. My findings show that while the TPers largely agree with the left AGMs in locating the problems and causes of neo-liberal globalization, their solutions diverge sharply from that of the latter and point to a US-dominated neo-liberal global order. By thematizing conservative movements’ relation to AGM, this article indicates the possible coalitions and cleavages between the right-wing movements and left-leaning AGMs, which suggest that AGMs should not be solely defined negatively vis-à-vis neo-liberal globalization. </jats:p>",

A social network analysis of Al Jazeera America’s following on Twitter reveals that 42 per cent of Al Jazeera America’s followers did not follow any other US news outlet and that most of the remaining 58 per cent followed liberal stations. The findings illustrate mainstream US news consumers’ reluctance to follow Al Jazeera America, which only appealed to specific audiences. The analysis portrays the challenges facing counter-hegemonic contra-flow stations such as Al Jazeera America in their bid to gain legitimacy in the West, and specifically in the United States, and highlights the relevance of selective exposure and hostile media theories in the case of counter-flowing stations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "On 30 September 2005 the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten published the now famous 12 cartoons of the Holy ProphetMuhammed. For the Danish mass media such obvious provocation onthe part of Jyllands-Posten (JP ) was not really newsworthy . After all JP hadpublished confrontational anti-Islamic pieces many times before. Onlywhen Muslim communities began to react to the offending cartoons andnative Danish groups of authors, doctors, dentists, ministers, and othersreacted to the tone of the media debate on ethnic minorities, did themass media begin to cover the cartoon issue and reactions to it. Theco v erag e g rew m o re in ten se w h en P rim e M in ister A n d ers Fo g h R asm u ssencommitted a blunder by refusing to meet with 11 ambassadors repre-senting half a billion Muslim people. Unable to have a dialogue with theDanish government, the ambassadors turned to their governments in theMiddle East, while Islamic individuals and groups went to the samecountries to talk about the cartoons. One Danish imam phrased it thisway: Earlier when we went abroad to talk about anti-Islamic sentimentsin Denmark, few people really believed us. W ith Othe ticking bombOcartoon, ever yone knew exactly what we were talking about and wasoutraged (Alev , 2005). From here the stor y turned truly global andreleased what has been called the most serious crisis in Danish foreignpolicy since the Second W orld W ar.In the course of events experts of all kinds have joined in tocomment on and explain the unfolding global news stor y. Localreactions were predictable, some said, because the cartoons had simplytriggered local outrage and frustration, ignited by social and politicaltension. The cartoons were not really the problem. Others explained thatmass demonstrations and burning of flags were done without protestershaving even seen the cartoons. Many words and much ink were wastedon discussing whether the cartoons should have been published or not.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay argues against reducing the recent history of global television to an oversimplified transition between ‘statist’ and ‘consumerist’ dispensations. As apparently irreconcilable ideologies of television, the statist and consumerist models represent two ways of imagining the relation between the deployment of media and the project of modernity. Despite their surface differences, both share a tendency to imagine television in primarily ‘representative’ rather than ‘constitutive’ terms: they both evaluate television according to its ability to represent or address supposedly pre-existing publics, as opposed to its power to help constitute those very publics. I develop the question of the constitutive potential of television by reconsidering a decade of Indian television history – the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s – that is generally dismissed as a transitional phase between statist and consumerist paradigms. Through a discussion that is empirically grounded in the Indian experience, I propose categories that might inform comparative explorations of media and modernity in an age of globalization. </jats:p>",

A lexical content analysis of the words and phrases of three key documents – final Recommendations of the MacBride Report and WSIS final Declarations from the Geneva Summit (official and alternative) – enable us to identify continuity and change in international policy discourses on communication imbalances, the role of information technologies for development and their implications for human and communication rights. The discussion of the findings points out similarities and differences between the narratives of yesterday and today and how these relate to developments in the social and political environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "however, it is clear that policymakers also yearn for more reliable information about the users and non-users of broadband technologies. Considering its varied topics, Interacting with Broadband Society is a relatively wellorganized book. The chapters provide the reader with both methodological and conceptual insights as well as investigations ranging from the individual to national and supranational levels. There is a noticeable absence of community level analysis, which would have shed more light on how people interact and assemble in broadband society. Overall, it seems that the book deals more with the concept of e-actors (explaining what e-actors are all about) than with broadband society, where e-actors live and interact with others. Lastly, it would be unfair not to mention that the book lacks a uniform style. The varied use of capital letters in titles, unnecessary hyphens in the body text and unfinished lists of references stick out unpleasantly from the book. Despite this criticism, the book is a great introduction to Peter Lang’s new book series because it presents guidelines for understanding the essence of human agency in the socio-technical structures of broadband societies.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article presents the main results of the investigation, ‘Current Situation and Prospects of Spanish Cooperation in Culture and Communication with the Rest of Ibero-America, 1997–2007’. The text offers an overview of the initiatives which took place during the period studied, by country, cultural and media sectors, agents involved, and type of activity. Spain’s role in terms of cooperation in culture and communication is analysed, and a reflection on the possibility of building an Ibero-American cultural space appropriate to the new digital scene is also included. Although Ibero-America has traditionally been a privileged geopolitical space for Spanish cooperation policy, this was not developed until well into the new millennium, evolving from simplistic and rhetorical visions based on instrumental conceptions of culture and communication to a gradual recognition of the fact that cooperation is much more than the classical actions of dissemination and promotion of Spanish cultural products. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "global infotainment, argues Thussu, was created in the 1990s amidst the seeming ideological triumph of free market neo-liberalism. By 2006, a substantial section of the world’s media business was owned by fewer than 10 corporations, most based in the US. Many new satellite channels seem motivated by nationalist politics, not commerce. We know that early research on the production of net content has also revealed locational concentration. New locations may emerge, but their relationship to global economic and military power may not change. The question arises whether there is any path within this infrastructure towards an alternative ‘liberal’ regime, providing independent, diverse content. Is infotainment – which has a long history – a bad thing, or is it the excess of it, concentrated control and crowding out of diversity, that produces the ‘bad’? As Thussu points out, some make the case for ‘good infotainment’ as serving the wider populace better (pp. 162–6). Where in the ambitions of ‘neo-liberal imperialism’ does one place the dominance of local programming in India, even via ‘Murdochization’, or the Indian state broadcaster retaining the highest level of audience (p. 110), the rising percentage of listeners of National Public Radio in America (p. 168), and the greater diversity of global broadcast television within the concentration of ownership (p. 176)? In raising such questions the book fulfils its purpose of cutting through the highly unfocused lament over global infotainment and injecting a sharp argument of international political relations into the most influential media manifestation of our times.",

It argues that the symbolic power of transnational broadcasting consists primarily in its capacity to manage the visibility of suffering so as to reproduce the moral deficiencies of global inequality. However, under certain conditions, technological as well as symbolic, satellite news stories might be able to produce a sense of moral agency that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries, thereby constituting cosmopolitan communities of emotion and action. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The definition and local cultural adoption of globally generated terms such as environment and sustainable development happen largely through an imbricated process of meaning negotiation within democratic public discourse. Framing behaviour by media and influential opinion makers shapes and moulds local and national discourse about environment and sustainability, particularly in developing countries where pro-development forces face off against pro-conservation groups over resource use choices. Using elements of framing and grounded theory, a qualitative interpretive case study analysis of environment and sustainability related articles from a leading English language fortnightly magazine in India reveals that highly emotive frames are being used in media construction of the environment and sustainability discourse in India. While the research findings suggest that stock themes from the international framing repertoire are in use, they also indicate that distinctive new frames are being employed that could assist in instigating social change and refashioning public attitudes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "reader to wonder if perhaps this is why digital platforms have been studiously left out of the global media mix for so long. Another missed chance comes at the end of the book, which does not finish with a concluding chapter. Perhaps a matter of taste for some scholars, but particularly in a textbook that seeks to break new ground, the lack of a concluding chapter is strongly felt. Finally, one wonders if there are not missed opportunities in focus. A fair amount of the book seems to go through the paces of highlighting company ownership and revenues, but it does not venture into the most significant contemporary issues connected with digital platforms, specifically anti-trust, platform wars and competition, relentless freedom of speech issues, etc. Comparing and contrasting ownership issues of digital platforms with “traditional” media companies could bear fruit for the field and bring it to the next level. Globalization and Media in the Digital Platform Age by Dal Yong Jin represents a more inclusive and realistic approach to a textbook for students of media globalization, global communication, and global media studies by including digital platforms in its scope. However welcome or controversial this may be, the basic template for textbooks in the area of media and globalization survives with this volume. If building on the bedrock of historical background and using quantitative approaches to describe the present—as it was, inevitably—then this title is a strong one. Perhaps the next step, however, is to break with the descriptive quantitative approach to global media, and more actively pursue the “convergence of political economy and cultural studies” that the author sees as being “especially crucial as several digital platforms, including Netflix and Facebook, act as content producer, distributor, and consumer at the same time” (p. 33).",

    "abstract": "In the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, the Chinese national team was nowhere to be found. However, the Chinese presence could be felt in the buzzing vuvuzelas. According to the Associated Press, up to 90 per cent of the vuvuzelas sold in South Africa during the World Cup were made in China. This is only one case of the fast increasing trade between China and Africa. China’s recent economic and political involvement in Africa has put their bilateral relations under a broad scrutiny. Some in the West argue that China is trying to colonize Africa and repeating what Western colonists did centuries ago, while others maintain that China’s engagement with African countries is strictly a business that will help China get the minerals and oil it needs to fuel its growing economy without intervention in Africa’s internal sovereignty. Meanwhile, some African countries consider China as more than an economic partner, as someone who can offer an alternative development model. This reflective essay focuses on China’s perception of Africa by investigating how Africa is presented in two of China’s major newspapers – the China Daily and the People’s Daily. The article then examines the Chinese government’s first policy statement on Africa. During Chairman Mao’s era, Sino-African relations were characterized by ideological and strategic considerations. China saw itself as the leader of the Third World and thus African nations were treated as natural allies in China’s struggle against Western ‘imperialism’ and Soviet ‘revisionism’. This philosophy has remained a key component of China’s Africa policy (Shelton, 2001). In the meantime, China realized the importance of African nations in the diplomatic competition with Taiwan (which uses the Republic of China as its official name), especially in the United Nations. In 1971, the United Nations recognized the People’s Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China, and Chairman Mao later appraised, ‘It is our African brothers who lifted us into the UN’.1 The idea ARTICLE",

Globalization seemed weightless, giving Marx and Engels’ famous diagnosis that ‘all that is solid melts into air’ a new prophetic spin as capitalism and (Western) modernity re-ordered a globe now variously conceived as an array of flows, enhanced mobilities and reconstituted spaces.

    "title": "State, culture and anti-Muslim racism",
    "abstract": "In the context of the War on Terror there has been a rise in anti-Muslim racism across Europe which is based on the notion of opposed cultural values. The supposed cultural values of a unified and homogenous ‘West’ are set in opposition to those of an essentialized and homogenous ‘Islam’, and we are told there is a clash of civilizations. There is a long history of situating and justifying racism in relation to cultural difference. In the UK the Thatcher era invoked the idea of ‘cultural difference’ with the rise of a new racism which hid old ideas of Western superiority behind the claim that British culture was being ‘swamped’ by alien cultures. Anti-Muslim racism re-animates these ideas, but today this coincides with a wholesale attack on multiculturalism and the drive to assimilation. The question is – why is anti-Muslim racism anchored in these attacks on multiculturalism? As Gary Younge (2011) has recently pointed out, multiculturalism and racism have long co-existed. He asserts that ‘in this debate there are two types of multiculturalism: one rooted in fact, the other in fiction’. The first is:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article refutes dominant views that define evangelical indigenous media as intrinsic tools for religious indoctrination. The case of the Colombian Misak community shows that evangelical radio stations can contribute to community building. However, the degree of the positive or negative contribution of evangelical media depends on the dominance of evangelical presence at indigenous localities. The rapid expansion of indigenized evangelical groups via the provision of social services has radicalized Evangelicals against views different from their own. As a result, these evangelical media are progressively leaving their role as promoters of positive social change to become tools for religious indoctrination. </jats:p>",

Both of these inevitably compromised the scope and influence of the CPBF’s work, and Rob Hackett does not shrink from analysing these and other problems the CPBF had to negotiate. The authors are clear too about the limits of media activism: ‘it is not enough for media activism to remain within the realm of media. To democratize public communication implies a broader social transformation’ (p. 208). I suspect that it is this dual concern that draws many people into media activism. It is what in the US is perceived a ‘wedge issue’ and certainly many of the people who attended the Free Press Media Reform conferences in Madison, St Louis and Memphis cared deeply about media reform but they also wanted a better society. The authors of Remaking Media also clearly do too.",

Berlusconi’s story as entrepreneur and tician and the party that he founded are so important for Italy that cannot talk about books about him without discussing how these ks enter into today’s political debate and struggles and how they play le in the diffused practices of public discourse in Italy. Therefore, the er will find below not only a synthesis of the most important books he former Italian Prime Minister, otherwise known as ‘il cavaliere’, an orary title he was granted several years ago, but also a review of them an attempt to understand how they enter into Italian public debate. Among the many records that Berlusconi can boast, one might include of being the politician about whom the greatest number of books, is, the greatest number of negative books, has been written while still e. There are very few world leaders who can boast the number of vols written about themselves that Berlusconi can, volumes that, except one, to my knowledge, depict him in a negative way. I must also add most of the books on Berlusconi have been bestsellers, testifying to existence of a rather vast public interested in criticism of the cavaliere. The only book that exalts his image deals with Berlusconi ‘the epreneur’ and was written in 1985, long before his name became ciated with equivocal dealings. Except for this book I maghi del canale zards of the Channel) (Farinotti, 1985), which recounts the tycoon of re’s television adventure in an almost hagiographic way, the litere regarding Berlusconi is decidedly hostile. Trying to understand the ons behind such hostility is a necessary operation to better interpret current political situation in Italy and the relations between usconi and a considerable part of the Italian intelligentsia. The ‘negative’ literature on Berlusconi can be divided into two main s: those books that predominantly analyse the figure of Berlusconi as",

The article argues that the failure of Indian governments to make the most of radio and television for economic and social development stemmed from three sources: (i) the restrictive policies inherited from a colonial state; (ii) the puritanism of the Gandhian national movement; and (iii) the fear, made vivid by the 1947 partition, of inflaming social conflict. The policies and institutions established in the 1940s and 1950s shaped Indian broadcasting for the next 40 years and have been significantly subverted only since 1992 as a result of the transformation effected by satellite television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Little theoretical work from non-Western perspectives has entered the epistemological discussion of universal ethical principles for media and journalism. The increased analysis of media globalization requires a closer examination of the ethical principles being advocated by media theorists. We use postcolonial theory to argue that advocates of universal media ethics need to take into account the history of colonialism, differences of powers between nations and peoples, and the importance of indigenous theory. We contend that in the non-Western world underlying conditions of postcoloniality and indigenous values influence how media professionals and journalists make ethical decisions. These interpretations present an epistemic challenge to dominant ethical concepts based primarily on Western Enlightenment philosophies. The article concludes with a discussion of two specific ethical theories, ubuntu from South Africa and ahimsa from India, which illustrate the importance of indigenous knowledge in the search for global media ethics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The term ‘Chindia’ is relatively incoherent, since these two countries share few characteristics other than their sheer size and their consequent significance to the global community. They will indeed be major economic, social, and cultural forces in the 21st century, and their impact on global media is likely to be profound. Yet colliding the two names together does not make them complementary companions. It does, however, invite critical comparisons, some of which can be quite revealing. Most interesting are their diverging patterns of institutional organization and regulation. Indian film and television operates at arm’s length from the state in a relatively open market economy. Chinese media on the other hand is held close by a state apparatus that fears criticism, democracy, and populism, as well as a host of ‘cultural contaminants’ that include on-screen depictions of horror, violence, and sexuality. Equally intriguing is the fact that these structural differences have manifested themselves in the diverging fortunes of the two industries with respect to globalization. Indian screen media are successfully expanding their range throughout South Asia and increasingly in Africa, the Mideast, Europe, and North America. Chinese film and television on the other hand seems to be mired in a state of disarray. Occasional blockbusters circulate beyond East Asia, but the film industry is now renowned for a yawning gap between state-sanctioned extravaganzas and sadly undernourished midrange and independent movies. Television likewise suffers from various institutional constraints, so that mainland China, which is by far the world’s largest national television market, remains a net importer of programming. Such diverging fortunes are also manifested in the geography of these respective media industries. Fifteen years ago, Bombay – the enduring center of the Indian movie business – was rapidly becoming an important node of the India’s nascent commercial TV industry, an emerging ARTICLE",

The purpose is to bring into sharp focus the imprint of global capitalism and imperialism on China’s domestic social-spatial relations as well as the well-entrenched underdevelopment dynamics in communications. It argues that communications, shaped successively by historical configurations of relationships, domesticated spatially China’s peripheral position in the world capitalist system. This spatiality, expressing internal underdevelopment and external subordination, had never been effectively overhauled and even remained true of socialist modernity after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which then has informed and deformed communications development since the country’s market reform. </jats:p>",

One influence factor to be considered in the area of framing is media input, which consists of materials that political actors send to newsrooms to facilitate their work while influencing the news. To find out to what extent the government’s frames for the Merida Initiative influenced news frames, we identified the issue-specific frames of the initiative, measured their presence in newspapers and media input, and conducted eight cross-lagged correlation analyses. On seven occasions, the correlation went above the baseline. For this reason, it was concluded that the salience of frames in media input had a significant role in the salience of frames in news. </jats:p>",

It matches public agendas with media agendas to investigate agenda-setting effects in 11 countries worldwide, then compares media agendas across countries to consider whether inter-nation intermedia influence exists. Results suggest a general pattern of the agenda-setting function of mass media in the countries examined. The study finds evidence of inter-nation intermedia influence and thus presents a new way to look at the intermedia agenda-setting relationship – moving this research from comparisons within a local area to cross-national intermedia comparisons. Furthermore, this study checks for evidence of directional inter-nation intermedia agenda-setting. The findings suggest a complex inter-nation intermedia relationship and imply that, in the age of globalization, the simple ‘powerful West’ reasoning derived from the old days may need to be rethought and updated. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mediated modernities: (Meta)narratives of modern nationhood in Indian and Pakistani media, 1947–2007",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding modernity as lying at the intersection of two dimensions: (1) the narrative of modernity as interpreted variously in particular nations and (2) the metanarrative of modernity as a universal goal that nations tend to share. It demonstrates that interpretations of modernity vary among nations, and even within nations over time. But modernity in former European colonies is nonetheless an ideological construct that seeks validation from the West. News media, this article shows, constitute a vital mechanism through which both the narratives and the metanarrative of modernity become collective. The media naturalize particular interpretations of modernity while also making ‘becoming modern’ a necessary objective of nationhood in non-Western societies. Empirical evidence comes from the comparative study of India’s Hindustan Times and Pakistan’s Dawn newspapers over a 60-year period (1947–2007) after the two nations gained freedom from British colonialism, using Derrida’s method of deconstruction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article attempts to answer a question: how far can we view the broadcasting of Arabic-language television in France in the context of a tension between the construction of the Other (and the dangerous difference this implies) and the ways in which the Others so constructed are able to negotiate their status as transnational social actors? Since the early 1990s, these television channels have appeared both to extend and to catalyze the contradictions at work in French society. To extend them, in so far as the opinions expressed, as well as the public actions undertaken, in this domain have often borne the mark of an undisguised hostility closely related to the inherited representations of colonialism (intrinsic differences, special cases, etc.), and to catalyze them, because history does not precisely repeat itself; the many different ways in which these channels are received (from indifference to infatuation) by the communities formed by postcolonial immigration call into question those very representations and require us to conceive of a transnationality not confined by place (here versus there). </jats:p>",

    "title": "Asian modernities: Culture, politics and media",
    "abstract": "This special issue joins a growing and vibrant conversation that has occurred in the last decade in the social sciences and humanities about what ‘modernity’ means beyond the West. As the geopolitical gravity of the world shifts and new rearrangements of global power – especially in Asia – articulate new logics of presence in the contemporary world, the question of how modernity is (and has been) experienced and expressed beyond the West emerges as an important postcolonial question confronting our global present and future. Asserting that modernity has never been the sole or even original property of the West – although the West has certainly constructed its false sense of superiority through such a claim – scholars have underscored the need to attend to ‘habitations of modernity’ (Chakraborty, 2002) in geographies, societies, regions and nations beyond the West. The goal of such a move is to denaturalize the equation between the ‘modern/progress’ and the West. But the move is much more as well. Inviting us to recognize that modernity has existed in diverse national and geographical contexts not only beyond the West, but also before the so-called civilizations and colonial empires of Europe, initiatives centered on non-Western modernities attempt to question the dominant linear singular thesis of modernity (in the Western academy) – whereby modernity is seen as having spread from the West into less ‘backward’ parts of the world. Such initiatives remind us that ‘when modern world history contemplates its achievements and transformations ... it fails to represent the passions and perversities of those modernities that have a pre or postcolonial genealogy’ (Bhabha, 2002: xi). An exercise aimed at exploring numerous practices of the modern in societies, nations and geographies hitherto denied the status of the ‘modern’ by histories of European colonialism, the Cold War and, today, a post-2001 world map, is not merely a philosophical, intellectual or cultural exercise. It is very centrally a political and even a geopolitical exercise. Shifting and expanding the terms of reference as to what constitutes the modern, how the modern has been practiced, experienced and expressed in diverse locations",

    "title": "Cultural diversity policies in Europe: Between integration and security",
    "abstract": "‘One of the great challenges of our time must now surely be to ensure that our rich cultural diversity makes us more secure – not less’. With these words, United Nations (UN) secretary-general Ban Ki-moon (2008) drew a clear connection between issues of cultural diversity and international security. Ban Ki-moon spoke in a peculiar context framed by the 11 September 2001 (9/11) attacks against the United States and the Madrid and London bombings of 2004 and 2005, all attributed to Islamist terrorist groups. In 2005, against the prospects of a ‘clash of civilizations’, the UN had implemented an ‘Alliance of Civilizations’ (UNAOC, 2006) with the co-sponsorship of the Spanish and Turkish prime ministers in the hope of building ‘bridges between societies’ and appeasing conflicts ‘threatening international stability’ (p. 3). Ban Ki-moon’s statement pointed to an understudied dimension of ‘cultural diversity’ policies. Indeed, such policies are also meant to ‘build bridges’ between and within societies with a view to easing tensions that threaten international and national security. Within this framework, the media are seen both as an obstacle to cultural diversity policies and as a major tool at the latter’s disposal. According to the UNAOC (2006), the media are forces that shape ‘stereotypes and misrepresentations’, fuelling antagonisms between communities and raising security problems, but also instruments able to ‘reduce cross cultural tensions and to build bridges between [these] communities’ (pp. 25, 31). Cultural diversity policies are infused with a rhetoric that makes it difficult to critically explore their nature: After all, how could one be against diversity? Yet, as this special",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews the range of views that are grouped together under the heading `theories of globalization'. Rather than advocating one from the range of conflicting theories, the article attempts to establish the basic ideas that they have in common. These, mostly very abstract, ideas are then developed in order to arrive at propositions that may be examined in relation to evidence about the contemporary world. It is found that none of the five major planks upon which most theories of globalization rest are accurate. On the contrary, even quite easily available evidence contradicts them. It is therefore concluded that, whatever their popular appeal, theories of globalization are not an accurate guide to the investigation of the world. The distorted consequences that flow from an adherence to a mistaken theory are demonstrated through a consideration of the nature of contemporary migration, which is shown to be an overwhelmingly intra-state, rather than transnational, phenomenon. It is argued that processes like this, and the other developments considered here, are better explained by developing the same kinds of analytic tools that were appropriate to an earlier phase of capitalist development. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Compressed modernity in South China",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the changing role of Hong Kong in what I propose as the formation of a compressed modernity in South China. In the 1980s through the 1990s, the Hong Kong liberal mediascape was over-spilling onto many developing cities in south China, fueling the desire for modernity among the people in the region. Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the Greater Pearl River Delta, in which Hong Kong is a small but influential city, has become increasingly interconnected socially, culturally and in terms of infrastructure. The formation of this ‘compressed modernity’ is illustrated by four case studies. In case one, a magazine had become the site of imagining modernity via the representations of Hong Kong society in the 1980s. In case two, a television drama in the 1990s vividly expressed the longing for knowledge of the capitalistic market. Case three is an ethnographic study of a toy factory in South China, which, in the 2000s, was managed by Hong Kong managers equipped with modern skills of marketing, logistics, and international trade. Case four is another ethnographic study, this time of a disco bar, which demonstrates the juxtaposition of the lifeworlds of the working class and the consumerist lifestyle of the rising middle class in the region. The ‘compressed modernity’, as illustrated by these cases and theorized in this article, has multiple socio-cultural layers juxtaposed against each other, rendering it a social formation very different from popular versions of modernity in developed countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since Turkey became a candidate for the European Union in 1999, democratic rights and freedom of expression have been key issues in discourses surrounding EU—Turkey relations. Discussions on these questions often centre on state censorship and legislative constraints. The role of the media themselves, however, and the deeply-ingrained elements and historically-contingent norms and practices within public culture that shape the public sphere, have received a significantly lower level of attention. Despite recent legislative changes towards greater freedom of expression, major hurdles that limit democratic rights and freedoms persist in practice, as highlighted by the judicial trial (and the subsequent murder in January 2007) of the Armenian-Turkish journalist Hrant Dink. The police raid of Nokta magazine in 2007 is another case in point. The purpose of this article is to discuss current questions related with freedom of expression and tolerance of diversity in the Turkish media based on in-depth interviews with journalists and with the Dink and Nokta cases as examples; and to offer critical reflections on the public sphere in Turkey in its current state. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The peace journalism (PJ) field now has an appreciable amount of published material to show for its first decade of serious operation, in research, teaching and training alike. It amounts to a serious project to reform professional education programmes in journalism. But so far, the proposed remedies are more individual projects than coordinated and organized reforms; they are scattered geographically and do not have a global scope. This article discusses the need for a joint approach together with universities, colleges, training institutes and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and inter-governmental organizations, if PJ is to contribute to establishing journalism as an important factor in international norm-setting and to raise the profession’s ethical standards with regard to violent conflicts. To enable this, further conceptual development is also necessary. A combination of Johan Galtung’s PJ approach, with insights from critical discourse analysis (CDA), offers a way of managing the demand for contextual reflexivity that has been raised in the debate about PJ. CDA offers an opportunity to address war and peace issues in a more comprehensive manner, integrating analysis of the propaganda discourses during peacetime, underestimated by Galtung in his model. </jats:p>",

We try here to understand to what extent pirated goods constitute, for millions of consumers in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Maghreb, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and also in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, a major means of access to the products of local, regional and international cultural industries. By doing this, we will shed light on some of the underground channels through which cultural globalization is operating. </jats:p>",

    "title": "When citizen photojournalism sets the news agenda: Neda Agha Soltan as a Web 2.0 icon of post-election unrest in Iran",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article discusses the current rise of citizen photojournalism, which has received little scholarly scrutiny. Drawing on a case study of the mobile telephone footage of the Iranian woman Neda Agha Soltan, who was killed during a demonstration in Iran in June 2009, the article investigates the ethical dilemmas of the Western news media’s eager use of citizen photojournalism as a unique and headline-grabbing source. While these images may grant us insight into areas of tension, to which the media has no other access, amateur footage challenges the ethical standards of conventional journalism with its fragmentary and subjective format, not to mention the difficulties involved in tracking a clip’s author and origin. Even though the news media indisputably play an essential role as a platform for editorial selection and communication of citizen photojournalism, this article points to a general lack of editorial procedures for accommodating these new sources. </jats:p>",

This paper encapsulates the trends and patterns in the media sphere through the talk show, Simi Selects India’s Most Desirable and how it flourished as a celebrity’s brand augmenting platform. The study reads into commodification of content, links it to capitalism and also how it is a celebrity branding or rebranding platform. Using the talk show as an apparatus, this work integrates the political economy of communication approach with Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). </jats:p>",

In an attempt to answer this question, I employ Vladimir Lenin’s analysis of imperialism. Paying particular attention to the relevance of media and information, I test Lenin’s theories against macroeconomic statistical analysis of existing data. My analysis is structured according to Lenin’s five characteristics of imperialism: (1) the role of economic concentration; (2) the dominance of finance capital; (3) the importance of capital export; (4) the spatial stratification of the world as result of corporate dominance; and (5) the political dimension of the spatial stratification of the world. The results demonstrate that Lenin’s theories should be reloaded for contemporary media and communication studies. </jats:p>",

    "title": "News framing of the ‘Detroit Bomber’ in the Nigerian press",
    "abstract": "On 25 December, 2009 the world was greeted by the story of a young Nigerian who, according to the reports, attempted to destroy a US airliner to Detroit, Michigan. His name is Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. This story was shocking not only to the outside world but also to Nigerians because of the background of the alleged perpetrator: he had received a sound education right from childhood, and had attended some of the best schools including University College London. A point of interest here is that Nigeria is a country that is regionally divided between the north and the south. The ownership of the media is predominantly southern (Oyovbaire, 2001; Yusha’u, 2010a, 2010b) but with a handful of newspapers in the northern part of the country. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is from the northern city of Katsina. This raised a number of questions: how would the predominantly southern press, with predominantly Christian ownership, frame the story involving a Muslim terror suspect? How would a northern newspaper with a Muslim ownership frame the story? What are the implications of this story within the context of the ‘global war on terrorism’? These are the questions that this paper would like to explore.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent years have seen numerous attempts by community broadcasters around the world to reinvent their practices in an effort to remain relevant and financially sustainable in the digital age. One proposed initiative is to have community programming distributed via satellite, either in the form of a single channel or as a subscription service for local stations to find programming. Combining two case studies and multiple research methods, this article investigates the potential impact of satellite distribution on community broadcasting in Canada and East Africa. We observe that it is often not the community media organizations themselves that are pushing for satellite delivery, but, rather, outside actors such as media corporations and non-governmental organizations. As a result, we argue that a more spirited discussion within the community media sector is warranted to better understand the implications of this technological shift in delivery mechanisms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The field of media and communication studies has been dominated by attempts to explain the nature and context of mainstream cultural production and reproduction. This is for good reason – in advanced capitalist societies mass cultural production and, some would argue, our means of expression have been largely subsumed within the interests of multinational conglomerates operating globally for the pursuit of profit. This has material and symbolic consequences for the way we live our lives and imagine our world. But this focus is resonant of a tendency to overlook a whole other area of cultural activity that is not profit-led, is rarely mainstream and is set up precisely to challenge the status quo, to engender protest and to struggle against the state, big business and corporate ideology.

The relationship between communication, knowledge and the possibility of transformative practice can be traced back all the way from the trial of Socrates, to the prohibition against literacy among the black slaves of the American South, to the destruction of Iraq’s body of manuscripts and the looting of its historic artefacts. It is knowledge, understood as a communicative and communicable archive, which forms the ground, as well as the scaffolding, for reflection, self-reflection, critique and, in the end, transformative social action. But the communicative chain which results in the possibility of conscious self-fashioning, and of active participation in the fashioning of the social condition, can be broken, or intervened in, at any number of points.

Empirically, we take our point of departure in interviews with photographers, NGO workers, editors and journalists involved in facilitating, producing and initially disseminating the Omran Daqneesh imagery, to explore how – in contrast to the seemingly straightforward communication offered by visual icons – they are in effect the result of an intricate interplay between these actors, which in different ways and for different reasons contribute to spreading the images and determining their significance and meaning. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While Nollywood, Nigeria’s video industry, is largely separate from dominant global cultural industry networks of production inputs and distribution, it is an industry that is still globally linked in a number of ways. In this article, I investigate the nature and layout of these connections via interviews with those populating these networks, from key Nollywood producers to shop owners thousands of miles from Lagos. I conclude that, instead of the formal links of dominant cultural industry networks, these links are mostly via alternative global networks, forged on the flipside of – or the gaps between – the connections that link the Network Society. Some formal international institutions have a presence, but these are largely mediated through Nollywood’s situation in global cultural industry networks. I argue that this renders Nollywood as situated in an alternative media capital, central to alternative networks, while too informal to integrate into dominant networks, and it is from this position that we can best understand Nollywood’s position in global media flows. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Post-9/11 era : To the end of a period",
    "abstract": "The 9/11 attacks constituted a sudden, surprising, international event. They are the archetype of the modern event, as defined by the historian Pierre Nora: first, the modern event takes place within a public space; then, there is always a spectator who can show or speak about it; finally this testimony integrates the event into history (Nora, 1972: 166). In fact, the event takes place visibly within the global public sphere: the public has suddenly become a universal eyewitness. In its brutality, ‘I do not understand’ the event when it happens – it produces surprise and needs an explanation (Derrida et al., 2004: 139). Indeed, the 9/11 attacks needed to be appropriated by people. The media guaranteed this appropriation from the moment of the first impact by multiplying the number of explanatory articles, and the expert responses. The 9/11 attacks combine both a rupture – showing the end of an historical period – and a beginning – opening a new period. This new era was immediately named by the media as ‘after (or post) September 11’. To determine the contours of the post-9/11 period, we opted for an exploratory content analysis. We noted all references of the key words ‘after September 11’ (après 11 septembre) as well as ‘post-9/11’ (post 11 septembre) in a corpus of articles from four newspapers of the French national daily press (Libération [L], Le Monde [LM], Le Figaro [LF] and L’Humanité [LH]). This analysis concerns the title and the body of the article. We identified 589 occurrences of the expression between 12 September 2001 and 30 June 2010. This analysis will help us to define what Dupont describes as a ‘process of terminological creation’ (Dupont, in Rémi-Giraud and Rétat, 1996: 170) of the expression in the post-9/11 period and ask about the outlines of this period described in french press.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It was around 1991 when satellite dishes were first observed on roofs in Tehran. After approximately 25 years, 100 Persian satellite channels launched outside Iran are now broadcasting various programmes for Iranians. This article will provide a short account of Iran’s media environment. The main objective of this article is to examine the developments in Persian satellite channels, which are divided into three periods. The primary features of each will be scrutinized. It will be argued that although these channels have been banned by the Iranian government, they have initiated media pluralism in Iran. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The last few years have witnessed an explosion in the number of 24/7 satellite news channels around the globe. Some theorists have heralded the arrival of 24/7 news delivery systems and channels as definitive of processes of globalization and foundational in the creation of a ‘global public sphere’. Others view them as simply the latest expansion of Western-led corporate interests and vehicles of cultural imperialism, propagating news flows from the West to the rest. This article contributes up-to-date empirical findings and arguments that variously support and problematize aspects of both these overarching theoretical positions and debates and does so by systematically mapping for the first time all 24/7 news channels broadcast in the world today. Our findings reveal a field characterized by complex stratifications, formations and flows that prompt the need for refined conceptualization and theorization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The first pan-regional satellite TV stations in Europe ran into financial difficulties because too few companies had the interest and ability to run international advertising campaigns. Their financial shape improved with the upturn of the pan-European advertising market in the 1990s. The pool of international advertisers expanded as multinationals adjusted their marketing strategy to the challenges and opportunities of globalization. The advertising industry restructured, this article argues, creating media buying agencies with specialist knowledge of pan-European television and the network to run transnational advertising campaigns that mix local and global objectives. Pan-European TV stations began, the article notes, to offer flexible local advertising windows and integrated communication solutions involving cross-format and cross-platform opportunities for advertisers. </jats:p>",

Drawing on media practice theory and ethnographic research on media activism in the World Social Forum, it shows how ‘global publics’ can be constituted through a diverse range of activist communication practices that complicate both conventional hierarchies of scale and contemporary theorizations of publics as personalized networks. It develops an understanding of the global public sphere as an emergent formation made up of multiple, interlinked publics at different scales and emphasizes the significance of collective communication spaces for actors at the margins of the global network society. </jats:p>",

Some scholars note that the growing decline in youth’s news consumption raises concerns about the future of democracy in various media systems. This research explores the factors that influence college students’ news consumption behaviour in the United Kingdom and Turkey through an interpretative approach. The data are based on qualitative in-depth interviews with around 50 students studying in major universities in London and Istanbul. The findings show overarching common trends such as increased mobile news access, incidental exposure to news on social media, irregular snacking and verifying of news that drive youth’s news consumption behaviour. Findings also show that traditional media use for news has almost been replaced by online media and the modality of traditional media do not easily fit in with youth’s daily routine of studies, work and commute. </jats:p>",

It begins by emphasising the centrality of collectivism to the storytelling process.

The chapter then explicates how online urban legends can effectively draw from ‘hybrid vernacular sources and creatively reconfigure existing narrative tropes’ (p. 161). Digital mediation provides people faster and easier ways to add individual voices into established urban legends. Chapter 5, ‘Public Debate’, analyses the ambivalence underlying online debates. Using the contentious 2016 US Presidential Election as the prime example, it illustrates how online debates are situated within the overlap ‘between the evil twins of conflict and unity, along with affect and rationality’ (p. 198). As public multiplicity becomes increasingly polarised, such ambivalence further complicates the relation between digital mediation and democratic process. Finally, the Conclusion summarises the whole book by suggesting a dirt work approach to Internet ambivalence. The authors propose that online expressions cannot be treated as a singular, self-contained and easily traceable litany built by explicit texts with authors and meanings. Instead, we should focus on ‘how specific vernacular expressions – however unusual or unintelligible they might appear – illuminate and often complicate broader cultural logics’ (p. 202). The best way to deal with online expressions, in other words, is to live with their embedded ambivalence. Grounded in multidisciplinary literature and vivid examples drawn from US online culture, The Ambivalent Internet presents a methodologically innovative account of the complexity underlying everyday online behaviours. The book’s thesis (i.e. ‘ambivalence is an essential aspect of the Internet’) has been well argued through a wide range of interesting yet confusing expressions found in online spaces. As a timely contribution following the 2016 US Presidential Election, the book also offers a useful framework for analysing the antagonism currently unfolding across the Internet. If there was any room for further improvement, I wish that the book could be more accommodating for readers without sufficient background knowledge in North American culture. In addition, the book’s colloquial language style, though understandable given its research subject, may disappoint some readers since, occasionally, it can be difficult to follow. With all being said, the book has raised serious questions concerning online behaviours, and it is a valuable reference for ongoing academic debates.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the context of a perceived crisis of globalization, this article outlines key features of the globalization paradigm that bore influence in media and communication studies, observing two recurring and related weaknesses: underestimation of the continuing significance of nation-states, and overestimation of the extent to which cultures and identities had become ‘post-national’ and cosmopolitan. The rise of populism could lead to a post-global era, but it is more likely that it marks a reassertion of national policy and political priorities into the operations of global corporations and multilateral institutions. This raises the question of whether global communication studies need to be more concerned with national policy questions rather than with ‘the global’ as an entity in its own right. </jats:p>",

In the course of tracing WITNESS’ development over the past two decades, it offers an evaluative assessment of the challenges its members have faced in promoting a grass-roots, citizen-centred approach to video reportage. More specifically, this advocacy is informed by an ethical commitment to advancing human rights causes by equipping citizens in crisis situations with cameras, and the training to use them, so that they might bear witness to the plight of others. In so doing, this article argues, WITNESS offers a tactical reformulation of the guiding tenets of peace journalism, one with considerable potential for recasting anew its strategic priorities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on literature review and interviews with journalists, we argue that the BRICS countries are constructing a collective vision, guided by logics of recognition and of transformation. The production of discourse reaches its high point during the BRICS leaders’ summits. To go beyond analysis of the discourse revealed in the media, this article examines projects, thereby aiming to qualify and label the justificatory discourses, in order to develop an understanding of intentions. The BRICS countries have become a reference point as the press increasingly makes comparisons between these countries. The notion of recognition, present in the political elites, also appears as a part of the public imagination and in the press. The leaders too seek transformation. The first official multilateral institution founded by the BRICS countries was the New Development Bank. Current efforts indicate the development of common scientific and technological research initiatives and official support for the establishment of an innovative BRICS Network University. Initiatives will appear as these countries try to consolidate their position. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A round-table on the international dimensions of News Corp in the light of the UK phone hacking scandal",
    "abstract": "The events of July 2011, in which reporters working for the News Corporation-owned title, the News of the World, were found to have hacked into the mobile phone of a murdered teenager, have focused a huge amount of attention on the ethics and regulation of corporate media. As allegations emerged of complicity between senior media executives, top police officers and leading government officials, public revulsion at the newspaper’s behaviour forced the government to launch a major public inquiry led by Lord Justice Leveson into the ‘culture, practices and ethics’ of the UK media. Since then, it has been revealed that there may have been nearly 6000 victims of phone hacking, and further evidence has emerged of covert surveillance, blackmail, the ‘blagging’ of information and regular invasions of privacy at the title, which was soon shut down by Rupert Murdoch, the CEO of News Corporation. News Corporation is the world’s second-largest media company: a giant transnational with holdings in cable and satellite television, movies, book publishing, newspapers and online. It has a presence in all the major media markets and a major influence on politics, business and everyday life. The events in the UK raise serious questions about the behaviour of News Corp in other countries. To what extent does the company exert similar influence over the political process elsewhere? In what ways does its domination of sports and entertainment coverage distort or enhance domestic media systems? What does its behaviour tell us about the practices and scope of media power in the contemporary world? In order to answer some of these questions, we have commissioned short articles on the impact of News Corp in six countries and regions: Latin America, Italy, New Zealand, China, India and the US. They provide a fascinating insight into how News Corp operates differently in different regions – using joint ventures in some while relying on its own brand in others – and how its ability to dominate market share is far from inevitable and subject to ongoing regulation by the state and intense competition from its rivals. 434730 GMC8110.1177/1742766511434730Global Media and CommunicationSpecial section 2012",

The paper also investigates factors that predict users’ interest in partisan content and establishes that the region of residence is the key predictor of selective consumption of pro-Ukrainian or pro-Russian partisan news content. </jats:p>",

Few studies have examined how memes are used to advance state interests in relation to China’s public diplomacy. In this context, the main objective of this study is to provide a preliminary but comprehensive analysis of the content, objectives and novel practice of using memes to communicate China’s foreign policy goals on Twitter. To achieve this, we conduct multiple analyses through a combination of computational techniques and manual coding. The dataset comprises 725,000 tweets from 68 Chinese diplomats’ accounts and 13 state media accounts. Drawing on a theoretical framework regarding the use of humour in international relations, our findings reveal that Chinese diplomats’ use of images in their tweets resulted in significantly more retweets and tweets featuring playful memes achieved a high degree of virality. These memes employed sarcasm to amplify ideological contention, and in doing so, challenged traditional diplomatic decorum. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This comparative study examines the power relationship between journalists and political elites in South-Eastern Europe, emphasizing the clientelistic ties under which these interactions take place. It is based on 60 in-depth interviews with journalists from Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro. The results suggest that the journalist–politician relationship in these countries has gradually evolved into two-way communication marked by cooperation and conflict. On one hand, the clientelist ties at the inter-organizational level have subordinated journalists to the political elites in power who negotiate the news agenda with media owners. On the other hand, journalists often serve as tools to combat political and economic enemies, leading to the exposure of corruption and scandals. However, this is done selectively, based on the media owner’s agenda. Overall, the study implies the lack of a uniform relationship between journalists and political elites, challenging previous assumptions that media clientelism in Eastern Europe is a stable system that exerts predictable relationships. </jats:p>",

At one point, it is even argued that ‘Asia is home to particular conceptions of beauty, certain styles of animation, idiosyncratic approaches to political communication . . . and context-specific assertions of uniqueness (cultural and national identity) and superiority (nationalism)’ (p. 12), as if a certain ‘Asian consciousness’ was in the making and about to emerge on the horizon. The attempt to project a ‘unique’ and ‘unitary’ image of Asia, of course, directly contradicts the editors’ informed emphasis on the use, both individual and communal, of media and communication content. This contradiction or incoherence is further complicated by the fact that the 11 selections cover a wide range of media forms, from television, film, and music videos to popular song and romance novels, and from internet bulletin boards and comics to brand characters and advertising. Although the blurb for the book claims that it ‘charts a new interdisciplinary area of inquiry’, one has to wonder whether there is any logic behind the practice of lumping together these diverse media forms in an already overloaded project.",

Are video-on-demand platforms contributing to India’s growing dependence on global players or are they asserting the diversification of domestic players and the progress of Indian capitalism in the cultural and digital industries? To answer, we analyse the strategies of competition and collaboration between historical audio-visual players versus communication players, the dynamics of foreign ownership and the content localisation strategies of global players. We conclude that the study of digital platforms offers an important insight into new forms of economic and cultural hegemony in the cultural industries. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Fiction film and the ‘real’ world",
    "abstract": "The 21st century has been dictated by a postmodern understanding of the world, where one gets information through a diverse mix of codes, styles and resources: such as newspapers, magazines, television and the internet. This mix allows for a disjointed understanding of the world, merging high art and mass culture and providing a huge variety of means to obtain information. This paper will examine how one assumes an understanding of conflict in the ‘real’ world when it is placed in an essentially fictional film that follows a pattern of cause and effect. When one understands conflict along these lines, it becomes evident that cultural artefacts such as film, influence our understanding of both history and memory.1 The Kingdom is a fiction film, but when one watches it, one assumes that one has an understanding of the events that occurred on 9/11 because the characters discuss the fictional events within the film together with actual events from the historical world. The title sequence, which is made of an historical montage, not only introduces the film, but it also links the film to 9/11 and the War on Terror. In order to understand how the title sequence acts as a historical referent, one has to analyse the sequence in more detail. The title sequence of The Kingdom starts with factual background information and communicates the events via a sophisticated animated graphic sequence. The film also starts with the audio track of a distinct drumbeat over a black screen that fades into the Universal and Relativity Media logos. The screen then fades to white and sand dunes fade in as the camera pans quickly from left to right. This movement symbolizes the timeline of the history of Saudi Arabia. The film begins with the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by AbdulAziz bin Saud in 1932, with the chance discovery of oil in 1933 and the establishment of the first American-Arabian corporation ARAMCO (Arabian American Oil Company) in 1938. The timeline then fades to stock footage of the first Western housing compound (the script ‘plants’2 this information in order to ground its later meaning in the film). The images then dissolve back to the timeline intercut with images of: John F Kennedy; the Arab–Israeli war; and how the 1973 oil embargo resulted in oil becoming a concern of",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is an increasing amount written on the decline of professional journalism around the world. One of the factors that are used to illustrate the decline of journalism is the interaction and collaboration between journalists and public relations (PR) practitioners in the production of mass media news content. On a theoretical and conceptual level, the aims and goals of the two professions are quite different, even though there are a number of superficial similarities between these forms of mass communication. Studies of the interaction between journalism and PR in the United States reveal a certain underlying tension, yet simultaneous mutual dependency. An indicative survey was conducted across different cities in the Russian Federation to understand the perception of professional journalists and PR practitioners on the current level of interaction between their professions. The answers were remarkably similar and reveal a deep concern for the direction of journalism, which many viewed as being subordinated to PR. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "It speaks the language of the industry and the business of transnational television. To this reviewer’s mind, this feature of the book makes it suitable for classroom use because it prepares students for joining the industry. That is a noteworthy accomplishment by itself. It must be noted, however, viewed from the same pedagogical perspective, the book has some shortcomings. The book does not give students a critical perspective from which they could assess the role this business plays in their social and cultural lives. There is little room for discussing normative claims or questions of valuation. In considering ‘when the local meets the global’, for example, the book addresses how channels within a network can differentiate themselves. The Turner Classic Movies network, the book argues, can offer a film such as Casablanca across its channels but never at the same time or the same day or even season. The film can be aired as a part of the focus on its director on one channel and aired on another as a part of the focus on its stars. This makes sense as a business strategy. However, some questions the book does not prepare students for include: is such a differentiation meaningful? Is it desirable? Who stands to benefit from it? The book does not give students a sense of an alternative perspective or a rich critical literature that would address such questions. Having said that, I admit that it might be unfair to expect a single volume to address all of these issues, especially one that has made a significant contribution to our understanding of a complex industry.",

To analyse emerging consumerist discourses around Singles’ Day, we considered news coverage alongside posts on Sina Weibo. Although the Singles’ Day bent towards consumerism occurred over time, in concert with demographic and political changes within China, our research shows that consumerist understandings of Singles’ Day emerged from a nascent cultural logic that celebrated togetherness through consumption. </jats:p>",

I argue that notions and concepts of what exactly should be protected under the umbrella of media freedom have been transformed during three distinct periods in post-war history. The related definitions are placed in the hierarchy of universal human rights. The contemporary international debate is illustrated with an example of the latest challenges to the scope of freedom of the media.

Findings show that the NMC must respond to four main challenges: lack of strategic vision and identity, a centralized regime power structure, an acute financial deficit, and a weak digital presence. Interviewees evaluated the new regulatory framework as inexhaustive with an intention to maintain grip on power. Interviewees proposed an integrated decentralized model that combines the public service mission with private partnership. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As a subject of academic research, Turkey has found itself caught in an intellectual and theoretical `no-man's land' located somewhere between south-eastern Europe and the Middle East. This article aims to position the Turkish media experience in relation to those of geographically, politically, economically and historically proximate nations/regions. It analyses the problems facing journalists and the institutions of journalism in Turkey by addressing three interrelated phenomena: (1) the concentration of media ownership in Turkey; (2) the efforts (largely successful) on the part of media owners to break the power of unions; and (3) government legislation affecting the rights and working environments of news workers. Following a presentation of empirical data on these three areas, I offer suggestions as to how the present situation in Turkey could open the door for the further refinement of research on, and theory regarding, nationally and regionally specific media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of a ‘moral economy,’ used famously by historian Edward Thompson in his 1971 essay, ‘The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century,’ is sometimes invoked in discussions of struggles for social justice. Drawing from Thompson and others who have written about the idea of a ‘moral economy,’ this article shows how that concept serves as an instructive guide for thinking today about the idea of a global civil society and the global justice movement. Relying on historical work about selected struggles for social justice, this article demonstrates how the means of communication have been vital to transnational social movements for far longer than generally is acknowledged. Moreover, the means of communication have been central to sustaining the idea of a moral economy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article assesses the public service media (PSM) ‘turn to diversity’ in several European contexts and examines the ways in which this emerges from a rejection of multiculturalism that is at once politically sustained and analytically inchoate. It approaches PSM as national institutions conditioned to mediate coherent images of society. In contemporary European societies, this positions PSM in a field in which integrationist imaginaries of the nation are insistent, but under conditions of social complexity, which render homogeneous visions of the nation difficult to mediate. In this context, diversity has developed as a framework for mediating, and being held to mediate, lived multiculture. However, recent research suggests that this shift to diversity both depoliticizes the ‘politics of difference’ and may also further the prevalent integration politics currently in the ascendant in Western Europe. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The revelations of investigative journalism in France",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1970s and 1980s, national newspapers in France, both general and political, have regularly praised ‘investigative journalism’ and its role in unveiling ‘scandals’. To gain an understanding of how this new model of professional excellence arose, even though it concerns only a small number of journalists, we need to show the extent to which it is first of all largely symptomatic of a series of changes that have occurred outside the field of journalism, especially in the political and legal worlds, and in the relationships these spaces maintain with one another. In particular it is important to show that the media space has become highly strategic, notwithstanding its relative lack of autonomy. What is covered by the media is largely the outcome of power relations within different social spaces that are then translated in accordance with media processes. Thus ‘investigative journalism’ is often based less on journalists’ own investigations than on state-sponsored studies: reports, inquests, etc. The present article endeavours to show how and why these ‘scandals’ have been exposed only where such external changes have also found an echo in the field of general and political media nationally, in particular among a group of politicized journalists who constitute a new specialist field within the profession. The rise of ‘investigative journalism’ and its successful profile in the discourse of the profession both result from and reveal transformations affecting the whole space of journalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Satellite communication has become the central platform in today’s globalized communication sphere. From its beginnings in the mid-1960s to its advanced technology today, satellite communication is the key provider of multi-purpose platforms, delivering not only television and radio, but also telecommunication and other advanced communication modes. Global satellite chains, such as Intelsat and Panamsat, both operating on a commercial basis, are the main providers of crucial transcontinental content flow. In addition, inter-governmental satellites, as well as commercial platforms, are shaping quite distinct satellite cultures in various world regions. Despite this central role to worldwide communication today, satellite-enhanced communication has not always received due attention in the academic literature (but see Collins, 1992; Sakr, 2001; Price, 2002; Parks, 2005). This special issue contributes to closing this gap by addressing crucial themes of European satellite culture. The articles in this issue have been selected from papers which were presented at the conference ‘European Satellite Cultures. Challenges to Media Policies and National Identities’, in Copenhagen, Denmark. The conference brought together policymakers and industry representatives, as well as academics, in order to debate key issues of the European satellite sphere. Drawing on interdisciplinary academic perspectives, this issue provides an overview of key themes in satellite communication in Europe as an emerging transnational sphere, in an otherwise nationally structured communication territory. This particular transnational form, the issue contributors argue, constitutes an increasingly powerful supraand sub-national discourse, challenging and transforming power relations in the contemporary information and communications landscape. All articles address an aspect of the broader landscape of transnational communications that primarily involves the challenge of digital media, along two dimensions of power: territorial and symbolic. Territorial power refers to power over the spaces, routes and messages of satellite communications, as they cross borders and seek to overcome traditional principles of national sovereignty in the domains of",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1920s emerged as a landmark decade in the world history of radio, more particularly in South Asia. About a century later, this paper seeks to stitch together a critical historiography of radio governance in colonial South Asia. In doing so, the paper seeks to unravel colonial constructions, norms and rationalities associated with the modern medium of radio in the South Asian context. This paper draws on the works of Pinkerton, Zivin, Brayne, Potter and gleanings in their work of the autobiographical writings of Fielden and Reith, the first broadcasting controller of All India Radio and the general manager of the British Broadcasting Corporation, respectively, besides some official documents cited in these works pertaining to the goings-on in British South Asia and its broadcasting. Ultimately, this paper seeks to not only historicize the eventual decolonization and democratization that occurred, but also sets the stage to locate, understand and move towards sustainable media governance in a post-2015 world. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Just as the highly debatable concept of ‘the CNN Effect’ denotes that visual news coverage can drive foreign policy, the Al-Jazeera Effect is ‘a paradigm of new media’s influence’ on global politics (which includes satellite television, the internet and all other networked information technologies). As a symbol of our new ‘media-centric world’, says Seib, Al-Jazeera ‘fosters unprecedented cohesion in the worldwide Muslim community’ (Seib, 2008: ix). The concept of the Al-Jazeera Effect, suggests Seib, is used to describe all the uses of new media in global affairs, including democratization, terrorism and ‘virtual states’, by pushing at the limits of free media expression in the Arab/Muslim worlds. While the CNN Effect concept mainly assumes media-driven foreign policy in the West, the Al-Jazeera Effect concept generally refers to the direct impact of satellite television and the internet on Arab politics, including processes of Islamic-led change, the proliferation of terrorism and ‘virtual states’ (such as Al-Qaeda and Kurdistan), and possibly the fostering of democracy. This article aims to clear up the confusion by addressing some of the misconceptions (that have even attained the status of myth) related to: (1) the nature of the Arab media in the age of the satellite; (2) the Al-Jazeera Effect and socio-political change; and (3) Al-Jazeera’s relationship to Al-Qaeda, and its place within Al-Qaeda’s media strategy.",

    "abstract": "The internet has been viewed as a vehicle for promoting communication among grassroots netizens in international politics. However, internet debates are also criticized for being deficient in deliberation and respect for others, and a breeding ground for cyber-hate and nationalist extremism. As Sino-Indo relations are among the hottest subjects in the Chinese internet, this paper sets up an inquiry into the significance of the internet debate in facilitating a better understanding between netizens of the two countries. The case in focus is the first cross-country online debate on Sino-Indo relations, the ‘Sino-Indo Internet Users Debate Contest’, which was organized by the Global Times, one of the most popular newspapers in China. A Fantasy Theme Analysis (FTA) is applied to identify the rhetorical visions in the debate represented by the Chinese and Indian teams. The paper evaluates the importance of this new initiative in several aspects. First, it analyses how the debate is structured to be different from normal online discussion. Second, it examines the fantasy themes and rhetorical visions constructed in the debate by the Chinese and Indian teams. Finally, it evaluates the implications of this more formally structured online debate in relation to the role of the internet discussion among netizens in facilitating a more promising future of international relations, specifically the Sino-Indo relations.",

    "abstract": "In 1977, two Hungarians, George Gerbner, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and György Márványi, a programme director for Hungarian television in Budapest, published their study of the world’s newspapers. In their study, Gerbner and Márványi showed that Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) was almost invisible in the news geography of the Western world as then defined. Thirty-two years later, Inka Salovaara-Moring argued that the area was so neglected in mainstream media and communication studies outside CEE that it could be called ‘dead ground’ (Salovaara-Moring, 2009). This has come about despite the fact that, as Gross (2004: 112) reminds us, CEE is by no means a ‘tabula rasa’, since ‘durable and persistent cultural traits inimical to democracy have long been embedded in these societies, in both pre-communist and communist eras’. Media and communication scholars are eager to point out how journalists concentrate on major news events in the USA and Western Europe and ignore processes taking place in other countries that they do not consider newsworthy. Academics might also exercise self-criticism: academia is not immune to fashion and research tends to concentrate on major events. It also tends to keep coming back to its most consistent interests in the Anglo-American world. The collapse of communism may have been one of those major events, but outside CEE interest faded when no new major events were occurring. Academic research also favours larger countries and their media: size does matter when it comes to choosing a unit of analysis. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was the communist country that attracted most scholarly attention, and now Russia has been replaced by China. Russia and China both remain under-studied, but at least they have not been ignored to the same extent as the CEE countries.",

    "abstract": "Digital media have fundamentally changed the traditional model of media distribution by enabling information and ideas to be shared and exchanged by a large number of users simultaneously. Nowhere have these new forces produced a more significant impact than in China and India, where broadcasting and telecommunications systems had operated as government owned and managed monopolies. This paper will review the foreign direct investment (FDI) policies in the telecom and media industries in India and China. It demonstrates that while both countries want to use FDI to achieve similar industrial objectives, they have taken different paths to develop those industries. The Indian government encourages both foreign and domestic players to participate in moderately regulated industries. Private operators currently hold the majority of market shares in a very fragmented and competitive market. In China, both industries are heavily regulated and dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with limited space for foreign companies to grow.",

    "abstract": "This themed issue of Global Media and Communication focuses on one of the most important aspects of teaching and researching media and communication – its rapid and inevitable internationalization, which is one of the editorial priorities of this journal. The inspiration behind and the incentive for this special issue was the successful conference Internationalising Media Studies: Imperative and Impediments, organized in September 2006 by the University of Westminster in London and supported by this journal. Rather than publishing a few articles based on the theme of internationalization, we decided to print a range of shorter reflections on the theme, encompassing a wider range of perspectives. The globalization of media, combined with the globalization of higher education, means that the research and teaching of media, cultural and communication studies face immediate and profound challenges, not only as the subject of enquiry but also as the means by which researchers and students undertake their studies. In the complexity of the globalized world, media studies as an interand trans-disciplinary field is well placed to draw in and deploy a range of paradigms and approaches from the social sciences, arts and humanities, and to look across borders and boundaries, between nations, cultures and academic disciplines. The globalization of media has contributed significantly to the growth of media and communication as a fast-growing area of academic enquiry internationally. The explosion of transnational information flows, made possible by new technologies and institutional changes – economic, political and legal – has profoundly affected global media industries. Increasingly, the emphasis is shifting from the traditional approach of considering the role of media in the vertical integration of national societies, to studying the transnational, horizontal integration of media and communication structures, processes and audiences, indicative of the increasingly complex relations between local, national, regional and international production, distribution and consumption of media texts in a global context. Technological transformations have opened up huge possibilities of new subjects and materials for research in media, communication and",

The aim is to debunk myths about the influence of external broadcasting on the events that led to German reunification in 1990. The study follows a historical approach and discusses what role external media played during the years of a divided Germany. The findings are based on several historical sources, research reports from the 1950s and 1960s and over 100 biographical interviews with former residents of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The article analyses the impact of external broadcasting on citizens and the political elite in times of crisis as well as during everyday life. </jats:p>",

This article examines frames, sources and claims in articles from Ecuadorian news regarding the lawsuit against Chevron brought by thousands of indigenous peoples living in the Amazonian region, who claimed their health was at risk and ancestral lands destroyed by petroleum contamination. Findings indicated that the risk discussion at the heart of events and conflicts was subsumed by coverage that focused largely on the legal conflict as well as was indexed to the claims denying the hazard.

However, could one say that the urban news mediatized by this press is structured according to the standardized infotainment and sensationalism objectives that are often associated with the commercial media? The research based on three case studies shows that these publications, which have a single logo and format worldwide, develop a specific, place-bound editorial line of exposing the most important risks perceived within late-modern cities by its reporters and their audiences. Interactionism and, more precisely, the ‘social world’ approach to a profession can help understand these differentiated representations of metropolitan dangers by offering a more place-bound and socio-anthropological perspective of journalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Poland, as all the post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe, was a target of Western international broadcasting before 1989. After the Velvet Revolution, the former receiver became communicator. Poland undertook efforts to promote democracy in Belarus, while reaching the audience in the country via a television station, basing these efforts on its own experiences from the communist times. Belarus, Poland’s eastern authoritarian neighbour, limits citizens’ access to information while controlling the state television and persecuting oppositional media and journalists. Thus, Belsat TV, financed by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Polish public service television, has been run as a station substituting for the domestic, Belarusian sources of information. The article sheds light on the motivation of the Polish government to launch alternative media for Belarus as well as on the political and media landscape in which these media operate. In the study, international broadcasting is understood as one of the components of Polish public diplomacy, used as a leverage to strengthen the position of the country as an actor in international communication. </jats:p>",

The analysis is informed by theories of social construction and devotes particular attention to the way regulators have sought to allocate the airwaves to serve the public interest. The research is focused on two key moments of disruption that were particularly influential for the diffusion of phones in India: the introduction of code division multiple access (CDMA) service in the early 2000s and an infamous spectrum scandal of 2008.

    "abstract": "Manuel Castells Oliván is widely considered the leading analyst of the information age. He is thus in high demand by universities, international organizations, governments, colleagues, students, journalists, biographers, and, of course, by Global Media and Communication. Castells receives about 1000 invitations per year (Ince, 2003: 20), accepts in fact only about 20 of them, gives on average one media interview per month, usually online, and one keynote speech a month somewhere in the world (Annenberg Agenda, 2003: 12). He has given more than 300 papers in 43 countries (Webster and Dimitriou, 2004). When not globetrotting he now divides his time primarily between two cities in two continents. In Los Angeles he holds the Wallis Annenberg Chair in Communication Technology and Society at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Southern California, and in Barcelona the Research Professorship at the Open University of Catalonia [http://www.ascweb.usc.edu/]. Castells is sole author of 23 books and editor or co-author of 15 more, as well as over 100 articles in academic journals. His magnum opus, the trilogy, The Information Age (1996–8), has been compared to the work of Karl Marx and Max Weber and took him 15 years to research, from 1983 to 1998, the last five years in a race against cancer. Castells is now recovered and the book is in its second edition and has been translated into 20 languages. His most recent books are The Internet Galaxy (Castells, 2001), which has now been translated into 15 languages; The Information Society and the Welfare State: The Finnish Model (Castells and Himanen, 2002); La societat xarxa a Catalunya (Castells, 2003) and The Network Society: A Cross-cultural Perspective (Castells, 2004). Castells has received more honorary doctorates from universities around the world than he has time to accept in person. Apart from his scholarly activities he has a weekly column in Barcelona’s leading daily La Vanguardia. INTERVIEW",

    "title": "Demonizing Islam before and after 9/11: Anti-Islamic spin – an important factor in pro-war PR?",
    "abstract": "After years of research about the coverage of Islam in German and other European media, I have come to the conclusion that an analysis based purely on descriptive features is not enough to capture the phenomenon and its impact. Therefore, I have expanded my analytical work to include the question of the purpose that the mostly negatively biased coverage of topics related in one way or another to Islam, has served over the years. One thing worth noting when examining the coverage of Islam is that there is no qualitative difference between the coverage before and after 9/11 (Aly, 2002; Hafez, 2002; Pinn and Wehner, 1992; Poole, 2002; Said, 1981; Schiffer, 1996; Sokolowsky, 2009). For example, my dissertation ‘Islam in German media’ shows that anti-Islamic stereotypes, which were cultivated for decades, resulted in something of a tradition of covering Islam, Muslims, and Arabs as backward and violent (Schiffer, 2005a, 2005b). However, after 9/11 there has been a large quantitative difference: the same topics came up more often and in a much more explicit way (Schiffer and Wagner, 2009). From a Western perspective, the conclusions drawn from the attacks and the arguments advanced in their aftermath seem logical, in the sense that they do not contradict the impressions created over time through books, TV programmes, and public discourse.",

The first part of the at trilogy, Heimat 1, broadcast on German public service television 984, was a major media event with approximately 9 million people wing the series and 25 million or 54 per cent of the viewing ulation in Germany watching at least one of the 11 episodes. Heimat was released for cinema and television in more than 20 ntries. In the UK, the first part of the trilogy, Heimat 1, was shown on 2 in 1986. Despite its length and subtitles, about 2.5 million people wed the first series. According to Reitz, an increasing number of ision channels contributed to the less successful reception of Heimat leased in 1992. Despite the success of Heimat 1, Reitz struggled for ing. Eventually 16 mainly European public service broadcasters, the and SBS Australia among them, funded Heimat 2 and Heimat 3. Heimat 3 begins with the day the Berlin Wall falls. The historical ent of German reunification coincides with a symbolic moment in lives of two central characters in the film, Hermann and Clarissa. e lovers in 1960s Munich (Heimat 2), they meet again by chance in a in hotel after a Schubert concert on 9 November 1989. Hermann and Clarissa witness the historical event on television in a l room, separated from the jubilant crowds. Reitz here deliberately s with images of mediated reality that have become an intrinsic part ultural memory. In the euphoria of the moment, they set off for the srück, a remote rural area in the Western Rhineland and Hermann’s dhood home. The couple buy a run-down house with a stunning over the romantic Rhine valley near Schabbach, the fictional village eimat. They employ two East German craftsmen from Leipzig, nar and Udo, to renovate the house. As the story unfolds, the fate of East Germans and other newcomers to this hinterland becomes rtwined with the people of Schabbach and Hermann’s family.",

    "abstract": "French journalistic fields in ways that set standards also for the commercial media. For instance, similar to many other European countries, the French commercial television was developed only when the public system had established its position. Traces of these origins remain in the journalistic values of commercial providers. In the United States, however, the public service television PBS grew out of educational networks only in the 1960s, and it remains a small and decentralized player in the field. While the regulatory framework produces the meta-level difference for the two journalistic fields, Benson also pays attention to the ‘field logics’, that is, to the more practical and professional differences between the two countries. One such example is the ‘forms’ of news: modes of articles and news packages. Narrative news, ‘shaping of information as a “story” with clear characters and plot’ (p. 49) is typical for the American news genre. In France, on the contrary, newspapers organize topics as a ‘multigenre debate ensemble’, which is a collage of different genres and voices. This format allows various agents such as civil society actors and academics to present their views on an issue, and according to Benson, this form tends to afford more multiperspectival, critical, and in-depth news coverage on immigration. While the book makes future recommendations particularly towards American journalism, claiming for a stronger public service media, the comparative study nevertheless offers future perspectives also for European journalistic fields. The European public service media face pressure from commercialization and digitalization, perhaps more so than Benson’s rather optimistic account suggests. Studies such as Shaping Immigration News that carefully compare the strengths and limits of different systems and outcomes of different media policies are crucially important also for the future development of the struggling public service initiative in Europe and elsewhere.",

Using Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory and Rodney Benson’s habitus affinity and habitus disaffinity, this article highlights the pitfalls of using ‘African media’ as an analytical category when studying media representations of atrocities by Africa’s press. The evidence presented here suggests the need for an approach that is nuanced when analysing representation of issues of political or social import, especially considering, in the case of Kenyan news organizations, the willingness to lift news reports from Western organizations. By lifting such a large number of stories from wire agencies, the Kenyan media field privileges narratives employed by these organizations. This parsing out of articles is necessary if scholars are to confidently understand how the press in Africa represents Africa to local/national audiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article explores the extent to which the future of democracy in Morocco is healthier with the Internet as the primary means by which people create a public sphere where they communicate and form public opinion. A study on digital media in Morocco was carried out to examine the emergence of new media platforms and the impact of digitization on democracy and journalists’ activity. The study relies on in-depth interviews with digital activists and online journalists. The study found that the Internet had created a dynamic and networked public space where lively debates can take place on many issues still considered off-limits to mainstream media. It has also been used as a tool for nascent political movements to organize and mobilize supporters across the country, particularly in the context of the ongoing Arab Spring. Morocco was spared from the draconian measures used in other authoritarian countries and the Internet was relatively free. The February 20 Movement in 2011, the Amina Filali campaign in 2012, the Daniel Gate case in 2013 and the Free Ali Anouzla campaign are all significant moments of victory that relied on social media for political mobilization. However, with the surveillance technology available and its use justified (since the most democratic countries such as the United States and France use it), the state is clamping down on Internet freedom. In the past, the government controlled the online information landscape through a series of restrictive laws that can be manipulated to serve political purposes. Today, activists and journalists identify surveillance as the most dangerous instrument in the hands of the regime. The regime has learned to use the empowering potential of the Internet to serve its own repressive agenda. </jats:p>",

In the process, the article demonstrates that communication media contributed to the definition of the IOR as a geographical entity, much of which constitutes the global South today. The study concludes with a note on the legacies of media modernization inherited by these societies following independence as, ironically, an apparatus constructed to network and connect the region became fragmented as properties of postcolonial nations, used in the service of independent nation-building and national development. Now that these countries have come together in the recent Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation, implications for a networked region remain to be seen. </jats:p>",

The purpose of the analysis was to assess the extent to which Egyptians are able to navigate ongoing government authoritarianism to self-express online. Contrary to expectations, the results indicate that Facebook page size appears to be a much more important factor in dictating the conditions of Egyptian news spheres than editorial policies and ownership structures. Overall, this suggests that current authoritarian conditions in Egypt have rendered editorial lines relatively unimportant. </jats:p>",

Over that period Habermas’ original conception of the public sphere, as stated in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere has been subjected to a number of critiques which are well outlined by Goode as well as Crossley and Roberts. Habermas has himself accepted many of these critiques. Indeed, as his own thought has developed, he has in many cases moved beyond them. Again, both Goode and Crossley and Roberts take good account of these developments in Habermas’ thinking. I will return in a moment to these critiques and debates, in order to assess where I think we have now got to with public sphere theory. REVIEW ESSAY",

It explores British press coverage of the genocide in Darfur and finds that the British press maintains traditional and ethnocentric frameworks that undermine the need for responsible reporting. Ultimately, the news values of negativity, elite people and elite nations have determined coverage of the Darfur crisis, and official and Western sources have been used to maintain credibility and a sense of identification with the domestic setting. Geopolitical biases continue to determine what stories are newsworthy, and political context remains scant. Sparse use of foreign correspondents and meagre inclusion of personal experiences suggest that journalists remain detached from the crisis, urging political rather than humanitarian intervention. This article concludes that the British press maintains institutionalised approaches to reporting humanitarian crises by avoiding attachment. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Terrorism, humor, and American popular culture",
    "abstract": "Terrorism has been reflected in popular culture in the past decade in a variety of ways – ranging from newspaper comics, magazine pieces, and graphic novels to feature-length films, television mini-series, and stand-up comic routines. Many of these treat the subject with gravitas. Within this overall context, works that use humor to approach the topic of terrorism have been somewhat slower to appear. In this paper I consider four different examples involving the use of humor: (1) comics (syndicated newspaper comic strips and magazine cartoons); (2) a magazine parody; (3) feature-length films; and (4) a standup comedy routine. A detailed analysis of the types of humor relies on Bergson’s essay Le rire (Laughter, 1911) – for example, on his understanding of the mechanisms of repetition, inversion, and reciprocal interference, as well as the important distinction between irony and humor (how the ideal and reality interact). All of the examples of humor considered here represent attempts to cope with, confront, comment on, and even contain the potential danger represented by terrorism. In his essay, Bergson discusses three types of comedy: of situations, characters, and language. Some of the subcategories for these three types overlap. In situational comedy we might have repetition, inversion of situations or roles, and reciprocal interference. According to Bergson, in the latter instance: ‘A situation is invariably comic when it belongs simultaneously to two altogether independent series of events and is capable of being interpreted in two entirely different meanings at the same time’ (1911: 28). For this to be humorous, the viewer must, of course, be in on the double entendre. Under comedy of character, Bergson notably mentions gestures and automatism. Whereas actions are conscious, he argues, gestures are unconscious and can slip out unintentionally. Automatism is related and centers on obliviousness (lack of self-knowledge) or rigidity. In the third type of comedy, that of language, Bergson distinguishes among verbal inversion, reciprocal interference, and transposition into a different register. Bergson notes the humor inherent in parody (transposing the solemn into the familiar) or exaggeration (transposing the",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> China is a much more active player in the lives of Chinese diasporas than it has been in recent decades. In this paper, based on rich empirical material, we depart from the dominant approach that dissects China’s practices of direct digital diaspora engagement and take a new perspective. Focusing on broader multilingual transnational narrative galaxies, we argue that while processes of selective diaspora engagement with China do take place, they also result from diasporic participation in transnational narrative galaxies not specifically targeted at diasporics. In a binary global discursive context that requires everyone, and especially diasporics, to take sides, narratives critical of the US-dominated world order have a greater impact on the young adult Chinese diasporics discussed here than any direct attempt by the Chinese party-state to engage its diaspora. In turn, China’s ability to capitalise on narratives and actors also facilitates diasporic participation in the Chinese transnational space. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "As is often the case with edited volumes of this nature, however, the critical approach adopted by many of its featured contributors all too often highlights the negative role media serve in representing, contextualizing, communicating and stabilizing forms of terrorism for audiences and spectators. Though this is most often the framework through which thinly-defined notions of terrorism are presented, it is not always such a monolithic process. There have been numerous instances throughout the ‘war on terror’ where the media, in its various manifestations, have actively sought to unseat dominant representations of terrorism and deconstruct the identities of those regarded as ‘terrorists’ – something that has served to broaden audience understanding of who the terrorists are and what they want.1 While Freedman and Thussu do indeed highlight the way in which ‘media are not simply external actors passively bringing the news of terrorist incidents to global audiences’ (p.10), this is a notion that is not always shared by their contributors. Nevertheless, this edited volume is a welcome addition to the existing literature in this field, demonstrating the extent to which debates surrounding media and terrorism have moved away from a limited concern with ‘the oxygen of publicity’ and are now encouraging new spaces for critical engagement. Media and Terrorism is a timely and accessible intervention and will be of much value to students and media practitioners alike.",

    "abstract": "countries. Of interest to ICT governance scholars, practitioners, and donors are the specific research questions Dany offers that are tied to each policy issue. The questions guided the content analysis of WSIS draft and final documents. Chapters 5 and 6 present the study’s findings. Chapter 5 details what NGOs achieved in the four topical policy areas described in Chapter 4. Findings are presented according to what NGOs demanded in each area followed by what they did or did not achieve in each. She closes by identifying the limits of NGO influence. Chapter 6 explains why NGO influence in some of the policy areas was limited. One reason is that NGOs’ claims were disregarded. Another has to do with the downsides of the informal mechanisms for participation. Early on in the WSIS processes, they initially seemed to lead to agendasetting influences, but Dany notes that the influence of NGOs decreased during the negotiation processes. The concluding chapter offers questions for future studies of NGO influence in international negotiations, noting ‘easy access does not guarantee policy impact’ (p.143). Dany complicates the term NGO to attend to the fact that non-state actors vary considerably in their organisational structures, access to power, and internal capabilities. Simply grouping disparate groups involved in the WSIS as NGOs or civil society or the NGO community obfuscates the multiple ways that participants are unequally enabled. She argues, ‘NGO diplomats and protesters have distinct communicative capabilities which are bound by different structures’ (p.151). In closing, Global Governance and NGO Participation offers a theoretically grounded framework for analysing how NGO influence is tied to structures of participation. To this reviewer, the book’s strength is its appreciation of the work that NGOs actually do and the attention paid to empirical review of the actual artefacts and events around which NGOs organise their work. The chapters introduce non-experts to concepts of global governance, the information society, international policy advocacy, and ‘what power means for NGOs’ influence in participatory global governance arenas’ (p.11). Both the theoretical framework and research design is highly transferrable to numerous other global governance fields as well as teaching and research contexts. Finally, donors and their evaluators will find indicators useful to assessing capacity-building needs.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The financial burdens of Filipino migrant workers are exacerbated by the lure of miscellaneous consumer goods peddled to them by businesses looking for a lucrative share of their remittances. This study examines a profit-oriented model of diasporic media that directly serves the business interests of its publisher and its advertisers. It analyses the Taiwan-based EEC Now magazine and criticizes the duplicity of its proclaimed mission of ‘Caring for Migrant Workers Now and in the Future’. Through a thematic analysis of advertisements published in selected issues of EEC Now, the study reveals the consumerist ideology espoused by the magazine: the commodification of the migrant worker’s body, the obligatory sending of balikbayan (repatriate) cargo boxes and cash remittances and the search for the next overseas destination. Applying concepts from Baudrillard’s theory of consumer society and San Juan’s critique of Filipino diaspora formation, the themes from the analysis reveal how profit-oriented diasporic media reflect social inequities and service the global capitalist system that ultimately spawned labour migration. </jats:p>",

Such interactions are based on the interests and experiences of the actors and conditioned by their particular historical, structural, cultural and international contexts.

Second, there is the question of whether art cinema is an obsolete high cultural form pretending to worthiness but often bordering on the pornographic, or the leading edge of new cinema. Capino’s chapter on the Philippines certainly takes the former position, whereas Dissanayake’s account of Sri Lankan cinema does not hide the author’s preference for the local realist cinema classified there as art cinema. William van der Heide’s decision to end his chapter on Malaysian cinema on an optimistic note with an analysis of Teck Tan’s Spinning Gasing would seem to validate art cinema as the site for new directions and possibilities in mainstream cinema. The range of different opinions and responses to these issues in the book indicates that another accomplishment of Contemporary Asian Cinema is its ability to open up debates and questions. However, these debates about art cinema and popular cinema in the context of the international circulation of cinema are complex enough to merit a volume in their own right.",

    "title": "Book Review: GATS and the audiovisual sector",
    "abstract": "One of the major achievements of the Uruguay Round of trade talks that concluded in 1994 was the establishment of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to be administered by the newly-formed World Trade Organization (WTO). The objective of GATS is to ensure that key parts of the service sector, which now accounts for the majority of world trade, are progressively liberalized and privatized. Trade disciplines that were traditionally applied to goods – measures that made it harder to justify domestic subsidies and tariffs – are now to be applied to industries including water, health, education and communications. The audiovisual industries had been left out of the Uruguay Round mainly due to French insistence on a cultural exemption. The new round of GATS talks was therefore an opportunity for governments with liberalizing instincts to try once again to secure ‘open markets’ in the audiovisual sector. As the industry magazine TV International (1999) put it, ‘U.S. trade negotiators and Hollywood industry officials are determined to get film, TV program and music exemptions on the negotiating table’ (p. 1). Opponents of liberalization were quick to argue that GATS, as one commentator put it, was nothing more than ‘legalised piracy’ (Petley, 2003: 4), forcing weaker economies to open up their service industries to wealthier countries without reciprocal benefits. In the audiovisual sector, a full implementation of GATS could, in theory, lead to the scrapping of mechanisms like licence fees, screen quotas, press subsidies and public service content obligations that have traditionally been applied to ensure cultural diversity, media pluralism and national sovereignty. Negotiations started in January 2000 with a timetable agreed at the Doha ministerial meeting in November 2001. Member states would make initial requests for commitments on market access by 30 June 2002 with initial offers, i.e. the response to the requests, tabled by the end of March POLICY REVIEW",

Friel and Falk argue, probably rightly, that these mostly liberal intellectuals were positioning themselves in what they saw as the political center, just as the Times was doing, burnishing their realist credentials in order to remain players in the political and intellectual marketplace. The main chapter that deals with news coverage is, like the Times’ own self-critique, rather narrow in its focus on the easy target of Judith Miller’s WMD stories. Certainly, though, this is a valuable book, among other things for undergraduate teaching, providing an articulate statement of the case for putting international law at the center of deliberation on foreign policy and a powerful critique of the Times’ deference to the ‘realist’ position.",

The authors conclude that female journalists articulated their experiences of newsroom culture as hegemonically masculine. While it appears that female journalists believe that women have made some strides in covering political news, they still see their influence as limited and continue to battle pre-existing professional stereotypes. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Website Review: Islamist websites",
    "abstract": "Before discussing Islamist websites, the very term ‘Islamist’ needs qualification. In general, it refers to modern political movements in which Islam plays a central ideological role. However, the term often holds a pejorative connotation. It implies that Islamist movements are, in fact, distinct from Islam itself, that they superficially invoke Islam for political ends, without any real understanding of, or commitment to, the religion. With this usage, the term ‘Islamist’ drips from a variety of tongues and pens. It appears in Islamophobic polemics as well as intersectarian Muslim debates. Still, the term remains useful for a more neutral designation of Muslim groups and individuals that directly engage the issue of politics. The Islamist internet embodies many traditional characteristics of online media. It displays a geographic fluidity that bypasses national borders and controls. Nonetheless, it remains bound by the imbalances of the global information infrastructure. Its relatively low costs of entry and production allow a diversity of voices. Yet, powerful institutions and governments offer innovative attempts to restrict content and monopolize discourse. Islamist websites tend to fit within identifiable clusters – united by a common political focus, even though the specific content, location, and format may differ. The following list of clusters identifies major themes and notable examples of the Islamist internet.",

The findings show that the efforts to construct counterhegemonic narratives are most evident in the co-productions with RT and Al-Mayadeen. Although the co-production with CGTN focusses on culture, it is nonetheless possible to identify the broadcasters’ distinct ideological agendas. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Social and cultural adaptation in host countries is crucial for the well-being of international students. Research suggests that information and communication technologies (ICTs) enable international students to develop knowledge of new environments, expand and maintain social networks, and participate in community activities, contributing to their integration into host societies. However, little has been explored on how ICTs are related to their identities during adaptation. Drawing on the information technology (IT) identity concept, we regard ICTs as part of migrants’ identity and argue that a local IT identity benefits international students’ psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. Based on an online survey among students from mainland China in Hong Kong (\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            = 146) and the UK (\n            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>\n            = 202), we found that using locally popular mobile apps contributed to their local IT identity and enhanced their adaptation. On the other hand, using home country apps negatively impacted the local IT identity and hindered adaptation. The mediating effects of local IT identity were more pronounced among UK participants. This study suggests that ICTs not only provide a space for migrants’ acculturation but could also be potential pathways for international students to establish new identities. Staying in the home countries’ ‘ICT bubbles’ might constrain their adaptation to the host society.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article focuses on internet use as a mediating factor in identity formulation and maintenance among the minority Russian community living within post-Soviet space, but outside of the Russian Federation. I argue that regular internet usage among ethnic Russians in the near abroad has precipitated a denationalization of identity since the breakup of the USSR. The shock of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the often painful demands of living as an ‘immigrant’ in one's birth country, and the concurrent psychic traumas of globalization have created a powerful nexus which has deeply impacted younger near abroad Russians who, in turn, have turned to cyberspace to help them make sense of their place in world – a process which has, rather paradoxically, promoted postnational, globalist identities. Through regular web use and the creation of transnational communication networks, these Russian digerati are increasingly acting as agents of globalization within their own communities and steadily distinguishing themselves from the larger Russian community residing in the ethnic homeland. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The global spread of freedom of the press and expression is widely acclaimed as one of the main achievements of democratization over the past two decades. Yet, the meaning of press freedom, how it should be practised and where the boundaries of this new-found freedom lie are fiercely disputed in most new democracies. This article explores how journalists from six new democracies in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Poland), East Asia (South Korea, Taiwan) and Southern Africa (Namibia, South Africa) interpret press freedom and how this might affect their professional practices. Based on a total of 58 semi-structured interviews, the findings imply that journalists in new democracies combine universal interpretations of press freedom with those that are rooted in particular cultural traditions and political experiences. The article concludes by calling for a fresh view on the rise of ‘domesticated’ forms of journalism as a way of ensuring the significance and viability of press freedom in different cultural and political contexts. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Section III Chindia screens Chindia",
    "abstract": "‘Chindia’ offers fascinating challenges, both empirical and theoretical, for explanatory frameworks seeking to understand rapidly changing media production, distribution and consumption patterns and possibilities. Our focus here is part of a larger project with two dimensions. The first is empirical: a study of online screen distribution worldwide as part of the ‘Dynamics of World Cinema’ project initiated by Dina Iordinova at St Andrews University (http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/filmstudies/dynamics. php). Our contribution charts the ‘career’ of online film distribution, and its first publication (Cunningham et al., 2010) concentrates on Hollywood – where innovation and experimentation is occurring most intensively with iTunes, Hulu and YouTube. iTunes has been a major disruptor of the ‘premium content’ or ‘content is king’ model on which Hollywood has based its business models since the early 1950s with the beginnings of competition with television and with audiovisual product differentiation. The iTunes download model, with a lower unit cost than Hollywood has ever been comfortable with, exemplifies this. Its ‘open-closed’ intellectual property control model – iTunes is platform-agnostic and can be deployed on PCs as much as Apple hardware and on any mobile device, but has strong and relatively efficient digital rights management content control – has made it the most successful market-based audio and audiovisual content provider in the online world. Hulu, Hollywood’s answer to iTunes, adopts a streaming, advertiserbased and thoroughly geo-blocked approach, and has migrated to a subscription model as there is not enough advertising revenue to sustain it. It suffers from the ‘analogue dollars to digital cents’ conundrum typically faced by all actors in the emergent online media market.",

The writing and discussion of this book reminds me of many other theoretical works on sound, voice and listening not mentioned in the book itself, including Canetti’s (1984) Crowd and Power, Erlmann’s (2014) Reason and Resonance, Ingold’s (2000) The Perception of the Environment, and various discussions of sound and affect in recent sounds studies scholarship. Overall, it is an easy, pleasant and intellectually stimulating book. It is, as stated in the Preface, intended for non-academic readership. If one is eager to find out how the author tackles the brilliant question of why people sing, one may feel a bit disappointed to find the question being squarely addressed only in the last chapter. As the author notes, the previous three chapters can be read as footnotes for Chapter 4. In a sense, Chapters 2 and 3 are still important; they provide a personal context (with engaging research stories and details) of the philosophical speculation on talk, singing and communication. If this book had been written 13 years ago and if I had read it then, I would have had more confidence to remain in communication studies with a more articulated defence for my proposed dissertation research on new music/sound culture as communication. After years of research in sound studies, reading this book gives me a feeling of déjà vu. All is meant to be.",

Using content analysis, we critically engage with user-generated memes and news media coverage responding to these disruptions. In these cases, Brazilians self-reflexively questioned the app’s role in their everyday lives and country, reassessing what it means to rely on a national infrastructure owned by an unaccountable global media conglomerate. </jats:p>",

Portugal’s case illustrates well the conflict between capitalism and democracy in the neo-liberal era. It demonstrates how governments no longer have the degree of control they once had over their own state due not only to the presence of supranational institutions, but also to their dependence on investors – which has led to the increasing political power of large corporations over national governments and over national public interest. In this process, the state plays an active role in promoting the free play of market forces through public policy. Against this backdrop, one may also suggest that the news media might no longer be an adequate agent of public interest under the neo-liberal order. </jats:p>",

Tony, as everybody at the LSE calls him, was a very popular Director of the School from 1997 to 2003. Born 66 years ago in Edmonton, North London, Giddens became the first member of his family to go to university. He is now the author of more than 30 books that have been translated into some 35 different languages; his 1986 textbook, Sociology (Giddens, 2001[1986]), has sold more than a million copies. Before joining the LSE, he was Professor of Sociology at the University of Cambridge and is now Emeritus Professor at the LSE, attached to the Centre for Global Governance and the Sociology Department.1 At the end of June 2004, Tony gave his maiden speech in the House of Lords as Baron Giddens of Southgate,2 appointed by the Blair government. I wanted to interview Professor Giddens (AG) since he is one of the leading globalization theorists. There are only a few contemporary social scientists in the world who have been as influential as Giddens. He popularized the term ‘globalization’, not only among his fellow academics but also for the wider world.",

The fact that debates about globalization in general, and the global media in particular, have proved commercially productive for academic publishers only partly explains the durability of this specific commodity.

    "title": "Representing school arson in Kenya: An analysis of newspaper reporting",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Arson is a recurrent problem in Kenyan secondary schools. Although school violence – notably gun violence – has received significant attention, there has been less academic attention paid to school arson, especially in Africa. This study explores how newspaper reports in Kenya framed school arson and links these framings to broader questions about the understanding and production of Kenyan identity. A thematic analysis of 334 newspaper reports revealed multiple understandings of school arson. Print media discourse afforded journalists an opportunity to make a commentary on the post-colonial globalized Kenyan society. We discuss the implications of this for understanding post-colonial media in Africa. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through comparative content analysis of online news reports ( N = 420), we examined how indigenous values and source citation practices (re)define journalistic objectivity away from the normative comfort domain of ‘The American standard’. We argue that ‘African’ journalistic practices will more possibly reflect more ‘objective’ narratives with a critical gaze to African values such as ‘ Ubuntu’ and ‘ Afriethics’. By comparing ‘grassroots’ with ‘elite’ source citations as reflected in ‘African’ media reportage, we found that African news narratives that embrace ‘Community Journalism’ reflect more grassroots than elite voices as distinct from ‘Western’ libertarian journalistic practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Tunis, March 1976: the Non-Aligned Symposium on Information prepares a programme for safeguarding national cultures and overcoming global imbalances in information flows and communication systems in order to ‘obtain the decolonization of information and initiate a new international order in information’. The mandate came from the NonAligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Algiers in 1973 which had declared that ‘the activities of imperialism are not confined solely to the political and economic fields, but also cover the cultural and social fields’ calling for ‘concerted action in the fields of mass communication’. The Tunis Symposium’s call for a New International Information Order, with mechanisms such as the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool, was endorsed by the NAM Summit in Colombo later the same year. This NAM campaign, supported by the socialist countries, led to an historic media debate at the UN and UNESCO as well as in media professional associations and among communication scholars around the world. The concept of a New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) became a central element in this debate, with landmarks such as the MacBride Commission (1980) and its well-known report Many Voices, One World. The great media debate and its historical experience is well documented in communication literature (Gerbner et al., 1993; Golding and Harris, 1997; Vincent et al., 1999; Carlsson, 2003), but an awareness of its relevance to contemporary communication debates is restricted to a narrow sphere of academia and some non-governmental organizations. Tunis, November 2005: information and communication issues are once again debated in an international forum. The second phase of the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), following the FROM NWICO TO WSIS",

    "title": "The meta-process of `mediatization' as a conceptual frame",
    "abstract": "In the rapidly changing global environment, there is a need for a conceptual frame that takes account of the wide range of theories and explanations for developments in media and communication, which also encompasses drivers like globalization, individualization and the growing importance of the market economy as a reference system. Academic research here does a lot of interesting work ‐ but we lack a conceptual frame to order all these partial results and theories. Such a frame would make it easier to find a common language between different academic cultures in the world, such that we can learn better from their results and theoretical efforts. This is necessary because academic research is important for civic society, which needs objective information about what is happening in a changing world and how to influence it. Driven by their interests, money and power, economic and political systems already employ large networks to collect, exchange and use knowledge, but the exchange of information between civil societies, including academic researchers, is much less systematic and complete. Worldwide academic communication research needs a common conceptual framework within which to integrate and disseminate this knowledge. This article briefly sketches some general concepts which perhaps may be helpful here.",

For any academic researchers from diverse fields who are interested in these issues, as well as technology and social change in general, this book brings fresh data with a new perspective.

In this I argue for freedom of expression and journalistic independence as imperatives. The impediments are that no models exist to date which could be implemented around the world. However, data by Splichal and Sparks (1994) shows that journalism students in very differing countries have a desire for independence and autonomy of journalism. This permits hope in a normatively infused journalistic professional model as an agent of change.",

In sum, Williams has written a highly accessible yet multifaceted account of the history and current state of international journalism. At the same time, the relative absence of more critical discussions with the academic literature and the lack of a theoretical framework to provide a more encompassing interpretation of the described changes in the field may make the book a somewhat less satisfying read for more advanced students of journalism.",

    "title": "Sectarianism and the Arab Spring: Framing the popular protests in Bahrain",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Inspired by the events of the Arab Spring, political activists in Bahrain organized an anti-government demonstration on 14 February 2011, which resulted in the death of one protestor. Hundreds of other protests followed, and popular anger against the Sunni monarchy is still a vital issue in the Kingdom. From the earliest stages, the Bahraini government, which is closely aided by other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, framed the protests as an Iran-backed conspiracy against the Gulf in an attempt to spread Shiism and infiltrate into the region. This sectarian dimension became the dominant frame in order to discredit the cause of the mostly Shiite protestors who were asking for equal rights and job opportunities. This study investigates the different issues and sentiments framed by the commentators as well as the main online communities that were present. Despite its importance in providing a vital venue for the online public sphere and in documenting popular protests, YouTube is also a platform for schism as flaming and highly sectarian exchanges of comments are frequently made. </jats:p>",

    "title": "New strategies of China’s film industry as soft power",
    "abstract": "The concept of ‘soft power’ has its discourse and ramifications in the Chinese context. Since the essence of ‘soft power’ lies in a country’s capability that ‘co-opts people rather than coerces them’ (Nye and Wang, 2009: 18), culture is always considered a significant source of ‘soft power’, and cultural industries are crucial mechanisms to materialize such power. The film industry of mainland China is considered by the Party-state an indispensable manifestation of soft power. Since 2003, China’s film industry has undergone a drastic transformation. The transformation culminated between 2006 and 2008 with new trends and strategies to magnify Chinese soft power fully revealed. This essay seeks to analyze the new strategies and new trends of the film industry within the context of the Chinese government’s embrace of the concept of ‘soft power’. As defined by Chinese President Hu Jintao in his speech on October 24, 2007 to the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese version of ‘soft power’ is primarily composed of four aspects: (1) the ‘socialist core-values system’ that highlights Marxism, ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics’, patriotism and collectivism; (2) A ‘harmonious culture’ and a morally uplifting society based on honesty and integrity; (3) the exaltation of traditional Chinese culture to foster ‘a spiritual home commonly identified by the entire Chinese nation’; and (4) the innovation of culture and the liberalization of the ‘cultural production force’ (Hu, 2007). As such, President Hu acknowledged the importance of culture as a source of national cohesion, creativity, and overall national strength. This essay argues that the Chinese government purposefully employs the new strategies to attempt to build a kind of ‘Chinawood’ to enhance China’s cultural power, as analyzed below. ARTICLE",

    "title": "Part I: Researching media internationalization",
    "abstract": "At the beginning of his comparative economic history, Kenneth Pomerantz states his determination to take the question ‘why wasn’t England the Yangzi Delta?’ as seriously as ‘why wasn’t the Yangzi Delta England?’ (2000: 13). The result is to destabilize completely our inherited account of how a supposedly distinctive and ‘superior’ Western economic, social and legal infrastructure and capitalist ‘spirit’ generated the 19thand 20th-century economic dominance of ‘the West’. Would a genuine internationalization of media history yield equally disruptive results? On the face of it, no, because the modern media on which we concentrate (from the national press onwards) emerged first within the already divergent economies and empires of the West. The power of Pomerantz’s argument is to start from the extensive economic similarities between the less and more developed parts of ‘the West’ and ‘the East’ even in the late 18th century; but media history offers no such early similarities, and the links between the history of political change in the West and the growth of modern media are difficult to ignore. I want, however, to argue that a fully international – that is, comprehensively and mutually comparative – media studies would constitute a disruption to existing media studies no less far reaching, if more subtle, than Pomerantz envisages in economic history. In the media case, the path towards a genuine internationalization starts out not from our assumptions about the past, but from our assumptions about the present (and future): we need to unwork the Western bias behind continual claims that current forms of mediasaturated society in parts of the West represent a necessary ‘modernization’, a path towards an unavoidable and fully ‘wired’ future. The ease with which highly particular assumptions are naturalized as ‘modern’ THEMED SECTION",

    "title": "The changing web of Chinese nationalism",
    "abstract": "An essential component in nation-building processes around the world, nationalism is central to China’s online discourse and the evolving political identity of Chinese internet users. While politicians and activists in the country prefer the label, ‘patriotism’ (aiguozhuyi), the fundamental idea is clear: to many of today’s Chinese netizens, allegiance to the nation takes priority over other identities, ideologies and political actions. Nationalism, in this broad sense, underlies almost all political discussion in China’s cyberspace due to the withering away of communism, the need of the authorities to maintain social cohesion, and the lack of alternatives created by the censorship regime. But as the anti-Japanese protests in April 2005 demonstrate, web-based nationalistic formations can materialize offline in a way that poses a threat to not only social stability in cities like Beijing and Shanghai but also the actual standing of the party-state as the only legitimate representative of the Chinese nation. Nationalism is so central to online politics in China that it can be found in every form of electronic communication – websites, email, SMS, instant messaging, and so on – the totality of which constitutes an evolving web of hyperlinks, activists and extensive social fabrics. In April 2005, when official mass media suspended coverage on anti-Japanese nationalist demonstrations throughout China, concerned netizens could easily access pictures and writings about the protests through email attachments and ICQ file transfers. Nationalistic video clips and Flash games were widely available on the net. Chinese hackers started to coordinate a new cyber-war against Japan, as they did against the US after the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. It is, however, crucial to bear in mind that online nationalism does not automatically lead to mass movements. Due to state control, the realignment of the global political economy after September 11 2001, and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, there was a peculiar WEB REVIEW",

This paper unsettles this assumption by showing that state actors in the US and the EU are stretching border controls into neighbouring and distant territories. These borders, which are dependent on transnational ICT networks, are permitting state actors to re-scale border controls in a way that transcends the territorial framework of the nation-state system. These network-like borders are discussed in terms of their contribution to mobility inequality; their implications for those who have turned to concepts such as ‘diaspora’ as a way of escaping ‘the iron grip of the nation-state on the social imagination’; and their implications for state power. </jats:p>",

Drawing on interviews with industry insiders, the article explores the industry’s communicative agency in both the media sphere and key sites of power, with a focus on the European Union (EU) policy sphere. The analysis shows that the industry has focused primarily on maintaining access to policymakers and sustaining elite consensus around the existing global intellectual property rights regime through political communication activities that largely bypass mediated public arenas – from strategically promoting its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes and mobilizing third-party endorsement to direct lobbying. The article concludes by reflecting on the implications of the findings for critical investigations of the interplay between media and political power in relation to global economic governance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "economic and international uncertainties in the context of ongoing US-China trade war and the 2019-2020 new Coronavirus pandemic. In this sense, Wanda’s rise and fall indicate that the process of China’s media globalization is not a linear process, involving ups and downs, just like its relationship with all its East Asian neighbours discussed in the book. This can also apply to the rise of BAT, namely Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, in and beyond China, as illustrated in the chapter by Michael Kean and Chunmeizi Su. The geopolitics of China’s media globalization in the region and beyond, as pointed out by Keane in Chapter 1 and Yecies in Chapter 9, remains an important external factor to be considered when it comes to discussing the current state and future of China’s burgeoning cultural and creative industries. Overall, the edited volume Willing Collaborators offers timely and insightful accounts of the fast-growing and fast-internationalizing media and cultural industries in mainland China, and their growing impact on Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan. It is recommended reading for everyone, academic or practitioner, who is interested in China and its collaborations and interactions with the creative industries of its East Asian neighbours.",

The final section focuses on developing appropriate concepts for internationalizing media studies. In his short reflective piece Cees Hamelink argues for international media ethics, while Kaarle Nordenstreng’s contribution is helpful in formulating appropriate media research methods in the context of internationalizing media studies. John Downing offers an overview of programmes in the US academy that deal with international media studies and Winston Mano examines the state of media studies in Africa. The section ends with a chapter by Gerard Goggin and Mark McLelland, which focuses on the internationalization of the internet and its implications for media studies as a field. The ideas and the arguments offered by the different authors in this collection are fresh and original. A book of this kind has long been needed and the editor has filled this vacuum by bringing together a valuable compendium of articles around the much discussed theme of ‘de-Westernizing’ media research and the emergence of trans-cultural media studies.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Podcasting has moved rapidly from the underground and pirate radio fringe to the heart of public-service media, with the BBC, NPR, CBC and Australia’s ABC all early adopters of the technology. The public-service broadcasting (PSBing) ethos appears both compatible with, and challenged by, the podcasting phenomenon. Podcasting’s appeal lies in its capacity for time-shifting, portable consumption and global distribution of audio content. Moreover, podcasting piggybacks on existing distribution infrastructure, and is particularly appealing to technologically savvy youth audiences whom public-service broadcasters (PSBers) traditionally have difficulty attracting. Yet podcasting simultaneously creates highly fragmented audiences with doubtful brand loyalty. Equally problematically, the medium’s relationship to commercial media has been close from its inception, as the term ‘podcasting’ itself suggests. It is precisely podcasting’s complex relationship with PSBing ideals — both complementary and potentially conflictual — which makes it such a rich case-study for examining the continued viability of PSBing in the digital media environment. </jats:p>",

Recently, Qatar made global headlines in connection with an alleged bribe to win the 2022 World Cup bid, which creates a rare opportunity to examine Al-Jazeera’s coverage of this as well as other Qatari affairs. We compared coverage by Al-Jazeera Arabic, Al-Jazeera English and Al-Jazeera America with coverage of international networks (Sky News, CNN International and ITV). The analysis reveals that while Al-Jazeera English and America maintained high journalistic norms when reporting on the 2022 World Cup controversy, Al-Jazeera Arabic almost never criticizes its Qatari sponsor. The study highlights the dramatic differences between Al-Jazeera’s English and Arabic versions, looking at journalistic values in general and Qatari affairs coverage in particular. </jats:p>",

Frequently invoked, the notion of ‘diversity’ is seldom questioned. While endowed with a powerful incantatory power, it is not without its problems. Its looseness obfuscates the policy objectives pursued in its name, just as its seeming novelty prevents us from seeing those initiatives in a historical perspective. Tracing the genealogy of diversity policies in France, this article demonstrates that they have sought not only to promote the integration of ethnic minorities but also – and no less importantly – to protect internal security. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "the growing power of the Mainland market. Does such a shift signify the diversification of global media production, or merely the subdivision of world markets into separate spheres of cultural-linguistic influence? And, as major Western media players attempt to access the Mandarin television market through co-productions, what impact will this have on programming? The volume concludes with an extremely useful timeline of key moments in Chinese-language television history, both in East Asia and beyond. Criticizing an edited collection for what it omits is far easier than addressing what it contains. The essays here are – as the editors themselves note – heavily weighted towards Hong Kong and the People’s Republic, with far less attention paid to Taiwan. This perhaps reflects the current state of the field: to the best of my knowledge, there exists no monograph in English on Taiwanese television. More surprisingly, though the impact of satellite television is addressed directly, digital technology is not. Given the importance of the digital for industry insiders and policymakers, and its centrality in creating and sustaining new transnational audiences, a chapter in which its implications are addressed head-on was perhaps warranted. Ultimately, however, these are minor quibbles: this is a book that, in its breadth, depth and focus, currently has no obvious competitors in the English-language market.",

This article seeks to hold this argument up to empirical scrutiny via a framing analysis of coverage of the US election in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To some extent, the analysis supports the claim: throughout the election, the KSA media offered several substantive criticisms of democracy. However, Trump’s campaign also served as a catalyst for a discussion about the merits of democracy, revealing some admiration for its key principles, and an acknowledgement of the challenges it faces in the 21st century. </jats:p>",

Globalization once belonged to the West and now the tables are turning. We have entered the era of the ‘rise of the rest’. Western media and politics of representation have celebrated the rise of the West for 200 years, how then do they represent the rise of the rest? The main trends are that the rise of the rest is ignored, or represented as a threat, or celebrated in business media as a triumph of the marketplace. Media echoing free market ideology have contributed to vast wealth polarization; representing the rise of the rest as a threat contributes to global political polarization; recycling the 9/11 complex produces cultural and political polarization; and overusing celebrity narratives contributes to existential polarization. These are the global divides discussed in this article. In the wake of the economic crisis of 2008 there have been marked changes in discourse and a new motif has taken shape: recruiting the rest to rescue the West. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article focuses on plurilingual processes in two European-based news agencies: Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Agence télégraphique suisse (ATS). Fieldwork (observation and semi-structured interviews) was conducted in Switzerland at the regional office of AFP in Geneva and at the head office of ATS in Bern. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential consequences of a highly plurilingual production process on the one hand, and of the ostensible invisibility of multilingualism/translation on the other hand. Some of the interviewed journalists acknowledge the risks that may be posed by interlingual and intercultural transfer (translation), given the working norms of news agencies (rapidity, accuracy of information, and adaptation to the audience). However, the institutional denial of these possible biases may prevent news agencies from reducing them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Laborie’s chapter illuminates this point by discussing the formation in 1947 of the International Telephone Consultative Committee (CCIF), an effort to separate the political from the technical spheres; however, the entanglement of these two arenas wasn’t quite eased. The political struggle over technical standards surrounding data networks is also illustrated by Valérie Schafer, a case which the international standard for videotex was contested by states fighting for competitive advantage in this new market, with the ITU – through its Consultative Committee on International Telephony and Telegraphy (CCITT) – playing a central role in this techno-diplomacy; though, like Winseck, Schafer notes the diminished role of the ITU over the internet. These three themes in the volume are far from mutually exclusive; rather they are tightly intertwined, though the elements are unevenly emphasized throughout the chapters as the authors offer an in-depth exploration of the complex processes of “techno-diplomacy” within the ITU. Balbi and Fickers’ edited volume is more than the history of the ITU and politics of technological change. By locating the ITU as a nexus of transnational politics surrounding ICTs, it uncovers the making of global telecommunications from the 19th century to the present. Historians and media scholars have long studied the history of telecommunication from the point of view of states, militaries, multinational corporations and financiers;3 however, this book offers that history from a transnational perspective which adds another dimension to the inquiry that widens the current scholarship.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents part of the findings of a wider empirical study focusing on memories of three generations in Mexico. The study investigated the relationships between the three generational groups, their access to, and reception of, different media technologies, and how these affected the construction of their media memories. The authors show how social class, gender and age, and different media technologies (such as radio, television and the internet) interact to form media memories of ‘global’ events. Access to, and familiarity with, these material support systems combined with the social distribution of specific kinds of cognitive dispositions are the key conditions for making sense of media messages. Contesting some assumptions about the ‘globality’ of media messages and experiences, this article’s conclusions and findings provide empirical evidence of a more complex situation. The study found only a limited ‘global’ effect on the lower social classes, who form the majority of the population; in contrast, it was the privileged social classes of peripheral countries who ‘behaved’ in a global way and expressed their memories as ‘global’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Philosophers have considered the problems of knowledge, information and technology for millennia. The industrial revolution, the development of capitalism and the Enlightenment intensified the significance of the analysis of these ‘resources’. Certainly by the time Karl Marx had conducted the bulk of his studies on capitalism, it became clear that we could think of none of these things as ‘neutral’ given their embedding in specific historical contexts. Considerations of the implications of technological development animated important strands of 20th-century philosophy. Inspired by Marx, members of the Frankfurt School were among the most influential thinkers on these issues. Marcuse, Adorno, Horkheimer and Benjamin considered the impact of technology, both as REVIEW ESSAY",

    "title": "Contradictions of the globalizing moment",
    "abstract": "London, August 2004: sufficient for context. The logics of the analysis of globalization seem now to privilege space over time, geography over history. Yet history is not ending but running fast, with dramatic changes in focus and debate, so that one’s standpoint needs to be addressed not only in terms of categories of social life and political orientation but also of the time and place from/in which one writes. Far from obliterating the traces of the moment, they need to be better written into our work, as indications of where we are when thinking the things we think. British television: for the moment. BBC channels are dominated by the Olympics, throughout the day, pushing other programmes off the schedule, helped by the relative synchronicity with Athens. European timing. Mediated sport is one obvious example of globalization processes. The modern Olympics are an example of the emergence of global competitions, which Robertson (1992: 59) suggests are central to the take-off phase of globalization. No mention, though, of the role of broadcasting whereby media are carriers of this other, earlier, element of globalization and make it public. Sport has been seen as part of the ‘civilizing process’ (Elias, 1978), whereby more and more people come to abide by universal rule-governed behaviour that includes making up the ‘rules of the game’ and the mechanisms for keeping them. Thus, articulation of International Olympic Committee (IOC) corruption (explored in a documentary in August 2004 on Panorama, the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme) and doping scandals (high drama when two leading Greek athletes provided the headline story on the eve of the games’ opening) were said to only strengthen the rule-bound and transparent nature of sport. Indeed, as the Olympic games ‘come home to Athens’, the ‘home of democracy’, at the same time that international conflict was being waged and extended ‘to bring democracy’ to Others, the essence of democracy is worth spelling out (pace Keane, 1991). This centres on the ability by the people to re-write the rules of the game and even to determine who has the right to write the rules. All the attempts by the Islamic Republic to write about ‘religious democracy’ and the attempts by US ground forces to impose democracy don’t fly if the rules themselves cannot be re-written and if the rulers cannot be removed by the ruled when necessary. Global sport is obviously big business, as is media coverage, and both function to extend the global reach of capital. Eleven key sponsors",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the late 1990s, a wave of dynasty drama serials began to dominate primetime dramatic programming in People's Republic of China (PRC) television, which soon created a viewing frenzy among Chinese audiences around the world. Together with Taiwan's idol drama and Hong Kong's martial arts sagas and contemporary social mobility dramas, by the early 2000s, PRC's dynasty drama had saturated a pan-Chinese media market. Using transnational dramas from the three Chinese language media production centers as a springboard, this article explores two issues concerning the global circulation of Chinese language television dramas: the forces conducive to their transnational circulation and its cultural and economic impact. It utilizes the framework of the `cultural-linguistic market' to analyze the factors enabling the formation of a Chinese cultural-linguistic media and the products viable for the market. It further entertains the question of how the emergence of a Chinese cultural-linguistic market, together with other cultural-linguistic markets, complicates the power dynamic of global cultural flow. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Why do pluralistic media systems emerge? Comparing media change in the Czech Republic and in Russia after the collapse of communism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> A quarter of a century after the collapse of communism in the former Eastern bloc, a wide range of scholarly projects have been undertaken to compare and theorize processes of media change in the region. One question that scholars have sought to address is: what were the factors that crucially impacted how these media landscapes evolved? This essay aims to contribute to this debate by juxtaposing media change in two selected cases: the Czech Republic (as a best-case scenario in terms of convergence with the Western model) and Russia (as a scenario where convergence has been limited). Based on secondary analysis of a wide range of sources, the essay systematically exposes 11 crucial differences between the two countries and illustrates how these have impacted the processes of media change. The conclusion sets out how these findings could serve as a starting point and source of inspiration for future comparative research. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Film Review: The Yacoubian Building (2006)",
    "abstract": "Amidst the attenuated art deco splendour of a downtown Cairo apartment block, a microcosm of Egyptian society lives out its everyday conflicts and dramas. A parable of the contemporary Egyptian citizen’s determined – and not infrequently desperate – will to survive, The Yacoubian Building (Arabic, ‘Imarat Ya’qubian) marks the hugely successful debut of 27-year-old director, Marwan Hamed. Adapted from dentistturned-writer Alaa al-Aswany’s 2002 novel of the same title, itself the bestselling Arabic novel for the years 2002 and 2003, The Yacoubian Building is the first production from the Good News Film and Music corporation, established in 2001, and has now out-grossed any other film in the history of Egyptian cinema. Like its novelistic (1967) and cinematic (1968) predecessor Miramar, by Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz, The Yacoubian Building charts the destinies of a cast of symbolic characters, each representing a different class, or epoch in Egypt’s modern political history, and inhabiting a shared metaphorical site of narrative action. In an ironic inversion of the national socio-economic structure, at the apex of the Yacoubian Building live the impoverished working class, who settle their large families into the store rooms that once served the building’s wealthy, cosmopolitan tenants. In the apartments below them exist a medley of fading aristocrats and arrivistes, all characters struggling in the face of corruption, social oppression and thwarted ambition. As we learn from the film’s short sepia prologue, the Yacoubian Building (an actual edifice in the Talat Harb quarter of downtown Cairo, and site of author al-Aswany’s first dental practice) was constructed by a wealthy Armenian in the 1920s, when it housed a cross-section of Egypt’s local and foreign elites: Turco-Circassian and Egyptian nobility, intellectuals, monied Europeans and Jews. Following the revolution of 1952, the social make-up of the building transformed accordingly, through to F ILM REVIEW",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We present here the results of recent studies on the emergence in Quebec of associations of a new kind, which we call technology activist groups. These groups consist of individuals who, on the basis of their own expertise in computer programming or in establishing specialist technological structures (WiFi hotspots), are developing social practices involving information technologies (ICTs). We try to give some elements of a response to some specific questions such as: What effects are these technology activists having on the dynamics of community activism in Quebec? In a broader context, at the level of political imagination in today’s societies, how far can these technical activist groups act politically to help redefine the project of the coming ‘information society’? And conversely, can the project of a ‘knowledge-sharing society’ — as formulated by the representatives of civil society organizations at the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) in Tunis — help to redefine the aims and actions of actors in community politics? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines, by comparative thematic analysis, public perceptions of global journalistic norms of independence and integrity by studying perceptions of news media corruption in three Eastern European countries: Serbia, Macedonia and Croatia. In-depth interviews with 61 representatives of the three nations revealed that, in the public eye, the breaches of journalistic independence and integrity are frequent and take different forms. The participants from Serbia, Macedonia and Croatia thought that journalists from their countries often succumb to pressures from politicians, owners and advertisers; that they receive direct bribes for positive coverage and even extort money from people; and that news media are engaged in hidden advertising and journalists are engaged in nepotism. The results show similarity of public perceptions of breaches of journalistic independence and integrity with academic and professional findings and are discussed from the point of view of the cross-country examination of the attribution theory in the context of audiences’ use of situational and trait characteristics in understanding journalistic ethical norms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the social and political importance of printed magazines at a time of social and mobile media. It draws on a cross-cultural ethnographic research amongst two different political organisations in Britain and Spain. Although differing in political cultures and strategies, both organisations invest their few economic resources in the production of printed activist magazines, as well as in the development of web platforms. This study investigates why for these political groups’ materiality matters. It argues that looking at why people – and especially grassroots political organisations – remain attached to material forms of communication, whilst at the same time developing online ones, can raise critical questions on the connection between subjectivity, political association and new technologies, as well as on the difference between individualised and collective forms of communication. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The fluidity of soft power in YouTube’s broadcast of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an era of heightened geopolitical tension, marked by a dynamic power shift between the West and China, the 2022 Winter Olympic Games emerged as a focal point of diplomatic contention. Several Western nations signalled their dissent through diplomatic boycotts, while China, conversely, seized this platform to strategically enhance its soft power. This paper explores how the Chinese government utilized the 2022 Winter Olympic Games’ opening ceremony as a canvas for the portrayal of its national image, and examines the resonance of this portrayal with the global audience. The opening ceremony provided China with an unrivalled opportunity to express its cultural identity, political ideology and aspirations to an international audience. Consequently, this research delves into the intangible aspects of media and image perception, with a particular focus on the role of YouTube as a repository for live streams from the traditional broadcaster, Eurosport. It is crucial to understand that the depiction of national image and its perception by a global audience are not static, but fluid concepts, constantly shaped by the socio-political context. Therefore, this paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of the fluidity inherent in the construction and projection of China’s soft power. It sheds light on the intricate choreography of international diplomacy, media strategy and national branding. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the role of violence in Shabash and ‘History of the Freedom Movement in India: The Ghadar Movement, 1913–1918’, two key texts of the Gadar Party, a US-based political party of South Asians that campaigned for Indian independence in the early twentieth century. In these texts, violence operates both as universal communication and as a critique of the possibility of universal communication. Acts of violence allow oppressed societies to secure the status of civilized nations. Violence also operates as a historiographic principle that enables the writing of universal history, linking present with past and incorporating national histories into global narratives. On the other hand, violence fails to sustain communities beyond a narrow conception of political community. The body that suffers violence negates the very possibility of communication. I also argue that violence in these contradictory roles brokers a relationship between national identity and global belonging in Gadar thought. </jats:p>",

In doing so, the article addresses recurrent patterns within neo-corporatist policy concertation that is oriented toward satisfying neoliberal economic imperatives.

    "abstract": "Recently I have been reading a history of the Majapahit Empire, which in the 12th century conquered all of the Southeast Asia archipelago, encompassing what is now Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the southern Philippines. It is fascinating how empires came and went in this part of the world, before and after the Majapahit Empire. A common thread running through the history is the role played by China and India. When China and India opened their doors and conducted trade with Southeast Asia, the region prospered. But when China and India, for various reasons, closed their doors, even slightly, the region began to lag, first in economics and then in other fruits of international trade. So, for Singapore, which is concerned with the economics of the region, both China and India have loomed large. It is clear that China and India will loom larger in the not-so-distant future for all of humanity on earth. The sheer scale of the populations, the competition to get ahead in both countries, the desire and will of the populace to succeed, which is increasingly now coupled with available resources, all mean that both China and India can and will have a major impact on the world. In this short piece, I want to reflect on the impact of China and India in academic research.",

    "title": "The abject/the terrorist/the reel Arab – a point of intersection",
    "abstract": "Julia Kristeva (1982) argues that the abject not only lies outside the self but also functions as its opposition. The abject is ‘immoral, sinister [and] scheming’ (Kristeva 1982). Furthermore, abjection is the state of revulsion that is a threat to the being of the self as it blurs the boundaries between the subject and object, leading to its destruction. The abject becomes the other, the source of fear. Abject representations of terrorists post-9/11 have flooded the media. These images of abjection, however, are problematic as they solidify the ugly image of the Hollywood Arab, in which Arabs are generally viewed as one whole mass: as Lina Khatib (2006) observes Arabs ‘are not assigned a particular nationality or even a particular Arabic accent or dialect’. The terrorist’s image conforms to the modality set by film, and by mirroring the reel image1 it obfuscates the line between the real and the unreal. This paper proposes that such portrayals have been successful in placing the Arab within the abject, a priori not human. Initially, the paper will outline the portrayal of the Arab in film, before examining the point at which the images of the reel Arab and the real terrorist interconnect through a study of a number of terrorist images vis-a-vis these reel portrayals, and ultimately show how the images of terrorists aired in the news media have not deviated from these preset stereotypes. Jack Shaheen has documented Hollywood misrepresentations of Arabs in two of his books Reel Bad Arabs and Guilty: Hollywood’s Verdict on Arabs after 9/11, two comprehensive studies, in which he analyzed at least 1150 films (Shaheen, 2008, 2009). Shaheen (2008) argues that Arabs ‘remain the most maligned group in the history of Hollywood’ and that malicious ‘stereotypes equating Islam and Arabs with violence have endured for more than a century’. The Arab is always the evil other outside of the self, outside of civilization and needs to be defeated; s/he is physically menacing and repellent. This abjection has to be contained. According to Kristeva (1982), within abjection lies a dark and violent revolt at being, which is directed against a threat that ‘seems to emanate from an exorbitant outside or inside’ and culminates in a violent mourning for a lost object.

    "title": "Book review: Misunderstanding the Internet",
    "abstract": "the book to highlight negative dimensions of IT use: mobile phone use and internet connectivity among workers from rural areas can sustain a ‘false consciousness’, exacerbating feelings of being lost in urban host societies. Chung-tai assesses class differentials by looking at the use of the Chinese instant messaging application Mobile QQ among workers. Its use allows workers to remain connected while floating between workplaces, thus escaping a repetitive working life. Yet, they also become prone to withdrawal. Denison and Johanson delve into external migration and showcase the multiple – diaspora and lifestyle based – identities that young Chinese migrants adopt in Prato, Italy and Melbourne, Australia. By analysing expatriate bloggers, Herold covers the rarely accounted for situation of expats. Not only do they sustain online expatriate communities, by interpreting and communicating Chinese realities to people back home in Europe and the US, expats may build ‘bridges’ of understanding. In sum, this anthology ambitiously attempts to cover the wide spectrum of IT use among migrants. The red thread of the collection sometimes becomes opaque, also due to the many different disciplines included, such as linguistics, cultural psychology, sociology, media studies and ethnography. The volume would have benefited from stronger engagement with post-colonial scholarship on diaspora as well as from attention to financial inequalities, dangers, extremisms and surveillance. In addition, an unwanted dichotomy between the online and offline is partially reified due to the lack of attention to the interconnectedness of online and offline experiences. However, the book does offer a wide-ranging introduction for students interested in the cultural dynamics of transnational media flows and inspiration for scholars working at the intersection of migration and media studies.",

One way of doing this has been to interview eminent scholars in our field. In this issue we carry an extensive and in-depth interview with Lu Xinyu, one of the leading Chinese scholars of media and communication and an important voice within China’s growing ‘new left’ intellectual movement. The interview, conducted by Global Media and Communication editor Yuezhi Zhao, is wide-ranging and theoretically rigorous. Lu is chair of the Radio and Television Department at Fudan University’s School of Journalism and Communication, one of China’s leading communication programmes and has been a leading figure in developing alternative perspectives on communication research, notably China’s New Documentary Movement (NDM). At the heart of her analysis is the now unfashionable notion of class. As Lu notes in the interview:",

    "title": "The pragmatic politics of media reform: Media movements and coalition-building in Latin America",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the strategies and the impact of two ‘media movements’ in Latin America — the experiences of civic coalitions working on media policy reform in Uruguay, and advocacy journalism about tobacco control in Argentina — through interviewing the principle actors involved in these movements and reviewing the literature relevant to them. Media movements refer to a broad set of civic initiatives to transform media structures, practices, and content. The analysis aims to discuss the goals and tactics of civic actions to promote media democracy. The cases show a critical yet pragmatic sensitivity among progressive actors who use advocacy and legislative mechanisms to catalyze changes in media systems. The article has three implications for the study of global media democracy. First, to assess the impact of media movements, it is necessary to understand the press as a field that ‘refracts’ the influence of external forces. The successes and setbacks of media movements suggest the need to understand the conditions that make the media susceptible to civic efforts. Second, the findings bolster the case for conceptualizing the role of the state as an arena for competing interests struggling to influence media systems. Third, the state remains a crucial actor for media democracy in a globalized world. Key decisions affecting media structures and news content remain closely linked to the state. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In September 2018, the second wave of #Metooindia resumed in India, opening up conversations on sexual assault. Surprisingly, this did not lead to the inclusion of sexual assault as a key campaign issue in the Indian parliamentary elections in early 2019. This study investigates the underlying role of news media and social media in building an anti-sexual assault agenda in the 2019 Indian Lok Sabha election campaign. It builds on past literature on rational choice decision-making theory, social media activism and rape as a political issue in campaigns. This mixed method study includes the analysis of political manifestos and Facebook posts during the campaign, news articles published in the two most circulated English newspapers in India and interviews with political journalists. The restrained mainstream media coverage of sexual assault and pan-Indian social media platforms helped to limit the issue from becoming a part of the campaign during the elections. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The case for communication rights: A rights-based approach to media development",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> From the 1980s, international organizations have devised strategies to develop national media systems to make them more diverse and inclusive so as to both exhibit and preserve local cultures. However, these strategies have not always been successful since information has become a commodity, because the interests of private actors prevent equal access to communication rights. This article outlines a perspective on media development from a rights-based approach, derived from a critique of dominant perspectives from international organizations with a strong focus on technology provisions. The article argues for media development based on the right to communication as an alternative to commodification of information. Through examples from Brazil and Kenya, the article illustrates that viewing communication as a basic right can lead to the inclusion of more voices in the public discourse. In addition, a model for media development is proposed, suggesting that the state and national civil society play a significant role in promoting diverse national public spheres. </jats:p>",

Based on theory and examples of practice, it argues that the exercise of popular sovereignty through mass movements and collective actions contribute to the strengthening of the sovereignty of individuals and to limiting the extent of the state’s sovereign power. </jats:p>",

It is not entirely novel to point out the ideological ambivalence of the Chinese state, yet is such ambivalence a deliberate, strategic choice to camouflage a choice (either left or right) already made, or is there a real struggle (and difficulty) to articulate a developmental vision that connects to everyday experiences in the market reform? A comprehensive answer is probably beyond the scope of this book, yet readers (having read a forceful critique of liberal dichotomous assumptions) might expect an ending that discusses not only how a Western-centric view of Xi versus Mao is largely irrelevant but also where present-day China is located against the background of nearly two centuries of revolutionary struggles against Western imperialism and capitalism.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> From climate change to the war on terror, from financial meltdowns to forced migrations, from pandemics to world poverty and from humanitarian disasters to the denial of human rights, these and other global crises represent the dark side of our global age. They are spawned by it. When represented within today’s world news ecology such ‘global crises’ can also shape processes of globalization — deepening our sense of globality and, possibly, contributing to what Ulrich Beck’s discerns as a ‘cosmopolitan outlook’ (Beck, 2006). With too few exceptions, however, researchers have yet to theorize and examine today’s endemic, interpenetrating and proliferating global crises or their complex dependencies on the world’s news media and emergent forms of global journalism. This article elaborates on these claims and sets out the case for taking global crises seriously, both ontologically and epistemologically, and how they can variously become enacted within the complex flows and formations of global news. </jats:p>",

The performance piece You Don’t Look Like provides a unique opportunity to examine how those who have been excluded from and reconfigured in the local televisual frame have negotiated their invisibility and their constructed Otherness. By reenacting some of Puerto Rico’s scenarios of blackness, You Don’t Look Like questions and denounces the positionality of black citizens in the island’s society, culture, and on television. The article argues that both directly and indirectly, Puerto Rico’s scenarios of blackness not only imply specific geographical sites within the island but also the racialized bodies and cultures that flow back and forth across the Caribbean Sea. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Media, cultural and communication studies' critique of the concept of creative industries as policy discourse has been as consistent as it has been negative. The gap between the remarkable enthusiasm with which it has been taken up in policy circles across many parts of the world and at many \nlevels (national, state, regional, supranational), and the depth of opposition to it academically, marks it out as a major contemporary instance of the gap between policy and critique (Cunningham, 1992). \nInterestingly, though, almost all of this critique has been focused on the British policy environment, and as such betrays a remarkably metropolitanist bias. This brief overview of policy situations elsewhere in the world offers an interesting case study in internationalizing media \nstudies, comparing their 'problematics' with those identified by Garnham as foundational to the creative industries discourse.",

    "title": "The economic inefficiencies of market liberalization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article returns to the long-running public service versus free market debate in media and communications but from a rather unconventional perspective. Critics of the steady, globally driven marketization of national public media and information services tend to object on social and political grounds. Market advocates, in contrast, make their case on economic grounds. Greater competition in markets, including media markets, brings economic efficiencies which, in turn, are a `public good'. This economic assertion is rarely scrutinized within media studies. The study presented here, which looks at financial media and communications in the London Stock Exchange (LSE), does just this. In recent decades the LSE has been opened up to accommodate the needs of international financial institutions and international capital flows. This has had a detrimental impact on its media and information systems. Such liberalization, it is argued, has made the LSE less economically efficient, not more, and with quite negative economic (as well as social) consequences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Decolonizing the internet",
    "abstract": "The 1990s were full of enthusiasm for the apparent power of new media to transcend local boundaries and bring the people of the world directly into contact with each other regardless of their separate governments. The rhetoric at the end of the 20th century about the power of information technology is reflected by a March 1994 speech by Al Gore. In order to preserve freedom and democracy, telecommunications development must be encouraged in every nation. In this way, citizens will think of themselves as members of the human family, instead of enemies. Interconnectedness, Gore said, will bring about ‘robust and sustainable economic progress, strong democracies, better solutions to global and local environmental challenges, improved health care, and – ultimately – a greater sense of shared stewardship of our small planet’ (Gore, 1994). Another cyberoptimist, Michael Hauben (1996), wrote about the way in which Netizens (as he called them) would be able to break through national boundaries and speak to each other in a free medium. While Netizens live physically in a particular country, everyone online is a ‘compatriot’; ‘geographical separation is replaced by existence in the same virtual space’. The image of togetherness, the idea that new media would be able to eliminate boundaries between people, seemed to suggest that the status of nationality and independent culture would be lessened in the electronic future. At the same time as this optimism was being expressed, it seemed as if there would be the unfortunate consequence that local languages would be lost in the process. The loss of local languages was decried at the start of the century, even if the globalization of English seemed like a necessary price to pay for the new camaraderie of Netizens. In one hundred years, some predicted, the number of the world’s languages would have been cut in half, to 3,000. Along with the language loss would come a homogenization of culture: ‘As the global drive to learn English eats up those remaining languages, it will also consume many 439806 GMC8110.1177/1742766512439806Review essayGlobal Media and Communication 2012",

    "title": "Wars and their journalisms",
    "abstract": "Does the nature of warfare somehow determine its news coverage? In particular, is the global war on terror so radically different from past wars that its reporting is, too? Some analysts and practitioners think so. Barbie Zelizer and Stuart Allan (2002: 1) introduce their collection Journalism After September 11 by asserting that ‘Shaken to their foundation have been familiar notions of what it means to be a journalist, how best to practice journalism and what different publics can reasonably expect of journalists in the name of democracy’. Veteran war correspondent Robert Fox (2003: 10) argues that the 9/11 attacks had ‘a major impact on the information media and the language of how we report conflict’. The BBC’s former director of news, Richard Sambrook, bluntly claims that ‘war coverage is changed forever’ (Byrne, 2003) by the demands of a worldwide war on terror. There is some truth in this view: the war on terror has unusual qualities and Western mainstream journalism is passing through an historical period of fundamental transformations. But does the one determine the other? Probably not so much. Most war reporting is noteworthy for its long-term continuity. Changes in journalism that relate to war coverage are likely to result from and reveal larger societal instabilities.",

    "title": "Reflections on Inter Press Service",
    "abstract": "News agencies are generally considered to be key agents in the process of news selection and dissemination, with a dominant role for a few Western actors. By determining which global issues will be distributed, they hold the power to set the international agenda for public debate, to shape public attitudes towards global issues and to define the world in which citizens operate. Global news is accordingly framed by the prevailing social, political and economic orientation of the West (Giffard, 1998a). One frequently criticized outcome of this is the ‘inadequate, negative, and stereotypical portrayal of developing countries’ (Rampal, 2002: 111). In addition to the issue of representation, several scholars have been criticizing dominant Western news providers such as Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France Press for reducing the range of news topics in their coverage and for nurturing a homogenized public discourse (Harrison, 2006: 92; Paterson, 2001: 84–9). A rich body of academic research has provided evidence for these and other imbalances and unequal power structures in international news reporting (cf. BoydBarrett, 2000; Thussu, 2000). Closely related to this strand of research and setting out from the premise that ‘an alternative to corporatized global communication is a moral imperative and a necessary democratic requirement’ (Thussu, 2000: 252), scholars have been exploring the value and role of alternative news voices such as Gemini (now part of an NGO), the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP, now operating as the online NAM News Network), PANA (Press) and Inter Press Service (IPS). What these initiatives all have in common is: their goal to ensure a greater balance in international news flows; their objective to strive for realistic representations of developing countries; and their continuous struggle to survive due to a lack of sufficient funding (Boyd-Barrett and Thussu, 1992). In retrospect, none of these agencies really posed a serious COMMENTARY",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study is an attempt to investigate the cultural aspects of North Korea by examining the everyday lives of the people, a topic that has been a blind spot in the body of previous research on North Korea. Although there are ample studies on North Korea due to its significance for world peace, they are limited to military and political aspects. To look into the micro-aspects of the social practice of ordinary people in North Korea, the method of post-modern ethnography is adopted. In-depth interviews and participatory observation of North Korean refugees in a special high school for them were conducted by focusing on their experiences of viewing South Korean media, which is absolutely prohibited in North Korea. Watching South Korean media is a fad among young North Koreans these days, although it is seen as delinquent behaviour by the authorities and the young people have to take the risk of being caught and sent to jail. The viewing patterns of media in people’s daily lives may be one of the few indicators of social change in such closed societies as North Korea. Due to persistent poverty and pervasive corruption, social minorities exist without social care and control. Young people as a social minority are free to create their own resistant culture in the social underside. With little hope for the future, the visual fantasy of South Korean media allows youth to dream of an alternative way of life. Watching South Korean TV is not simply a means of entertainment or escaping from reality, but also a means of signifying social change. This audience study of young North Koreans is meaningful in the sense that a marginal activity like watching TV in a social minority group could signify major social changes in the most stagnant society in the world. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Becker’s ‘Hierarchy of Credibility’ and the recognition that people at the top of society’s trees have good reasons to put their best face forward in public, and then to dissemble, deceive and indeed lie, even perhaps to social scientists. Conducting research amongst elite communicators, whose professional ethos is premised on careful presentation of self, means this problem is particularly acute. While this issue is rather elided in the presentation of case material it does hover in the background throughout this book. The pitfalls and challenges of elite research are unlikely to diminish. The Mediation of Power offers a compelling argument for more media and communications scholars to engage in elite studies, and to develop the research trajectory outlined by Davis. This book opens up many promising lines of inquiry and offers valuable suggestions for ways out of the theoretical impasse in which researchers interested in ideology, hegemony and communication have found themselves recently.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Participating in social networks has become a controversial phenomenon. In this study, we explore the relationship between the type of social network used by citizens of 18 Latin American countries (moderated by age) and satisfaction with democracy, based on the mediation carried out by satisfaction with life and economic self-placement. To do so, we have prepared a moderated mediation analysis with the survey carried out by Latinobarómetro in 2018 and in 2020. The results confirm an indirect effect between the networks included and satisfaction with democracy, mediated by the proposed variables, in a majority of the cases. </jats:p>",

Traditional news media have long held a favoured position when it comes to understanding democracy. Now social media has emerged as a new and exciting communication technology. This project explores social media use and the unique way in which media affect Latin Americans’ attitudes. Empirical analysis of survey data from eight Latin American states supports social media as a ‘public sphere’ where participants hold attitudes that are more democratic, separable from traditional media as well as general Internet use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many multi- and bilateral agencies have integrated the promotion of information and communication technologies in Africa into their programmes. Along with African NGOs, they strongly advocate the use of ICTs by government offices, private enterprises, schools and the public. In general, groups and actors involved in such efforts share a set of dispositions and worldviews which are highly ‘modernist’ and technocentrist and characterized by a propensity to view and act in favour of exogenous ‘technological’ solutions to development problems. One of the main characteristics of this rhetoric is that it accords no importance to existing social conditions, assuming that equipping people with computers will suffice to leapfrog them into the technological world of economic opportunities. This article critically reviews the main ideas presented by the proponents of this position in Africa and shows why there is a need for a more cautious approach to the question, without rejecting the promises of ICTs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the predominance of the ‘negativity’ factor as the primary determinant of news coverage in the German press – Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Tageszeitung and Der Spiegel – of events in Latin America. Based on a sample of 3831 articles published between January 2000 and December 2014, this study finds a general concentration of negative events (43.05%) with regard to 20 Latin American countries. However, since this number does not exceed 50%, the research assumption of a conflict-oriented news reporting has to be relativised. The ‘negativity’ rate stands out as sectorial depending on specific countries and areas of news coverage. Considerable interest in cultural issues helps to provide a more balanced image. While Honduras, Haiti, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Paraguay exhibit a strong negative balance, Costa Rica, Uruguay, Chile and Cuba boast a dynamic, positive image. Brazil and Mexico account for two ambivalent cases. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article attempts to develop a theoretical framework in order to understand how the media system has been enabling public figures to use hate speech to enhance their media prominence. The current scenario in Brazil, shaped by a high concentration of (private) media ownership, an economic crisis, deep political polarization, distrust of democracy and the right turn, provides a privileged case for analysing it. In this scenario, public figures preach violence against homosexuals on TV. Black people are insulted and compared to monkeys. Based on Max Weber’s ideal types and Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic capital, four ideal types have been identified: the hate preacher, the right-wing populist, the media polemicist and the intolerant comedian. The analysis makes it evident that hate speakers tend to be ‘backbenchers’ who guarantee their media prominence (or ‘capital’) through a strongly commercialized media system, particularly on TV and the Internet. </jats:p>",

We would be wrong. The small size and often dispersed distribution of many minorities makes it uneconomical for major advertisers to seek to reach them, whether through their own ‘ethnic’ media at the local level, or even the international satellite channels which now serve globally distributed minority audiences. While there may be enviable advantages to being segregated from commercial influence in this way, it is also a form of marginalization, a restriction of full cultural citizenship. This article contrasts the case of Chinese-speaking minorities in Australia with that of Spanish speakers in the United States. </jats:p>",

Our findings reveal that visual content with efficacy-eliciting characteristics was posted more often than emotion-arousing content. Furthermore, visual content with more protest activity is more likely to be retweeted. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Representations of Muslims in the Australian media have been routinely stereotyped; have failed to reflect the diversity of origin, outlook, and aspirations of Muslim Australians; and have negatively impacted perceptions of Islam and treatment of Muslims by non-Muslim Australians. This article explores findings from a study involving content and discourse analysis of representations of Muslims in Australian broadsheet newspapers. Lower levels of Islamophobia in news articles within the sample were associated with a ‘peace journalism’ approach to reporting. Peace journalism promotes the contextualization of conflict narratives and challenges dominant news conventions such as the focus on elite, bureaucratic sources. It is therefore suggested that potentially fruitful strategies for countering Islamophobia in the news media could include the adoption of standards for conflict reporting and expanding opportunities for peace journalism in reporting on issues relating to Muslims and Islam. </jats:p>",

The study utilizes a comparative frame analysis to deconstruct and explain media messages communicated by Russian and Chinese media representing national identities of the countries through the BRICS summit diplomacy. The study discusses important questions with regard to the cultural, political and economic contexts that shape the perceptions of the roles and ambitions of Russia and China on the world stage. The major findings clearly demonstrate that Russian and Chinese media adopted different rhetorical frames to portray their national identities through the media coverage of the fifth BRICS summit. These positions imply an interior (in the case of China) or a straightforward (in the case of Russia) approach to communicate a form of ‘collective resistance’ to the global arena, where the countries seek larger global recognition and appreciation. </jats:p>",

A news story of an aborted air raid reflected the huge importance which governments increasingly place upon getting their message across in the international media in times of conflict. Looking at that example from the conflict in Libya, and studying in detail others from Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia, this article argues that journalists must correspondingly be increasingly aware of attempts by governments, and their hired public relations hands, to influence reporting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Blogs have become a communicative alternative for Cuban civil society in recent years. Cuban communities, inside and outside the island, are characterized by substantial ideological differences and economic gaps that highlight the challenges for consensus building and collective action in the country’s politics. Information and communication technologies (ICTs), however, are gradually facilitating the creation of spaces outside the control of the state for the exchange of ideas about the present and future of the nation. Through content analysis and qualitative interpretation, we undertake a case study of the most renowned Cuban blog, ‘Generación Y’, to evaluate users’ participation, the content they generate for the site, and the nature of debates taking place within it. Our findings show that while this blog opens an unprecedented opportunity for Cubans to engage in relatively unrestricted political dialogue, its users tend to favour expressive participation and antagonistic exchanges over the rational deliberations associated with traditional conceptualizations of the notion of the public sphere. </jats:p>",

But, for graduate students and senior undergraduates, the book is an excellent opportunity to become quickly conversant in the discipline’s policy takes.

For nonacademics, and academics more familiar with other disciplines, it is a headlong jump into intense dialogue with a perspective from a media and communication studies standpoint on global and national communication policy and the interaction between them – a productive endeavour for all involved.",

    "abstract": "In December 2007, South Koreans elected an opposition candidate, Lee Myung Bak, a former mayor of Seoul and a legendary self-made entrepreneur, as their new President. The election marked another peaceful change of government uncharacteristic of Korean politics which had for years been interspersed with military coups and street demonstrations against authoritarian rule. The constitution and elections were abolished in 1972 by the former general-turned-civilian President Park Chung Hee but were restored in 1987 when his successor capitulated to the massive popular uprising that demanded a return to presidential elections. Last year’s election then reinforced the country’s relatively new experience of the democratic transfer of power. South Korean broadcasting has more often served the interests of those in power than the public, as it was controlled by authoritarian governments and used for propaganda. This legacy was handed down from the Japanese in the first half of the 20th century when they exploited radio broadcasting as an instrument for their colonial rule that lasted 36 years. Unfortunately, this instrumental view of broadcasting was retained by the military junta government that seized power in 1960. The fact that the military government introduced television broadcasting into the country in the same year foreshadowed how it would treat television under its rule. In fact, the military oligarchy, which soon changed from uniforms into civilian suits, harnessed television as a means to mobilize people to support their modernization projects. Television, indeed, proved to be an effective and powerful medium for building a modern industrial state. However, they soon also realized that television could be utilized as an effective tool to stay in power and used television unashamedly for political purposes. In such a media culture, the idea of public service or impartiality to competing political voices found it hard to take root. COMMENTARY",

    "abstract": "Since the founding of the web in 1993, China has experienced an unprecedented growth in the diffusion of information and communication technologies, and houses the world’s largest population of internet and mobile phone users today (338 million and 700 million respectively). What does this mean for China and the world? Qiu leads us on a memorable journey into the relationship between ICTs, class and Chinese society with his insightful work, Working-Class Network Society. Qiu delves into the social, political, cultural, and economic dynamics in contemporary China and captures the most fascinating element surrounding the rapid ICT diffusion and social transformation: the making of a working-class network society. This is examined through the distinct patterns of place making, social innovation, cultural practices, and the appropriation and diffusion of working-class ICTs by the information ‘have-less’. This is not, however, seen as a linear and straightforward process, as Qiu constantly provides us with mixed stories of empowerment and disempowerment, connectivity and alienation, freedom of information choice and new forms of control. The conception of a working-class network society is a timely one for scholars of communication and China. The focus of this book is the examination of the root cause, emergence, and development processes of ICTs as they contribute to the cultural production of a new Chinese working-class network society. Although peculiar to China, these changes hold far-reaching implications for other developing countries and may even serve as a leapfrog exemplar for the developed world. Tightly knitted around his network society framework, the structure of the book is divided into three coherent parts.

    "abstract": "The internationalization of media studies is closely tied to the globalization discourse, elements of which concern linguistic dominance, even imperialism (Phillipson, 1992). Herein I consider how language influences what we teach, study and overlook in considering media-related issues and processes across a variety of boundaries. My goal is to raise cogent linguistic issues that challenge our teaching and research, not to provide definitive answers. Much as a mastery of English increases economic opportunity for many people, it is also becoming a prerequisite to academic success in classrooms the world over, to participation in conferences like the one this special issue is founded on, and to gaining broad readership of one’s published research and thereby international recognition in one’s field. As two experts in linguistics and education put it, ‘nowhere is the influence, power and dominance of English more clear than in the academic world . . . as a language of international communication English increasingly dominates academic and scientific publishing, discourse and even instruction’ (Reagan and Schreffler, 2005: 116). The essential activities of developing theory and sharing knowledge are facilitated by a lingua franca and I do not advocate diminishing the position of English. However, by opening more interaction and publication opportunities to non-English scholars, and encouraging more native-English-speaking scholars to learn and use other languages, we may enrich the international and intercultural dimensions of media studies teaching and research. Individual benefits may also emerge. Sociolinguistic research indicates that the natural languages a person communicates through shape their perceptions of reality; thus, multiTHEMED SECTION",

Specifically, this article highlights how key trends commonly identified in Western countries have also been apparent in India and South Africa, namely, the use of exclusive sports rights as a ‘battering ram’ to open up pay-TV markets and the resulting escalation in the value of premium rights. Just as significantly, the cases of India and South Africa also demonstrate the importance of sports broadcasting regulation in two main areas: first, major events legislation, designed to guarantee that certain major sporting events remain available on free-to-air television, and, second, the application of competition law in order to limit the use of sports rights as a source of market power within pay TV. </jats:p>",

I will analyse the political implications of e gao through a close reading of the two most influential cases.

I note that the IPSP should develop an intersectional analysis of media representation, employment, and ownership; that online hate speech must be addressed; and that the ‘filter bubble’ critique ignores the importance of subaltern counterpublics, although state and corporate propaganda is indeed a real problem. I urge application of a design justice lens, and identify free software as one important tool. I call attention to media policy proposals by social movements. Finally, I note the development of new tools for media analysis and encourage their application to an intersectional Media Equity Index. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> China’s global communication activities are mainly perceived as sinister propaganda to mislead international audiences, and related discussions exemplify Western unease about China’s global communication efforts. While not trivializing these efforts, this article objects to some of the assessments and argues in favour of a critical but open-minded engagement with China’s global communication activities. Such an approach should pay attention to potential audiences and should closely scrutinize the real-life circumstances of China’s communicative practices and put them into perspective for its audiences. The article highlights these aspects by analysing the screening of a video in New York City’s Times Square in Summer 2016 and one version of the China Daily supplement, China Watch. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents and discusses the results of an experiment in which television viewers were exposed to either a war journalism (WJ) or a peace journalism (PJ) version of two news stories, on Australian government policies towards asylum seekers and US-sponsored ‘peace talks’ between Israel and the Palestinians, respectively. Before and after viewing, they completed a cognitive questionnaire and two tests designed to disclose changes in their emotional state. During the viewing, they also underwent measurement of blood volume pulse, from which their heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated. HRV measures effects on the autonomic nervous system caused by changes in breathing patterns as subjects respond to stimuli with empathic concern. Since these patterns are regulated by the vagal nerve, HRV readings can therefore be interpreted as an indicator of vagal tone, which Porges et al. propose as an ‘autonomic correlate of emotion’. In this study, vagal tone decreased from baseline through both WJ stories, but showed a slightly smaller decrease during the PJ asylum story and then a significant increase during the PJ Israel–Palestine story. These readings correlated with questionnaire results showing greater hope and empathy among PJ viewers and increased anger and distress among WJ viewers, of the Israel–Palestine story. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Chindia’s newspaper boom",
    "abstract": "India is the world’s largest newspaper market, followed closely by China. Together, the two countries daily sell nearly 220 million copies of some 3300 titles. While they share historical similarities such as social inequities and a powerful middle class, there are compelling contrasts that differentiate their respective media milieus. While India’s press is relatively free of government interference, China’s Communist establishment is often criticized for severe repression of free expression through prior restraints or criminal libel arrests. This study identifies 10 major business models that have sustained India and China’s newspaper industry from 1990 through 2010. The business models are based on an examination for three criteria: financial sustainability; adaptability to emerging media; and consistency with civil-libertarian values. Grounded in freedom of expression theory, the ongoing research reported in this paper explores possible lessons for the beleaguered newspaper industry in other nations. Over many millennia, China and India, the two most populous countries, have nurtured civilizations that cradled fundamental norms in philosophy, art and science. Despite pressing issues such as overpopulation, environmental neglect, and economic inequity, China and India have attained prominence among the world’s largest economies in terms of the purchasing power of a large middle class. Since Chinese statesman Deng Xiaoping sparked free market reforms in the late 1970s and India’s Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao pioneered a similar transformation in the early 1990s, the economic proliferation of both China and India has coincided with a rapid expansion in media audiences, news providers, and advertising spending.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reconstructs the post-2008 response of the Dutch public service broadcaster, Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO), to political pressures to reconsider its remit vis-à-vis diversity. It focuses on NPO’s reliance on pluriformity – a trope that describes hegemonic categories of cultural belonging in the Netherlands – to define which ideological differences deserve support. Pluriformity works because it incorporates and accommodates attacks on the value and remit of public service broadcasting. However, this achievement comes at a price. Through the way in which NPO strategically imagines its public remit, segments its audiences and produces diversity programming, the broadcaster reinforces a hierarchy of cultural difference. In this hierarchy, only those groups in society whose differences can be reduced to non-structural and hegemonic convictions are entitled to representation and recognition by the public broadcaster. As a result, cultural diversity is being securitized in and through the very institution that should protect minority representation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Assessing the potential of Channel NewsAsia as the next ‘Al Jazeera’: A comparative discourse analysis of Channel NewsAsia and the BBC",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade, Western news organizations such as CNN and the BBC have been increasingly upstaged by satellite news services from the global South. The Qatari news network, Al Jazeera, has emerged as a prime example of a global media contra-flow that has been able to give its region a voice in the international news arena. At a time when developments like the global economic crisis have called for greater checks and balances on Western governments and corporations, this paper takes a critical look at an increasingly prominent news player in the fast-growing developing region of East Asia, Channel NewsAsia, to ascertain if it is likely to rise up the ranks to the level of Al Jazeera. A critical discourse analysis comparing the coverage of Channel NewsAsia and the BBC’s most salient stories, however, shows that the Singapore-based station falls short in its claim to ‘provide Asian perspectives’ because it is constrained by political-economic factors to operate within an authoritarian developmental news model. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Sino-US film collaboration processes reveal the fraught power dynamic between the Chinese and American film industries. Through several key Chinese film policy deal structures, China’s centralization of film regulation policy facilitates China’s ongoing efforts to become the most powerful film industry in the world. The absence of a centralized US government media policy, driven by long-term industry lobbying, has thus far blunted US efforts to challenge Chinese centralized film policy. Tracing the power dynamics behind Sino-US deal structures allows us to predict long-term vectors of volatility in Hollywood’s relationship with China. Using network management strategies to analyse the Sino-US film relationship offers a template for predicting relationships between global media markets and a risen China. </jats:p>",

The study answers this question by exploring the television (TV) drama series, The Magnificent Century (2011–2014) by conducting in-depth interviews in the Greek capital Athens and the Moroccan capital Rabat with viewers and the production and distribution team of the series. The findings show that potentials for pleasure in the consumption of drama are designed from the very beginning when thinking globally, to reduce cultural differences to a minimum, to finally fuse audiences’ interpretative practices beyond cultural polarization to common understandings. </jats:p>",

Drawing from a thorough analysis of policy and diplomatic documents, press articles, academic literature and two expert interviews and focusing on three Kurdish TV channels in Europe, Med-TV, Medya-TV and Roj-TV, it describes how the contrast between Turkish and European media freedoms and minority rights has driven Kurdish broadcasting to develop in Europe, rather than in Turkey. It reveals how, in an effort to obstruct these broadcasting activities, Turkey’s diplomatic undertakings have been able to sway opinions in several countries and get them to endorse more restrictive media policies. This study advances the understanding of minority broadcasting and the European Union (EU) media policies, but also highlights conflicting understandings of freedom of expression and media pluralism between Turkey and Europe. </jats:p>",

As television gave way to the Internet as the dominant advertising medium, these practices are representative of a new media environment wherein trans-medial, target-specific and user-driven advertising has come to challenge the prominence of mass marketing. Grounded in multi-disciplinary literature as well as extensive archival research and fieldwork, Advertising and Consumer Culture in China is not only methodologically innovative but also empirically nuanced. It is a richly detailed account that affirms as well as contests many Western-originated media, communication and globalization theories. As China’s visibility in the international community becomes more pronounced, studies of this kind are perhaps more necessary than ever. After all, the story of China’s advertising and consumer culture is inseparable from the globalizing media landscape that shapes and is shaped by China’s growing presence. The beneficiaries of such Chinaspecific insights are understandably no longer limited to China experts alone but include broad-based audiences with an interest in economic and cultural globalization.",

This article studies the copyright controversy of an online video in 2006, as well as the dynamics and features of a social mobilization triggered by the video. It argues that Chinese copyright law has very stringent limitations on ‘fair use’, the use of copyrighted works for public or non-market interest and purposes. Under specific technological and regulatory environments, video-sharing as a new media form showed unique power in resisting cultural control in China, yet it is faced with restraints from a pro-control system of copyright. With the rise of capitalist interests and proprietary control mechanisms in Chinese communications sectors, intellectual property is coming to the core of cultural resistance and repression in China. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book review: Media and terrorism: Global perspectives",
    "abstract": "As the book’s subtitle suggests, Lule’s analysis of the relationship between globalization and media pays tribute first to Marshall McLuhan’s insight that the electronic media – radio and, most of all, television – would make the world a smaller place, a global village. Throughout the book, Lule argues that McLuhan’s prediction has come true. However, he rejects the ‘imaginary of the technological sublime’ (p.59) and doesn’t share the enthusiasm that followed from McLuhan’s first ‘declinations’ of the global village. Actually, Lule also credits Lewis Mumford and his vision that the global village would become, not a place of harmony, but one where differences, divisions and conflicts would be strengthened because of a new struggle over capital and power fought through the use, and thanks to the availability, of the newest media. This is the pivotal argument of the entire book: that, even in light of the revolution brought about by the digital media, both McLuhan and Mumford were proved right. The world has become a global village, but is so fragmented that it is like the biblical Tower of Babel. Another central argument Lule makes is that globalization and media are inseparable. Globalization would have never happened without the aid of media messages – be they oral, script, printed, transmitted electronically or encoded digitally. At the same time, Lule points out, media industries – first and foremost, media conglomerates – profit from economic globalization and provide other kinds of corporations with a wide set of tools to advertise their products effectively on a global scale, while ignoring the huge challenges still faced by at least one billion people on the planet. Globalization and Media does not advance any radically new interpretation of the relationship between globalization and media. The argument that globalization is a process started thousands of years ago, made possible and evolved thanks to media, is not particularly original. On the other hand, Lule does not claim to make a revolutionary contribution to the theoretical frameworks used to address globalization and its connection to media. The author does not pretend to coin a new theory, nor does he claim paternity of the idea of linking the current outcomes of globalization processes to the metaphor of the Tower of Babel. The book is definitely an interesting and coherent long essay on the topic – particularly effective, if we consider the huge undertaking of addressing such a broad subject and the fact that it is written in a style that makes it enjoyable even for an uninitiated readership.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article proposes that the framework of media imperialism is appropriate for the study of US dominance of information and communication technology (ICT) industries in the period 1975–2000. Early media imperialism theories focused on US television exports at a time when such exports were set to decline in many local markets. Covert influences such as ownership, business models, professional values, content formatting, audience preferences, cultural hybrids and technologies, were insufficiently considered. In particular, the earlier focus on television and content may have distracted attention from the emergence of microprocessor-based computer networking technologies, their significance for the development of ICT industries, and the profound influence these have exerted on US economic and foreign policies. This article documents the continuing dominance of US corporate power, of US-based transnational corporations (TNCs) and, among them, of ICT industries, within the global economy. It charts US dominance of most spheres of computing and telecommunications at the turn of the 21st century. With specific reference to intelligence estimates of future global trends it assesses the significance of the ‘Asian challenge’, specifically the challenge of Asian ICT activity to the prospects of a continuation of US hegemony. </jats:p>",

These cartoons proved to be very controversial, and, since the original publication has been reprinted several times, continue to stir controversy. In order to investigate how different frames emerged in the news coverage, the study includes all news articles published in the selected newspapers during a six-month period from the first publication of the Mohammad cartoons. Methodologically, the study uses quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Theoretically, the study is based on framing theory and international news determinants.

    "abstract": "Journalism’s close links with nationalism and patriotism are played out on a daily basis in newspapers. The ‘nation-state’ is one of the most important levels of ‘othering’ in news discourse, and this can be clearly discerned in the Indian news media on events and issues related to China. As in the case of news, a ‘nation’ is also formed on the basis of selection – ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. The discourse of nations and nationalism is premised on several assumptions about common myths and historical memories; a common, mass culture; a historic territory; common legal rights and duties of members, and so forth. The ‘us’ and ‘them’ dynamic is central to nation formation and assumes a version of hegemony by which one view of society is made to appear as the ‘natural’ order of things, beyond rational questioning which may completely delegitimize or even obliterate alternative perspectives. This obsession with the ‘self’ has its part and counterpart in discriminating ‘others’, a reality that is reflected in the Indian news media in relation to China. This primal ‘othering’ of China is an entrenched frame in newsrooms in India, particularly since the 1962 war. Since then, China has been constantly framed as a source of distrust and threat. Of late, the voices wary of China in the Indian news media have particularly focused on the apprehensions of the security forces in allowing Chinese telecommunication companies into India, China’s close links with Pakistan and Myanmar as part its alleged efforts to strategically ‘encircle’ India, and its plans to build a massive dam upstream of the Brahmaputra river in India’s north-east. In the 1970s, China was also in the news for its alleged support to Naga insurgents who have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north-east. The dominant frame of China in the Indian news media continues to be influenced by the security establishment who insist on viewing China as a threat and a neighbour that cannot be trusted. Historical events and issues lend credence to such Indian perspectives that are in the privileged ARTICLE",

    "title": "Covering crises: Indian news channels and the Mumbai terror attacks",
    "abstract": "The predominantly live coverage of the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 by Indian news channels has now come to be regarded as a defining event in the history of Indian news television. It was the first time that a major terror attack was beamed live across the country; but faced with an unprecedented event of tragic proportions unfolding over 62 hours, Indian news channels indulged in coverage that a subsequent media survey dubbed ‘extensive but theatrical’ (Newswatch, 2008). The criticism started soon after the attacks ended, especially across the print media. Writing in The Hindu, India’s most prominent media critic Sevanti Ninan (2008) lamented that ‘civil society had also to put up with the media assault on its collective sensibility’ and described the coverage as ‘A non-stop, news-generated soap opera that you could plug into whenever you wished’. Similar concerns were raised by columnists Mohan Ramamoorthy (2008) who accused news channels of assuming roles as varied as counter-terrorism strategists to policy advisors, and Vir Sanghvi (2008) who criticized the television coverage for its ‘complete misjudgment of tone’. A perusal of the extensive criticism of the television coverage reveals that the news channels were mainly implicated on their loud and theatrical coverage, unrestrained live beaming that compromised security and caused deaths, their elitist, anti-democratic and pro-war tone, and the spreading of fear, uncertainty and doubt amongst the public. Television channels, however, bluntly refuted such charges. NDTV posted a defence on their website branding the criticism ‘malicious and entirely untrue’ (Dutt, 2008) and Rajdeep Sardesai of CNN IBN, cited ‘poor information flow’, tactfully shifting the blame on to the Indian government (Pepper, 2008).",

    "abstract": "are more economic than political. One would not be too optimistic to assume that the coming of global media will promote press freedom and media democratization in China, for their intervention with local Chinese conditions will not make the best business sense. Conversely, one would not be too pessimistic to conclude that global media are doomed to failure in the Chinese marketplace in the face of authoritarian restriction from the propaganda ‘czars’ and deep-rooted nationalism at grass-roots level, for the ongoing process of social stratification and cultural diversification has already left little room for any endeavor of conformity, let alone coercion. More significantly, the tale of ‘the taming of the shrew’ in the Chinese media sphere is not merely another embodiment of the inherent dichotomy between China and the West; it also manifests the efforts of reinventing the term ‘global’ in the context of third-world nations. Compared to their Euro-American counterparts, Chinese media appear more ‘global’ by way of alluding to such news sources as the Qatar-based TV network al-Jazeera, importing soap operas from Brazil and Venezuela, and selling pop music stars from Japan and South Korea. Meanwhile, local institutions also endeavor to make Chinese media products more ‘globalized’, as evinced by CCTV-9 (English Channel)’s integration into Viacom’s distribution system in Euro-America, and by the global success of Zhang Yimou’s recent Kungfu-cum-epic, Hero. In a Chinese perspective, what the coming of global media evokes in contemporary China is not simply another rehearsal of Hollywoodization or Disneyfication, but rather a plethora of ideological, institutional and discursive conflicts, contests and negotiations at various levels.",

    "title": "Book Review: Hybridity, or the Cultural Logic of Globalization",
    "abstract": "Marwan Kraidy’s account of the usefulness of the term ‘hybridity’ in the present moment is a persuasive one. In the context in which cultures are thoroughly mixed, cross-fertilized and transmitted across borders of various kinds, hybridity has some work to do. The subtitle, echoing Jameson’s ‘or the cultural logic of late capitalism’, refers us back to an earlier Marxist project whilst also underscoring the temporal difference. Late capitalism has now given way to globalization, an even more nebulous object of study and an equally unpromising condition in which we find ourselves. So how does hybridity fare as a tool to work with, a term that appears to be as ubiquitous in current descriptions of the present as postmodernism came to be? How may hybridity retain a critical incisiveness when its application is so broad? This is a challenge met head on. Kraidy notes at the outset that hybridity is a slippery fish, a loose term referring to any type of mixture, an excuse for celebrations of global fusion (music, fashion, film), and a glamorizing of the everyday exercise of Western cosmopolitanism. Problematically for critique, it is both ‘one of the emblematic notions of our era’, and ‘fully compatible with globalization’ (p. 9). Acknowledging these ‘risks’, Kraidy takes on the task of tracing the genealogies of hybridity in discourses of race and religion, and its significance as a foundational category of nation-formation for both the ‘melting pot’ ideology of the United States, and for Latin America in the concept of mestizaje. Indeed, Latin America provides a fruitful historical tradition of critical transculturism, one that bears the marks of economic, social and political conflict, and it features in several of the chapters. Drawing on the work of Martín-Barbero, Kraidy argues that hybridity overcomes the BOOK REVIEWS",

AJE is neither dominated by geopolitical nor commercial interests, and is the first of its kind to have the resources, mandate and journalistic capacity to reach out to typically ignored audiences throughout the world. This study argues that AJE’s model of journalism offers an alternative to today’s mode of news journalism that continues to encourage stereotypical attitudes towards cultural ‘others’. Not only has AJE’s programming represented a fresh break from the traditional news agenda, but audiences around the world found AJE to work towards a conciliatory function, based on a typology of a conciliatory media developed here. These findings point to the possibility of a global news broadcaster that can bring diverse audiences together and encourage dialogue, empathy, responsibility and reconciliation. </jats:p>",

Fenton draws from broader fields of social and political theory to develop an argument that will challenge scholars across a variety of disciplines. Whatever one’s own predisposition or understanding of the ways in which digital technologies have been used in political practice, Fenton’s work is one that deserves to be reckoned with – not just for its deft critique of extant theorizations but also for its normative contribution to how radical politics can move forward.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates disparities in the portrayals of US and China images across ethnic media, homeland media, and host media that are serving the Chinese migrants in the United States. A quantitative content analysis of 156 news articles was conducted. Results reveal that ethnic media share more similarities with homeland media than with host media, which adds empirical explanations to ethnic and homeland media’s commonalities in retaining migrants’ ethnic identity. This also signals a pervasive impact of homeland news organizations on overseas ethnic media – although ethnic media are registered by US citizens or permanent citizens in America, they are actually owned or operated by Chinese news companies. As a result, ethnic media may have followed the same journalistic practices as their counterpart agencies from China. Implications of these findings for public opinion are also discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In Latin America, the role of the media in democratic societies has recently become the subject of public debates, struggles and political mobilizations that have denaturalized the existing media order and established a distinct policy agenda oriented towards media democratization. This region-wide trend – a counter-tendency to the globally dominant market-driven orientation of media and telecommunication policies – requires explanation. This article stresses that it cannot be attributed to a spontaneous reaction to market concentration or media elitism, just as it cannot be reduced to a top-down process driven by populist leaders seeking to control the media. Drawing on social movement literature, the article traces four interacting processes – domestic network mobilization, reframing processes, transnational activism and changes in political elite alignments – that have brought about the unprecedented politicization of the Latin American media order. </jats:p>",

Payitaht: Abdülhamid, as an ideological state apparatus, repurposes anti-Semitism as salient conspiracy theories by creating scapegoats and existential others. This paper argues that the state uses entertainment media to disseminate conspiracy theories and, in effect, endorses anti-Semitism.

It also examines censorship’s different forms and its impact on individuals. The Chinese government imposes mainstream censorship policies on social media, and it is impossible for political satirists to avoid the ‘red line’ to lower political risk. The threat of censorship causes political satirists to self-censor, abandon their creations and reduce their output. The influence of those who continue to work is diminished because the government controls all Chinese social media platforms. However, political satire still has strong vitality thanks to collective action, such as the anonymous production, distribution and sharing of work on Chinese social media. The future of political satire on social media depends on whether the race between netizens and censors continues. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Twitter as media watch-dog? Lessons from India’s Radia tapes scandal",
    "abstract": "In recent years, India’s media landscape has witnessed rapid and expansive growth, marked by the emergence of numerous print and electronic news outlets. Concomitantly, India’s numerous news organizations have cast their role in celebratory terms as being free, vibrant and responsible for exposing political corruption and abuses of power. Such positive assertions about the state of the Indian news media have also come from observers outside the country. Tina Brown, editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast and Newsweek, for example, commented that Indian journalism is ‘vibrant, rich, and healthy’, in contrast with journalism in the West, which ‘is believed to be in the grip of an existential and financial crisis’ (quoted in Elliott, 2010). These positive perceptions were, however, significantly undermined by the publication in November 2010 of transcripts and audio files of damaging phone conversations between several leading Indian journalists and a lobbyist for some of the country’s top business interests. In this scandal, variously termed Radiagate (after Niira Radia, the lobbyist in question) or Barkhagate (after Barkha Dutt, one of the journalists on tape), some of India’s best-known print and broadcast journalists could be heard on tape, offering the lobbyist’s clients scripted interviews and favorable columns, giving advice on how to place stories in media outlets, and even seemingly acting as intermediaries between political interests close to the lobbyist and the ruling Congress Party (Wax, 2010). The scandal initially came to light when Open magazine, an English-language news weekly established in 2009, along with the better known magazine, Outlook, posted transcripts of, as well as audio links to, conversations between a leading Indian lobbyist, Niira Radia, and leading Indian journalists on its website on 18 November 2010. These tapes arose out of a wire-tap placed on Radia’s cellular phone by the Indian Income Tax Department in 2009 in response to a complaint that she had evaded taxes. The tapes were leaked by an unknown whistleblower to various mainstream media outlets. While only a",

    "abstract": "From 1600 until the end of the 1800s, economic historian Angus Maddison estimated China and India together accounted for more than half the world’s economic output. Protectionism and the world wars in the 1900s coincided with a reduction in their economic output to just 20 per cent. Meredith (2007:13) goes on to point out that the last 100 years have been a historical aberration: by 2015 China and the US will reach economic parity, and by 2030 China’ s economy will be number one, the US will be number two and India will be number three. China will have to develop the military power to protect the sea routes that carry its oil, natural resource imports and manufactured exports. Caught between the US and China, India could ally itself with either one or persist in its efforts to be non-aligned. Over 20 years ago, a young Chinese graduate student at a US university asked me why the people of India still ate with their fingers despite their long rich civilization and scientific achievements. Why, she asked, had Indians not innovated the equivalent of chopsticks that would protect diners from germs and bacteria, since hand washing was not always feasible? Other than quipping about how Indian food tasted better when eaten with the fingers, I did not have an answer then, and I do not have one now. My focus here is on the need for contextually-grounded comparative scholarship in general, and particularly, on how the contexts of China and India in the 21st century shape their media institutions and practices.

It delves into the affective dimensions of individuals’ imagination of a global digital order, of the impact of digital media on social organization, and of their own sense of place in a globalized world. It demonstrates that while digital media’s connective affordances help reduce the sense of isolation stemming from the community’s geographic position, conflicting feelings of disconnection, alienation and loss simultaneously arise in its members’ broader relationship to the digital world. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The media and the failed coup in Turkey: Televised, Tweeted and FaceTimed, yet so 20th century",
    "abstract": "The attempted coup on the night of 15 July 2016 in Turkey was my first ‘networked’ coup experience. It was a lovely summer evening, and I was enjoying a night out after work with friends when I got the news on one of my WhatsApp groups. It unfolded in front of my eyes on three screens: my TV, my tablet and my phone. It stirred early childhood memories of the 1980 military takeover declaration being read on the TV screen and a vivid memory of watching the so-called post-modern coup in 1997 on prime-time news. Despite a seeming plurality of current affairs programmes, talk shows and prime-time news coverage and use of hashtags over the summer, the most pivotal questions continue to remain in the dark. But, it is believed that the attempt was an act of the movement headed by Fetullah Gülen, an Islamic cleric who has lived in the United States since 1999. The movement, which is now known as Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), is believed to have infiltrated all sections of Turkish bureaucracy, including the army, over the course of the last 30 years. In 2014, it was declared to constitute a national security threat. The government has since fired thousands of police officers, prosecutors and judges whom it considered to be working for the movement. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) did not, however, always consider FETÖ to be a threat. Its media operated as a partisan pro-AKP media until 2013, when leaked tapes of a corruption scandal soured their relationship. The state of the media, especially in the second term of the AKP government, was yet another example of the intrinsic relationship between media barons and governments in Turkey. This complex relationship in the political communication domain has been marked with military interventions in the last 50 years and is filled with irony. The night of the abortive coup was laden with contradictory trends in its unfolding media sphere, blending archaic measures such as taking over the state broadcaster Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) in Ankara, which stirred a feeling of time travel to the 1980s, and ‘FaceTiming’ the coup. I followed the social media timeline and chat threads until the early hours of the morning while I panicked over the sonic booms of jets flying low over my residential building.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using both quantitative and qualitative content analysis, this study investigates how two Chinese Communist Party newspapers frame the same story to international and national audiences. The empirical findings illustrate how propaganda techniques originally developed and applied in Western and democratic countries have been adopted and refined by newspapers in a state-run Communist press environment to create frames that best align with the cultural and political predispositions of domestic and international readers. The findings suggest Chinese authorities understand Western communication theory and appreciate how that theory can be applied to disseminate messages to both foreign and domestic audiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How are marginalized peoples and places framed in their dominant national media? Framing theory applied through a comparative narrative analysis of 313 news articles, 291 photos and 1051 telenovela scenes allowed Brazilian media representations of a marginalized people, favelados, and marginalized, contested spaces, favelas, to be juxtapositioned. ‘Organizing principles’ communicated through media reports and stories of these marginalized groups operated to shape a certain social reality within the nation-state of Brazil. The salient latent frames Abandoned favelas and favelados and Favela life is ideal father-led life percolated from news and novela reports, respectively. That the timing of news reports and photos with telenovela production were concurrent, yet the manifest media framing of these people and places proved so radically different, makes this study interesting. More importantly, while the telenovela initially appeared as the more progressive storyteller, latent framing across media platforms harmonized hegemonically, retrogressing Brazilian storytelling to its paternalistic past. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cosmopolitanization – now!",
    "abstract": "February 2005: Ulrich Beck, Professor of Sociology at the University of Munich, gives a public lecture in The Hong Kong Theatre at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In the front row is a line-up hard to equal, sociology’s crème de la crème mondiale: Tony Giddens,1 Ralf Dahrendorf,2 Mary Kaldor,3 Saskia Sassen4 and Richard Sennett5 – while Nicholas Rose6 chairs the event. After Beck has finished they, instead of students, ask most of the questions, following an LSE tradition where new ideas are always critically examined, no matter who they are presented by. This time, however, the tone is almost aggressive. My students come to me afterwards asking whether this is the way LSE treats invited speakers. Beck (born 1944), after all, has published 15 books,7 among them Risk Society (Beck, 1992), Reflexive Modernization (Beck et al., 1994), The Normal Chaos of Love (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995) and What is Globalization? (Beck, 1999). His most recent books are Power and Countervailing Power in the Global Age (2005),8 Der kosmopolitische Blick oder: Krieg ist Frieden (2004a) and Das kosmopolitische Europa (2004b). I am also puzzled as to why this happens. One explanation may be that Beck, as an LSE visiting professor, has become a regular and can be treated just like any staff member. The second possible explanation is that his stance when he talks about the challenges of cosmopolitanization is much more radical than that so far taken by most sociologists. When I interview him the following day, I need to know more.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Al-Jazeera network, founded in 1996 and financed directly by Qatar’s royal family, is attributed with a significant catalytic role in the ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings that swept the Middle East from 2011. However, the Qatar-based network has been criticized for facilitating and supporting the Tunisian, Egyptian, Syrian and Libyan revolutions, while not giving the same attention to the uprisings in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, close allies to Doha and members (Bahrain and Saudi Arabia) of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Using peace journalism as a source of evaluative criteria, this study examines to what extent Al-Jazeera’s online coverage (Al-Jazeera Arabic (AJA) and Al-Jazeera English (AJE)) reproduced and supported key framings of GCC foreign policy in coverage of two stories: Bahrain’s uprising during the first two weeks of the military Saudi intervention and the Syria conflict in the week that followed the Al-Ghouta Chemical Weapons (CW) attack in Damascus. Al-Jazeera’s online coverage was dominated by the war journalism frames in both countries, but AJA’s coverage of Bahrain’s uprising was more propagandistic than that of AJE. However, AJA and AJE generally agreed on Syria, as both of them were dominated by pro-GCC framing. </jats:p>",

The article examines the place of music in an emerging brand-conscious youth culture in China and examines what this means for the single-child generation. It questions the assumption that there is a simple equation between cool youth and cool music and concludes by placing the discussion in the context of musical subcultures and musical tribal cultures in China. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "of the WSIS process may agree, most other caucuses made very limited use of mailing lists, tools for remote participation, etc., and focused largely on face-to-face meetings. Equally, statements submitted to the WSIS website were far less effective than corridor lobbying, drafting statements and submitting inputs at the preparatory conferences where the physical negotiations took place. The internet may have been supportive to civil society involvement, but it was not as such an ‘enabling force’ (p. 86), or, as Cammaerts claims, ‘the backbone of civil society networking and co-ordination’ (p. 137). Rather, WSIS showed how global civil society can be active, even at an ‘information’ summit, with very limited use of ICTs. For the other case, the Convention on the Future of Europe, one of Cammaerts interviewees points explicitly to ‘the limits of the use of internet’ (p. 191) and confirms: ‘We experienced that more influence can be achieved through personal contacts ... ’ (ibid.). A closer look at such informal processes and the dynamics of policy negotiations on location may have led to an even more critical perspective on the role of the internet and, possibly, may have questioned the connection which the author draws between ICT use and multi-stakeholderism. Overall, Cammaerts provides an important and impressive study on a core question of our times: what does democratic participation mean in the 21st century? He shows how the institutional discourses on increased participation have been detached from their radical meaning and thus explains why their implementation has been flawed. Despite recognizing some positive outcomes, the book raises caution as to whether, as Robin Mansell asks in her Foreword, ‘new ICTs provide a foundation for a challenge to hegemonic models of representative democracy’. It shows that while there is evidence for increased consultations, both onand offline, of civil society, there is still a long way to go until we can speak of true ‘participation’.",

Using in-depth interviews, we investigate the motivations and the obstacles underlying the publication of grassroots information related to the post-earthquake situation. Findings highlight that people were largely motivated to upload their content online: (1) to contrast the quake-related news provided by Italian mainstream media with their own perceptions; (2) to document their lives and the ‘real situation’ of the city; and (3) to share their points of view with other citizens trying to re-establish online the ties broken offline because of the catastrophe. Analysis shows that these non-professional journalists also had to face a series of obstacles, such as risks of fragmentation and lack of professionalism, funding and visibility. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks critically at the systems approaches in comparative media studies when applied to studying the relationship between media and politics in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). It introduces a concept of methodological systematization consisting of four different components: (1) the relationship between a political and a media system (methodological politicization); (2) the relationship between democracy and a media system (methodological democratization); (3) the relationship between a nation-state and a media system (methodological nationalism); and (4) the relationship between culture and a media system (methodological structuralism). The article concludes that these system approaches should not be taken as a naturalized starting point for comparative research when studying media and politics in CEE. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article focuses on the formation of the `global media system' from 1860 to 1910. It begins with a critique of conventional knowledge in international communication and focuses on three themes: first, the rise of the global media; second, how markets, states and imperialism shaped the global media; and third, how the global media developed as a series of multinational cartels — powerful `private structures of control' through which corporate and national foreign policy objectives were pursued. We critique the strong tendency in the literature to conflate the history of the global media with the history of imperialism and to exaggerate the extent to which powerful nations struggled constantly with one another to control world communication. Over and against this `struggle for control of international communication' model our concept of empire combines classical theories of imperialism with one of capitalist imperialism. Within this context, the global media evolved as part of a project of creating a worldwide system of accumulation and modernization. Lastly, we show that the global media — in terms of ownership, alliances, corporate identity, international and national laws, views of modernization and imperial strategy — were more global and organized as a system than is often assumed. </jats:p>",

It presents a significant opening up of the field, which inserts a critical assessment to scholarship on globalisation, brands, and branding professionals, as well as nations and their constructed imagination. Yet, the book can and should be read within the particular scholarship on nation branding, branding, or promotional cultures, as well as beyond it by anyone who is studying topics relevant to globalisation. It offers a thorough analysis of case studies from across the world, as well as a cautious and critical perspective on how global communication of the nation has become skewed towards wholesome, homogenous, and tampered conceptual imagery, which is constructed by a global elite who seek to create a here-and-now product out of nations of a people with history.",

[ Methods ] First, we retrieved 12 393 reviews on cellphones from Amazon.cn. Then, we investigated the impacts of the review’s characteristics on the numbers of positive votes with the help of zero inflated negative binomial regression and text analysis methods. The characteristics we studied include reviewer’s credibility, review’s quality and extremity. [ Results ] The usefulness of the reviewer’s previous posting, the information quality of the reviews, the number of comments, the extreme ratings, and the negative level of the reviews helped them receive more positive votes. However, the reviewers bought the products or not, and the number of the previously posted reviews had negative influence on the number of votes. [ Limitations ] Only investigated cellphones in this study. [ Conclusions ] This paper helps E-commerce websites improve their review ranking algorithms.",

Chinese film benefits from the global market at the same time as recognizing that it is really difficult to compete with Western films, especially Hollywood. According to statistics collected by the Motion Picture Association of America, in 2009 the annual revenue of American films reached $29.9 billion, of which, $10.6 billion was generated from the North American market while $19.3 billion came from the international market. The ratio of foreign market to domestic market was about 2 to 1. Compared with 2008, box office earnings from the Asia-Pacific market increased from $6.8 billion to $7.7 billion, making a growth rate of around 12.3 per cent, 81 per cent of which were contributed by Japan and China (Lv, 2010). In China in 2009, Chinese film revenues were $1.56 billion, including $1.15 billion from the domestic market and $0.40 billion from the foreign market (Entgroup Information Consulatation, 2010: 19).",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this case study, we examine the evolution of particular themes and identities of collective action. Using the 2016 Candlelight Movement in South Korea as a case study, we attempt to understand how communication processes construct the sociocultural meanings of collective action. We argue that understanding a social movement requires comprehension of the communicative actions of the movement participants, either physically or symbolically engaged, through which they together make sense of the broad contexts and meanings of the movement as they actively pursue construction of the identities and themes of the collective action. Based on a communication perspective of social movements, we developed three research questions regarding the specific features of the collective action repertoire, collective identities and issue framing. Considering the extensive impact of media communication technologies in mobilising collective action in South Korea, especially mobile social networking platforms, we chose one of the most popular social network sites, Twitter, as the data source of communicative actions for the study. Content analysis and semantic network analysis was conducted with a sample of 1,779,902 tweets. Based on the analyses, we suggest that the collective action and identities both shape and are shaped by the communication networks of the movement participants as they interact with not only the counter-movement actors, but also the movement’s social, economic and cultural conditions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides a critical assessment of the popular notion that we are moving towards an increasingly global understanding of political community and citizenship. At the centre of this debate is a specific, although often implicit, account of media developments. Drawing on original research done on the global news network, BBC World News, this article makes the case that news practices are developing in a far more complex and contradictory way than is often implied in discourses on the global ‘turn’ in politics. Globality as understood and represented at BBC World News is a question of not only certain culturally and institutionally informed assumptions about what constitutes public interest, but also, increasingly, a question of resources and dominant political rhetoric from a few institutions of power. What is more, developments in news practices do not necessarily lead to new and challenging communicative contexts in our understanding of the world, but rather may entrench and reinforce existing power relations. These empirically informed assessments of media developments need to form a much bigger part of discussions on the ‘global shift’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates new trends in the consumption of national and transnational television channels in Algeria, following the changes introduced by the 2012 media law. Research on this topic was conducted through a small-scale audience survey among university students in Mostaganem, West Algeria, at the beginning of 2015. As with other neighbouring countries, since the 1980s, Algeria has been exposed to a rising amount of transnational television flows. After an initial French dominance, the last 10 years saw a gradual growth in the Gulf channels’ penetration, while national television became increasingly neglected. This partially changed after the 2011 uprisings as many Arab countries accelerated a process of media liberalization. In Algeria, the media law approved in 2012 opened the door to the creation of private television channels. The article explores the choices made by young Algerians in terms of national and transnational television content, both for news and for entertainment. Based on the results of our survey and on other historical and contextual data, we argue that a new national perspective on news and current affairs is emerging in the country, together with the success of non-Western productions for entertainment formats. In both these domains, students from different faculties and backgrounds showed similar preferences, going beyond the linguistic, cultural and social segmentation that has characterized the Algerian audience since the emergence of satellite television. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "segmentation strategies. If so many of the case studies point to the Faustian bargains involved in making indigenous media, then it might be useful to explore the cases of producers who actively act as brokers between their local cultures and the now globally-circulated forms of popular culture and media. Indeed, the strongest essays in Global Indigenous Media should remind all communication and media scholars that they should be reading about Indigenous media experiences. The final two essays by Michael Christie and Faye Ginsberg challenge us to de-centre our own normative assumptions about media and modernity with a one–two punch. First, Christie, a sociolinguist, speaks to the impossibility of relaying aborigine knowledge as a dynamic and collective practice and also collecting it for easy distribution via digital databases. The Catch-22, rendered vividly through Christie’s own doubts about the project, strikes down neutral readings of media technologies, while moving beyond some form of technological imperialism enforced from the outside. ‘Databases are not innocent objects’ Christie concludes (p. 277), setting the stage for the future struggles over indigenous digital intellectual property. In contrast, Ginsberg cites three indigenous media projects that integrate digital technologies with local storytelling traditions. These projects and their ability to generate new forms of common culture critiques liberal philanthropists and development policymakers alike who construct the ‘digital’ as a necessarily ‘modern’ force, and, hence, unnecessary for Indigenous cultural expressions. With the wit of a cultural critic, Ginsberg insists that the only people ‘left behind’ in the ‘digital age’ are those who stick to the rigid binaries of a hegemonic order.",

The study proposes a synthesis of both these models, which serves as one of the main foundational theoretical components of the resulting media dependence model, an original and critical model of news analysis. An English-language news source and a Spanish-language news source belonging to the same company (Cable News Network (CNN) and CNN en Español) were analyzed in a sophisticated content analysis of coverage of major events in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2003 and 2004. The study concludes with the finding that ownership remains a powerful variable in news content, even when differing audiences and distinct public opinion leanings are in question. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "targets the dilemma of celebrity humanitarianism. Drawing inspiration from Marc Alleyne, Chouliaraki suggests a ‘shift of emphasis away from the dominant figures of show business and towards new types of celebrity amongst those local activists whose heroic work make a difference in their own communities of belonging’ (p201). To conclude, The Ironic Spectator demonstrates convincingly how major sociopolitical and technological transformations have changed the moral imperative to act on distant others in the Global South. As a consequence, she argues, solidarity has become momentary and trend-related, turning ‘us’ into ironic spectators of the misery of vulnerable populations. The book fulfills the expectations of the reader. Yet, Chouliaraki does not quite see the full potential of social media for both humanitarian work and mainstream journalism. I am here thinking of current phenomena, such as geotagging of violent acts, crowdsourcing for checking the authenticity of pictures and witness accounts, and co-operation between victim-bloggers in the Global South and established journalists in the ‘West’ in times of crises. Chouliaraki may not quite be cultivating moral panic over new media practices, but neither does she invite the reader to profoundly contemplate the positive impact that these practices have, or could have, for advancing empowering and sensitizing agendas, particularly among young spectators with an emerging moral consciousness.",

This research employs content analysis to analyse how two flagship evening news programmes –  Al-Hasad ( The Harvest) on Al Jazeera and  Panorama on Al Arabiya – framed the early phase of the 2017 Gulf crisis. The study provides an elucidation of how, specifically, editorial positions were made manifest and, importantly, what framing mechanisms were employed. Results suggest that Al Jazeera’s  Al-Hasad took the position of a victim being attacked by an external oppressor, while Al Arabiya’s  Panorama framed Qatar as a sponsor of terrorism. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘The things that we have to do’: Ethics and instrumentality in humanitarian communication",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study critically reflects on a schism evident in debates surrounding ‘humanitarian communication’. On one hand, it is approached as embodying an ideal of ethical practice. On the other, ideal humanitarianism is deployed as the grounds for a critique, whereby ‘humanitarian practice’ is seen as compromised by exigencies and political-economic influence. Drawing on the testimony of humanitarian communication practitioners within major international agencies, we argue this also reflects a felt tension within the field, where practitioners are very aware of the practical constraints and material influences to which they are subject. In both cases, however, an assumed opposition between the ‘practical’ and the ‘ethical’ tends to position ‘humanitarian ethics’ as an ahistorical ideal that stands apart from, and acts as a check on, instrumental action. This paper argues that a more historically grounded analysis suggests a more complex interrelationship between ethical and instrumental concerns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Interlocalization’ has been witnessed as a new praxis in international communication which is all about horizontal flow of knowledge, culture, tradition, know-how and so on, among countries of the world, free from any form of hegemony and domination as against what has been observed in the case of ‘globalization’ and also in ‘glocalization’. This study is an attempt to understand and analyse this phenomenon in the Indian context, and it revolves around two possible broad catalysts of the interlocalization process: (1) India’s communication business alliances and (2) transnational networking among Indian diaspora communities. The article finds that India’s communication business alliances around the world have not yet reached a level to provide the desired impetus to the interlocalization process, although it is gaining momentum. But a highly encouraging scenario is presented in the case of Indian diaspora networking and its implications for the interlocalization process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Lu Xinyu was my most obvious choice as a Chinese scholar I would like to have a dialogue with ever since the founding of Global Media and Communication, when a decision was made to have interviews with scholars outside the West. Yet, emblematic of the Western-centric problem that this journal endeavours to overcome, I realize I cannot assume that her work is already known to most of the readers of this journal. Despite the proliferation of media studies on regions outside the West in the English language literature, it remains that, while Western scholars theorize about the ‘world’ and speak of ‘universal’ categories such as ‘globalization’, nonWestern scholars continue to be seen as providing ‘local’ knowledge. Similarly, while there are Western translations of non-Western classics, it remains a norm that contemporary scholars in the West write books and scholars from outside the West, often students of these Western scholars, translate these books into their respective native languages. I cannot also help noticing that most of the Western scholars we have interviewed so far do not hail from communication as their academic disciplinary home. To be sure, things are slowly changing. Contemporary intellectual flows, like global media flows, are no longer strictly one way. Trickles of nonWestern modern intellectual thoughts are flowing in from the nonWestern world. A number of mainland Chinese scholar Wang Hui’s essays on contemporary Chinese politics and culture, for example, have been translated into English. Lu Xinyu, however, became my first choice not just because she is a Chinese communication professor who won a scholarly achievement award for one of her books and is the chair of the Radio and Television Department at Fudan University’s School of Journalism, one of China’s leading communication programmes, but also, most importantly, she is a Chinese communication scholar whose work has a reach beyond field specialists both in the West and inside China.

    "abstract": "that they are being manipulated. Perhaps promotional culture has been so universalized that citizens support or reject candidates as if they are just buying or exchanging commodities. Perhaps their mostly bitter experiences with ‘colour revolutions’ have left them (permanently) disillusioned. Yet for all the empirical detail provided in this book, I am still puzzled as to why people, once disillusioned, seem unable to go forward, forging the kinds of civil societies that Sussman believes are essential for ‘true’ democracies to develop (at least this is what the author implies). Beyond critical IPE’s prospective insights, the Gramscian approach to hegemony explains why elections and related institutions are so effective at limiting resistance – it is because they constitute genuine opportunities to take part in governance but in ways that frame or contain the parameters of this participation. In keeping with his critical approach, Sussman also might have fleshed out some of the contradictions that have emerged as a result of democratization. As conditions develop that compel sustained forms of mass resistance (as in the late-1960s/early-1970s in the United States), the very institutions that facilitate hegemonic rule (elections, constitutional rights, a ‘free’ press, etc.) may also be used to mobilize substantive – and possibly anti-imperialist – political change (Gitlin, 2003). Despite his limited theorization of the role that democratic institutions play in facilitating and prospectively undermining hegemonic rule (and despite the unevenness of his earlier chapters), Sussman has written an important and illuminating study. Students of foreign policy and scholars interested in how citizens and audiences relate to powerful interests will find much in this book that is inspiring – inspiring in that it might well stimulate others to dig deeper, theorize further and clarify the precise nature of what Sussman and others refer to as an American-led post-Cold War empire of civil society (Rosenberg, 1994).",

Using examples from India and the US, it explores the ways in which Pentecostal and neo-Pentecostal groups use multi-media products and platforms for evangelization. The profit potential in religious fare has not gone unnoticed in corporate circles, and synergistic relationships have developed between media corporations and Christian production houses involved in creating commodities for segmented audiences. The article argues that in the context of the global expansion and export of Christian fundamentalism, the increasingly close relationship between mediated Christianity and the commodity form facilitates the extension of specific, conservative, forms of values-based capitalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This paper presents part of a wider project analysing agenda-building (Rogers and Dearing, 1988) regarding the use of torture to extract intelligence from security detainees across the War on Terror (2001–2011) (Bakir, forthcoming). Using a case study methodology, the project analyses strategic political communication (Manheim, 1991) concerning the torture issue, emanating from the Bush and Obama administrations in the US, and the Blair, Brown and Cameron–Clegg administrations in the UK; alongside an evaluation of three main mechanisms of resistance – political, media and lay-public. Political mechanisms comprise unauthorized leaks and official investigations. Media mechanisms comprise investigative journalism, and tele-diplomacy effects resulting from real-time technologies like satellite TV (the CNN effect (Winseck, 1992; Livingston, 1997)) and the internet (the YouTube effect (Naím, 2007)). Lay-public mechanisms comprise NonGovernmental Organization (NGO) activity, and activities that constitute sousveillance (watching from below). As the most recent of the mechanisms of resistance to strategic political communication, the wider project pays particular attention to evaluating sousveillance’s resistive actuality (Bakir, forthcoming). Mann (2004, 2005) identifies two types of sousveillance: personal sousveillance (the sharing of everyday human-centred information, capture as manifested online in websites like YouTube) and hierarchical sousveillance (a more legally or politically-motivated watching of the institutional watchers, as manifested in websites like WikiLeaks). Given that the War on Terror unfolds across a media ecology of Web 2.0, this architecture of mass participation potentially facilitates sousveillance – as demonstrated by the use of Facebook in the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions. While sousveillance can be highly impactful in subverting strategic political communication, as indicated by the Abu Ghraib torture photos, and the mobile",

    "abstract": "Given the intensification in the production of media discourse in the contemporary world, as a result of the developments in information and communication technologies, the representation of differences necessarily becomes a central topic. In the face of the diversity of ways through which one is able to narrate events, media narratives, assume a preponderant function (Appadurai, 1996), considering that they are one of the sites from which one narrates the life of the Other. If newspapers, TV news, weblogs, documentaries – holding fictional, factual or hybridized narratives – give meaning to what one experiences as real and/or imaginary life, we ought to look at them with the purpose of better understanding how such meanings are produced. The globalizing processes we are going through today, which more than ever make asymmetries and fragmentation more evident, seem to impose a look upon a type of life being lived where conflict is the rule (Miege, 2000). It is not that it has never been so, but the intertwined relations between the local and the global that we have all become aware of, enhance the complexity of the moment we are now experiencing. Beyond the simply economic dimension that is exhaustively spoken of, one must recognize that such processes do not only produce homogeneities, but also bring out differences. The research projects being done at [LAN] Media Narratives Experimentation and Research Laboratory, based at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are fundamentally concerned with the fact that the encounter with other cultural experiences, promoted by globalization processes, for good or for bad, is routinely produced and received through media narratives. Within these narratives, we have been able to note the evidence as well as the veiling of conflicts, both basically constituted by the question of alterity. As we seek to understand the ways of dealing and narrating the relation between the I and the Other, the notion of cultural translation helps guide one of the central questions in our research: what is there in the narratives of the media that contributes to making the relationship between the I and",

Drawing on Jesús Martín-Barbero’s concept of ‘mediations’, the paper aims to contribute to the vital critical communication and media studies scholarship on the culture of fear by proposing the incorporation of analyses of the diverse and creative struggles of social movements working to subvert the political uses of fear in the dominant public sphere. </jats:p>",

Based on interviews with personnel of MTV, as well as observations of their programme productions, this article explores how MTV localizes in China under various economic and political constraints. It argues that the localization process is not a planned strategy that seeks to circumvent Chinese authorities. Instead, it is argued that transnational corporations have devised methods to maximize manoeuverability within the various political and economic constraints, and tune into the cultural and political configurations encountered. Whereas most academic studies have asserted that authoritarian states set high thresholds to prevent global capital from ‘Westernizing’ the culture, this article argues that the Chinese state, in various forms, is now flexible enough to work closely with Viacom in producing a new popular youth culture. </jats:p>",

The studies invested in analysing the causes for such attitudes have so far neglected examination of material interests that the recent immigrants might have in their homelands. This study analyses the politically active Telangana online community, which was involved in a struggle for separation. This article argues that the complex patterns of resistance and hegemonic co-option in the Telangana movement can be understood by situating the texts within the wider context of social and institutional practices both in the home and host societies. This article identifies five key frames with which to analyse the political engagement of the Telangana diaspora: identifying victims and enemies, asserting cultural difference, articulating relations with the host country and transnational actors, negotiating globalization, and conflicts over resources. The article concludes that critical scholarly engagement with the diaspora requires theorization that goes beyond the study of marginal voices in the public sphere and forges new connections between globalization, political processes, state and the media. </jats:p>",

Definitions of social progress must therefore pay close attention to the contradictions of contemporary information–communication structures. Our datafied subject positions need to be unpacked for an understanding of why privacy is a social, and not just individual, concern. The proprietization of social interactions data and marketization of digital intelligence exhort a critical examination not only of data practices but also of data ownership. Also, the contemporary public sphere seems to promote voice, but without agency. To participate, therefore, does not seem to necessarily imply political equality. An urgent reorientation of technology governance – away from the rhetoric of openness and transparency and towards citizen accountability – is needed. Institutional norms for the digital age must explore commons-based ownership frameworks for data and promote the conditions where free expression is seen as the ability of communities to self-define their ideas of social, cultural, economic and political progress. </jats:p>",

This study focusses on the role the news media plays in the conflict by examining how the visual and textual practices of news framing help constitute geopolitical rationality and legitimise foreign policy. We analyse how the framing of the conflict in Die Welt, Dagens Nyheter, Helsingin Sanomat and The Guardian developed through four key events between February 2014 and February 2015. The analysis indicates that by promoting particular news frames the newspapers contributed to the legitimation of European Union policies, which are premised upon supporting the Ukrainian government in its military campaign in eastern Ukraine and placing responsibility for the conflict onto Russia. Hence, we argue that the news framing eventually contributed to the naturalisation of the ‘new cold war’ as a geopolitical rationality, orienting and legitimising foreign policy in Europe. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "are moving into an inherently ungovernable world of information. To be sure, the new modalities of regulation, which both constrict and enable certain kinds of markets, information flows, organization and uses, are very different in an age of information abundance. Yet, at the same time, there is an urgent need to understand how the passing of an ‘old regime’ of information and media governance is yielding, even if in tentative, ad hoc and not so coherent fashion, to a new framework. And it is to the authors’, as well as Sandra Braman’s, credit that this book goes a long way towards attaining such goals. My main criticism of the book, and this is a criticism that applies to regime theory as a whole, is that there is no real rank-ordering of determinants on the processes that cause one regime to pass and another to form. Regime theory is to be lauded for the ecumenical and detailed empirical approach that it fosters towards complex questions of political economy, policy and international relations, but it very much needs to be enhanced by setting out some way of differentiating between the relative influence of various actors, ideas, knowledge and states. In short, regime theory is weak when it comes to understanding power. While this edited volume offers an otherwise excellent overview of the informational environment that is rapidly emerging around us, only a few of the authors highlight issues of power and, in the end, how we might turn the tide and choose between different options.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The popular Indian television talk show, Neeya? Naana? ( You? or Me?), offers a public platform for open discussion of important issues facing citizens in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Through its inclusive nature and open discussion format, the programme demonstrates the gendered involvement of citizens from all sections of society, including the socially disadvantaged castes and classes. While this suggests that Indian television provides a new site for an emerging public sphere, we contend that the public sphere in India can be historicized to the third millennium BC. In our analysis of Neeya? Naana?, we establish a relationship between Habermasian notions of the public sphere, India’s argumentative tradition and the ancient Sangam literature of South India. We further interrogate the concept of the public sphere by asserting that while India’s television talk shows offer the suggestion of an open democratic forum, they instead reinforce conservative cultural values. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: Book Reviews",
    "abstract": "This edited book stems from the 2004 conference of the RIPE initiative, based in Scandinavia. The aim of RIPE (Re-visionary Interpretations of the Public Enterprise) is to strengthen engagements between academic media scholars and public service broadcasting (PSB) practitioners in order to foster productive reflection on the transformation of PSB by changing social conditions, globalization, deregulation and digitization. The subject of the present book is the changing ‘cultural mission’ of PSB beyond its historical goal of strengthening social integration through the promotion of a unified national culture. In the face of increasing fragmentation of audiences and the growth of multiculturalism, contributors were asked to consider whether PSB can take on new roles both within and beyond the nation-state such as fostering a cultural commons, cultivating cultural citizenship and ‘cultural democracy’ (Touraine, 2000), mediating cross-cultural understanding and mitigating the cultural conflicts attendant on rising immigration and ethnic diversity. The editors set the tone in their introductory chapter, arguing that ‘the cultural role of PSB today is about building social capital’ (p. 28). On the basis of Puttnam’s distinction between ‘bonding’ and ‘bridging’ social capital they propose that PSB must play a role in enhancing both, by strengthening the social ties of the nation and by building intercultural understanding and recognition, as well as being a core institution of civil society that supports trust, reciprocity, fairness and other civic virtues in public life. The book has three sections, each offering a comparative perspective derived from country-specific essays, with an over-representation of pieces on Denmark, where the conference took place, and the UK. The first section addresses questions of quality and accountability, illustrating a tension in RIPE between critical academic research and the desire to BOOK REVIEWS",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the ‘Palestine Papers’ as both a major news story carried by Al Jazeera in 2011 and an enduring digital artefact. These leaked documents revealed that during peace talks, the Palestinian Authority offered concessions to Israel that went beyond the Palestinian national consensus, yet failed to advance the cause of statehood. While many predicted a third Palestinian uprising, the impact of this scandal appeared limited. However, by drawing upon Harold Innis’ insights concerning the time-binding versus space-binding ‘biases’ of media and institutions, a more complex picture is revealed, one unamenable to conventional understandings of media effects. </jats:p>",

Given common emphases on knowledge as a central societal dimension by those who focus on information and communication technologies on the one hand and those who focus on politics on the other, we seek to investigate knowledge-power links in the contemporary world. Here we present some preliminary findings from a longitudinal study (1960 to 2005) of how Asia (including the Middle East), Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean are represented in doctoral dissertations in Communication, Journalism and Mass Media conducted in the US. This study investigated patterns and trends over four decades in terms of research questions asked, nations studied, theories used, goals, contextual (social, economic, political) grounding, media/technology foci, research methods, findings, advisor name, university name, and scholar’s nationality and gender if mentioned.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We will, in this paper, argue that the concept of propaganda is still relevant in the context of post-communist Hungary. More particularly, we will suggest that, in contrast to the period 1998-2010 when modern political marketing methods were applied widely, the political campaigns launched under Viktor Orbán’s second government (2010–present) have marked a paradigm shift in the history of political communication in Hungary, best described as the revival of old-school propaganda. First, drawing on a distinction by Gunther and Diamond between proto-hegemonic and pluralist parties in the political realm, we will attempt to establish a theoretical dichotomy between political propaganda and political marketing in the communicative domain. Then we will demonstrate – through an analysis of three campaigns launched during the past three years – that the communication of the ruling proto-hegemonic Fidesz party and its Christian Democratic coalition ally meets the criteria of classic political propaganda. Finally, we will apply neo-Durkheimian media theory to describe the selected political campaigns as communication rituals and attempt to show that political propaganda may, under specific circumstances, actively involve, engage and mobilize target audiences.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Idiot is usually a term of derision. In this article, we reconsider the common meaning as designating a stupid person and return to an earlier etymology as signifying a private and independent individual. In ancient Greece, being idiotic meant engaging in the contemplative process of becoming an individual. At times, this pursuit of individuation differentiated such individuals as their acts occurred in public and were seen as absurd, out-of-the-ordinary and, frankly, idiotic, as most now know the term. With the widespread use of social media and digital video, these once private or semi-public acts of individuation often become explicitly public acts for others to see, critique and mimic. Social media has made it possible for these explorations of self to circulate where their emotional intensities resonate with or are rejected by viewers, are captured for profit by media corporations, and leveraged by their producers into media careers. Using a case study from Russian social media, this article describes the affective economy of idiotic videos and how the history of one Internet video illustrates the circulation, capture and self-capitalization attendant with neoliberalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "‘Professor, have you watched the documentary Two Million Minutes, the one on India? Is it true, did you and do other Indian boys and girls study so hard? Or, is the video exaggerating to make a point about America?’ My undergraduate student’s question referenced entrepreneur and venture capitalist Bob Compton’s controversial video Two Million Minutes: A Deeper Look at India, which focuses on the two million minutes that high school students spend on their education over a four-year period before they graduate. Emerging from Compton’s travels for business ventures in India and his subsequent quest to understand an Indian workforce whose energy and intelligence impressed him, the video compares and contrasts the lives of high-achieving students in the US and in India to conclude that students in the US are being cheated of a rigorous, cutting-edge education and that their mentors, teachers, parents, and the culture at large have failed to inspire students to excel in academic pursuits. Before I could answer my student’s question, another student chimed in and said, ‘But is this video making a different point than what we read about education and middle class pressure in China in the National Geographic? Do you remember what Bella had to go through? Poor girl had all that tutoring in math and English’ (Chang, 2008). Twenty minutes later I still had not responded to the first question about Two Million Minutes as other students, including two international students from China, jumped into this lively debate on American media portrayals of middle-class educational culture in India and China in my undergraduate globalization and media course. At the end of this course, which far exceeded my expectations for student engagement and class participation, several students wrote in their evaluation essays that the material they had learned about India and China should be a compulsory part of their education, and one student in particular said, ‘The world is ARTICLE",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyses Disney’s operations in the Indian film market through its subsidiary, UTV Motion Pictures, during earlier decades. Scholarship in the critical political economy has ignored how transnational media corporations make inroads into profitable markets. The present study addresses this critical gap by examining Disney’s expansion strategies in the Indian culture market. The analysis reveals that Disney has increased its influence in the Indian entertainment sphere by following the capitalistic logic of profit maximisation at the expense of local production, distribution and consumption of entertainment products. The study discusses the future research agenda for critical political economy theory. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Part V: Broadening media discourses",
    "abstract": "Since the turn of this century, a new object of study has emerged, at the interface of what used to be called ‘international communication’ and media policy studies. The object is elusive. Unlike its conventional ‘national’ counterparts, global media policy is not ‘made’ in any clearly definable political space, and it involves the oddest imaginable assortment of actors. Where media policy has always been difficult to grasp as an object of study, studying global media policy raises a new and fundamental problem, of definition: what are we talking about here? Unquestionably, a global framework for media policy is emerging, although its contours are not yet clear. What was still, only a short while ago, a field essentially defined by national legislative and regulatory frameworks and a minimum of international supervision, is now subject to a complex ecology of interdependent practices, structures and institutions. Specific policy issues, such as copyright, information flow, rules governing media ownership, and internet governance, migrate from one level to another, often typifying the flashpoint of conflicts between interests and jurisdictions. But it is no longer possible to understand, let alone deal with, such issues locally without referring to the broader context. This situation poses a particular challenge not only to internationalizing media studies, but far more importantly, to the ongoing development of citizenship and democratic public life. For that reason alone, it demands our attention. Defining the field of global media policy studies at this stage means ‘mapping’ the global media policy environment, developing a theoretical understanding of the object, and establishing an empirical base from which to explore the issues and processes involved. It means developing a conceptual and analytical framework for studying media policy that takes account of corporate THEMED SECTION",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the role of the Caracas-based, pan-Latin American state broadcaster, TeleSUR, in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Drawing on Manuel Castells’ communication theory of the information age, in which global society has become a series of interlinked ‘networks’, and the ‘information economy’ has displaced manufacturing, the article argues that the Bolivarian Revolution, led by the late Hugo Chávez (1954–2013), is a network state, and as such is to be understood as a network of interconnected political, economic and communication interests. As an integral part of this network state, then, the TeleSUR broadcaster sets the agenda in the international sphere via satellite, cable and the Internet. Since petroleum is one of Venezuela’s main commodities – the country produces little in the way of manufacturing – and its main export, one of the ways in which Venezuela projects itself to the world is not with material commodities (oil notwithstanding), but images such as those that regularly appear on TeleSUR. This exportation of images of Chavismo and of Chávez himself, the article concludes, has become both a cultural policy and a form of incipient nation-building. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Multiple modernities and mass communications in Muslim countries",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of multiple modernities is increasingly influential in mainly Western academic circles. Although the multiple modernities thesis challenges established West-centric understandings of the modern world, it also risks praising ‘the modern’ as the end of history and our preordained destiny. Multiple modernities’ global history cannot be separated from the colonialism, slavery, wars and exploitation that have formed our modern world and its inequalities. The multiple modernities thesis also illuminates a cultural and religious battlefield in which a Western concept of linear modernity, with a ‘developmental path’ that should be followed by all countries, is highly contested. The division of societies into the dichotomous categories of modern versus traditional – a legacy of the ‘grand narratives’ of classical social theory – also creates the foundation for other divisions, including the dichotomy of the modern Christian ‘Us’ versus the traditional Muslim ‘Them’. Such West-centric history-telling is part of a field of cultural authority in which the battle over the right to shape the past and present of various societies is taking place. There is no singular model of modernity; global modernization programs and processes have taken place in a variety of cultural and political environments, creating multiple models of modernity. This article critically explores the shortcomings of the West-centric theory of singular modernity. By focusing on the modern transformation of mass communication in Muslim countries, it argues that both traditional means of mass communication, such as manbars, and modern media, such as newspapers and tape recorders, have been used effectively for mobilization of masses by revolutionary Muslim groups. It also argues that Islam is not incompatible with modernity or democracy, and that Islamic groups have been an integral part of modern democratic developments in Muslim countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the proliferation of transnational television flows, viewers can see their national affairs, traditionally covered predominantly by national news, portrayed by cross-border news channels. This article examines how transnational satellite news coverage of national events enhances nations' global visibility, and influences national public debate over national narratives. An analysis of the public debates in Spain and France over transnational channels' coverage of the March 2004 terror bombings in Madrid and the October 2005 French riots, respectively, provides the basis for discussing the implications of the `new visibility' (Thompson, 2005) of nations, in today's media age. The analysis demonstrates how transnational networks' coverage of these events generated estrangement, de-familiarized and cast doubt on national narratives and commonsensical discourses of us/them, thereby offering viewers an alternative distance from their national unit and encouraging a self-reflexive process of introspection and critical discussion. This process may open up the possibility for a more inclusive national space and strengthen democratic culture, but at the same time it triggers instabilities, which might contribute to citizens' loss of trust in the news media — a dangerous scenario for democracy. </jats:p>",

Since the initially negative responses to the idea of the 24-hour surveillance of a confined group of individuals, the programme has been host to a series of scandals, reflecting the values and morals of the local culture in which it was being produced. Interracial relationships, unsafe sex, homosexual proposals, religious conflicts, class disputes, fairytale love affairs, family reunions, and race rows are some examples of events that have contributed to Big Brother’s popularity worldwide.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent times, researchers have examined the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s use of social media to directly connect with his followers, while largely shunning the mainstream media. This strategy of direct communication with their constituents has been adopted by other political parties too, with opposition party leaders hosting ‘Facebook Live’ sessions and tweeting their messages. A large proportion of Indian voters, who increasingly own mobile phones, are enjoying being part of the ‘like’ and ‘share’ online networks. What does this effective use of social media by Indian political parties mean for the public discourse in India? This article presents the view that this phenomenon is more than Modi’s ‘selfie nationalism’ or his attempt to marginalize the news media. The article argues that there is a structural shift in the Indian public sphere, which might prove to be the greatest challenge to Indian journalism. </jats:p>",

Our empirical investigation finds evidence of a significant relationship between higher levels of press freedom and lower levels of corruption with other variables being equal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that while democracy deters corruption only in countries that enjoy press freedom, rule of law reduces corruption whether the press is free or unfree. Press freedom and democracy are complements rather than substitutes in the fight against corruption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Much has been written about transnational public spheres, though our understanding of their shape and nature remains limited. Drawing on three alternative conceptions of newswork as public communication, this article explores the role of international journalists in shaping transnational publics. Based on a series of original interviews, it asks how journalists are oriented in their newswork (e.g. are they cosmopolitan or parochial in their orientation) and how they ‘imagine’ the public. It finds that interviewees imagine a polycentric transnational public and variously frame their work as giving voice to those affected by an issue (imagining the public as a cosmopolitan community of fate), performing and reaffirming a particular kind of identity and belonging (imagining the public as a nation) or pursuing audiences wherever they may be (imagining the public as the de facto audience). </jats:p>",

In particular, this article examines ways in which The TalkBack Show on Nottingham community station Kemet FM produces articulations of British Caribbean identity and argues that community radio’s remit of inclusivity enables transcultural production in the form of ‘accented radio’. Accented modes of production are shaped in radio, by conditions of displacement and marginalization and responses to these experiences. An accented radio programme thus functions at the local level – speaking not only to the community whose members produce it but also to other local (and marginalized) communities – and simultaneously articulates a wider, transnational perspective. This article examines radio content from The TalkBack Show with reference to accented production practices. </jats:p>",

This investigation revealed that partisan frames, emphasis on local and international efforts and use of health expert sources all differed across the two media systems. These differences suggest that social, political and economic attributes of media systems affect how news is shaped. When an event of international significance occurs, such as a disease outbreak, the characteristics that make up a media system will influence how issues are covered and presented to the public. Giving the current globalized nature of news, the findings in this study has implications for international news flow. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Like celebrities who ‘need no introduction’, Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities (hereinafter IC) should need no review. After all, it is one of the most widely cited works in its field and such academic ubiquity is surely review enough. Indeed, no single phrase occurs as widely and frequently in the literature on nationalism as ‘imagined communities’. It is not always attributed to its original creator – testimony to its wide acceptance and adoption. However, I am probably not alone in having long felt a certain unease with IC: not on individual points, though many of these have been criticized (see Özkırımlı, 2000, for a convenient summary of the principal criticisms of IC), but with slippages between its stated aims and arguments and their real logic. My unease was recently heightened when I tried to place IC – the conjuncture in the development of nations and nationalisms at which it intervened and the contribution it made – within a larger historical perspective on nationalism as it evolved over recent centuries, and an intellectual historical perspective on attempts to comprehend it. Re-reading IC in its new edition – now including a postface detailing an impressive history of its translations and editions – nearly a quarter century after its original publication has served to crystallize vague unease into overall assessment. Inevitably, this assessment is made against the backdrop of the rather drastic swings of fortune which IC’s object of study – nationality, nationREVIEW ESSAY",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the dynamics of political participation on the ‘We Are All Khaled Said’ Facebook page, which hosted the call for Egypt’s 25 January 2011 revolution. It shows that the page served as a proto-democratic instrument by introducing both qualitative and quantitative polls and following up with actions based on majority opinion. This argument is developed through an analysis of discussion threads and polls from the page, selected from a data set of 14,072 posts, 6,810,357 comments and 32,030,731 likes made by 1,892,118 users, extracted via a customized version of Netvizz. The analysis demonstrates that the page provided a basic lesson in democratic participation to its users. ‘We Are All Khaled Said’ constituted an unprecedented public space for active discussions on fighting corruption, torture and police brutality. Moreover, it served as a practical example of shared governance and political participation, which became a model for its users to strive to apply to their country. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "As one of the world’s fastest growing economies and with a steadily growing diaspora worldwide, India has become increasingly visible on the world map. The popular image of India as the land of snake charmers, maharajas and spiritual gurus has been replaced globally with Bollywood glitz, outsourcing anxieties and the steadily growing Asian tiger. However, there remains a desire, or shall we say a need, to know the country, its culture and its people, faced with an influx of NRIs, as the diaspora is termed in official government parlance. Perhaps it is this realization that led the BBC to commission several programmes on India and Pakistan, through August and September 2007, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of their independence from colonial rule. The sudden, absorbed, interest in the two south Asian countries, by the BBC, is a marked departure from the past. This curious turn of programming logic seems to be a measure of India’s growing importance globally. It is also, possibly, a recognition of the strong south Asian presence within the UK. In this assemblage of programmes Michael Wood’s six-part series, The Story of India, stood apart as the only one that journeys into India’s past to uncover a history of the country for an uninitiated audience. Wood is very aware of the significance of his project at this juncture. At several points he exclaims: ‘its economy is making India a global giant in the new century’. Or elsewhere, ‘by the 2030s it’s predicted that India’s GDP will overtake the United States’. The series, jointly funded by the BBC and the PBS, had a budget of over £1million.1 This budget allowed the team to unearth the many layered history of India by criss-crossing thousands of miles across the subcontinent and beyond and consulting several sources. The series is shot extensively across the length and breadth of India and Pakistan, and also journeys into Afghanistan and Central Asia to follow archaeological trails and migrations over centuries into India.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses German public diplomacy efforts via international broadcasting to the Arab world post-9/11. After defining the field’s major relevant concepts and models and pointing out the conceptual convergence of public relations and public diplomacy, the article presents a critical analysis of the requirements of dialogue drawing on Habermas’s (1984) Theory of Communicative Action. For the time being, the question whether Germany’s broadcast public diplomacy in the Arab world is based on ‘dialogue’, as has been posited by the main protagonists, needs to be answered cautiously. What is visible is a determination of Deutsche Welle to at least present a quest for dialogue as a projection of the country’s national values, policies, self-image and underlying myth. The invocation of ‘dialogue’ via DW may reflect a reassertion of the very self-image Germany feels most comfortable with: that of the Open-minded Society of Consensus as the country’s grand narrative. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Chinese digital technology giants, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT), dominate over their competitors in China across platforms that include e-commerce, digital entertainment, e-finance and artificial intelligence (AI). To understand BAT’s corporate power and their strategic role working with the government – in this case, their involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – this paper unveils the capabilities of these three oligopolies and discusses their international expansion in relation to the BRI. The BRI is being constructed on two layers, the physical and digital infrastructure, and the BAT are contributing to the latter. This paper examines the interrelations between BAT and the state through case studies, observing the tensions and potential contradictions arising from the reliance of the Chinese state on the BAT to build digital infrastructure, while the BAT seek to minimize direct state regulation for their data-driven business models. </jats:p>",

Twitter is considered specifically indicative of public attitudes in this regard. This study attempts to examine the feasibility of using Twitter sentiment analysis to predict the 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Tweets representing public opinion are clustered by means of the ‘StreamKM++’ algorithm into three classes (likely, neutral and unlikely). The resulting prediction model for the three classes (using Naïve Bayes) was 96.75 per cent. As such, this study offers a promising way to perform an online prediction of social movements. </jats:p>",

The research question that motivates this article is, ‘To what extent can Globo Network’s Brazilian coverage be characterized as a transmedia experience?’ The theoretical framework focuses on transmedia journalism, and the methodology is based on the analytical model regarding transmedia news coverage of planned events developed by Gambarato and Tárcia. The research findings demonstrate that the Globo Network coverage was modestly transmediatic, presenting mechanisms of audience engagement and limited expansion of content within technological advances. However, there was no solid transmedia plan aiming at articulating transmediality to build a universe designed within various integrated media platforms. </jats:p>",

We argue that Tencent’s market strategy has always been based on four principles: mobility, media convergence, gaming/youth culture and Sinicization. The article concludes by highlighting that these constitutive choices paved the way to the creation of WeChat, thus contributing to its current success. </jats:p>",

This study examines Safaricom’s advertisements from 2010-2014 to explore its use of national sentiment in its marketing. We argue that the ads reflect a commitment to promoting the country and its products through discourses of ‘commercial nationalism’, which present Safaricom as a driver of economic growth and development in Kenya. These discourses link Kenyan identity and distinctiveness to consumerism, commercial and economic success, profit and upward social mobility. </jats:p>",

Following my assessment of the IPSP’s report, I emphasize the importance of two emerging media and communication areas – applied ontology and semantic technology – that impact internet users daily, yet receive limited attention from critical data researchers. I illustrate two examples to show how applied ontologies and semantic technologies impact social processes by engaging in the hierarchization of social relations and entities, a practice that will become more common as the Internet changes states towards a ‘smarter’ version of itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Having today – 13 December 2016 – watched Tweeted videos of embattled rebels and desperate civilians as Aleppo fell, this certainly seems like a distinct possibility. Indeed, the last months have demonstrated that the opening up of journalistic space and the move away from professional norms have expanded propaganda’s reach as much as they have emboldened new forms of truth-telling. The era of mass media may be behind us, but it is unclear whether we are on the brink of the Renaissance or the Dark Ages. Russell’s work shows us how such uncertainty and openness in our media, our politics and our technology may help us wield new forms of power to build a more just and equitable world.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Betty la Fea , the phenomenally popular Colombian telenovela, has been exported as both canned (e.g. either dubbed or unaltered) programming and format to approximately 70 countries, including the recent US prime-time hit Ugly Betty. Guided by an examination of the extended global success of this Colombian production, this article explores the telenovela as a cultural product that is successful because of its appeal on both the local and global level, and as an economic product traversing a global industry. Popular telenovelas succeed as both canned programming and formats because they combine universally appealing stories (rags-to-riches) and style (melodrama) with localizable specifics with which viewers can easily identify. While telenovelas are localized products produced to first achieve domestic success, the cross-ownership structure of and multinational flows that mark the telenovela industry render any conception of telenovelas as South-to-North contra-flows of culture inherently problematic. Instead, this article argues that telenovelas can best be understood as localizable yet universally appealing cultural products traversing global networks of capitalist cultural concerns. </jats:p>",

How has the Chinese field of film production emerged, stabilized and changed in the era of Reform and Opening? Through archival data and in-depth interviews, I answer the question by discussing four sub-fields of film production, namely political ‘main melody film’, commercial film, ‘international Chinese film’ and independent film. How has globalization affected the transformation of the cinematic field? Contra Bourdieu’s emphasis on the weakening autonomy of various national social fields under globalization, I highlight the processes through which globalization is appropriated by social actors in the cinematic field to alter domestic power relations. This article moves towards a better understanding of the field of cultural production amidst global linkages and national refractions. </jats:p>",

These policies have ignored that the emerging transnational cultural landscapes highlight the need to create new spaces for cooperation and product exchange that extend beyond current national and regional borders. In this respect, opening a new and effective space for audiovisual cooperation between the EU and Latin America would imply the possibility of an enriching dialogue between two culturally different actors which share both historical links and the conception of cinema as a cultural manifestation that must be protected above and beyond its industrial value. The aim of this article is to analyse the current situation and to propose different ways forward, outlining the measures that should be taken in order to lay the foundations for a future of further audiovisual cooperation between the EU and Latin America. The article argues that such cooperation is sorely needed for the future development of both regions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The mass media can be seen as occupying five levels – from a world level down to a very local level. But the most important level is that of the nation state. About 85 per cent of total world audience time is devoted to domestically produced media; about 15 per cent of world audience time is devoted to imported media. The world, or global level, is especially important for finance, telecommunications and trade; but it is less important in the media. My book, The Media Are American (Tunstall, 1977), argued that most media (press, film, radio, recorded music) achieved their mass market character primarily within the United States. But it did also suggest that American media were most internationally dominant in 1947–8. By 1950 Hollywood and American news agencies had been largely shut out of India, China and the Soviet bloc. Thirty years later my new book, The Media Were American (2007), argues that the United States media have been in decline on the world scene for several decades. The strength of media globalization today has been exaggerated, just as 100 years ago the strength of the world news cartel was exaggerated. Yes, Reuters and Havas dominated the world flow of fast news, but the period around 1900 was also one of news nationalism. The national newspapers in France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Russia and the United States applauded nationalism, national empire building and the national military. The term ‘globalization’ was developed by various Anglo-American authors and public relations people in the 1980s. The big flood of globalization books began around 1990–92. It was also at this time that Ted Turner and CNN were widely quoted as pioneers of news globalization. However, by 1990–92, the United States had already ceased to be the world news leader. The USA in 1950 had three major world news THEMED SECTION",

    "title": "The Indian news media industry: Structural trends and journalistic implications",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past two decades, India’s media sector has witnessed profound and transformative change reflected in the expansion of both outlets and audiences. According to recent estimates, the country has over a 100 news channels that reach 161 million TV households, about 94,067 newspapers, as well as over 200 million Internet users. These developments have engendered a growing discourse that emphasizes the growth and dynamism of Indian media. However, this predictably celebratory narrative does not focus on the more troubling structural trends that increasingly characterize the country’s media landscape. These include commercialism, rising levels of concentration and cross-media ownership, as well as the expansion of control by politicians and industrialists over the media. Employing a political economy perspective, this article explores the emergence and workings of these structural trends in depth. It challenges the popular perception that India represents a dynamic and pluralistic media landscape, and argues that contemporary trends in the Indian media landscape have significant and deeply negative implications for the production of news and the overall quality of journalism in the country. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Managing the elite consensus: A critical analysis of press discourses over warfare in Iraq",
    "abstract": "There seems to be agreement among scholars that during international conflicts and wars ‘as institutions, the media have generally served the military [and the state-corporate elites] rather well’ (Carruthers, 2000: 271–272; see also Herman and Chomsky, 2008; Mermin, 1999). On the other hand, research suggests that the media provided a more nuanced, less ‘elite-driven’ coverage during the Iraq War (Robinson et al., 2010) and other conflicts emerging after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of the Cold War consensus (Entman, 2004). In a major study on British news coverage of the 2003 Iraq War, Robinson et al. (2010: 34–35) tested three distinct models of media performance (elite driven, independent, and oppositional). According to the authors, ‘at an aggregate level, many of the findings ... are consistent with the predictions of the elite-driven model’ (Robinson et al., 2010: 161) whose variables – patriotism, humanitarian ideology and, to a lesser degree, reliance on official sources – had explanatory significance (2010: 164). The study also ‘found a significant quantity of negotiated and oppositional coverage, suggesting that the independent and oppositional models were also relevant to understanding some aspects of news media performance’ (Robinson et al., 2010: 172–173). The latter findings were ascribed to professional autonomy, the characteristics of the British media system, and uncontrolled events (2010: 176–177). Robinson et al. (2010: 177) conclude: ‘The elitedriven model continues to explain most of what we have observed, but important and significant exceptions provide support to the independent and oppositional models’. One problem with this is that many of the examples listed as negotiated and oppositional coverage include procedural criticisms (see Robinson et al., 2010: 108–118). But it has been established that procedural criticism can be accommodated within an elite-driven model (see Herman and Chomsky, 2008: 159–160).",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses the role of media and communications in contributing to social progress, as elaborated in a landmark international project – the International Panel on Social Progress. First, it analyses how media and digital platforms have contributed to global inequality by examining media access and infrastructure across world regions. Second, it looks at media governance and the different mechanisms of corporatized control over media platforms, algorithms and content. Third, the article examines how the democratization of media is a key element in the struggle for social justice. It argues that effective media access – in terms of distribution of media resources, even relations between spaces of connection and the design and operation of spaces that foster dialogue, free speech and respectful cultural exchange – is a core component of social progress. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I critically analyse the relationship between media and conceptualisations of diaspora as a form of imagined transnational community. Despite the central place of transnational media in understandings of diasporic communities, there is yet to be a sustained dialogue between theoretical understandings of diaspora and diaspora media studies. I argue that the role of transnational media in conceptualisations of diaspora is too often reduced to the facilitation of cross-border communities. Not enough attention is paid to the alternative possibilities, including the potential of media to challenge cross-border solidarities in ways that fundamentally undermine prevalent understandings of the media and diaspora relationship. As a way to address this issue, it is important that studies of diaspora and media incorporate non-diasporic media into their analyses. </jats:p>",

We conducted a representative survey of 400 refugees to Germany which provides insight into their use of digital media in preparation for and during forced migration. We also asked whether digital media shaped images of and expectations about the refugees’ target country Germany. The data show that refugees are not a homogeneous group and that usage patterns depend on regional origins. Internet use also contributed to a positively biased perception of Germany, but the effect of traditional media use was stronger. </jats:p>",
