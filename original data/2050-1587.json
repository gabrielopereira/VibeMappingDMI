    "title": "App-centric mobile media and commoditization: Implications for the future of the open Web",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper traces linkages between the commoditization of the Web and what we call “app-centric media.” By this we mean a media environment composed of a multitude of discrete-but-connected software applications and their associated protocols, platforms, frameworks, and institutions. The rapid growth of app-centric media, we argue, is directly dependent on the development and commercialization of the (mobile) Internet, as well as on the business models embedded in the development of key native app platforms such as iOS and Android. </jats:p><jats:p> The emergence of app-centric media, particularly in relation to mobile media, is having a marked effect on conceptualizations of the Web. The prevailing rhetoric concerning the development of the mobile Internet and app-centric media employs imagery of autonomy, empowerment, and independence for both the users and producers of apps. We argue that the commoditization central to the commercial development of the mobile Internet evidences a fusion of neoliberal rhetoric valorizing worker autonomy, individual empowerment, and entrepreneurial independence, with a mode of production consonant with “cognitive capitalism” (Dyer-Witheford, 2014; Vercellone, 2007). </jats:p><jats:p> Our analysis is divided into three sections. The first looks at the early development of the mobile Internet in relation to the accumulation strategies of cognitive capitalism including the structural importance of “value networks” and the “putting-out system”; the second deals with the commercialization models underpinning the two dominant app platforms, Apple’s iOS and Android; the third addresses the development of HTML as a means of production and describes how HTML5 is framed as a prospectively more “open” competitor to the existing platform duopoly. It concludes by briefly examining the development of the Firefox OS mobile platform—and whether this platform resists or incorporates the forms of commoditization associated with app-centric media generally. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book review: John Cheney-Lippold, <i>We are data: Algorithms and the making of our digital selves</i>",
    "abstract": "Who are we online? This is the main question Cheney-Lippold’s book investigates and the concise answer is: we are not who we think we are. While many of us might have the idea that our digital identities are accurate representations of ourselves, the author makes a convincing argument that this is not the case. On the contrary, he writes that our digital identity is deeply rooted in functionalistic models where “our data is spoken for with a language fashioned from these models” (p. 48). Drawing on a number of valuable examples, the book points towards the existing (and partly frightening) gap between the ambiguity of everyday life experiences and the simplicity of computational models in an effort to capture and make sense of these. The book is structured around four main themes. The first theme, categorization, engages with the idea of metadata and illustrates how conclusions are drawn from such classification systems. The second theme, control, explores how authoritative relationships are established and how decisions made from big data analyses are surrounded by a certain aura of truth. The third theme, subjectivity, examines the concept of algorithmic citizenship and the assumptions that citizens have to reckon with when going online. The fourth theme, privacy, engages with the historical roots of privacy and makes a call for “a privacy that extends beyond our individual bodies, that accepts the realities of ubiquitous surveillance, and that defends the ‘right to be alone’ even, and especially, when we are made of data” (p. 236). Overall We Are Data is an inspiring and thought-provoking book to read, especially for those interested in the social, political, and cultural aspects of data. It draws on a wide range of well-known literature in the field of Internet and algorithm studies and further engages deeply with the philosophical aspects of the presented themes. It is, hence, not an easy book to read but for those taking the time to immerse themselves in the author’s line of argumentation, it is certainly very rewarding. As such, while not directly related to mobile media, all the examples given can easily be understood from a more general communication perspective, and no prior knowledge about data and algorithms is required. The examples presented in the book are persuasive. However, due to the long process of writing such a book, they may seem a little outdated. The critical reader might ask if the computational models presented are still representative given the fast pace of technological development; and this is exactly the point: It is not about the models themselves as they are merely examples. It is about the layers of data these models produce and provide for our world. To explore, describe, and examine these layers of datafied knowledge is the core contribution of the Cheney-Lippold’s book to the field of media and communication.",

    "abstract": "127–128). Instead these families encourage the use of digital tools for creative expression and scheduling busy days empty of social connection. Here “helicopter parenting” (p. 205) drives parents to adopt digital surveillance of teenagers in their rooms. In contrast, lower income parents are less discriminatory with media that at least keep children indoors and safe. These families value an “ethic of respectful connectedness” (pp. 129–130) and expect children to demonstrate an appreciation for family bonds through their media use, thus preferring media focused on family entertainment to individualised educational or expressive activities. These findings may be particularly interesting for scholars in the mobile-education field to understand how the social values of a particular community may discourage the use of a new educational application despite its potential usefulness. The book title The Parent App refers to a whimsical desire to design a customised smartphone application that would help parents from different backgrounds navigate the risks of the digital world. While the book delivers many practical suggestions, Clark makes a powerful appeal to parents to stop just worrying about their own problems and consider the collective future their children will live in. A future where new media, influenced by broader social patterns, is increasingly deepening divisions in a country that has prided itself on equal opportunities.",

In a time of restrictions and physical distancing, the role of the digital for social inclusion—especially for older adults—was heightened with many having to care at a distance. Our study focuses on older adults from Wuhan and the role of the dominant social media app, WeChat, for intergenerational informal care through digital literacy during and after the pandemic. Often characterized in global media as the place where the virus began, many of the quotidian experiences of Wuhan people have been overlooked. We reflect upon ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Wuhan in 2020–2021 with 10 households. We are particularly interested in how kinship care practices in Wuhan households—as sites for complex configurations of intergenerational practices that converge digital, social, and material worlds—have shifted during the pandemic. We ask: what are the learnings, opportunities and limitations around smartphone apps like WeChat for informal care as part of filial piety? In sum, what are the possibilities and limitations for mobilizing care? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the contextual and relational characteristics that underlie people’s information and communication technology (ICT) use and the implications for their well-being. We contextualize this investigation according to migrants, because they are faced with disruptions to their personal networks in the migration process that may attenuate the availability of social support and negatively affect their mental health. Migrants tend to be proficient in using mobile ICT to connect with different social ties to fulfill their needs, which potentially makes a difference to their psychological well-being. Through a survey of 504 internal migrant workers in China, we examined the social network factors that underlie multiple mobile ICT use and the attendant influences on social support and psychological well-being. Redressing the overemphasis on the importance of strong ties in extant literature, this study highlights the salience of mobile media multiplexity (i.e., the use of multiple mobile communication channels for social interactions) in weak tie communication and the greater contribution of weak ties toward social support and psychological well-being than strong ties. Our findings suggest that mobile-mediated communicative relationships with newer and more distanced social connections outside their immediate circles enhance the well-being of migrants. We contend that media multiplexity vis-à-vis weak ties underscores the reconfiguration of migrants’ communicative relationships following the separation from original ties and facilitates rewarding interactions with new ties. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As mobile phones evolve into smartphones equipped with mobile operating systems, the modes of mobile communication are changing. When smartphones incorporate the Internet into their multimedia functions, they enable people to access various mobile social communication spaces in which existing forms of mobile communication, such as calls and text messages, coexist with forms of Internet communication such as instant messengers, emails, and social networking sites (SNSs) on the move. This study attempts to focus on the newly emerging mobile communication practices that have resulted from smartphones allowing people to access their SNSs anytime and anywhere. To understand how the mobility and immediate accessibility of smartphones have affected the communication practices of SNS, the study will pay particular attention to the use of Twitter via smartphones. This study will explore this through 49 Korean Twitter users’ everyday practices of communication and social interaction via their smartphones. Based on qualitative interview data, this study discusses how mobile social media forms a pseudo-aural space for volatile but self-expediential social networks and how it shapes a new sociality. It suggests that this sociality strays from existing social practices and has a new cultural significance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "When the inaugural issue ofMobile Media and Communication (MMC) was published in 2013, I began my article with the story of the Lovegety, a stand-alone device in Japan in the late 1990s that would beep when within 5 meters of another Lovegety device on the same setting, either “chatting,” “karaoke,” or “get2” (Humphreys, 2013). This example demonstrated several important aspects of mobile social media. First, the use of a stand-alone device was out of place given the mobile phone, app-centric environment. Second, the Lovegety’s connectivity was based on proximity, not locality. There were no location-based data collected on such devices. Third, the Lovegety demonstrated that mobile social media were not always tied to mobile phones. In this article, I want to reflect on what these three aspects mean for mobile social media in 2023. WhenMMC first launched, it seemed unfathomable that a separate device, such as the Lovegety, would connect people rather than an app on a smartphone. Indeed from 2008– 2013, there was exponential growth in apps (Goggin, 2021; Morris & Murray, 2018). Today, however, given the rise of “smart” objects and appliances, devices such as the Lovegety do not seem unusual. Plenty of things “talk” to each other (Frith, 2019). It is, however, the case that such objects or things are now also connected to our mobile devices and ultimately the Internet (Bunz & Meikle, 2017), whereas the Lovegety was not accessible through a mobile phone or the Internet. If the Lovegety were to exist",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do people use media technologies in everyday life and how do they make sense of them? This is one of the core questions in media and communication studies, gaining even more in relevance in light of the rapidly changing, convergent media environment. Yet, rich and context-sensitive data about media and technology use are difficult to generate when media consumption is increasingly pervasive, ubiquitous, and often goes on in passing. At the same time, the full potential of smartphones in qualitative research has not yet been realized. The mobile instant messaging interview (MIMI) introduced and assessed in this paper is intended to fill this gap by exploiting some of the unique communication and multimedia features offered by mobile instant messaging apps. Drawing on diary techniques and on the tried and tested mobile experience sampling method (MESM), the MIMI uses WhatsApp for an in situ exploration of distinct settings and situations of social action (e.g., media usage). To substantiate the approach, the results of a pilot study conducted with young smartphone users are presented, discussing the advantages and drawbacks of mobile instant messaging interviews in detail, from the researcher’s as well as the participant’s point of view. </jats:p>",

An understudied but promising self-nudge intervention is turning off smartphone screen colors (i.e., grayscaling). Since a grayscale setting is available on all smartphones, it has the potential to be an easily implemented intervention. The main aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of a grayscale intervention by addressing its effects on both objective smartphone behavior as well as on daily subjective indicators of digital well-being. Participants’ smartphone use was tracked for 2 weeks ( N  =  84). The first week served as a baseline measure, followed by a 1-week grayscale intervention. Findings indicate that daily screen time was significantly reduced by 20 min, yet the daily number of phone unlocks did not change, suggesting deep-rooted checking habits. Moreover, grayscaling improved perceived control over one's smartphone use, and reduced perceived overuse, online vigilance, and stress, but did not affect productivity or sleep quality. Overall, findings indicate that grayscaling is an effective strategy to reduce screen time and improve digital well-being. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Mastodon is a free and open-source software which allows to run a self-hosted microblogging service, like Twitter. Servers running Mastodon can interoperate, meaning that their users can communicate across different instances. Together, all Mastodon instances form a large decentralized federation of social networking sites. Mastodon was first released in late 2016 but has not attracted as much attention by users and researchers compared to centralized social media platforms such as Twitter. Previous studies on Mastodon (e.g., La Cava et al., 2022; Zulli et al., 2020) classify it as an “alternative social media” platform, in contrast to “corporate social media” platforms such as Twitter. Due to the open-source nature, Mastodon is also famous for being the technology behind far-right social media platforms such as Gab and Donald Trump’s Truth Social. These far-right platforms have also captured certain academic attention (e.g., Zannettou et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). The Twitter takeover by Elon Musk in 2022, however, has changed this alternative—if not fringe—status of the technology and sparked a huge wave of new registrations for instances running Mastodon (Huang, 2022). Mastodon will become increasingly more relevant for communication scholars who study online behavior and phenomena. It is important to note that Mastodon also is a mobile platform.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Socioeconomic status and demographic determinants are the most commonly examined factors in the study of the second-order digital divide regarding the differences associated with Internet use. The role of motivation in digital inequalities is comparatively less studied. We examine motivation and access variables in this paper. Statistical analysis based on a representative survey conducted in China indicates that motivation is a salient predictor of Internet use when other factors are controlled. In addition, device access significantly moderates the association between motivation and certain types of Internet use. While mobile-only users show the same, if not stronger, motivation for using the Internet for the purposes of study, entertainment, and e-commerce, they actually use those functions to a lesser extent than multimodal users. Hence, the digital divide is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive solution. </jats:p>",

This paper explores parent perceptions and attitudes toward two mobile interventions (Text4baby and Univision Contigo) designed to support parents’ engagement with their young children as a way of reducing the language gap and improving child outcomes. We conducted eight focus groups with parents who were users of either service. Using general inductive analysis of the transcript data, we found that parents enrolled in the Text4baby service were relatively unaware of the video text messages and almost never clicked the links. Univision Contigo users, on the other hand, more frequently recalled seeing videos encouraging parent–child interaction and particularly liked that these videos came as multimedia messages (MMS). We interpret findings through a social cognitive theory lens and provide recommendations for incorporating video into parent-targeted mobile interventions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I explore how the interplay between music consumption and self-construction is experienced by Norwegians who frequently use streaming services on smartphones. Accordingly, the interplay unfolds in a situation characterized by (a) an abundance of legally available music tracks and (b) low technical barriers for music listening, discovery, management, and sharing. This implies a major shift when compared to previous conditions for music consumption, and it provides the foundation upon which I developed the analysis. The article relies on qualitative material gathered in focus group discussions with smartphone streaming users in Oslo in September 2013. The findings suggest that the instant access to millions of songs yields a tension between intimacy and detachment in users’ relationship to music. In such an environment of numerous music consumption alternatives, freedom of choice is embraced, but apparently accompanied with a craving for scarcity. These opposing tendencies in the experience of music consumption are interpreted and acted on by the individual in the reflexive and social processes of self-construction. Thus, I propose that the self should be included into what in domestication studies has been coined “the articulations of media technologies.” The articulation of the self equips this analytical framework with a fourth pillar in addition to the previous three: object, content, and context. Moreover, the articulation of the self highlights a dimension that seems crucial to content consumption at large in the smartphone age. </jats:p>",

The present investigation examines why sports spectators use social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) while attending sporting events. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 466 participants who generally attended games with friends or family, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that social media use through a mobile device during sporting event attendance served four functions: information-based and game pleasure-based utilitarian functions, an ego-defensive function, and a value-expressive function. The first three functions, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy predicted attitudes toward social media use. When placed within a larger theoretical framework, attitudes, self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and the ego-defensive function predicted intentions to use social media during sporting event attendance. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons were once heralded as the “holy grail of marketing,” a “cookie” for the physical world. An entire industry—proximity marketing—evolved to capture value from beacon-enabled micro-location networks, with venture capitalists, startups, mobile operating systems suppliers, and major platforms all making substantial investments of data, labor, and resources in the technology. Despite these investments, beacons fell out of favor abruptly, with observers dismissing the technology as an overly cumbersome solution in search of a problem, a “low-value fad.” We offer a microhistorical account of beacons’ small yet untenable role in the ecologies of location-based commercial surveillance—from the standards wars between Apple and Google to the efforts of startups and tech giants to capitalize on the market’s enthusiasm for beacons, and finally, to the industry’s quiet collapse. Our analysis builds upon work on the relationship between platform and infrastructure. We argue that proximity marketers failed to construct a viable platform-infrastructure hybrid capable of monetizing beacon proximity data and identify three axes along which beacons frustrated marketers’ ambitions for the technology: scalability, exclusivity, and visibility. We conclude by revisiting the platform-infrastructure relationship to discuss beacons’ legacy in two surveillance systems: student tracking on college campuses and contact-tracing initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>",

To address this, we developed a text-messaging-based data-collection framework. This paper details our approach including reflections on both the benefits and challenges of the methodology for researchers seeking to apply similar approaches to social science research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our methodology helps establish a contextually rich understanding of information-seeking processes.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During 2011, the now defunct ABC Pool (abc.net.au/pool) project developed an experiment that sought to combine emerging augmented reality (AR) technology with the archival collection of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The MyBurb project attempted to alter experiences of Australian suburbs by augmenting ABC archives in contemporary suburban environments to explore the blur between physical and digital spaces with its citizens. Mobile media, specifically geo-locative AR applications such as Layar are “one of the most widely used mobile AR applications” (Liao &amp; Humphreys, 2014, p. 2) and challenge the sociological implications of hybrid spaces as “[m]obile interfaces … allow users to be constantly connected to the Internet while walking through urban spaces” (de Souza e Silva, 2006, p. 261). The project was successfully implemented, but was rarely utilized by the audience it sought to engage, revealing a division between aspects of the ABC’s remit and engaging its audience through mobile technology and environmental hybridity. This observation supports the cultural production gap Hesmondhalgh (2007) identified between the production and consumption of cultural goods, which I argue could be facilitated through technological intermediation as part of the broader concept of cultural intermediation (Hutchinson, 2013; Maguire &amp; Matthews, 2010; Negus, 2002). How then could cultural intermediation facilitate the collaborative production of cultural goods to include the affordances of geo-locative media while avoiding the disconnection between the MyBurb project and its stakeholders? The data presented within this paper represents 3 years of research at ABC Pool where I was embedded as the community manager/researcher in residence. </jats:p>",

By using a historical approach, which is useful to determine the causes behind the changing processes of new technology, we examine the presmartphone era, focusing on the growth of mobile technologies before the successful launch of Korea’s smartphones in 2009. We divide the presmartphone era into four major periods, including the early mobile technologies period (between the 1980s and 1996), the CDMA period (between 1996 and the early 2000s), the Internet Platform for Interoperability (WIPI) period (2001–2007), and the iPhone period (between 2007 and 2009) before the introduction of locally made smartphones. We investigate multiple causes that led to the rise of the smartphone, both technologies and systems, surrounding the development of the early smartphones by analyzing not only power relations between several major players, such as the government, corporations, and global forces, but also the crucial role of mobile users as customers. We also map out the relationship between socioeconomic transitions and accompanying changes in mobile technologies, which are becoming part of contemporary smartphone technologies. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Critical interpretation of the <i>Pokémon GO</i> phenomenon: The intensification of new capitalism and free labor",
    "abstract": "Pokémon GO players create value in the process of their consumption by touching the smartphone screen to catch monsters with no monetary reward, resulting in the expansion of a new kind of capitalism. Pokémon GO has quickly become a global phenomenon since the release of the game in July 2016. As Pokémon GO swept the globe, people in many countries, from the US to Korea (although it is limited to certain regions in Korea), enjoy this new augmented reality (AR) mobile game where players capture pocket monsters using a GPS map on their smartphone and their phone’s built-in camera. Pokémon GO allows players to scour the real world for characters, including the yellow monster Pikachu, the franchise’s mascot (Mochizuki, 2016). Pokémon GO is free to download, but offers in-app purchases where users can buy additional items to help players capture the Pokémon creatures (Carew, 2016). In other words, Pokémon GO utilizes the freemium model or the free-to-play (F2P) game model in which players can download games online at no cost from application stores or social network sites (SNSs; Ramirez, 2015). Pokémon GO indeed earned $200 million in net revenue globally on the App Store and Google Play in its first month, beating other topearning games such as Candy Crush and Clash Royale (Kharpal, 2016). Of course, the game actually collects big data, such as players’ locations, gender, and age, that people accumulate while playing the game (Joseph, 2016). Pokémon GO is also engaged in the commodification of what can be understood as free labor. Pokémon GO play is mobile and entails doing tiny repetitive tasks in return for virtual valuables like Poke-coins (Mirrlees, 2016). Playing Pokémon GO is not just analogous to work in the global digital economy, but provides real value-adding labor that supports the bottom line of Niantic—best known for developing and publishing",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the influence of smartphone use on the embodied experiences of pedestrians in urban public spaces. Participants in this study engaged in leisure walks in a bustling urban environment. The study employed a multi-sensory, multi-modal data collection approach, which incorporated mobile eye tracking, screen capture, think-aloud, and participant data review. Findings revealed dynamic relationships between the urban pedestrians’ embodied experiences (“streets as experienced through the body”), digital content (“streets on the screen”), and spatial knowledge (“streets in the mind”). The study explored the “unfolding” practice between multiple versions of the surrounding environment and sheds light on the complex interplay of cognitive, experiential, and digital inputs in shaping pedestrian actions. Moreover, the study uncovers the paradoxical effects of smartphone usage and introduces both serendipity and familiarity into the pedestrian's journey through public spaces. Further, the implications of this research highlight the need for mobile media studies to embrace “messy” and “noisy” data for a more comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between minds, bodies, places, and mobilities. </jats:p>",

Their efficacy and ethical debates have become the focus of recent studies in the Global North. Reasons for using contact tracing apps among users with disability living in the Global South, however, seem to be understudied. Through cases from Indonesia and Vietnam, this study found that nationalistic values were among the reasons for using contact tracing apps as reflected in the users’ faith in the state and inclination to support its collective objective to control the pandemic. The users believed the state would be accountable in managing the personal and mobility data the contact tracing apps collected. Using contact tracing apps represented the users’ sense of capabilities to individually partake in the existing efforts to control the pandemic. </jats:p>",

However, the reasons for readers to adopt e-book reading or to stick to traditional printed books are mainly unknown. Therefore, we explored demographic and motivational differences between print readers, digital readers, and readers using both reading media. We further studied their book-reading practices, like the amount of reading, the preferred genres, the different reading situations, and if there are dedicated reading media for specific genres or situations. Additionally, we explored if digital reading media have changed the reading process or just appeal to a certain type of reader. Therefore, we conducted a survey ( n  =  779) of adult book readers about their leisure reading behavior. The results show that print readers, digital readers, and readers using both media differ in age, gender, amount of reading, genre preference, and the situations in which they read. Furthermore, digital reading media especially foster reading on the move. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Psychology-infused research has always been a central section within the literature on mobile media and communication, highlighting the diverse emotional, cognitive, social, and personality processes that can interact with mobile behavior. While past work on the psychology of media and technology has been rooted more in the discipline of Communication than Psychology, more social scientists across disciplines are conducting mobile research with each year going forward. The result is a massive, and arguably scattered, body of knowledge on the psychological predictors, processes, effects, and implications of mobile media use. Despite the breadth of the burgeoning literature, there have been increasing attempts to synthesize this wide-ranging work (Bayer et al., 2016; Cumiskey & Ling, 2015; Ellis, 2020; Kushlev & Leitao, 2020; Melumad & Pham, 2020; Ross & Campbell, 2021; Wilmer et al., 2017). That said, it is unclear how much psychologically tuned research has been published in Mobile Media & Communication (MMC) so far. In this short review, we evaluate the prevalence of psychological work in MMC by completing a flyover of article abstracts published during the journal’s 10-year history. We then identify the core themes within this set of articles, extracting the guiding perspectives that drive research on the psychology of mobile media. To conclude, we reconsider the",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Contemporary discourse around digital well-being tends to focus on self-control when it comes to “addicting” social media apps and digital devices. By acting on behalf of users, designers and engineers promote various self-regulating products and services in order for users to “fix” the distractible brains of typical users. This paper explores the role of the history of psychology on user-experience thinking and engineering and provides a critical genealogy of digital well-being discourse and persuasive technology. In particular, I expand on the role of dual-process models in human–computer interaction and health behavior change from the 1980s to today. By exploring the social construction of the distracted, impulsive, “primitive” animal brain (system 1), I find that it is this part of the mind that the engineer wishes to “treat,” via app design. In order to tame this “primitive” brain, researchers and engineers have turned to behavioral science, hoping to better structure user options and encourage users to manage their own time and normalize screen habits. I argue that normality discourses like this are founded upon ideas of time management and delay of gratification, whereas abnormality is tied to ideas of immediate gratification and time wasting. This dichotomy is not simply to enforce social norms around time wasting, but reinforces social and econoimc inequities. Therefore, unlike some other approaches to digital well-being, I urge future scholarship on the subject to examine the taken-for-granted social-cultural context, which will lead not only to a more politically nuanced understanding of the subject but may also lead to further discussions over how digital well-being could be conceived otherwise. </jats:p>",

Instagram had no dedicated advertising or analytics tools until 2014 so, in the absence of such devices, brands have developed uses of the platform that engage with the productive ability of cultural intermediaries and consumers to create and circulate images of their bodies, everyday lives, and cultural practices. This article examines the Instagram activities of the global vodka brand Smirnoff and the fashion retailer General Pants. Each brand engages with cultural intermediaries and builds themed activations at cultural events to orchestrate the production of images. Following Wissinger’s (2007a) study of fashion models, we conceptualize Instagram as an image machine that captures and calibrates attention. Instagram expands the terrain upon which brands operate by dispersing the work of creating and engaging with images into consumers’ everyday lives. The efforts made by brands to experiment with mobile media demonstrate the need to critically examine how participatory, discursive, and algorithmic modes of control are interrelated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article shows how dominant actors inscribe certain ideas, visions, and predictions of infrastructural futures for international mobile telecommunications through standardization. It argues that standard setting is a key avenue that brings different (and sometimes divergent) interests, groups, concerns, and activities into alignment around a certain vision of social and technological progress. To demonstrate this, two key stages in the 5G standardization process were examined. First, we explored the path to the release of IMT-2020—the standard for 5G networks, devices, and services released by the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union. Through the standard setting process, two key visions of 5G—one “evolutionary”, the other “revolutionary”—became highly influential ideas of a future worth striving for. Second, we examined how one technical feature of the IMT-2020 standard—the capacity for network slicing—was realized through the work of partner organization the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In doing so, this article reveals the processes that define the infrastructural conditions that underpin international mobile telecommunications. It also draws attention to how standardization has the potential to redefine the parameters of mobile media and communication in significant ways. </jats:p>",

Mobile media, further, provide the wider field of research with an opportunity to revisit the great divide between technologically mediated and embodied communication. Technologically mediated communication remains grounded in human bodies residing in local places.

    "title": "COVID-19 now and then: Reflections on mobile communication and the pandemic",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The COVID-19 pandemic may soon be coming to its end, but COVID-19 still kills thousands of people every single day (at time of writing). Even if COVID-19 now represents less of a health risk, and less disruption to our personal lives, we know this won’t be the last pandemic. Preparing for the next pandemic includes understanding the past and planning for the future. It includes rethinking “normal” ways of interacting with others, our technologies, and the spaces in which we live. In this introduction, we show how the pandemic has challenged the role of mobile communication in our everyday lives, making us rethink the very meaning of mobile communication—from simply communicating while on the move, to a networked resource that supports emotional and personal connections. During the pandemic, mobile communication practices and the development of new mobile technologies, such as contact-tracing apps and mobile mapping, was strongly tied to the infrastructural politics that took place through government and private companies’ interventions. In addition, mobile technologies became a primary source of support for those who became immobile, or were forced to move. However, mobile communication is not only enabled by end devices; it happens at the intersection of both end devices and the infrastructures that enable them to work. The articles in this special issue reflect some of these themes, and address how the pandemic has shaped and rearranged our mobile communication, sociability, and networked urban mobility practices around the world. Although each article engages with the challenges of the pandemic in its unique and original way, in this introduction we highlight some overlapping topics and methodologies that run across multiple articles, namely historical perspectives on the pandemic, urban and transnational networked mobilities, the use of mobile apps and interfaces for community and self-care, pandemic context in the Global South, and networks and infrastructures. </jats:p>",

Pokémon GO is part of a new wave of phenomena that are about to change that situation. As a location-based game, it encourages people to play digital games out in the open, visiting public places. The ludic mindset and playful practices first developed while interacting with Pokémon GO may provide a basis for more complex skill sets and cultural practices that will be needed in broader cultural ludification developments, and for the next steps of entering the Ludic Society.

    "abstract": "examples, Tinnell refreshingly returns the digital into the aesthetic. In particular, Tinnell’s discussion of how the digitally constructed is spatially orientated drives home the importance of linking rhetoric to ubiquitous computing. On occasion, Tinnell strays more into historical review, particularly with regard to Weiser (aforementioned) and Bernard Steigler—each has nearly an entire column of mentions in the index. However, by the time the reader has finished Actionable Media, this minor criticism is drowned out by his consistent use of textured examples. These range from an unpacking of GPS navigation’s ability to “conjoin lived perception and technical memory” (p. 76) to how the act of walking in Teri Rueb’s Itinerant serves as a nondiscursive action that delivers “structural agency for readers” (p. 134). Tinnell concludes with an “Epilogue,” an appropriately named chapter given the engaging narrative of his book. Within this epilogue, he proposes the idea of the “kairotic” intellectual, a term designed to reflect a shift towards the employment of ubiquitous computing by students and scholars within locales, generating and disseminating humanities knowledge to broader audiences. Despite Tinnell’s attempts to explore ubiquitous computing beyond the desktop and mobile phone, his examples and evidence suggest that mobile devices remain the dominant lens through which this shift can be imagined. To this extent, Actionable Media can be seen as a call to action made amidst an ongoing paradigm shift. Through a pushing forward of both technology and terminology, Tinnell powerfully finishes on the notion that actionable media enables the delivery of “the right words at the right time in the right place” (p. 223). This call for intervention is well made by Tinnell throughout Actionable Media, and the onus now falls on academics and artists alike to deliver the rise of the kairotic intellectual.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the phenomenon of mobile bystanders who use their smartphones to film or take photographs at accident scenes, instead of offering their help to people in need or to assist medical units. This phenomenon has been extensively discussed in Swedish news media in recent years since it has been described as a growing problem for first responders, such as paramedics, police, and firefighters. This article aims to identify theoretical perspectives that are relevant for analyzing mobile media practices and discuss the ethical implications of these perspectives. Our purpose is twofold: we want to develop a theoretical framework for critically approaching mobile media practices, and we want to contribute to discussions concerning well-being in a time marked by mediatization and digitalization. In this pursuit, we combine theory from social psychology about how people behave at traumatic scenes with discussions about witnessing in and through media, as developed in media and communication studies. Both perspectives offer various implications for normative inquiry, and in our discussion, we argue that mobile bystanders must be considered simultaneously as transgressors of social norms and as emphatic witnesses behaving in accordance with the digital media age. The article ends with a discussion regarding the implications for further research. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Reviews: Germaine Halegoua, <i>The Digital City: Media and the Social Production of Place</i>",
    "abstract": "In The Digital City, Germaine Halegoua offers a broad and refreshing examination of the state of the smart city and its (potential) inhabitants. The book draws on information emerging from some key smart city sites across Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S., including “smart-from-the-start” cities such as Masdar City and the Songdo IBD, and extensive fieldwork, especially near ground zero of the Google Fiber installation in Kansas City. Halegoua makes a strong case for reconsidering the notion of the smart city as being more than the many capacities of ubiquitous computing in the urban context. Central to her argument is the observation that place is an always shifting social construct, and that the way we use the most intimate of our devices—the smartphone—is grounded in our social desires. Taking stock of mobile media theorists and space and place scholars, at the heart of this book, Halegoua aims to illustrate and analyze the ways “many different actors are actually using digital technologies and practices to re-embed themselves within urban space to create a sense of place” (p. 3)—much of which is done by, with and through mobile technologies. The book begins with a detailed overview of the state-of-the-art in smart cities, and how the Internet of Things has been implicated in new visions of urban space. It is here that some prominent smart cities, such as Masdar City, are exposed for the ghost towns they are, built upon the asocial logic of business rather than the actual needs of potential inhabitants. The second chapter is the book at its most powerful, centering around Halegoua’s engagement on the ground with the Google Fiber rollout in Kansas City. Here Halegoua points out that the designers of the project conceived of broadband as a good in and of itself, rather than being oriented, or at least sensitive to, the needs of people, leading to predictable class-based gaps in adoption. In this chapter, further compelling research is presented on the integration of spatial and social dimensions into the grassroots smart city framework that Halegoua shapes with her ethnographic experience. The main chapters of the book are rounded out by a final chapter that makes connections between creativity and place, and how digital media and urban computing are creating new opportunities in this space. Halegoua’s critical step, and the key contribution of the book, is the building the idea of “re-placeing”: the “subjective, habitual practice of assessing and combining physical, 1024893 MMC0010.1177/20501579211024893Mobile Media & CommunicationBook Reviews book-review2021",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile connectivity can negatively affect smartphone users by eliciting stress. Past research focused on stress-inducing potentials of smartphone use behaviors and, recently, on the cognitive-motivational engagement with online interactions. However, theoretical perspectives as the mobile connectivity paradox and the IM³UNE model further suggest that digital stress effects may be conditional. A preregistered experience sampling study ( n = 123; 1,427 use episodes) investigated relationships of cognitive-motivational (online vigilance) and behavioral (communication load, media multitasking) smartphone use patterns with perceived stress and introduced two situational boundary conditions (goal conflict, autonomy need dissatisfaction). Results demonstrate that online vigilance can induce stress directly and via increasing communication load. Goal conflict and autonomy need dissatisfaction moderated the influence of online vigilance and media multitasking on stress. Findings are discussed in the context of effect directionality and the need to further investigate boundary conditions in digital well-being research. </jats:p>",

Conducting an explorative study among market women in Kampala, the aim is to examine what roles (if any) the mobile phone plays for them in terms of empowerment. Our findings resonate with studies from other parts of the world, suggesting that while pivotal for their business endeavors, mobile phone practices are also embedded in patriarchal structures. By discussing how these market women navigate the tensions between using the phone for their business and in relations to their partners, the article contributes a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of mobile phone practices and the empowerment of market women. We conclude the article by suggesting a situated approach to the study of empowerment. </jats:p>",

Extending well beyond use as an air-conditioning tool, the hand-fan has evolved across centuries and cultures to become a portable screen, a game console, an artistic medium, and an elaborate communication device. Drawing on the scholarly, literary, and art history of hand-fans in North Asian and European contexts, this paper excavates a deep history of hand-fans and connects them to contemporary mobile communication devices. This research develops two key aspects of the hand-fan as a communicative apparatus: first, the fan as an optical image surface to store and transmit information, constituting the earliest portable screen, and second, the fan as a haptic and gestural object from which distinct vernaculars arise. This paper maps a radical new trajectory in how we conceptualise the hand-fan in history and the mobile phone in the present. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies have demonstrated that social media use, as well as problematic smartphone use (PSU), are associated with psychopathology variables, such as depression and anxiety. However, it has not been studied how Instagram use frequency is associated with depression, anxiety, and PSU. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Instagram use frequency is related to these psychopathology variables. Three hundred and five active Instagram users ( M<jats:sub>age</jats:sub> = 23.61, SD<jats:sub>age</jats:sub> = 5.33; 82.2% female) comprised the effective sample in this study. They responded to an online survey that included questionnaires regarding their Instagram and smartphone use, as well as about experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms. We also retrieved objectively measured Instagram use data. The results showed that although Instagram use frequency, depression, and anxiety were associated with PSU in bivariate analysis, Instagram use frequency did not have indirect effects in the relations between psychopathology variables and PSU. Furthermore, while younger age and female sex predicted Instagram use frequency, these socio-demographic variables did not predict PSU. According to our findings Instagram use frequency contributes to PSU, but it is not related to depression and anxiety. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In July 2016, Niantic Labs released the hybrid/augmented reality game Pokémon Go. Due to the game’s sudden enormous success, many mobile phone users all over the world could experience for the first time playing a hybrid reality game. Hybrid reality games, however, are not new. For at least 15 years, researchers and artists experiment with the affordances of location-based mobile technology to create playful experiences that take place across physical and digital (i.e., hybrid) spaces. Blast Theory’s Can You See Me Now?, developed in 2001, is one of the first examples. Yet for a long time, these games remained in the domain of art and research, and had therefore a very limited player community. Previous research has identified three design characteristics of hybrid reality games: mobility, sociability, and spatiality; and three main aspects to analyze these games: the connection between play and ordinary life, the relevance of the play community, and surveillance. With hybrid reality games’ commercialization and popularity, some of the issues that have been at the core of these games for over a decade will remain the same, while other aspects will change. This paper uses Pokémon Go as an example of a hybrid/augmented reality game to explore the main social and spatial issues that arise when these games become mainstream, including mobility, sociability, spatiality, and surveillance. </jats:p>",

Overall, the levels of concentration in app usage are high, particularly in the communication and social media categories.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile applications are often positioned as a technologically driven answer to navigating the world with disability; nevertheless, apps created for specialized communities designed to facilitate mobility can quickly meet friction that stymies movement through place. Accordingly, the effectiveness of mobile apps is determined by a complex sociotechnical puzzle that includes cultures, industry regulations, public knowledge and legislation, the unique histories of urban spaces, and infrastructural access. Drawing from short-term autoethnographic approaches designed to evaluate the utility of mobile applications, this article provides a critical assessment of using location-aware gluten-free apps to navigate traveling in an unfamiliar location, context, and culture with celiac disease. These experiences serve as the basis of a critical heuristic for assessing how the success or lack thereof of app functionality is predicated on the complex networked contexts in which they are embedded: cultural histories of place, the spatial layering of information, and infrastructures of monetization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> From time immemorial, transhumant livestock farmers have continued to work in the countryside, living an intense and symbolic form of social distancing. Their work consists of moving around with their herd or flock, mainly sheep, so they can provide their animals with the best pastures. This research study, using ethnographic techniques, located and interviewed a group of livestock farmers to understand how the use of smartphones has changed their professional and social habits. Even now in modern times, this group still lives in isolation, working alone in the mountains. However, they have also been undergoing profound change due to the development of virtual social networks and information channels, mainly through groups in online applications. This enables them to keep fully up to date with all the topics they are interested in. This new connectivity has allowed them to make better-informed financial decisions based on more and better information. It has also meant they can produce proposals for joint action when faced with problems that affect them as a group. Lastly, the widespread use of mobile phones has increased their ability to communicate with friends and family, breaking previously held social taboos and barriers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Conversational studies have shown that location cannot be considered as an external framework that shapes interaction; rather it is to be analyzed as a resource and an achievement in interaction (Schegloff, 1972). Building on a corpus of 93 recorded mobile phone conversations from the United States and Denmark, this article adds to current interaction research by investigating how location is produced, understood and socially accomplished via mobile phones. More specifically, we investigate how location talk operates in the opening sequences of the call. We find that location is an opening-relevant topic: speakers introduce it as the reason for the call and topicalize it following initial engagement. When referring to location, speakers predominately use two variations: inquiries (where are you), and reports of their whereabouts (I just got home). Further, speakers formulate their locations in two ways: location specific (I’m sitting on a train) or status of transit (we are on our way). In addition to open format where-are-you elicitations, location talk can take the form of a candidate (are you at Union street); candidate formulations show how speakers orient to the collaborative work of meeting up with one another and display knowledge about each other’s activities. Finally, we treat the case of reciprocal location inquiries and reports, where both caller and callee state their whereabouts, showing how location talk is sequence organized. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This special issue marks an important milestone in the maturation of the growing field of Mobile Media and Communication (MMC). When this journal was launched a decade ago, some were still trying to make sense of what this field entails, what to call it, and whether it even exists (Campbell, 2013). Although there was no question as to the growth in this new area of scholarship, the field’s coherence was highly questionable. When this journal was launched, the editors echoed concerns that: although mobile media scholarship has begun to grow, it is by no means a coherent field of scholarship, and there are still many areas in need of elaboration and differentiation [...] mobile media in an age of smart-phones requires that we not only attempt to articulate the field but also to more systematically understand its various dimensions. (Hjorth et al., 2012, p. 1, cited in Jones et al., 2013). If the last decade has provided us with anything, it is perspective on where MMC scholarship has come from and how it is growing.

Here, Rushkoff shows that people have lost interest in traditional narrative and have also, in broader cultural terms, lost their reliance on the grand narratives that used to orientate our experience and our values in the past. In proposing such ideas, the author does not provide any clear reference to the work of postmodern theorists such as Lyotard on the end of grand narratives. When suggesting that people have lost interest in traditional narrative, the author provides several examples from popular culture, ranging from TV shows, movies, to videogames. However, he does not engage systematically with the voluminous literature debating the role played by storytelling in contemporary popular culture. Nevertheless, the author offers rich insights into many different fields, ranging from finance to popular culture and from military organization to business, and proposes an interesting hypothesis on the way we experience and make sense of the world today. The book is written in a clear and engaging manner and offers an original perspective that helps readers contextualize their everyday experience within a broader conceptual framework.",

As this case demonstrates, the general belief in nonmigrants’ entitlement to the achievements of those who migrate regardless of their status abroad, also means migrant students are involved in remittances practices. The students are expected to remit and at the same time, they are conscious of their obligation to support people who stay back in the home country. As such, the mobile phone ideally provides an infrastructure through which monetary resources could be coordinated and channeled to Cameroon. While exploring this possibility of remittances transfer, I argue that instant communication contradictorily generates and fuels conflicts mainly as a result of unmet expectations of deploying the phone to directly request money from abroad. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile youth culture (MYC) is a concept that refers to the distinctive ways in which young people adopt and use mobile phones. However, most studies on MYC are situated in the Global North, where the lived realities of teenagers are different from teenagers in the Global South. Through an investigation of how MYC manifests in Liberia, this article adds to the growing literature on mobile communication in the Global South. By doing so, the study responds to scholarly criticisms of the assumption that young people everywhere experience the use of mobile phones in similar ways. Based on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 38 Liberian teenagers, our findings challenge the western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD)-centric suggestion of a worldwide “monoculture,” because our results show that although mobile connectivity gives Liberian teenagers opportunities similar to those afforded to their peers in most WEIRD (and non-WEIRD) societies, it is simultaneously experienced markedly different by them. We therefore argue for a more “inclusive” conceptualization of the MYC concept. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The current research used uncertainty management theory (UMT) as a framework to examine individuals’ experience of uncertainty within the context of Grindr, an all-male, location-based mobile dating application. In two studies, we first investigated the particular concerns associated with Grindr use. Results indicated that the unique affordances of Grindr generated six categories of user concerns associated with use of the mobile application. The second study confirmed that a specific set of user goals and concerns predicted daters’ desire for uncertainty, which in turn predicted information-seeking behavior. Findings clearly indicate that Grindr users’ responses to uncertainty were not limited to simple reduction strategies, but were dependent upon their desire for and tolerance of uncertainty in relation to their goals and concerns of application use. The current results also help to establish UMT’s predictive power and explanatory utility within the realm of interpersonal communication. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Accessing the news in an age of mobile media: Tracing displacing and complementary effects of mobile news on newspapers and online news",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Legacy news media have invested substantially in developing digital and mobile news provisioning, alongside the widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies. Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-à-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to single-media use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The smartphone has become an integral part of adolescents’ daily life. Despite the countless affordances of smartphones, concerns have been raised about their enormous potential to cause failures in self-regulation, such as distraction and task delay. The current study investigated whether two smartphone usage patterns, fragmented and sticky smartphone use, are associated with distraction and task delay. For three weeks, we logged the smartphone usage of 160 adolescents (733,359 observations) and assessed their distraction and task delay six times a day with experience sampling (12,723 observations). Using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found that, overall, adolescents felt more distracted when their smartphone use was more fragmented or sticky. Exploratory analyses indicated that 77% of adolescents experienced increased distraction (i.e., β &gt; .05) when their smartphone use was more fragmented, and 55% when it was sticky. Overall, adolescents did not report more task delay as their smartphone use was more fragmented or sticky. Nonetheless, 22% experienced increased task delay when their smartphone use was more fragmented, and 42% when it was sticky. Together, our findings underline the dynamic nature of smartphone use and its differential impact on self-regulation outcomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article I discuss the phenomenon of deliberated missed calls and their intentional use by senior mobile phone users in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). Deliberate missed calls (DMC) are made with the intention that the receiver is not to answer them. Although this multiregional and multicultural practice is described in different countries, no specific study has been carried out on its use by the older population. To address this absence, this article explores the significance of using deliberate missed calls among seniors. There are three main conclusions. First, personal abilities and external support shape the way seniors use DMC. Second, seniors may abandon, or at least redefine, the use of deliberate missed calls if they change to a flat-rate contract. Finally, the focus on an already old innovation such as DMC allows us to observe the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity of older people if we are to properly analyze their mobile communication practices. </jats:p>",

Although the overarching view of the social effects of cellphones in conversations appears to be negative, some research has also reported positive outcomes. The Cellphone Relevance Hypothesis predicts that effects of cellphone use on conversational satisfaction depend on the function of cellphones within a conversation. When a conversation partner integrates cellphone use into the conversation (integral use), conversational satisfaction is predicted to be higher than when the cellphone is used for a purpose unrelated to the conversation (incidental use). Two vignette studies provide support for the Cellphone Relevance Hypothesis and specify boundary conditions of the cellphone effect based on the involvement of respondents. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This special commentary for Mobile Media &amp; Communication seeks to put these divisive debates in context. Through the lens of Pokémon GO, we can understand and critically interpret a variety of issues involved in the politics and practice of playful mobile media. These issues move across debates around location-aware technologies in constructions of privacy (Coldewey, 2016; Cunningham, 2016), risk and surveillance (Machkovech, 2016; Mishra, 2016) to the role of mobile media in commodifying (Evangelho, 2016) and expanding the social, cultural, and creative dimensions of play (Isbister, 2016; Mäyrä, 2012). As the mobile media and game theorists in this commentary highlight, the game sits at the nexus of several technological and cultural trajectories: the playful turn; the ubiquity of location-based and haptic mobile media (and apps and games); innovative game design; the effects of digital mapping technologies; the intertwining of performative media games and art; our individual and collective memories of playworlds and transmedia universes; the increasing importance of issues concerning privacy and risk in public spaces; the ongoing augmentation of place and space; and the politics embedded in this hybrid experience of the lifeworld. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "With the explosive spread of mobile media represented by mobile phones and the rapid iteration of mobile Internet technology, various social media applications have emerged, such as Facebook, Twitter, and China’s WeChat and Weibo. When mobile media as nonhuman actors were adapted into our daily life, the state of “permanent online, permanent connection” turned out to be the routine for mobile media users (Vorderer & Kohring, 2013), who started to use domesticated media as a resistance tactic to balance between the media system structures and action power (Haddon, 2003, p. 43). In this sense, the mobile media extend the time and space for social interaction. While the context of mobile communication has undergone drastic changes, the “media practice” carried out by users has also been increasingly treated as the core concept for the research on media action that is co-constructed among the public, technology, and environment. It should be noted that the scholarship on mobile communication effects achieved during the past decade mainly took a perspective from either the technological determinism or social construction of technology. However, neither the relationship between structure and action, nor that between technology and society, should be viewed as simply binary. Rather, the bilateral interaction perspective that was originally emphasized in communication research should be revisited, and the recent affordance perspective should be reintroduced and refocused. The concept of affordance was first proposed by eco-psychologist Gibson based on his interest in visual perception. Affordance refers to the action possibility of the perceiving subject in an object or environment, which is independent of the actor’s experience but",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we provide a history, analysis, and theorization of the emergence of mobile social gambling—a new form of media and cultural practice that fuses “social gambling” and “social gaming,” with the affordances of mobile platforms and social networking sites. Through the use of apps in mobile devices, the consumption of risk is experiencing a shift from space-bound betting to itinerant practices that open new spaces for leisure and socialization. Focusing on a case study of the mobile app Zynga Poker, this paper attempts to identify and describe these “leakages” in the “magic circle” of gambling, which bring together social gaming and longstanding gambling cultures and practices. Our argument is that mobile gambling on smartphones and tablets extends earlier cultural practices associated with gambling activities such as poker, and much deeper into the realm of the everyday. The expansion of gambling practices into the realm of the everyday, however, poses manifold ethical, cultural, and political implications: the availability of gambling products to minors and other vulnerable populations; increased normalization of wagering as entertainment; and the merging of gambling and mobile gaming industries and markets. Digital gambling is a pressing area for future study in mobile media and communication. </jats:p>",

App quality was often equated to personal preferences, that is, how the app met those preferences. Additional cues (cost, app size, order in App Store) led to download decisions but had nothing to do with quality or credibility. We categorized the findings as folk theories regarding quality and credibility of health apps and discuss them using information dual-processing models and media and technology literacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile dating applications play a prominent role in Chinese gay men’s social lives. Based on in-depth interviews with 21 participants, this study explores how urban gay singles in China develop social relationships on dating apps. It reveals that relationship development is often driven by casual conversations, which are not motivated by clear pragmatic purposes. Casual conversations tend to unfold around common hobbies or experiences, serving as a source of sociability, or satisfaction in socializing itself. In contrast to casual conversations, two forms of conversations are deemed highly instrumental and undesirable: one is the sex-oriented conversation aimed at immediate sexual encounters; the other is the interrogative conversation in which people ask private questions in a nonreciprocal and rigid way. Besides craving sociability, users “relationalize” casual sex by perceiving it as a form of social connection and endowing it with the potential to foster a relationship. This is also reflected in users’ preference for sexual partners with whom they can hold a conversation. Users also exploit the affordances of different media platforms and capture the relationship potential by platform switching. They switch to the mainstream media platform WeChat for more synchronous communication and to collect more identity cues from each other. Platform switching also signals willingness for relationship development and mutual trust. Nevertheless, users keep going back to dating apps for new possibilities for social relationships. </jats:p>",

Accompanying the spike in Indian youths’ smartphone use is a proliferation of media coverage on the purported impact of smartphones on youths’ physical, psychological, and social well-being.

We argue that this stems from a moral panic reaction to youths’, particularly young women’s, potential exercise of agency using their smartphones and accessing forbidden content over the internet. This narrative fails to include the potential affordances of internet access for youth and other marginalized people while also failing to address deeper concerns about digitization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> TikTok is the international twin of China’s mobile short video app, Douyin, and one of the fastest growing short video platforms in the world. Owned by Chinese tech giant, ByteDance, TikTok and Douyin share many similarities in terms of appearance, functionality, and platform affordances; however, they exist in radically different markets and are governed by radically different forces. Unlike other popular mobile media platforms in China and internationally, TikTok and Douyin are neither part of the big three tech giants in China nor the big five in the US. This provides an interesting case study to investigate how an emerging internet company adapts its products to better fit divergent expectations, cultures, and policy frameworks in China and abroad. Using the app walkthrough method informed by platformization of culture production theory, this study highlights the similarities and distinctions between these two platforms. We argue the co-evolution of Douyin and TikTok is a new paradigm of global platform expansion that differs from strategies of regionalization adopted by previous major social media platforms. We contribute to platformization theory by developing the concept of parallel platformization to explain ByteDance’s strategies for surviving in two opposing platform ecosystems in China and abroad. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research suggests that parent–child communication is rapidly changing as a result of the massive adoption of mobile devices and their penetration into interpersonal interaction within the family. Accordingly, this study aims to develop a more nuanced understanding of the impact of mobile device use on the quality of parent–child interaction in early childhood, based on ethnographic observations of 60 families at two playgrounds in the United States. The research findings suggest that parental behavior can be classified along a continuum of high engagement, divided engagement, and disengagement, often dependent upon whether and how parents use their mobile phone. Though mobile phones were not the only distracting factor during playground visits, their use was more highly correlated with parents’ disengagement from their children as compared to other distractors. Parents’ mobile phone use also corresponded to two main consequences for their children: safety concerns and emotional concerns, both resulting in missed opportunities for social learning. The results of this study call for closer attention to parental uses of mobile phones in public spaces. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the emerging phenomenon of the non-use of WeChat Moments. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of social media practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of WeChat, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their autonomy and agency in their daily interactions with WeChat. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study uses survey data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project to advance digital divide research by exploring how smartphone dependence—in which one’s only means of accessing the Internet is via a smartphone—and smartphone use differ between key demographic groups in the United States. Results show differences in smartphone dependence and use based on race, age, income, and education. Minority group members, younger, lower income, and less educated users are more likely to be smartphone-dependent. Additionally, minorities and younger individuals use smartphones for more social activity, while White, younger, and higher income individuals use smartphones for more news/information activity. Findings support the usage gap hypothesis and suggest smartphones may act as both a bridge and a barrier for disadvantaged groups to overcome the digital divide. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With digital communication increasingly shifting to mobile devices, communication research needs to explore ways to retrieve, process, and analyze digital trace data on people’s most personal devices. This study presents a new methodological approach, mobile data donations, in which smartphone usage data is collected unobtrusively with the help of mobile log data. The iOS Screen Time function is used as a test case for gathering log data with the help of screenshots. The study investigates the feasibility of the method, sample biases, and accuracy of smartphone usage self-reports on a general population sample of Dutch citizens ( n=404). Importantly, it explores how mobile data donations can be used as add-ons or substitutes for conventional media exposure measures. Results indicate that (a) users’ privacy concerns and technical skills are crucial factors for the willingness to donate mobile log data and (b) there is a strong tendency for underreporting of smartphone usage duration and frequency. </jats:p>",

Through an extensive review of 451 religious apps a number of problems were noted when relying solely on iTunes categories to identify app functions and purpose. Thus further analysis was done in order to present a new typology and framing of religious apps, which more accurately describe their design. We suggest that the 11 new categories offered here suggest a critical framework for studying religious apps. Thus this study provides a starting point for scholars interested in analyzing religious mobile applications to investigate how app developers integrate religious goals into their designs, and consider the primary ways people are expected to practice religion through mobile apps. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Phubbing—ignoring another person in order to use a smartphone instead—is an increasingly common behavior that disrupts interactions and harms relationships. Using the frameworks of the theory of planned behavior and an interaction value approach, we examined the driving factors of phubbing frequency. Four preregistered predictors were tested: attitudes toward phubbing, subjective norms of phubbing, interaction value, that is, the extent of valuing a social interaction, and the perceived interaction value of the partner. After having had lunch together, a total of 128 participants in 64 dyads filled out a survey assessing the four predictors. Dyadic linear mixed model analyses confirmed that a more positive attitude toward phubbing increases phubbing, as well as being phubbed. Moreover, we disentangled screen-sharing time (i.e., using a phone together), phone use, co-present phone use (i.e., using a phone alone), and phubbing: we found that valuing the social interaction more decreased phone use, but not phubbing, and holding more accepting subjective norms on phubbing increased co-present phone use, but not phone use in general. We further found that the person that used their phone first, phubbed more. Overall, this research extends our understanding of the factors driving phubbing and may be fruitfully harnessed to reduce phubbing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Most prior research on the effects of mobile and social media on well-being has worked from either the “technology addiction” or “screen time” approach. Yet these frameworks struggle with considerable conceptual and methodological limitations. The present study discusses and tests an established but understudied alternative, the technology habit approach. Instead of conflating mobile usage with problems (i.e., addictive/problematic usage) or ignoring users’ psychological engagement with mobiles (i.e., screen time), this approach investigates how person-level (habit strength) and day-level aspects of mobile habits (perceived interruptions and the urge to check) contribute to a key problem outcome, procrastination, as well as affective well-being and meaningfulness. In a five-day diary study with N = 532 student smartphone users providing N = 2,331 diary entries, mobile checking habit strength, perceived interruptions, and the urge to check together explained small to moderate amounts of procrastination. Procrastination, in turn, was linked to lower affective well-being and meaningfulness. Yet mobile habits showed only very small or no direct associations with affective well-being and meaningfulness. By separating habitual mobile connectivity from problem outcomes and well-being measures, this research demonstrates a promising alternative to the study of digital well-being. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile phone usage is typically measured via self-reporting. However, scholars have questioned the validity of self-reported data, which may lead to Type I or Type II errors. Using an online survey ( n = 777), this study compared self-reported and log mobile phone usage data using a simplified version of the mobile data donation method. The results showed that people generally underreported their mobile phone usage in terms of time duration, the number of notifications, and apps used. Moreover, self-reported data may either have no additional effect on or overestimate the communication findings depending on the outcome variables. This challenges the Type II error explanation and suggests that the effect sizes of self-reported data might not be underestimated after all. Instead, past research examining mobile use and pertinent outcomes may have false-positive findings and Type I errors. Given the potential inaccuracies of self-reported data, future research on mobile media and communications should go beyond self-reported data to enhance the validity of findings. </jats:p>",

And yet, communities persist in the face of this constant motion. This is a qualitative study of a mobile labor group—taxi drivers in Chicago. Similar to Wallis’s (2011) conclusions, I found that access to and use of a mobile phone does not automatically imbue taxi drivers with power and autonomy from forces that seem to be working against them. However, access to mobile phones does help to shake up the hierarchy of control in the taxi industry. This study has also identified another type of community where the theory of polymedia (Madianou &amp; Miller, 2012) applies, that is, labor communities, and has shown that while choice of technology may offer some sense of power, access to mobile communication technology does not necessarily result in significant changes in power structures within and surrounding a community. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The next six chapters then focus on socialbots within specific contexts of SNS— providing more thought-provoking, in-depth, and theoretical discussions on the blurring lines between bots and humans in the evolving social media landscape. Grant Bollmer and Chris Rodley’s chapter, for example, focuses on unpacking the concept of “sociality” on SNS, arguing that the way it is imagined and performed is socially constructed and further speculating that socialbots themselves “serve as a fluid and flexible limit” in defining human sociality online (p. 161). The chapter by Maria Bakardjieva also questions the understanding of what it means to be “social” on SNS. Referencing Max Weber’s work and other philosophical critiques of formal rationality, Bakardjieva attributes the rise of socialbots to the continuing process of formal rationalization of sociality online. She cautions that this could weaken interpersonal relationships, meaningful discussions, and group solidarities if left unchecked. The book then concludes with David Gunkel’s chapter on morals and ethics, highlighting the ethical conundrums, such as rights and accountability, of such automated software agents given their future existence and usage. Overall, the book provides a broad yet comprehensive exploration of socialbots and human–socialbot relationship that extends beyond existing scholarship in the field of computer science. The collection shines in its fascinating and detailed case studies of different socialbots and their predecessors. It also excels in its engagement with a wide range of approaches, perspectives, and theories, such as theory of rationalization and actor–network theory, to explain the existence and effect of such automated software agents on social networks and their users. Although the discussions within the book are not directly related to mobile media and might be a challenging read for those without foundational and technical knowledge, it offers useful insights that highlight the emerging trends in online human sociality within social networks. These are especially useful for students of media and communication, sociology, and psychology. At times, the conceptual understanding of socialbots seemed confusing and lacked consistency across chapters and contributors. However, this lack of a single definition and shared understanding reflects how socialbots are evolving, complex, and ambiguous in nature. In sum, the book underlines the need for further investigation of this sociotechnical entity and its associated user dynamics, especially with the inevitable proliferation of socialbots in digital media.",

    "abstract": "Nonetheless, even while Gregg speaks of contemporary reality, her current pool of evidence only captures the situations of those who are in a largely networked society— those segments of the population who are located in networked environments. This raises the question of whether those who are on the fringes of the networked world are also similarly experiencing such conditions. Moreover, while Gregg accounted for individual, social, organizational, gendered, generational, and technological aspects of presence bleed, factors such as race, ethnicity, and culture, which could also significantly influence the maintenance or blurring of professional and personal boundaries, were noticeably left out. Furthermore, while Gregg admitted that time constraints prohibited her from conducting more extensive ethnographic work, her narrative data could have been better complemented by extended observations of the working and living circumstances of her participants. This could have provided her study with expansive in-depth insights into presence bleed and the factors that contribute to its occurrence. As a final note, as each chapter was designed to offer contextual evidence of Gregg’s main thesis, incorporating a critical synthesis at the end of each chapter could have delivered more analytical value. Be that as it may, the aforementioned limitations do not diminish Gregg’s contribution to communication and new media scholarship as her book offers, in a reader-friendly style, a robust literature review as well as a copious accounting and description of firsthand human–technology experiences. Overall, her book is a useful resource for understanding how contemporary technology is redefining the contours of our professional and personal lives.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Around every new media technology debates circle about whether the technology is bringing people socially closer or pushing us further apart. According to popular press accounts, Pokémon GO players are absorbed into a game world on their phone with no attention or interest in the “real” world around them. But coupled with these accounts are stories of people exploring their neighborhoods and of marriage proposals in the midst of Pokémon hunting. This article puts Pokémon GO into a longer context of mobile technologies and sociospatial practice to explore the kinds of social interactions that can emerge around and through the use of Pokémon GO. In particular, the article explores how people can use the platform as both an involvement shield and social catalyst. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in older adults’ mobile phone use from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. The media displacement and digital divide approaches served as the theoretical frameworks of the study. The data were drawn from the 2018 and 2020 waves of the Aging + Communication + Technology cross-national longitudinal panel study. The sample consisted of older Internet users, aged 62 to 96 (in 2018), from Austria, Canada, Finland, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain, who participated in both waves (N = 4,398). Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis with multinomial regression models were the main methods applied to the data. With regard to the findings, three mobile phone function use profiles—Narrow Use, Medium Use, and Broad Use—were identified from the data. Lower age, being married, higher income, and place of residence (in 2018) predicted belonging to the three profiles, while country differences in the prevalence of the profiles were substantial. Between 2018 and 2020, transition from one profile to another was relatively rare but typically toward the “Broad Use” category. Profile transitions were most common in Romania, while stability was highest in Finland, Israel, and Canada. In addition, gender, age, marital status, and place of residence predicted the likelihood of changing from one profile to another between 2018 and 2020. The results suggest that older adults’ mobile phone function use is relatively stable over a two-year time span. While new mobile phone functions are adopted, they seem to augment the spectrum of mobile usage rather than displace older similar functionalities. In addition, demographic, socioeconomic, and country-level digital divides, although slightly modified over time, remain significant among older adults. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Travellers have long inhabited a liminal position between home and away. Now they also have a bridging foot in cyberspace, as Internet-enabled smartphones mediate their travel experience. Social-web-assisted mobility means that gazing down at a smartphone screen can either enhance or hamper a traveller’s movement through a destination and their interaction with place and its inhabitants, either distancing them from local people or offering new means to connect with hosts and enhance the travel experience. An Internet-linked smartphone is like a portal through which the traveller can gaze into different directions. Further, it is not just a question of which direction they choose; the choice will impact on the gazer and the performance of the gaze, potentially compromising attempts to view a place through independent eyes as the traveller’s imaginings of the foreign sphere are influenced by the social web. This paper reviews the literature on how travellers use the Internet before, during, and after a trip, and suggests the concept of the liminal gaze—in which an individual chooses between different directions to look at and different spheres to focus on—as a tool to examine smartphone-mediated interaction between people, and between people and place. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cautionary voices have pointed to the apparent dangers that mobile media and communication pose for young people in the form of “deviant” activities such as sexting and mobile phone-facilitated bullying and criminal activity. Such incidents have ignited moral panics about the proliferation of mobile media because they are seen to facilitate emergent social/spatial interactions that are either unprecedented, or occurring on a scale not hitherto witnessed. While labelling concerns about youth deviance that is, in some measure, enabled or facilitated by mobile communications as “moral panics” is unproductive, it would be equally myopic to disregard the risks that mobile media can pose for youths in certain circumstances. This article critically examines the panic discourse surrounding youths and mobile media before reviewing research that suggests how mobile media can present risks for youths in particular contexts and milieus. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study posits a framework for conceptualizing the practice of adolescent sexting in order to help explain this behavior and inform decisions about whether and how to address it. Select theoretical propositions about the role of mobile communication in the “social emancipation” of youth were explicated and tested using a national survey of teens in the US. Drawing from this perspective, we hypothesized that sexting would be associated with levels of peer and family mobile connectivity, although in opposite ways, as well as parental control over the technology. As hypothesized, involvement in sexting was positively predicted by connectedness to peers through mobile communication and negatively predicted by connectedness to family. Although sexting was less likely with mobile connectedness to family, heavy-handed parental control over the technology was not a predictor. The discussion offers theoretical and practical implications of these and other findings, along with directions for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study presents a secondary analysis of real-time data of mobile phone usage in Israel during two recent wars – with the Lebanese Hezbollah in 2006 and with the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza in 2008/9. The data, provided by Cellcom Israel, the country’s largest mobile operator, enabled an analysis of real behavior patterns rather than relying on memories of people who may have been under stress or traumatized during the hostilities, hence unable to accurately recollect this information later on. During both wars, significant changes were noted in the way people used their mobile phones: There was a substantial decrease of calls originating from within a 10-kilometer region along the Israel-Lebanon border and mobile users also made significantly longer calls. However, the decrease in calls during the Lebanon War was more than double that of the decrease in the comparable region along the Gaza border. There was no significant change in the calling patterns of Israelis living outside the directly affected regions. These supposed differences in reaction to a crisis situation (which are congruent with previous mobile phone usage studies following suicide bombings) are analyzed, and questions regarding the validity of the myth of solidarity and bonding among Israelis are raised. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Log data from smartphones have primarily been used in large-scale research designs to draw statistical inferences from hundreds or even thousands of participants. In this article, we argue that more qualitatively oriented designs can also benefit greatly from integrating these rich data sources into studies of smartphones in everyday life. Through an illustrative study, we explore a more nuanced perspective on what can be considered “log data” and how these types of data can be collected and analysed. A qualitative approach to log data analysis offers researchers new opportunities to situate smartphone use within people’s practices, norms, and routines. This is of relevance both to studies focusing on smartphones as cultural objects in everyday life and studies that use such devices as proxies for social behaviour more generally. We argue that log data, for instance in in-depth interviews, may serve as cues to instigate discussion and reflection as well as act as resources for contextualizing and organizing related empirical material. In the discussion, the advantages of a qualitative perspective for research designs are assessed in relation to issues of validity. Further perspectives on the promises of log data from various devices are proposed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research demonstrates that phubbing—the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at one's mobile phone—interferes with the quality and satisfaction of social interactions. This article examined how observations of an adult's phone use during a social interaction impact different social judgments. Adult participants (n = 331) watched a 3-min video showing four speakers having a discussion around a table. One speaker looked at their phone intermittently during the meeting (five times for 2–3 s each) while not interacting with the other speakers. Participants were asked to rate characteristics (e.g., attentiveness) of all four speakers and evaluate who they could trust both epistemically (e.g., for knowledge) and interpersonally (e.g., for social connection). Participants also provided information about their own technology use. Results indicated that participants’ judgments, ratings of interpersonal trust, and epistemic trust toward the phone user were significantly lower when compared to their ratings toward the non-phone users in the video, especially among female participants. Additionally, the more participants reported using their own phones during group interactions, the more leniently they rated the phone user in the video. This research provides evidence that overseeing acts of co-present mobile phone use are negatively evaluated. This has implications for how adults view technology use during social engagements. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile media researchers have increasingly focused on smartphones as locative media. However, our field has not devoted as much attention to another mobile technology used to track far more people and things than smartphones: radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. RFID tags are used to track products and people, and they are an increasingly important part of the infrastructure of the Internet of Things. This article argues that mobile media scholars have much to contribute to scholarly analyses of RFID. I make that argument by first giving background on RFID as a mobile technology. I then identify and discuss four areas of research related to RFID tags—Big Data, surveillance, space and place, and nonhuman agency—that are particularly relevant to mobile media scholars. </jats:p>",

The rapid rise of smartphone use calls for more scholarly attention paid to users’ media usage and time expenditure. This study aims to (a) understand smartphone usage patterns by examining time spent using smartphones and task switching between mobile applications (apps), and (b) test the validity of self-reported measures of these behaviors by comparing self-reports with log data from the smartphone. Data were collected from 50 participants over 1 week. Results show that on average participants spent 2 hours 39 minutes on their smartphone and made 101 app switches per day. Among other findings, social networking was the most used app category, age was a significant demographic factor, and participants, especially heavy smartphone users, overestimated their mobile app usage. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Steady demand for migrant domestic workers from developing countries continues to normalize an intriguing form of geographically dispersed families from which the mothers migrate and become the breadwinners. Despite the distance, migrant mothers remain committed to the preservation of intimacy by utilizing communication media to perform and “display” family practices. Using polymedia and displaying family as theoretical frameworks, this ethnographic study examines how smartphones shape family practices among migrant mothers. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews with 30 Indonesian mothers in Hong Kong, it illustrates how smartphones transform the configuration of mothering practices and power structures underpinning family interaction in the process of mediated family display. Smartphones, as polymedia, enable migrant mothers to assert authority over the display of maternal roles, relationships, and rituals, both materially and discursively. Given that their relationships are experienced almost exclusively via smartphone communication, directing the communication effectively means defining the shape and characteristics of the family. The findings problematize the depiction of migrant mothers as victims of communication technologies, highlighting their authorial privilege when displaying family. This article also presents a critical reflection on mediated family practices by illustrating cases of failed display. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Networked infrastructures support the flows of information and communication. While traditional conceptions of networked infrastructures render them necessarily immobile and centralized, this article rethinks the concept of networked infrastructures to instead consider their mobility. In doing so, this article conceptualizes mobilized networked infrastructures (MNIs) and examines their implications in three sections: Forms of Action, Production of Networked Space, and Ways of Knowing. The Forms of Action section indicates that, over time, MNIs have allowed for new spaces and practices of communicative mobility. The Production of Networked Space section considers the speculative potential for MNIs to deterritorialize networked space, but argues that MNIs often reinforce already networked spaces and reterritorialize deterritorialized networked space. Finally, the Ways of Knowing section examines the mobility of networked infrastructures as a new way of knowing by allowing the tracking of infrastructural mobilities in addition to, and in concert with, the tracking of human and nonhuman actors. </jats:p>",

Spotivey is a free research software that integrates music streaming provider API functionalities into online surveys and in this way allows to connect digital behavioral traces with self-reported questionnaire data. The current version effortlessly retrieves comprehensive information about respondents’ past music listening on Spotify while they fill an online survey. Through an informed consent procedure, General Date Protection Regulation compliance for this new form of digital data donation is ensured. Methodical challenges include participant dropout and the need for robust statistical analysis methods. Planned future enhancements encompass expanding application programming interfaces support, enriching retrieved data with information from other music databases, and compatibility with diverse online survey design systems. </jats:p>",

The dataset consisted of 250 published papers that investigated wearables for health-related purposes. Papers focused on technological inputs and health output factors, de-emphasizing theoretical mechanisms that could effectively translate the former into the latter. The lack of transdisciplinary research in the field is limiting both identification of effectiveness and evidence of beneficial health outcomes, with a considerable divide between technologists and public health researchers. Privacy concerns relate to increasing trends in collecting data for mental health and physical health, with the latter escalating exponentially. Invasiveness of wearables has increased over time in terms of collected signals and the derived health information, monitoring both users and their social and physical environments. We conclude with reflections for conceptual development, commercial application and policy regulation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents the attitudinal response of rural villagers in Papua New Guinea to mobile telephony, based on a threshold study made during the early stages of its adoption. The research indicates that the introduction of mobile telecommunications has generally been viewed positively, with mobile phones affording social interaction with loved ones. Nonetheless, negative concerns have been strongly felt, notably financial costs and anxiety about mobile phones aiding in the coordination of extramarital liaisons and criminal activities. The communities investigated previously had scant access to modern communication technologies, some still using traditional means such as wooden slit drums, known locally as garamuts. The expansion of mobile network coverage has introduced into communal village life the capability to communicate dyadically and privately at a distance. Investigation into the adoption of mobile phones thus promotes understanding about traditional means of communication and notions of public and private interactions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this contribution to the inaugural issue of Mobile Media &amp; Communication, I draw upon recent work on mobiles in the global south to illustrate how the ‘third wave’ of mobile communication research requires a renewed focus upon the political and economic dimensions of infrastructures and the subversion of the system by individuals, communities and organizations. Inspired by Susan Leigh Star’s seminal work on the importance of studying infrastructures, I suggest that mobile media scholarship should look to the changes in the technical, social, political, regulatory and other forms of infrastructures that the first two waves’ focus upon novel uses and consumers often rendered invisible. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As smartphone’s computing power continues to grow and as mobile applications (apps) continue to dominate digital engagement, apps have become a new frontier for advancing field experiment methodology. Using apps may help researchers to scale up the reach, precisely control randomization and experiment materials, collect a variety of objective and self-reported data over time, and more conveniently replicate and adapt an experiment. We performed a systematic review on field experiments involving apps published between 2007 and 2017. Seven databases were scanned using a predefined search strategy. The database search retrieved 4,810 citations; 101 articles met the inclusion criteria. Our review suggests that scholars have only started to employ apps in field experiments in the last 4 years. Most studies only used apps as an experiment treatment instead of an experiment platform; therefore, researchers have yet to fully leverage the advantages. Almost all studies were from the health research domain and 77.2% used randomized controlled trial design. Only 7 studies utilized smartphone sensors for collecting data. Only one study reported cost and ethical concerns regarding using apps for the experiment. Given these findings, we reported a case study that targeted a minority racial group and leveraged the advantages of apps as an experiment platform and as a data collection tool to illustrate practical challenges and lessons learned regarding time, financial cost, and technical support. In conclusion, we suggest apps provide new ways to study causal mechanisms with experiment big data. Limitations of generalizability, retention, and design quality were discussed as well. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In many countries across the world, mobile media has become an embedded part of everyday life. And yet, despite the influence of mobile media in and around art, the notion of “mobile art” or “mobile media art” remains relatively undertheorized and discussed. So what constitutes mobile art? Is it defined by a mobile interface in the process or delivery of the artwork? Or is it defined by a relationship to mobile content or context? Located in and around the field of mobile communication, mobile art has often been sublimated with locative, hybrid, mixed reality, or media arts. This paper argues for an understanding of mobile art as a broader field of creative practice than just locative media practice or media arts. Rather than survey all the examples of mobile art on offer today, this paper will structure mobile art into key three thematic rubrics: intimate copresence, emplaced visuality, ambient play. </jats:p>",

In total, 20 distinct topics emerged spanning topical foci and emotional tones. The prevalence of certain topics, such as those related to gacha game mechanics, declined as community members mastered the practice and as the practice itself changed.

This oversight is fairly common in studies of new media. Yet a familiarity with past practices is required to observe changes in the present. If this collection reports on the key mobile practices of today, how are those practices similar to and/or different from practices 5, 10, or 100 years ago? This collection, however, does deliver on its promise of organizing the nascent field of mobile media studies around politics, presence, and practices. Although these areas do not encompass all of mobile media research, this collection tacitly argues that mobile media studies might better benefit the various disciplines in which mobile media research operates by not becoming a discipline unto itself. Undoubtedly, this is a question that media scholars will constantly revisit as scholarship seeks to keep pace with technological change.",

These data reveal the way smartphone usage patterns tend to be organized according to notification functions (mSNS, SMS), a specific set of technical cues that mediatize social demand and promote social connectedness. Users manage these cues through a recurrent trend composed of a three-step sequence: they often start by using applications displaying notifications; they favor those that display social demands; and, among them, they prioritize these relational solicitations in accordance with social status or types of relationships. </jats:p><jats:p> By examining the distribution of users’ attention between urban environments and smartphone applications, this video-ethnography also highlights how these “checking habits” are organized according to a set of spatial cues and some daily commute characteristics, such as visual coordination with passengers in public transport. These technical cues mediatize a growing number of social demands that encourage users to keep their eyes focused on their smartphone’s screen in public spaces. We argue that these technical cues create a temporary bubble effect and social isolation at a proximal scale, which mostly operate at the beginning of smartphone usage patterns. </jats:p>",

Whichever side one takes in that debate, there is evidence of new forms of interaction and connection by way of modern media. Teenagers renegotiate relations to their parents by real time sharing and withholding of information on their location, their activities and their emotional states. Cultural goods such as literature and music acquire new and different meanings and affective investments when no longer collected and used in a material form but streamed to devices at hand. New potentials for health provision, social welfare and trade arise in regions where people have their first contact with hospitals, government agencies and banks through the screens of their mobile phones instead of computers or human agents. We cannot yet systematically define precisely what these observations have in common. But they all touch the phenomenon of mobility in communication. We believe that the time has come for a joint effort to explain this still unfolding phenomenon. This is what Mobile Media & Communication is about.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies show that the use of smartphones in the presence of a partner may result in lower relationship quality, intimacy, and increased conflict. Such co-present phone use, often referred to as “phubbing” or “technoference,” has been problematized in the literature. However, few studies have hitherto explored the possibility that using phones in each other's presence may not cause any relational harm and might even support relationship maintenance. Only recently did the critiques and theoretical frameworks begin to expand our understanding of the broader role of smartphones in dyadic interactions. In this study, we tested whether co-present phone use is always perceived as negative, or if it could also be neutral or positive. We employed quantitative methods and content coding of free responses to understand the participants’ experiences and reasoning in different evaluations. We analyzed the responses of British participants ( N = 383) living with their partner, who were enrolled via Prolific to take part in the study. The analyses revealed that only 15% of participants perceived their partner's phone use as negative, the majority evaluating it as neutral or positive. Most participants reported that their partner's phone use had no impact on their time together or was integrated with other activities. Those who reported a negative impact attributed it to the partner's lack of attention. The present study challenges the existing literature and highlights the need for a conceptual expansion of smartphone-related behaviors in dyads. </jats:p>",

Results reveal the smartphone’s role as an outlet of public information, which fosters political talk with others, but also suggest use of government-controlled traditional media stifles open civic discourse.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Communication about crime and the places it occurs has been an important area of study for criminology, sociology, public policy, and media scholars. Where incidents used to be communicated through word of mouth, physical evidence, and news outlets, recent advances in crime tracking, mapping, and mobile media have dramatically changed how individuals are informed about crime. Many organizations have adopted mobile text alerts, and recent advances in augmented reality (AR) technologies have made it possible to overlay visuals about crime on top of users’ physical surroundings. How people make sense of this visual, individualized, and location-specific crime information, however, is largely unknown and complicated by the fact that mobile technologies are challenging to study in situ, as people move through and experience urban place. Within the AR literature, while existing research has started to look at the ways that AR can affect people’s experience of place, the precise ways that people perceive and integrate AR displays into their understanding of place are still largely unexplored. This empirical study reports findings from a project utilizing AR as an urban probe, where we took participants ( N = 57) around to places in a large metropolitan area in the United States and showed them visual AR crime information overlaid on the physical place where they were moving through. After seeing these urban probes, participants were asked what they noticed, remembered, and thought occurred in that place when shown AR crime information. The analysis draws on Lefebvre’s (1991) spatial triad to explain how people read places through the lens of AR, and also how they extrapolate, speculate, and make associations from AR information. Based on these findings, this study discusses the implications for mobile media scholars and their understanding of visual place-based communication, as well as for designers and policymakers considering the use of AR to communicate crime information. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Messaging apps such as WhatsApp collapse temporal and spatial distances and enable continuous interactions. At the same time, messaging apps blur boundaries by default and contribute to the blending of different relational contexts as well as the collapsing of absence and presence. Whereas existing studies have mainly focused on the blurring of boundaries between work and private life, this study expands beyond the personal/professional binary and considers boundary work in more nuanced relational contexts. In order to provide a better understanding of boundary work within messaging practices, we conducted interviews and focus groups with employees from a variety of Dutch workplaces, and with participants of WhatsApp neighborhood crime prevention groups. Our findings highlight two forms of boundary work strategies. First, respondents purposefully tinker with WhatsApp features to manage the boundaries between absence and presence. Second, they use smartphone and WhatsApp functionalities to carefully construct segmentations between different contexts. The meaning of particular contexts, the materiality of messaging apps, and technical know-how play a crucial role in these boundary-sculpting practices. The importance of our study is in noting how the ongoing contradictions of messaging practices—being always available but always negotiating that availability—affect everyday experiences of freedom, privacy, and autonomy in significant ways. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the spread of unreliable information on Twitter during the 2017 French presidential campaign, focusing on the use of mobile phones with regard to information-sharing behavior. The corpus is composed of 38,346,765 tweets, posted by 2,163,812 supporters of the five main French political parties, from November 25, 2016 to May 12, 2017. We examine more precisely a sub-corpus of tweets (13,044,619) containing links to external information sources, in order to evaluate the different types of information sources and their reliability. </jats:p><jats:p> Our research shows that information-sharing behavior within Twitter in France is generally based on reliable information sources, produced by journalists and professional media. However, we highlight that smartphone users tended to share a greater amount of user-generated content, as well as articles from a wider range of alternative political information sources (blogs, activists’ websites); such sources were most likely to publish unreliable information. Thus it appears that users of mobile phones tend to share more unreliable news than those who use Twitter from a computer web browser. Further, we show that this “device effect” on the spread of unreliable information is primarily amplified among the practices of one political community—namely, the far-right party and its network of supporters—which is more likely to organize debate around a larger number of unreliable references. We are claiming here that the design-based interoperability of these unreliable political news and social media applications helps to understand why the French far-right community shared more unreliable information from the Twitter application. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As mobile media have grown more advanced, and mobile Internet access has increased to a near-ubiquitous state, media use is often described as occurring “anytime, anywhere.” Consequently, measuring media use and understanding competition and coexistence within such an environment is a constant challenge for researchers. To help address this issue the present study explicates a method for measuring media use and competition, the time–space diary, and reports a methodological study testing the robustness of this method across 3 diary instruments. Following a summary of concepts central to mobile media use and measurement, this study reports findings from data collected using 3 types of time–space diaries. Results indicate no significant difference between diary methods (paper and pencil, audio recorder, mobile device) on the likelihood of reported media use, and minimal differences in patterns of competitive superiority, supporting the reliability of the method. Paper-and-pencil diaries are argued to offer the greatest use flexibility relative to audio recorders and mobile devices, and received higher ease of use scores relative to mobile devices. The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of the time–space diary method for emerging mobile media research which must account for media use in novel times and places, as well as multichannel media consumption. </jats:p>",

Females were more likely to be involved in selfie-related activities and to use selfies for ASSP. Documentation was the prime predictor of the activity of “taking” selfies, SUSP was for “posting” selfies, and ASSP was for “editing” selfies.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study demonstrates how localization and homogenization can co-occur in different aspects of smartphone usage. Smartphones afford individualization of media behavior: users can begin, end, or switch between countless tasks anytime, but this individualization is shaped by shared environments such that smartphone usage may be similar among those who share such environments but contain differences, or localization, across environments or regions. Yet for all users, smartphone screen interactions are bounded and guided by nearly identical smartphone interfaces, suggesting that smartphone usage may be similar or homogenized across all individuals regardless of environment. We study homogenization and localization by comparing the temporal, visual, and experiential composition of screen activity among individuals in three dissimilar media environments—the United States, China, and Myanmar—using one week of screenshot data captured passively every 5 s by the novel Screenomics framework. We find that overall usage levels are consistently dissimilar across media environments, while metrics that depend more on moment-level decisions and user-interface design do not vary significantly across media environments. These results suggest that quantitative research on homogenization and localization should analyze behavior driven by user interfaces and by contextually determined parameters, respectively. </jats:p>",

Second, mobile methods engage in controlled complexity regarding the data they collect. Often complex and very large datasets are created through mobile methods and researchers must thoughtfully decide how best to analyze such data. Third, these methods raise important ethical considerations. Researchers employing mobile methods may collect a variety of personal or sensitive information and must be vigilant regarding informed consent and data management procedures.

Our findings revealed that communicative smartphone use increased friendship satisfaction over time, validating how smartphones can be a positive influence in difficult times. Friendship satisfaction decreased anxiety after one month, signaling the importance of strong friendship networks during the crisis. Contrary to our expectations, non-communicative smartphone use had no effects on friendship satisfaction or anxiety over time. Reciprocal effects showed that anxiety increased both types of smartphone use over time. These findings are discussed in the context of mobile media effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The iNakba is a new mobile application that allows users to locate, and learn about, Palestinian villages that were destroyed during and after the Nakba, the consequences of the war between Jewish forces and local and external Arab forces following the withdrawal of British Mandate from the colony of Palestine in 1948. As such, the iNakba, as a new mobile application, is a mnemonic device utilized in a heated memory contestation that exemplifies how contemporary technological capabilities operate as a reminder for a society that seeks to forget. This study reveals that when marginalized groups struggle for recognition in society’s memory sphere, while capitalizing on contemporary media’s unique characteristics, they benefit from the blurring of the familiar distinction between communicative and cultural memory (Assmann &amp; Czaplicka, 1995). The unique characteristics of new media create a new opportunity to make many more narratives and group memories known, officially organized, and mediated for mass audiences. These new memory affordances may contribute to establishing a culture of just memory that takes into consideration memory ethics and promotes the “duty to remember” the stories of the oppressed and marginalized. </jats:p>",

While the mobile phone was welcomed as a way to reduce the general digital divide, much early research presumed that mobile Internet was essentially inferior to personal-computer-based Internet in terms of possible online activities and related benefits. Given ongoing developments in devices, online activities, and socio-demographic differences, we reassess the device divide. After reviewing the concept, and considering mobile phone capabilities that could influence activities, followed by summarizing changes in device usage and online activities in the United States, we analyze the device divide from 2011 to 2019 in Armenia. Over time, use of mobile Internet separately and combined with personal computer Internet grew, and differences in online activity use withered, raising issues of whither device divide research. Nonetheless, in all years, there are continuing demographic-based digital divides after controlling for device divides. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile social networking apps, which offer a real-time platform for creating, sharing, and chatting, showcase the integration of mobile telephony and Web 2.0 technologies. Thanks to its thriving user-created public accounts, WeChat, a globally popular mobile social media app based in China, has become a digital source of news and information. Informed by the uses and gratifications framework, the present study examines predictors of reposting articles from WeChat public accounts and subscribing to these accounts. Findings show that use of WeChat for public communication is extensive. Predictors of such behavior include mass media and Internet use. Also, perceived credibility of WeChat is a significant predictor. With demographic and media use variables being controlled, two gratifications of WeChat (i.e., dependence on WeChat for information and mobile connectedness with one’s circles) were found to be the strongest predictors of reposting articles on WeChat public accounts. The theoretical implications of information mobility for changing China’s status quo in media environments are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> China has in recent years seen the rapid adoption of multifunctional social networking applications such as WeChat. This paper aims to explore if China’s social stratification has influenced the adoption and use of mobile social apps and if social apps such as WeChat can help to bridge the digital divide by providing urban and rural users equal access to diverse information and communication resources. The study is based on 4 months of fieldwork in the Henan Province of central China and combines quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from semistructured interviews and focus groups. We found that there still exists a digital gap in the adoption and use of mobile social apps such as WeChat between rural and urban China, but such differences are also associated with demographic variables such as age, gender, and education level. Meanwhile, we found that WeChat has become more than a communication tool; it has also played an essential role in everyday problem-solving and information seeking for both rural and urban users. Our qualitative interviews and focus group studies reveal how WeChat influences various aspects of daily life in developing areas in China. We argue that although some divides in information seeking are being overcome, other new divides are emerging. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Due to separation from their families and friends in their home countries and constrained living conditions in the host countries, migrant workers usually are found to experience loneliness. Compared with male migrant workers, female migrant workers are more vulnerable and likely to experience higher levels of psychological problems. The ubiquity of mobile phones enables migrant workers to access resources and social support to help to alleviate loneliness. However, research also suggests that mobile phone use may lead to a higher level of loneliness because problematic or excessive use displaces meaningful social interactions. This study investigates this mobile phone paradox among Filipino domestic workers (FDWs) in Hong Kong. Specifically, it explores the relationships between mobile phone use and two types of loneliness, namely social and emotional loneliness. Further, informed by the augmentation hypothesis and the displacement hypothesis, this research advances a two-path model to illustrate how mobile phone use connects with loneliness through social support and problematic mobile phone use. Findings from a survey of 492 FDWs reveal disjunctive effects. There is no direct correlation between mobile phone use and the two types of loneliness. Both problematic mobile phone use and social support are found to mediate the negative association between mobile phone use and social loneliness, while only problematic mobile phone use mediates the positive association between mobile phone use and emotional loneliness. Implications of the research on migrant workers’ mobile phone use and practical implications for social work and government efforts in helping FDWs dealing with loneliness are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphone use, e.g., on social network sites or instant messaging, can impair well-being and is related to clinical phenomena, like depression. Digital detox interventions have been suggested as a solution to reduce negative impacts from smartphone use on outcomes like well-being or social relationships. Digital detox is defined as timeouts from using electronic devices (e.g., smartphones), either completely or for specific subsets of smartphone use. However, until now, it has been unclear whether digital detox interventions are effective at promoting a healthy way of life in the digital era. This systematic literature review aimed to answer the question of whether digital detox interventions are effective at improving outcomes like health and well-being, social relationships, self-control or performance. Systematic searches of seven databases were carried out according to PRISMA guidelines, and intervention studies were extracted that examined timeouts from smartphone use and/or smartphone-related use of social network sites and instant messaging. The review yielded k = 21 extracted studies (total N = 3,625 participants). The studies included interventions in the field, from which 12 were identified as randomized controlled trials. The results showed that the effects from digital detox interventions varied across studies on health and well-being, social relationships, self-control, or performance. For example, some studies found positive intervention effects, whereas others found no effect or even negative consequences for well-being. Reasons for these mixed findings are discussed. Research is needed to examine mechanisms of change to derive implications for the development of successful digital detox interventions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The year 2013 marked not only the inaugural issue of Mobile Media & Communication, but also the start of my academic career and the development of my first mobile phone and well-being study (Chan, 2015). Whether it is conceived as “mental health,” “subjective well-being,” “flourishing,” “positive thinking,” “life satisfaction,” or another term, well-being has been the subject of scientific research for more than a century (Rodman & Fry, 2009). The longevity of the literature is understandable because of the accumulative evidence across the decades that high citizen well-being produces a variety of normatively desirable individual and societal benefits. These include increased mortality, health, academic achievement, workforce productivity, and prosocial behaviors (Maccagnan et al., 2018). During my graduate studies, I was especially fascinated by the ongoing academic and societal discourses on the beneficial and deleterious consequences of mobile phones (i.e., Rainie & Wellman, 2012; Turkle, 2011) as well as my own gradual realization that the mobile phone has become so integral to my everyday life. The successive emergence of new communication technologies since the 1990s such as the Internet and social media have stimulated a vast literature on whether they engender or diminish psychological well-being. Research on mobile phones is no exception given that it is one of the fastest-diffusing technologies in the world (Wei, 2013). Indeed, a cursory search of mobile phone and well-being related keywords in Google Scholar exemplifies the growth, which shows few signs of abating (Figure 1).

The findings show variables of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) and social norms are key predictors for mobile video consumption. In the research model, impression management is significantly associated with attitude, subjective norm, and individual social norms while perceived government and operator facilitation are associated with collective social norms.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This high-exposure study explores information-seeking via mobile phone usage among a specific unstably housed population. There exists a population referred to as “vehicle residents” who are people earning wages, who have chosen to move into their vehicles as a survival strategy during a time when housing expenses account for more than half of lower-income Americans’ monthly income, and whose situation varies from traditional homelessness in that they sustain some stability in maintaining ownership of the vehicle in which they are residing. Building on previous studies of homeless people and their mobile phone usage, while using mobilism as the frame, this study investigates the ways that access instability, an underexamined facet of digital inequality, impacts vehicle residents’ ability to search for information via their mobile phones to support their daily lives. This study is based on two rounds of semi-structured interviews with the same participants, complemented by a virtual guided tour of participant's vehicles. Among the key findings is that mobility creates and resolves access instability for vehicle residents, introducing the concept of mobile access instability. Overall, understanding the unique features and information needs of this particular group results in a more thorough comprehension of the contemporary housing crisis, which is necessary to improve policy by developing mitigation strategies and resolutions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the contemporary urban environment, the conditions for communication are in abundance, having shifted and extended to include multiple overlapping possibilities for interaction through mobile devices, personal computers, and online platforms such that traditional domains of activity have been subsumed within a relational domain of communication activity. This involves not only an extension of interaction across spaces of activity but also the remapping of how interpersonal communication practices are woven into the temporality and embodied practices of everyday life. The conditions for networked communication partially emerge through a consistent set of embodied background communication practices. These include practices of the individual maintaining contact with technological objects in their environment and also the habitual rhythms of interface-level practices, which together contribute to the forms of networked connection. </jats:p><jats:p> Stemming from qualitative fieldwork with 35 participants during 2010 and 2011, this paper explores the organization and experience of networked interpersonal communication practices within the temporalities of everyday life. The individual’s perceived need for networked connection is proposed as the prerequisite for, but also a condition of, participation in contemporary everyday life. This paper explores the emerging role of networked time: where the constant and multiple embodied rhythms of individual engagement with overlapping media technologies, as objects and interfaces within the material environment, are interwoven with the capacity of those media to partially constitute one’s relationship to, and management of, time in everyday life. The tension between the finite minutes of the individual’s day and the limitless potential of networked connection is explored through the individual’s interface-level practices to avoid being temporally overwhelmed by potential interactions. In this manner, communication is perceived and managed as distinct, quantifiable, but variable units of time in and of themselves: interaction as “tasks” to be addressed and completed through engagement. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Ephemerality as Data Prevention: Values for an Ethics of Ephemeral Mobile Media",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile media is a chief driver of digitizing locational information, geotags, and photos that are produced and collected as we communicate with and exist within our networks. But when these data are stored and recorded—in quantities that far exceed any of our abilities to manage—mobile technology denies our ability to actively forget. This article argues that digital ephemerality via mobile applications (i.e. Snapchat, Signal, Confide, and Facebook Messenger Secret) has emerged because of the granular possibilities for data retention enabled by mobile devices. Together these applications move towards a practice of preventing data from being stored and shared. In response, “data prevention” is proposed as an ethical framework for ephemeral mobile media, and is theorized with an eye toward the distributed agency inherent to networks. This ethics is positioned within a framework of distributed agency across stakeholders that draws most directly from actor–network theory, and three commonly articulated values—trust, transparency, and privacy—are proposed. These values help to define a system of networked practices within ephemeral mobile media that requires consideration of both human and non-human actors. Building sustainable ephemeral technologies necessitates aligning shared values amongst divergent stakeholders. The article concludes by motioning to LIMITS research, where data prevention might be included, linking and further intensifying shared values across technical and social concerns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, mobile media applications have become a significant resource for crisis communication and communal coping during natural disasters and wars. Drawing on communal coping and media affordance research, we examined the roles that a WhatsApp group plays for mothers living in an ongoing conflict area. We examined, through in-depth interviews, a local WhatsApp group operating in a community adjacent to the Israel–Gaza border. Findings revealed the unique emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies people use when facing ongoing threats. Four affordances—immediacy, reachability, mobility, and multimediality—contributed to WhatsApp’s role as a shared and ubiquitous coping resource. This study demonstrates the ways in which instant messaging communication affordances contribute to communal coping strategies in ongoing conflict areas. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "and its interface. This limitation makes an invaluable point concerning the simulation that is produced through mediated screen-based relationships, rather than physical experiences. This constraint from the screen is also explicated by Monteiro in Chapter 21, where he posits that the image is altered for the benefit of fitting the screen’s surface. The modification of the image in terms of the screen, Monteiro argues, not only affects the former’s integrity, but enhances the instrumentality of the latter; for even as televisions and computing devices attempt to “offer a seeming plenitude of the image by widening the screen, the deformation of the image in fact reasserts the presence of the frame as a defining factor in the composition’s properties” (p. 276). Such a containment of the image, in turn, contributes to the flattened performance of pixellation, in which “the image is animated, even if visibly still, within the flux of the system as data are continually received, sent and processed by the screen device and network to produce and sustain this visual performance” (p. 281). The final section, “Environments and Interactions,” looks into the material relations between screens and their user-environments. In Chapter 26, for example, Rae Cooley employs the criterion of fit to evaluate the relationship between a hand and a mobile screenic device (MSD). In differentiating fit from the distance between a viewer and the television/ cinema screen, Rae Cooley argues that fit must be considered together with the interface, or the “threshold at which users and their surroundings meet and interact” (p. 321). The concluding chapter by Verhoeff explores the ways screens function as an intermediary between software and physical space. Screen objects like the iPhone possess a hybrid interface, as users can navigate both within the machine and around its physical space. This experience, Verhoeff explains, is also a form of performative cartography, insofar as “movement through space and interaction with on-screen layers of digital information to off-screen geographical and material presence unfolds in time” (p. 446). In summary, the volume’s multidisciplinary approach provides a comprehensive range of insights into the screen’s social, historical, and cultural significance. While they do not explicitly undermine the actual devices that support it, the essays curated are arguably concerned with the screen’s pervasive transparency, as it becomes more embedded and indispensable in our everyday lives.",

This paper investigates these default effects among adolescents configuring apps that either satisfy relatedness or enhance autonomy by protecting privacy. Relatedness and privacy are two innate needs that adolescents can satisfy with the use of smartphone apps. This study argues that adolescents’ choice of features supporting either privacy protection or social relatedness is a consequence of default effects, so that adolescents adhere to preselected defaults. We test this assumption in an experimental survey design including four app configuration tasks with N = 280 German adolescents aged 11 to 20 years. The study finds support for default effects for privacy as well as social relatedness. Effects for further variables, particularly age are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile technology shows great promise in resource-limited settings due to its low cost and pervasive nature. Early evidence-based studies have shown robust support for mHealth interventions implemented among people living with HIV (PLWH); however, this type of inquiry is lacking amongst the most vulnerable groups of PLWH such as men who have sex with men (MSM), prisoners, and those facing substance use disorders (SUDS) and structural instabilities. These populations face barriers more profound than the general PLWH population including social stigma and discrimination. In response to the lack of rigorous evaluation of mHealth implementation and the tremendous potential for mHealth tools in underserved PLWH, we propose a 3-pronged approach in rooting mHealth tools using evidence-based methodology—(a) assessing mHealth feasibility and accessibility through descriptive studies, (b) conducting pilot projects testing mHealth tools, and (c) integrating mHealth tools into existing large-scale studies. The set of research steps proffered here aims to build a solid body of evidence on mHealth interventions among underserved populations and the health conditions that disproportionately affect them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The third section, “Locative Play” considers the contemporary concept of locationbased gaming and mobile applications, and how the combination of physical locations within the material world works alongside digital gaming. Perhaps due to the emergent nature of this type of gaming, there are two chapters that study the augmented reality game Ingress. Blasiola, Feng, and Massanari’s chapter (pp. 135–148) examines the collaboration, community, and privacy implications of location-based games (with a focus on Ingress), while Erin Stark (pp. 149–163) analyses how players experience the everyday realities of the real world through a digital platform (again, Ingress). While each chapter has its individual merits, the overlapping analyses of Ingress in back-to-back chapters feels repetitive, with this section appearing a little underdeveloped as a result. Conversely, Part Four approaches the topic of mobile and casual games from a marketplace perspective by first offering a historical overview on gaming markets through Balnaves and Madden’s chapter (pp. 195–212), before Tama Leaver’s closer analysis of the successful Angry Birds suite (pp. 213–224). David Nieborg’s chapter (pp. 225–240) examines the mobile app market, arguing that “power asymmetries” within the mobile gaming market “epitomise a winner-take-all” environment (p. 236), with Nieborg suggesting this trend will accelerate as the mobile app marketplace continues to grow. The fifth and final section “Cheating, Gambling, and Addiction,” features only two chapters: Cesar Albarran-Torres’s consideration of simulated social gambling apps (pp. 243–259), and Carter and Björk’s study of gamers’ belief that legal purchasing of resources (such as additional lives) on Candy Crush is considered as cheating (pp. 260–274). The afterword concludes this collection by reiterating Social, Casual and Mobile Games’ central argument, that gamers cannot be defined in a singular or binary manner owing to the rise of mobile and casual gaming. Ultimately, this collection offers a diverse and inclusive approach to mobile and casual gaming, successfully bringing together numerous approaches on an emergent and contemporary subject, while proposing various potential areas for future research. While some topics are perhaps underdeveloped, and the sheer breadth of the book occasionally undermines its overall cohesion, Social, Casual and Mobile Games offers an ambitious and stimulating perspective on the changing face of gaming and gamers.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Visual aesthetics is an essential part of our experience of mobile devices, but the ways in which it is accounted for in design have largely been overlooked. We investigate whether an aesthetization of mobile design is taking place and, if so, how it is being pursued through institutional practices in organizations. We conduct a visual analysis of all Nokia phone releases between 1992 and 2013 complemented by an interview series with key actors. The study reveals a continuous increase in aesthetic variation between 1998 and 2008, which is visible in the variation of colors, forms, and materials. The period between 2003 and 2008, which we term the “Grand” period, marks the peak of aesthetization of Nokia’s devices. It exhibits great variation, and is visibly similar to aesthetics in the fashion industry. With the introduction of the slate form, we see a decrease in visual variation between 2009 and 2013. The interviews reveal how the visual design was driven by organizational strategies, such as customer segmentation in general, and an orientation toward the fashion industry, for example, in the creation of a fashion segment. The study reveals how aesthetic variation is weaved into a complex innovation system with sometimes conflicting demands deriving from, for instance, technology and user interaction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "in Taipei were the least likely news consumers via their mobile phones. Interestingly, this difference did not appear statistically significant in the survey of 2017–2018. It is noteworthy that students under stricter news media supervision in cities (e.g., Shanghai) reportedly perceived mobile news to be more credible than those living in cities where press freedom is ranked higher (e.g., Taipei). This appears both counter-intuitive and fascinating. This timely and much-needed work paves the way for future research concerning news consumption behavior and its relationship with mobile technologies. Wei and Lo argue that mobile technologies afford users portability, interactivity, and mobility. Researchers can, for example, study how such affordances influence ordinary users’ sense of interpersonal distance between both journalists and governments. This may influence the extent to which users perceive freedom from these affordances. It is possible that mobility or portability that is often interpreted as a democratizing affordance may close the distance between government, journalists, and users. Thus, it may be important to consider not only how users are motivated to seek information through mobile phones, but also whether they perceive surveillance by political actors. By extension, understanding the affordances of mobile news from the perspectives of journalists and government may also strengthen our understanding of mobile communication in a civil society.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2014, a non-governmental organization called HOGAR SÍ initiated the Hábitat program as a pioneer attempt to implement the Housing First model in Spain. The present study is part of the evaluation of this program, which was carried out from May 2015 to February 2020 using a form of a randomized controlled trial. The treatment group was compared with a control group (people experiencing homelessness but not selected as Hábitat users), keeping track of their evolution over 18 months. Among the many dimensions that were evaluated (coverage of basic needs, life satisfaction, victimization, physical and mental health, etc.), the study analyzed social support and leisure activities involving the use of mobile media and other communication technologies—along similar lines to some previous research. The main results show that participating in the Hábitat program brought a few improvements in digital inclusion. That is the case of the higher use of mobile phones to receive calls, to connect to the Internet, or to have contact with relatives, partners, or friends. These gains seem to be significant for the increase in perception of available social support by Hábitat users, whereas these changes did not occur in the comparison group to the same extent. Additionally, participating in the program enhances satisfaction with leisure time, as well as the frequency of carrying out some activities such as shopping, watching TV, or doing a pastime or hobby. It could be concluded that the Hábitat program achieved significant improvements in areas beyond specific housing services. The positive effects regarding social support and leisure activities seem to be partly channeled through mobile phones and digital applications; nevertheless, we are aware that further research and discussion on the active role of these technologies in helping people experiencing homelessness is still necessary. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Domesticating technology: Learning from the use of mobile phone of small women rural entrepreneurs in India during COVID-19",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The COVID-19 pandemic and the worldwide lockdowns that followed the same have led to drastic changes in our lifestyles. While the lockdowns marked a global transition to a world of online services and products, the change was neither easy nor smooth for many. From lack of access to technology to the absence of skills to use it, the act of “going digital” was littered with challenges for people across the world. In the South-Asian country of India, this lack of access was further amplified by the presence of a gender digital divide. Among the women from various factions of the society, one such category affected by it was female entrepreneurs from small rural areas in India. These entrepreneurs were cut off from their clientele owing to a nationwide lockdown in the country imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Most of these women had no prior experience with technology (which is mobile phones in their case) but they not only negotiated access but used it to sustain and grow their entrepreneurial endeavors in a short duration of time. This study, through in-depth qualitative interviews with female entrepreneurs from small rural areas in India maps their usage patterns and their negotiations for domesticating mobile phones. The research found that the first two stages of domestication theory (appropriation and objectification) were easier to navigate for the women entrepreneurs, but gender expectations from them made the last two stages of incorporation and conversion challenging. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The smartphone between the present and the future: Five changes",
    "abstract": "The first change that I point out here is the ongoing capability of the mobile phone (and now the smartphone) to colonize everyday life. This dominance of the smartphone over other technologies is due to its closeness to the human body, already described in the early 2000s (Oksman & Rautiainen, 2002). This fact explains not only its supremacy but also the radical nature of the social changes it has facilitated. The smartphone makes an ever-increasing number of societies’ domains available for consumption while people are on the move or wherever they happen to be at the moment (Vorderer et al., 2018). This also means that we are available for work and production wherever we might be (Mullan & Wajcman, 2017). Being a metamedium (Humphreys et al., 2018; Jensen, 2016), the smartphone also effortlessly incorporates into itself other technologies and platforms (e.g., the computer, camera, internet, radio, television, newspapers, etc.). We can speak, write, read, learn, do mathematical operations, take photographs and videos, control their schedules, coordinate with others, express emotions, pray, check calendars, search for places, get information (and archive it), and also communicate. We can also access social media, read the news, do banking and ecommerce, play games, and get health data. The smartphone offers an incredible number of opportunities to redesign the attitudes, habits, routines, and behaviors of everyday life. The implications of our use affect many dimensions of human existence: the ontological as well as the anthropological. For example, not only do we have new ways to keep our memories, but we develop another relationship with our memories (Humphreys, 2018; Özkul & Humphreys,",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The power of app-driven mobile phones was first unleashed in 2011 when they were used to mobilize protesters and gain support for political movements in the United States and abroad. Mobile devices have since become the bedrock of political activism. To examine the influence of app reliance on offline and online political participation, this study builds on the Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response (O-S-R-O-R) model by (a) applying the model to mobile apps, (b) testing whether trust in, and reliance on political discussion are mediators between reliance on apps and political participation, and (c) using trust in both offline and online discussion as measures of cognitive elaboration. This study’s path model suggests that app reliance is related to online political discussion, which, in turn, is related to online political participation, but not offline participation. Although both offline and online discussion are linked to offline and online trust in political discussion, trust in political discussion does not influence either offline or online political participation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In organizational meetings, mobile media are commonly used to hold multiple simultaneous conversations (i.e., multicommunication). This experiment uses video vignettes to test how manager policy (no policy, pro-technology, anti-technology), device use (notepad, laptop, cell phone) and task-acknowledgment (no task-acknowledgment, task-acknowledgment) affect perceptions of meeting multicommunication behavior. US workers ( N = 243) who worked at least 30 hours per week and attended at least one weekly meeting rated relevant outcomes: expectancy violation, communicator evaluation, perceived competence, and meeting effectiveness. Results reveal manager policy and device use both affect multicommunication perceptions, with mobile phones generating the highest expectancy violation and lowest evaluation of the communicator and meeting effectiveness. Surprisingly, there was no effect for task-acknowledgment; however, a match between manager policy and task-acknowledgment affected evaluations. This paper unifies past evidence about multicommunication under the expectancy violations framework, extends theoretical understandings of mobile media use at work, and suggests practical implications for technology use in unfamiliar workplace situations. </jats:p>",

Though largely overlooked by historians of technology, these mobile, less-than-mobile, and relatively immobile devices helped shape the social and cultural uses of contemporary mobile communication. I argue that the technological capabilities of portables altered users’ expectations for how and where computers could be incorporated into daily life, be it near bodies, on hand, or at one’s fingertips. While the market for bulky portables dwindled by the late 1990s, as laptops and cell phones became more ubiquitous, these consumer electronics are nonetheless useful today for understanding the perpetual role of materiality and embodiment in how we conceive of the imagined affordances of mobile communication technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "However, Chin’s book also has many notable limitations and/or weaknesses. First, to what extent her empirical findings sufficiently support the book’s ambitious theoretical claims is debatable. In my opinion, the book would read more convincingly had it been framed less ambitiously as a study of international students’ discursive construction of identity and social spaces. Secondly, various mentions of MSN, MMS, Hotmail, “DVD shops,” and the Iraq War betray the datedness of the empirical study— no doubt a drawback when it comes to the book’s relevance today. For the same reason, the book also offers little, if any, insight into mobile media in relation to the advent of smartphone technologies and prevailing social media. Thirdly, the book leaves much to be desired regarding its literary quality and presentation. More could have been done in the thesis-to-book rewriting process. Lastly, Chin seems to have missed a good opportunity when she chose to relegate the explanation of her “CSNM” (communication spatialities, networks, and modes) framework to an endnote at the end of the book (p. 196), despite this framework’s central place in Chapter 5 as well as its potential wider analytical significance.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on a practice-centered study focusing on pilgrimage to explore mobile and digital media dis/connectivity in the context of a particular configuration of personal mobility. Pilgrimage is a practice bringing together people motivated by religion, tourism, leisure, or self-development, in what have been termed “post-secular” forms of pilgrimage and tourism. In 2020 and 2021, restrictions on individual mobility were imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This exploratory study consisted of interviews with 13 pilgrims in Portugal, who went on pilgrimage to Fátima or Santiago de Compostela in 2021. We argue that dis/connection by pilgrims is evidence of a post-digital moment. Our analysis shows how pilgrims maintain an ambivalent relationship with mobile media in light of this experience which limits their access to habitual devices, people, and digital services, while opening up for the use of others that facilitate the mobility and the spiritual, affective, and sensorial experience as a pilgrim. However, digital and mobile media are deeply entangled in pilgrims’ relationships with space, time, and others—and thus disconnection is partial and transitional. Moreover, dis/connection is embodied in pilgriming—for example, in how they choose the mobile media considering the weight and energy, and place it on the body, at the same time that mobile media can also afford disembodiment to the experience of pilgrimage—by alleviating the physical pain of walking, for example. Pilgrims also use the media in ways that blur the distinctions between digital and non-digital in the ways they invest meanings in their practices. </jats:p>",

This study investigates the relationship between noise sensitivity and mobile phone attitudes and behaviors. Study results suggest that noise sensitive bystanders find mobile phone conversations more annoying, that they differ in their assessment of the distraction level of ambient noise when making and receiving calls, are more likely to report mobile phones as distracting, and are more likely to seek privacy from others when receiving a call. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Attending to attention: How do people attract, manage, and negotiate attention using mobile devices?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In today’s always-connected world people have an ever-increasing array of ways to stay in touch, often selecting among multiple media that allow for different degrees of attention (e.g., phone calls vs. texting) and may vary in convenience for their interaction partner. In this environment, people must manage their attention to each other. Recent work suggests attention management can be considered as a dyadic negotiation process in which people are continually acting to display their own focus of attention and gather information about others’ focus of attention, and may seek to increase or decrease the current level of attention from their partner. To explore attention management and negotiation on mobile devices, we built a custom application to track people’s SMS and phone call activity. Drawing on log and transcript data, we use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the details of attention management behavior within specific relationships for a few participants, and then used hierarchical clustering to identify different patterns of attention management in relationships of varying tie strength. Results suggest that attention is managed both implicitly and explicitly, with explicit negotiation more likely when there are conflicts. There are also substantial differences in interaction patterns by tie strength, with phone calls and shorter text response times more common for weaker ties. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Personal safety apps provide new ways for crime data to be utilized by citizens within the context of urban mobilities. Yet, high-profile stories reveal the fear many women continue to experience in their daily lives. Operating as locative media, personal safety apps seem to imply that environments can simply be avoided. This is not always possible. Women students attending a city-based university, for example, might have to move through various urban spaces to get to their institution. Using a bespoke chatbot app for recording the experience of environments rather than avoiding them and semi-structured interviews, the purpose of this article is to examine the experiential fear of crime (EFC) that women students attending a city-based university experience in their daily lives. Between May and June 2022, 24 students who identify as women and attend a London-based university took part in this project. Our research first explored the question, how does EFC frame the experience of moving through a city-based university? Second, how does EFC frame the experience of ambulating the wider urban environment beyond campus? The article contributes to the wider field of locative media, by revealing how fear can shape extant understandings of digital wayfaring. </jats:p>",

In recent years, gacha games have gathered a considerable consumer base in the mobile gaming market, and these players have demonstrated strong purchasing power with regard to additional game resources. Within the framework of parasocial interaction and the investment model, this study explored factors influencing players’ game commitment and purchase intentions. This study used structural equation modeling and moderation analysis to examine data collected from 2,045 Chinese mobile game players. Satisfaction and investment size were positively correlated with game commitment and in-game purchase intention. Perceived alternatives were negatively correlated with game commitment. Furthermore, parasocial interaction was positively correlated with satisfaction, investment size, and game commitment and negatively correlated with perceived alternatives. The results indicate that these correlations were moderated by game genre. </jats:p>",

Applying an exploratory approach through grounded theory, participants ( N = 52) from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk provided common reasons for retaining voicemail artifacts. Results highlighted why participants retained or deleted general and specific voicemails. Five categories,  past-focused, important, future-focused, sentimental, and neglectful, represented retaining reasons. The oldest and most important artifacts represented sentimental messages. Three categories, past-focused, technological affordance, and unremarkable or undesirable calls, represented reasons for deletion. Voicemails are paralleled to mass and interpersonal communication and implications make connections between information retention, temporality, and interpersonal memorialization. Findings indicate that asynchronous communication exchanges and relics, such as voicemails, offer linkages to and reverberations of old and emerging technologies. </jats:p>",

As such, consumer drones afford “communication on the fly” in their medium-specific configuration of aerial navigation, visual production, and networked communication. Drawing on in-depth interviews with drone users and auto-ethnographic drone practices, I first highlight what physical-material conditions the flying camera mediates. An analysis of what digital-intangible formations the sensor medium collects and creates follows, before I turn to the sociospatial relations the buzzing mobile interface can establish and disrupt. I show how these conditions of communication on the fly shape user practices of place-sensing and place-making. Through the lenses of mobile communication research, media ecology, and mobilities studies, I ultimately illuminate how the ambiguous aerial system helps expand our thinking of and with notions of communication on the move. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite having been extremely popular in the 1980s and 1990s, the pager has received scant academic attention. Drawing on speed theory, this article provides a discourse analysis of popular representations of the beeper in the Netherlands between 1987 and 1999. It shows that it was first merely “emergency professionals” who were expected to be reachable whenever, wherever. However, the 1990s saw a growing number of occupations adopt the pager, which, additionally, was deployed to speed up tasks. Pagers enabled but also required people to work more efficiently and be more flexible. Articles and advertisements helped naturalize the idea that this was commonsensical. After 1994, an unprecedented pager marketing campaign sold the wider populace on the expectation of continuous reachability, which rapidly became the new norm. Advertisements successfully presented the pager as a communication technology that enabled reachability, yet—unlike its main competitor, the mobile phone—shielded users from constant availability. It thus offered autonomous reachability. All the same, journalists took issue with the reachability boom and flexibilization that pagers helped bring about. They criticized that pagers helped usher in a 24/7 economy, which in turn led to a stress society. Ultimately, then, this article demonstrates that the provenance of our sped-up society—or at least the pervasive idea that we live in one—is to be found before mobile phones and the Internet became ubiquitous. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the study of mobile media and communication matures, an important expansion in focus is to explore the experiences of people and communities living on the peripheries of social and economic power. In this special issue, we ask what happens when the stability of the “home” is pulled out from under our assumptions of mobile media and communication, as well as what happens when we shift our attention to the Global South. Additionally, mobility has a special relation to homelessness and, in turn, to media that is mobile. It enters both as a resource and a liability for the unstably housed in contexts around the globe. Tackling this combination of mobility, media, and homelessness, this special issue asks: What kind of opportunity is a mobile device for those who lack stable shelter? How do different experiences and drivers of homelessness interact with the possibilities of mobile media? What are communities and institutions doing to provide assistance to those at risk of, or experiencing, homelessness through mobile technologies? The articles gathered in this issue draw attention to homelessness as a set of diverse experiences with significant consequences for well-being and unique connections to mobile media. The authors challenge the taken-for-granted focus on the stably housed by studying those without access to the same basic need. We take an international perspective on contemporary homelessness to foreground its global existence and diverse expressions across a range of national contexts, and to challenge the predominant focus on North America and Western Europe in existing literature. </jats:p>",

However, there is a need to understand digital access, uses, and needs within wider organizational and technological contexts. Informed by a social construction of technology theoretical perspective, this article explores how different homelessness organizations in England appropriate technology within their support services. Drawing on findings from three case studies, it demonstrates how provision is shaped by interpretive, cultural, and material factors that operate to facilitate or inhibit use. Given the significance of technology within the lives of people experiencing homelessness, this article highlights the need for practitioners and policy makers to prioritize and examine the nature and impact of digital service provision and to ensure that its design and delivery reflects the needs of users. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "cative practices simultaneously personal, intimate, explicit, and open to interpretation. The author further argues that media accounting allows individuals to gain meaningful insights about the mundane and ordinary that could easily be overlooked, about others, about ourselves, in novel ways, ultimately evoking the notion of the “qualified self” in direct juxtaposition with the “quantified self.” While datafication is related to both the qualified and the quantified self, the qualified self takes on a special sociocultural significance when it prioritizes a bidirectional influence between people and the media and an interpersonal scope of unpacking representations of selfhood through media experiences. The author chooses to emphasize what people do with the media over the media technology or platform itself, and cautions us that the nature of media accounting is highly contextual. She reminds us that it is “meaning,” not “patterns” that we should pay close attention to, and that in the presence of ever-changing media, people’s media practices are certainly not created by new technologies (see also Jenkins et al., 2013). Thanks to this sharp analytical approach, the book centers the importance of contextual parameters to identify and analyze everyday mediated practices, whether in the domains of the digital or analog. The author’s rich findings and analysis offer an incisive and nuanced perspective on the complex relationship between digital media and media accounting. The book’s insights also foreground the significance of mapping personal and intimate media histories to further interrogate media practices in contemporary society. Nonetheless, clearly written and drawn on scholarly literature from media, science and technology, and feminist studies, this book will undoubtedly be useful to both scholars and students engaging with mobile media, digital media, media history, and cultural studies.",

Through the reading of promotional corporate blogposts and interfacial analysis of the layer, it critiques the layers' mediation of the pandemic, caught between public health needs and Google's overarching ethos. The analysis underscores three central claims: that interfacial choices endemic to the layer impose certainty and reduce necessary user hesitancy; promote data commodification regardless of its pandemic need; and stake unnecessary exceptionalism to the pandemic-spcecific information rather than integrating it into the maps’ existing hybridity. The paper ends with design recommendation for a better COVID layer, centered around bottom-up community practices, higher degree of personalisation, and increased friction. </jats:p>",

Through 26 semi-structured interviews, the authors sought to understand the role mobile devices play in family communication. Qualitative grounded theory analysis was used to find themes and interpret results (Creswell, 2013). One overarching paradoxical theme emerged from these data, family connect–family disconnect. In family connect, categories of across distance, reassurances, and boundaries are shared. Within family disconnect, distractions, misunderstandings, and negative emotional responses are conveyed. Future research avenues recommended are decision making related to mobile devices based on values and morals, in-depth social media and app usage, emoji emotional responses, individuals under 18 and between 18 and 30 years old, and a network analysis of one extended family. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphones are increasingly present during the exchanges we have with others in real life. Such co-present smartphone use has mainly been examined from a negative perspective, and research has insufficiently recognized the positive role these behaviors may play in social relationships. The main goal of the current study was therefore to offer insight into the processes by which smartphone co-use may be related to positive social dynamics during in-person interactions. Data were collected through two cross-sectional studies among 1) in Austria ( N = 257, M<jats:sub>age </jats:sub>= 32.84, SD<jats:sub>age </jats:sub>= 13.97, 55.9% female) and 2) in Belgium ( N = 180, M<jats:sub>age </jats:sub>= 10.79, SD<jats:sub>age </jats:sub>= 0.66, 54% female) in 2022. Results from Study 1 indicated a significant indirect relationship between co-use and friendship satisfaction mediated through emotional support and companionship. Only for male participants, the relationship between smartphone co-use and perceived companionship was evident. Study 2 further indicated that this relationship was mediated through increased companionship and perceived emotional support for male participants, but not for female participants. As such, the current study offers an important first step in exploring the positive role co-present smartphone use can play in social relationships among different generations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous studies have investigated how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers adjust to life in the US in order to understand their lives and help them to adapt to the new culture. Based on acculturation and mobile media theories, this study explores particularly how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ child-rearing practices in the US are mediated by mobile media. Guided by the theoretical framework of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers. Findings reveal that while going through the acculturation process, Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers attempt to play the traditional social role of mother as defined in their home countries when utilizing mobile media in their new home. Mobile media have symbolic meanings of empowerment and can be used as tools to deal with prejudice in the host country. This study also suggests that mobile media may mediate Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers’ acculturation processes when adopting different types of acculturation strategies (e.g., integration or separation). Implications for practice and future studies are further discussed. </jats:p>",

The arguments at the core of this article bring together, and build on, recent theoretical developments in (a) locative media, (b) automobiles as mobile media, and (c) new mapping technologies, practices, and spatial media to provide a coherent perspective of cars as mobile spatial media. Informed by a geographical political economy of navigation, this perspective contributes to our understanding of cars in the context of digital and informational capitalism as these vehicles undergo qualitative transformations catalyzed by increased digital interconnections and comprehensive automation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile technologies can become sources of interference that interrupt everyday family life. This concept, dubbed technoference, underlies the current study on how technological intrusions influence the parent–child relationship. This study of U.S. co-parents in families of preschool- and kindergarten-aged children examines the extent to which such interruptions are perceived to have negative consequences on the relationships that co-parents have with their children. The study found that the more the participant perceived the other co-parent as allowing technology to interfere during parent–child time together, the more likely the participant was to rate their co-parent's parent–child relationship quality negatively. Additional studies are needed to understand the young child's view of their parents' media use and how it impacts on their relationships. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mobile work, mobility, and mobile devices: Responding to a societal shift",
    "abstract": "The global community of mobile communication scholars has accomplished much in the past 10 years. We have more precisely defined mobile communication scholarship and began to focus on spatial, temporal, and power dynamics surrounding mobility and mobile devices (e.g., Campbell, 2013; Frith & Özkul, 2019; Stephens, 2018). Our scholarship has led the way by publishing research on diverse types of work and workers around the globe (e.g., construction workers: Pink et al., 2014; janitorial staff: Stephens & Ford, 2016; livestock farmers: Vidal-González & Fernández-Piqueras, 2021). Now, in a world that has recently experienced multiple cascading disasters, including a global pandemic, mobile communication has become even more important, and in the next five years we have new occasions to contribute our theoretical and empirical research. Before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the US, 7% of the population were considered full-time mobile workers—worked outside a designated work location—so mobile work is not a new practice (Parker et al., 2020). Scholars in a host of fields have studied telework, virtual work, and the use of mobile technologies in organizations (e.g., Watson-Manheim et al., 2002). What is different is that during 2020, we experienced extreme growth as the percentage of people working outside a formal workplace full time jumped from 7% to 50% (Parker et al., 2020). With that shift came a host of new challenges: parents could not find childcare outside the home, care responsibilities more often fell on women, people were less mobile as travel came to a halt, and many people having to work from home did not have a dedicated place to do their job",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile government (in short: m-government) is just at the beginning of its rise as a future trend of e-government. Considering technical advancements such as mobile Internet, smartphones, and tablet-PCs, m-government represents a tremendous new potential for the communication between governments and citizens. There are many examples of failures of early e-government projects due to a lack of consideration of users’ requirements. Against this background, this article tries to contribute to governmental communication processes by addressing the driving factors influencing the acceptance of mobile government among e-government users. Extending the approaches of the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) to mobile government, a new m-government acceptance model was developed. It shows that the intention to use m-government is significantly influenced by both, factors users see as a benefit but also by factors of perceived risks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile dating apps with geolocation function have gained popularity for fostering social, romantic, and sexual connections between nearby strangers. Through in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions with 74 users of gay mobile dating apps (Grindr and Jack’d) in Hong Kong, this study illustrates how the sociological concept of time can shed light on users’ experience of relationship formation through these apps. Specifically, the accelerated tempo of interactions facilitated by perpetual connectivity, mutual proximity awareness, and instant messaging was seen to entail instantaneous and ephemeral relationships. The interface design, which foregrounds profile photos and backgrounds textual self-descriptions, was perceived to structure the sequence of browsing and screening in favor of physical appearance and users seeking casual hook-ups. The findings suggest that the temporality of browsing and exchange on apps is incongruous with the temporal norms prescribing formation of friendship and long-term romance. Such incongruity affects the perceived quality and satisfaction of app use, frustrating users who seek more durable relationships. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "entities better our lives invariably likens itself to the familiar axiom that new technologies will resolve old problems. De Vries analyzes four attributes ascribed to wireless technologies: ubiquitous connectivity, fluid sociability, real-time relief of anxiety, and omniscience and collectiveness through ever-present knowledge. These characteristics are explored as a means of uncovering the false presence of progress and utopian ideals in the current technological landscape (p. 126). A minor limitation of the text can be seen in its conclusion with the brief discussion of mobile device improvements and utopian ideals, through the introduction of location awareness capabilities and the creation of the Internet of Things (p. 157). Rather than exploring the importance of communication noise filtration by the work of social actors, de Vries ascribes agency to these devices, “embedding the means to solve problems in the things around us” (p. 162). These inclinations serve to alter de Vries’s fairly neutral standpoint to one that may be perceived as deterministic. Tantalisingly Close is an ambitious and intricate illustration of scholarship that challenges modern idealistic notions of mobile communication. De Vries transcends his objectives throughout the text, and establishes a convincing and thought-provoking argument for dissecting the intersections of communication utopia and new mobile media. The text provides the reader with both a germane analysis and a standard from which to diagnostically evaluate widely disseminated conceptions of both communication and mobile media theory.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Martini Effect refers to being constantly connected to people through mobile devices; research into mobile phone use reports that its use may be related to feelings of connectedness. Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are becoming increasingly popular among early adolescents with the majority using them to stay in contact with existing friends. In addition, many adolescents use a range of mobile devices to access these sites. The present study compared feelings of belonging to the friendship group between SNS users who used a mobile device and those who did not. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 337 early adolescent SNS users (11–13 years, mean age = 12.28 years, SD = 0.73). Mobile device users were found to have significantly higher levels of belonging than non-mobile device users and this relationship was partially mediated by the frequency of use of SNSs. It is suggested that these mobile devices not only afford an opportunity for increased use of SNSs and therefore increased interaction with friends but that mobile device SNS users feel constantly connected to their friends. </jats:p>",

Heeding cautions from Boase (2013) concerning software variability across mobile technologies, as well as challenges from Ørmen and Thorhauge (2015) to use log data for qualitative research, our study offers one such methodological roadmap for observing—from the software side—the complex entanglements of humans and mobile technologies as they engage in mediated discourse. Our study draws upon keystroke analysis from the tradition of writing process research (Leijten &amp; van Waes, 2013; Wengelin, 2006), as well as posthumanist methodologies for observing cybernetic interactions (Giddings, 2014), and extends Farman’s (2012) argument that asynchronous forms of mobile communication, such as text messaging, are performatively synchronous, since interlocutors are pulled toward embodied copresence via the mediated space. In doing so, we present a preliminary study of methods for directly observing how discursive processes manifest in-the-moment as a complex flow between human, machinic, and spatial components in a network assemblage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile locative games consist of a subset of mobile games that encourage players to go outside, by promoting outdoor activities and physical meetings. Because of this, their gameplay breaks the core of social distancing strategies implemented since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, developers implemented changes in their locative games supported by the mobile game revenue model, which enabled a strategy called “playing remotely” that encourages the players to spend their money with microtransactions. This study analyses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in mobile locative gaming, by examining the preferences and behavior of players from the Northeast Brazil, a region with socioeconomic inequalities and urban violence, among other issues that shape mobility practices. </jats:p><jats:p> Accordingly, we pose a research question: how do players living in Northeast Brazil manage the mobile game revenue model for playing remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic? With this in mind, we have conducted an online survey among communities of players located in Northeast Brazil, by sharing a questionnaire with 21 questions. Seventy-four players from the region responded to our survey. The sample's age was from 16 to 58 years old, and they lived in seven of the nine states that form Northeast Brazil. We have found that players’ preference is to invest their time in gathering resources by playing the game, instead of spending their money in microtransactions for playing remotely. Moreover, we have found that mobile communication plays a significant role in keeping players in touch during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing players to expand their networks to other cities and countries. We have concluded that playing remotely represents an important strategy to support the development of locative games and other location-based applications, which can help us to prepare for the next pandemic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Our study examines attachment-related differences in the use of dating applications (dating apps). We collected online survey data regarding people’s attachment orientation and dating app preferences. People with a more anxious attachment orientation were more likely to report using dating apps than people lower in anxious attachment; people with a more avoidant attachment orientation were less likely to report using dating apps than people lower in avoidant attachment. Participants who used dating apps cited Tinder, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish as those most commonly used. The most common reason people reported for using apps was to meet others, and the most common reason people reported for not using apps was difficulty trusting people online. Our findings suggest that individual differences in attachment may be relevant for understanding online behavior, and that dating apps might be a fruitful avenue for future research on attachment-related differences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Balancing everyday tasks with the expectations of others regarding one's availability via smartphone is a challenge, especially for mothers. This research replicated and further developed studies by Halfmann and colleagues in 2021 and 2024 that yielded contradictory results regarding the conditions of feelings of guilt about (not) using the smartphone. More specifically, we investigated how smartphone-related goal conflict, the availability norm, and the parental phone use norm are related to mothers’ feelings of guilt when completing non-stressful everyday tasks. In addition, we researched how smartphone-related goal conflict and guilt are linked with experiences of recovery and task accomplishment. Results from a preregistered experience sampling study among 227 mothers of young children were largely in line with our hypotheses. They revealed, among others, that frequent smartphone use was more strongly linked with guilt when mothers perceived high goal conflict. If the availability norm was salient, little smartphone use was associated with more guilt. The results also indicated that the availability norm partly legitimized frequent smartphone use despite goal conflict. Nevertheless, overall, the findings suggest that mothers tend to experience low levels of guilt about their smartphone usage behavior and that these feelings do not impair the recovery from tasks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Having a mobile device continuously within an arm’s reach has changed everyday life. A retrospective glance shows that the mobile phone has enjoyed a broad diffusion around the globe during the 1990s and 2000s. This development has made possible mobile communication at any time and any place. Functioning as a tool for interpersonal communication—via voice calls and texting—it has become a taken-for-granted part of everyday life (Ling, 2012). Until recently the diffusion of mobile phones was twice as high as the diffusion of Internet access, but with mobile phones having become equipped with Internet functionality this gap is losing its relevance. Feature phones have increasingly been displaced by more and more smart mobile devices equipped with advanced hardware and software that facilitate not only communication but also the production and consumption of media. These personal and portable mobile devices provide ubiquitous connectedness through computer-like functionalities. Facilitated by developments of computing and hardware, they offer a touchscreen interface to a mobile ecosystem loaded with customized applications and responsive sites. Alongside these we also find that tablets have gained significance, offering largely similar affordances (although typically not traditional voice calls), but with slightly larger screen sizes. Situated betwixt smartphones and tablets one finds phablets offering affordances from each category that thus blurs the boundaries further. All of these mobile devices offer instant and personalized access to search engines, social networking sites, games, news, etcetera. Ultimately there has been a tremendous shift from mobile handsets designed primarily for communication toward more versatile media and communication functionalities. Legacy telecommunication equipment suppliers such as Ericsson, Nokia, and Motorola have struggled in making the shift, and have all suffered market share losses before being taken over by competitors. It is not only the telecommunications industry that has seen",

Informed by haptic media studies, the corporeal or sensory turn in contemporary theory, and phenomenology-informed mobile media studies, we examine the possible impacts for mobile device use of the risks of viral contagion associated with our routinized uses of haptic interfaces. We also examine the role and possibility of mobile haptics and the touchscreen in these contexts, and our capacity—via embodied and material metaphor—to extend corporeal reach through the mobile interface. Our contention is that, while the “stand in” for touch that mobile media offers may be perpetually incomplete, the “as-if” structure of habitual experience can play a significant role in narrowing the sensorial gap. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a growing body of literature on the demographic and socioeconomic distinctions between mobile-only and hybrid Internet users and how the two groups use the Internet differently. However, little is known about why people change their type of Internet access and the impact of this change. Relying on data from two waves of a nationally representative survey conducted in China, this study demonstrates that capital-enhancing Internet activities are positively correlated with the likelihood of switching from mobile-only access to hybrid access and negatively correlated with the likelihood of switching from hybrid access to mobile-only access. In addition, those who switch from mobile to hybrid access subsequently strengthen their capital-enhancing uses, thereby not only amplifying the divide between them and others who remain mobile-only but also creating a positive feedback loop. However, non-capital-enhancing uses, such as gaming, are irrelevant to changes in the type of access. It appears that mobile-only access has become a comparable substitute for computer-based Internet in terms of casual activities. However, for “serious” uses, a device divide still exists. </jats:p>",

Drawing from the concepts of deathlogging and datafication, we argue that an examination of media framing around wearables in criminal investigations and court rooms helps demonstrate how technologies become connected to different domains and practices. A discourse analysis of five case studies and 57 news stories showed how the framing of wearables in this context emphasized both enchantment with the capacity for datafication to witness, as well as contestation around how to define and interpret this witnessing. This study demonstrated how reporting around the incorporation of mobile media technologies into institutional practices often reproduced desires for digital technologies to provide access to “the truth” of social reality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> “Phubbing” (phone snubbing) refers to a set of behaviors where phone users focus on their mobile phone instead of interacting with their physically proximal companions. Building on existing understanding of problematic phone use, this study examined narcissism subtypes as predictors of phubbing behavior. Participants ( n = 250 smartphone users) completed an anonymous online study where they reported their phubbing behaviors and completed measures of vulnerable narcissism, grandiose narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. Analysis was via multiple regression, with vulnerable and grandiose narcissism as predictors; psychopathy and Machiavellianism were also included to account for shared variance with grandiose narcissism. As hypothesized, vulnerable narcissism emerged as a significant predictor in the model, such that higher levels of vulnerable narcissism were associated with more phubbing. In light of previously established negative social outcomes associated with phubbing behaviors, we conclude that although phubbing might help those high in vulnerable narcissism to manage their need for admiration and their contingent self-worth, phubbing may be particularly problematic for these individuals. </jats:p>",

This field has been establishing itself through a number of other initiatives as well, including conferences, symposiums, edited books, listservs, and centers for research. Despite this momentum, little attention has been given to defining – and justifying – the field itself. This essay begins by questioning whether there really is, or should be, a distinct field of study for research and theory on mobile media and communication. I then proceed to address this question by highlighting themes in the literature that illustrate how mobile communication is distinct from other forms of mediated communication and information exchange, with correspondingly distinctive social consequences. The essay argues that there are indeed justifiable reasons for treating mobile communication studies as a field. However, like the technology itself, this field is – or at least should be – highly integrated with research and theory of media and communication more broadly. </jats:p>",

Mobile media scholars may also be interested in Chapter 6 and the use of wax marked seals on letters. Similar to the read receipt functionality on smartphone messaging applications, the marked seal implicated both the sender and recipient’s experience of waiting by conferring authorship to the former, and the possibility to verify the content to the latter. However, a lack of signposting throughout the book makes it difficult to discern how each individual chapter contributes to the book’s overall thesis. Farman details each case study at length, drawing upon a mix of interviews, archival research, and his own experience of waiting. Less attention is paid to how each case study contributes towards or subverts normative conceptions of time and waiting. The writing is also more descriptive than analytical, meaning the reader is often left to draw their own conclusions. More detailed discussion about the attempts to commodify and control waiting in the context of mail scheduling apps such as Boomerang, or trends such as slow food, slow fashion, and slow media would have been welcome to more effectively address the economic and social appeal of waiting. As it stands, these issues only get cursory attention. Perhaps the major takeaway from Delayed Response is that the communicative aspects of waiting are amorphous and difficult to generalize.",

    "abstract": "In Chapter 2, an examination of 1.5 million Tweets related to the Egyptian social movement was undertaken. The results show how Twitter users connected on both informational and emotional levels, producing a common political narrative. News frames found in the posts were also presented. Chapter 3 analyzed nearly 300,000 tweets on the Occupy Wall Street movement. These results show a more fractured and inconsistent narrative. Those supporting the movement tended to lack a consistent call-to-action, and many dissenting viewpoints served to disrupt the cohesiveness of the movement. However, the connection that was displayed in drawing attention to the movement was seen as a strength. Lastly, Chapter 4 explored personal expression behavior via trending feed analysis. Content analysis of nearly 3,000 tweets related to trending hashtags showed that users construct their personal narratives in the form of play, often contravening societal norms of language use and self-disclosure rules. Users were likely to violate grammar rules, use profanity, and disclose highly personal information via Twitter in response to hashtag prompts. The main strengths lie in the conclusions of this book. In Chapter 5, Papacharissi outlines five propositions for interpreting this work with respect to affective publics, most notably the distinction between collective and connective action. These case studies illuminate the role of Twitter in bringing people together for a common cause, as well as differing results with respect to narrative cohesiveness and collective action. One weakness of the volume is with respect to Chapter 4. While it is illuminating to view three very different aspects of Twitter use, the personal narrative component seemed slightly discordant with the other two chapters. Although the argument is clearly made for developing personal narratives and representations of the self with respect to the political, the role of trending tweets vis-à-vis civic engagement (or dissent) is less convincing. Certainly Twitter offers a realm of self-expression that may go against social norms; however, it is not clear how social media norms may impact posting behavior. It may not be an act of civil disobedience to use foul language or disclose very personal information via social media insofar as those behaviors are part of the social norms that are common on social media. Despite this critique, the results are clearly presented and provide interesting implications with respect to personal Twitter use. Overall, this book offers a unique, rigorous, and well-rationalized argument for analyzing affect and microblogging. The case studies are methodologically innovative and provide a wealth of interesting results with respect to social movements, civic participation, and social media use. Certainly this book has the ability to spark future research for scholars across multiple disciplines.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on recent research conducted in Spain, this article analyses how mobile telephony contributes to (re)create and (re)mediate gender, couple intimacy, and privacy. We take a Goffmanian approach to analyse the utterances of disturb* ( to disturb, disturbing, disturbed) in interviews and focus groups on mobile phone uses and practices within heterosexual couples, showing how gendered ways of everyday management of intimate bonds and territories of the self contribute to the ordinary reconstitution of gender hierarchical differentiation. These gendered ways, in conjunction with mobile telephony possibilities and constraints, are producing the contextual norms and expectations which set the condition for privacy, or the lack of it, within current couple intimacies. </jats:p>",

Their accounts become memorialized accounts, which can be seen as a technique to translate disconnection into new linkages, in which the deceased is the factor that brings a minable public together. Disconnect is a fascinating read for all who are interested in the nitty-gritty of how SNS such as Facebook keep us hooked and lure data out of us, and for people who more generally are interested in disconnection and materialist/affect theory approaches to social media studies.",

    "abstract": "As a relatively young journal,Mobile Media & Communication (MMC) has become reputable and influential in the field of communication and technology research. While contemplating the questions provided by the editors of MMC concerning the 10th anniversary issue, I happened to read an article about the citation analysis of agendasetting research (Tai, 2009). Based on social network analysis, Tai analyzed the structure of the citation networks of the key literature (56 journal publications) in agenda-setting research. The analysis results showed how agenda-setting as a sub-field of mass communication and journalism research has developed and evolved over 10 years (1996–2005), referring to a few authoritative pieces. For further details of that analysis, please refer to the excellent article by Tai as this space is limited to discussing topics specifically relevant to our journal, MMC. I was inspired by Tai’s (2009) approach and intrigued about whatMMC’s citation networks would look like. Though I am aware that SAGE, the publisher, does its own citation analysis and posts updates on the journal website regarding the “Most cited” and “Most read” articles, those statistics involve citations and readership from outside the journal as well; thus, they cover a much wider range of authors and readers. For this article, I am interested in our internal conversations, particularly regarding the work",

This paper examines the domestication of smartphones by looking at how the way we use mobile applications affects our everyday routines. Data is collected through an innovative quantitative mixed-method approach, combining log data from smartphones and survey (perception) data. We find that there are dimensions of domestication that explain how the use of smartphones affects our daily routines. Contributions are stronger for downloaded applications than for native applications. Especially applications that require interaction with others, such as social media and instant messaging, have a serious impact on our day-to-day routines. As a result, appropriation is core in incorporating smartphones in daily life routines. However, frequency of use and the total number of minutes spent on a given type of application per day affect our everyday routines in different ways. This paper is the first quantitative domestication study that focuses on smartphones rather than feature phones. The theoretical contribution and practical implications are outlined. </jats:p>",

Building on existing research, a model is established that investigates this association through three mediators: parent–child conflict; companionship; and perceived emotional support. Data from a cross-sectional survey ( n = 742, 9–13 years, 50.9% girls, mean age =10.85, standard deviation = 0.73) supported most of the associations specified in our model. First, our findings demonstrate that preadolescents who perceived higher amounts of parent technoference also rated the relationship with their parents significantly higher in conflict, and lower in terms of perceived companionship. Moreover, maternal mobile device distraction was significantly associated with less emotional support. All but one of the indirect associations were found to be statistically significant, thus revealing a number of pathways through which technoference is related to preadolescents’ assessments of family satisfaction. </jats:p>",

In this study, we propose a variable-length measure called “session” to uncover the unmeasured temporal characteristics.

Little attention, however, has been devoted to its theoretical foundations. Drawing from youth culture theory and new (mobile) media theories, this article conceptually develops mobile youth culture by (a) describing the commonalities in adolescent mobile phone use that constitute the culture, and by (b) discussing the origins of these commonalities through an analysis of the network, the social and personal logics inherent in mobile communication technology, and the way these are appropriated by youths to accommodate their transition to adulthood. The article concludes by pointing out the shortcomings of the concept: The limited attention for the heterogeneity in adolescent media use, the integration of mobile media technologies into young people’s media repertoires, the cross-generational implications of mobile media use, and the impact of local context and culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile devices have permeated organizations creating diverse communication opportunities and new organizational challenges. This case study examines one of those challenges: creating a strategically ambiguous mobile device use policy to combat misuse in an organization. We use focus group data collection and a subsequent constant comparative analysis to examine a U.S. company with an organizational policy selectively restricting mobile device access for nonmanagerial workers. The findings and resulting theoretical model reflect the tension employees face when interpreting a restrictive mobile device use policy within the context of mobile use as “taken for granted.” This tension is manifest through four unintended consequences of the strategically ambiguous policy: (a) declining productivity, (b) supervisors burdened by overwhelming tasks, (c) decreased professional mobility, and (d) fleeting organizational identification. This research offers an organizational contribution to the current work on mobiles and it provides insight into how nonmanagerial workers interpret and act when a mobile use policy is strategically ambiguous. </jats:p>",

The study empirically investigated a sample of 90 smartphone users who completed 820 ESM protocols regarding their use of the messenger service WhatsApp. The results of the multilevel analyses revealed that users’ responsiveness in IM communication is affected by person- and situation-level factors, but the latter factors were found to have a much stronger impact.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates older adults’ perceptions of mobile phone use during face-to-face interactions and social gatherings. Data were derived from 9 semistructured focus group interviews. Study participants were older adult residents of Michigan, US ( N = 77). Focus groups were held in both urban and rural locations and our sample was heterogeneous in terms of race and socioeconomic status. Older adults in this study reported that the mobile phone behavior displayed by their younger family members during face-to-face interactions and family gatherings breaches their expectations regarding appropriate etiquette and manners. Specifically, participants reported they view mobile phone use during face-to-face interactions as disruptive to communication quality, offensive, and a potential signal of inattention, which may curtail intergenerational communication and hinder their sense of copresence. Limitations of our study and directions for future research are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the ways in which transnational city newcomers interact with locative technology to build knowledge about their urban surroundings. We conducted semistructured interviews with 25 transnational migrants recently relocated to the greater New York City area, investigating their day-to-day smartphone use, navigation tactics, and uses of location-based services. Our analysis reflects on three themes: tensions surrounding different navigation strategies (searching vs. browsing); social monitoring practices (awareness vs. surveillance); and perceptions of online information sources (credibility/trust vs. distrust). Together, these themes highlight the contradictory outcomes of technology use both facilitating and hindering the processes of urban learning. We conclude with a discussion of paradoxical outcomes of technological use as a means of unpacking the sociotechnical tensions that emerge from locative technology use among transnational migrants in new urban environments. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Tinder Games: Collective mobile dating app use and gender conforming behavior",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults, and, in contrast to mobile dating websites, they were designed to create a more game-like experience. While it is well documented that seeking entertainment is one core motivation for mobile dating app use, the social nature of entertainment has garnered less attention. Therefore, in this paper we draw on research on entertainment in dating apps and the socio-physical contexts of use to identify patterned behaviors of heterosexual users. To do this, we employed a qualitative multi-phase research approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest the fun of mobile dating is not just interacting with potential matches through the apps, but the use of the apps among one’s friends. These “dating games” are entertaining, but importantly mitigate potential social or physical risks of mobile dating. Unsurprisingly, notions of “play” across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly gendered practices surrounding mobile dating apps and different risks associated with such games. </jats:p>",

The smartphone features heavily throughout the book—not only is it a key device in the contemporary computing ecosystem, but also the most intimate and personal device that most of us own. Therefore, it’s more than a tool (for activities such as wayfaring and communication), but also serves as a trusted companion. As Halegoua suggests, it is primarily the smartphone that enables a habitual recontextualization in urban space at the individual and social level. In asking us to closely examine the subjective qualities of relationships between urban space, people and their devices, Halegoua is opening valuable space for critical and creative scholarly conversations on the future of urban space, mobility and mobile technologies, such as “spatial knowledge,” “urban navigation” and “geospatial empowerment” (p. 144).",

    "abstract": "The first part focuses on the theoretical and conceptual framing of the role of material and virtual dimensions of transport and communication technologies in mobilising communities. It elucidates how the entanglement of material and communicative infrastructures, political systems, and economic processes has shaped the formation of empires, nations, and regions in Europe. The second section unravels the various modes of entwined geographical and virtual mobilities, foregrounding Morley’s point that “online and offline realms are mutually constitutive” (p. 102). It also emphasises the need to take into consideration the continuities of media technologies in understanding the affordances and adoption of new media channels. The last section showcases the case studies or the “emblematic of our era” (p. 8), including the migrant, the mobile phone, and the container box. A common thread running through the case studies is the interlocking of virtual mobility and control. Drawing upon an extensive review of scholarly work on migration, transport studies, geography, media and communications, and mobilities, the book presents a balanced discussion of the double-edged impacts of virtual connectivity on sociality, subjectivity, community formation, and place making. As presented, virtual connections organise and connect the flows of goods, people, capitals, and information in a mobile society. Yet, they also stir asymmetries, ruptures, and exclusion. It is through this point that Morley highlights how place-based infrastructures and social structures often produce a layered and stratified mediated connection. As Morley notes, “pre-existing cultural logics serve to inform, amplify, and inflect the adoption and contemporary uses of these technologies” (p. 181). One of the salient features of the book is that it invites the readers to examine virtual connectivity beyond a EurAmcentric frame. In the first instance, Morley maps out some case studies to unearth how non-Western countries have adopted media and communications technologies. He then highlights the narratives and critical insights that can be obtained through a cross-cultural analysis of mediated communication in a local, transnational, and global sphere. Importantly, Morley encourages scholars and researchers to be more critical in creating metaphors to describe the conditions enabled by the use of media and communication technologies. This proposition is supported by deploying a nonmedia-centric and contextualist approach. In sum, this book delivers a rich and nuanced illumination of the impact of the inseparable material and virtual dimensions of media and communications in our contemporary world.",

Applying reflexive thematic analysis to 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with mothers of middle-school children, the study asks how mothers with different parenting styles describe their surveillance ideologies and practices, and what are the sociocultural imageries that motivate their use of location-tracking applications. The findings offer six criteria for evaluating different familial surveillance climates, organizing them in a three-tier model that demonstrates the multidimensionality of digital parental surveillance. Consequently, the study challenges the presumed link between parental surveillance and strict parenting styles (e.g., authoritarian, helicopter). Acknowledging the increasing normalization of digital parental surveillance, the study advances a balanced and pragmatic view of this trend while illuminating participatory methods of implementing what is often considered a suppressive practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research develops a model of mobile social network dispersion in rescue communication, and illustrates how people use a combination of mobile and social media, along with real-time communication, in their decision-making process. Guided by established research on smartphones, social media, and affordances, we used a qualitative approach and conducted field interviews that included photo-elicitation interview (PEI) techniques to examine participants’ private social media data. Our analysis of these rescue decisions reveals why so few people used the official 9-1-1 system. We show how rescue communication often occurs through a socially constructed assessment of risk that involves persuasion by trusted others in their network, regardless of professional qualifications. Furthermore, trusted others can function as proxies and can draw upon mobile social network affordances, helping to compensate for material limitations. The affordances people drew from can be organized into two sets: foundational and amplification. Hierarchical relationships exist among these sets of affordances, and materiality plays a pivotal role in rescue communication. Ultimately, our analysis uncovers the multimodality around people’s decisions to ask for help. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The problems of distracted driving and distracted pedestrian accidents have attracted the attention of public health officials, transportation and psychology researchers, and communication scholars. Though public safety campaigns intended to curb dangerous texting behaviors have been implemented, relatively little is known about the psychological processes involved in these behaviors. Our study integrates emerging research on automatic behavior, self-control, and mindfulness in an attempt to explain why many individuals believe that such behavior is dangerous but engage in it anyway. Our survey study ( N = 925) of college students ( n = 313) and adults ( n = 612) revealed that texting automaticity, trait self-control, and the “acting with awareness” facet of trait mindfulness were all uniquely predictive of texting while driving as well as texting while walking. Further, we observe that texting automaticity is more strongly related to the frequency of texting while walking than driving. Together, the findings synthesize disparate strands of research on cognition and media use and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing among types of consciousness to understanding mobile communication behavior. </jats:p>",

Interest in using IVR systems as a means to increase citizen participation in society has increased. Yet, research exploring the potential of IVRs—with particular affordances, constraints, and norms—to facilitate citizen participation in society remains limited. Drawing on field data gathered as part of a study of CGNet Swara, an IVR-based citizen journalism platform in rural India, we introduce the concept of a “participatory IVR” and undertake a phenomenological inquiry to account for user interactions with the system. </jats:p>",

The findings suggest that the app users felt empowered via self-tracking capacity and expressed community-level care and concerns, including those regarding the marginalized. At the same time, the users were raising doubts over technical effectiveness, navigating varying levels of voluntary choice available, and negotiating privacy concerns depending on the (dis)trust they held of institutional entities behind the governance of the apps. We argue that it is critical to investigate how surveillance technologies are situated across horizontal and vertical relationships in people's everyday lives to fully understand the individual and societal acceptance and/or refusal of the very systems during crises. </jats:p>",

Through the domestication framework and actor-network theory, findings showed a unique overlay of actors influencing acquisition and adoption of apps, including: dependent users, “warm-gatekeepers,” mobile phone shops, and Facebook. Mediators such as Android skins, language skills, and other factors (mobile data pricing and network infrastructure) impact the relationships between these actors. Together, the impact of mediators on actor relationships highlighted a filtered means many users adopted to acquire new apps, a “two-step access” model of acquisition. This article traces how users acquire apps given this network of actors, following their journey and how they overcome challenges and limitations in their social and technological landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws on the concept of “transportal home” to examine the intersection of mobile media, mobility, and place-making among homeless food delivery workers in the Shanghai lockdown. Shanghai's lockdown lasted from February 28 to May 31, 2022, and was one of the strictest in China, resulting in thousands of food delivery riders being locked out of their homes, treated as potential carriers of the virus, and forced to sleep on the streets until the lockdown was lifted. The article uses qualitative research methods to explore the COVID-related homelessness of food delivery riders during the lockdown, focusing on their media practices and highlighting their experiences and agency in using mobile media to negotiate their lives amid the (im)mobile mobility they faced. It argues that mobile phones, as a transportal home, can offer a technological imaginary of home out of “homelessness”; however, they also serve as a reminder of the constraints of such an imaginary, as these (temporarily) homeless food delivery riders continue to be subject to platform exploitation and pandemic surveillance. </jats:p>",

Based on findings from the Games of Mobile Australian Research Council Project, we present examples of how mobile devices bring about particular scenarios of Minecraft play within the household and family dynamics. These scenarios include renegotiating household spaces through acts of mobile Minecraft play, the development of physical gesture rituals through mobile touchscreen interactions, and the complex negotiations involved in shared device usage between different family members. We make the case that through these familial scenarios, the space of Minecraft can become an extension of the family home. These findings offer new insights into mobile-device-based engagement with Minecraft and provide a solid base of information for academic researchers and social policymakers seeking to understand the Minecraft and mobile phenomena. As mobile technology grows in ubiquity, mobile Minecraft becomes increasingly embedded in acts of play. We propose that Minecraft on mobile devices reshapes Australian perceptions of play, creativity, and family dynamics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the role of mobile news in democracy by examining individual-level variations in mobile election news use based on demographics, socioeconomic indicators, and mobile media activity breadth, and, in turn, how mobile news use is associated with political participation. Nationally representative data from a random-sample survey of American adults ( N = 2,250) in the 2010 general election were analyzed to better explain who mobile election news users are, how they compare to nonusers, and whether mobile news use was associated with voter turnout and mobile campaign donation. Findings underscore the significance of mobile media use and mobile news as phenomena of emerging importance in the election campaigns, and important differential patterns in the relationships of sociodemographics, mobile media, and electoral participation are discussed. By providing a nuanced accounting of the socioeconomic and demographic profile of mobile election news users and how those individuals differ from nonusers, this study enriches explanations of how societal privilege and the benefits of political engagement are related in complicated ways to individual-level variations in consuming and using mobile election news. Notably, for racial minorities, mobile media may provide a bridge across the digital-driven democratic divide and a more effective means of engaging with digital election information than other ICTs. Analysis also extends what is known about how citizens use mobile news to engage with increasingly personalized election campaigns. Results indicate that mobile election news use was a significant positive predictor of the odds of having voted and whether individuals used their mobile devices to make contributions during the campaign. These findings support arguments that the unique qualities of mobile devices are contributing to new and different pathways to political engagement while also retaining significance in relation to traditional forms of offline political participation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is concerned with a particular aspect of the relationship between media and mobility. The author draws attention to what he calls the “doubly digital” quality of contemporary media—pointing to the intimate connection between movements through media settings (such as online environments) and movements of the fingers or digits on keyboards, keypads, touch-screens, and so on. His main interest is in mobile, generative ways of the hand that is at home with communication technologies, and in opening up an investigation of media uses as manual activities. In exploring these mobile, generative ways, he also reflects on a range of other manual activities that are apparently unrelated to media use—venturing into the disciplines of philosophy, sociology, and anthropology to discuss phenomenological perspectives on practices of typing, organ and piano playing, and plank sawing. Out of his exploration emerges a focus on embodied, sensuous, practical knowing, and on matters of orientation and habitation (with the author advocating a distinctive nonrepresentational, non-media-centric approach for future studies of media use in everyday life). </jats:p>",

Yet, there is still a lack of research on mobile donation as a new venue of technology-mediated civic engagement. Using nationally representative survey data, this research examines the variations in mobile donation by mobile phone usage patterns and user characteristics such as age, race, and socioeconomic status. Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other. </jats:p>",

The constant availability of several, partially overlapping channels for communication (texting, calls, email, Facebook, etc.) requires that we adopt an integrated view of the various communicative affordances of mobile devices in order to understand how people choose between them for different purposes. It is argued that mobile communication makes intermediality especially central, as the choice of medium is detached from the location of stationary media and begins to follow the user across all contexts of daily life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous studies have examined the benefits and challenges of using mobile phones to support people experiencing homelessness. However, few studies have considered how mobile Wi-Fi hotspots support unhoused individuals and couples through public library lending programs. This paper seeks to address a gap in mobile communication scholarship by contributing insights from a qualitative study of library patrons who checked out mobile hotspots from the Boston Public Library in Massachusetts, USA. The findings show that although mobile hotspots provided many benefits for public library patrons in general, these devices facilitated mobile communication with a different sense of urgency for six people experiencing homelessness who also happened to be in romantic relationships. More concretely, the study found that mobile Wi-Fi hotspots reduced stress and anxiety for unhoused patrons because without the devices, patrons without fixed residences worried they could not be found; that hotspots kept unhoused patrons more connected, and therefore safer, in their tents despite the cold weather and a lack of electricity; and that unhoused patrons were concerned about their devices getting stolen because of their precarious situation. Although the unhoused patrons who participated in this study also shared their recommendations regarding how mobile hotspot lending programs in public libraries could be improved, they also mentioned that the benefits of hotspot availability far outweighed their challenges. The findings have implications for those working to address homelessness, including community-based organizations, government agencies, and policymakers who seek further insights into the positive role that mobile hotspot devices can play in supporting positive health outcomes for individuals and couples experiencing homelessness. </jats:p>",

The focus of this article is on the fluctuating fortunes of one U.S. company: Skyhook Wireless. The company was founded in 2003 with the explicit aim of exploring and developing systems that responded to a very specific communication infrastructure related challenge: how to calculate location positioning from Wi-Fi signals rather than from cellular towers or by using GPS? In this article, I detail the technical means by which they achieved this, and examine how the strength of Skyhook’s position in the field of location positioning and analysis became a key factor driving Google’s highly contentious Street View program for extracting and recording Wi-Fi access point and payload data. Through this analysis of Skyhook Wireless and its technical achievements, this article aims to contribute valuable new knowledge to our understanding of the location-related operations of mobile devices; the infrastructures associated with these operations; and the businesses that have emerged around, draw on, contribute to, and have come to dominate, these infrastructural systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study aims to explore effects of navigational augmented reality (AR) apps on the users’ perception of their surroundings, and to analyze in which ways these effects are enabled as well as limited by the performance of AR apps on currently available devices. To answer these questions, an exploratory quasi-experiment has been conducted, consisting of three groups of participants, each group differing in their method for obtaining location information as well as the frequency with which this information is consumed. Semistructured pre- and postexperiment interviews with participants, questionnaires that were filled out by the participants after every app usage, and expert interviews with navigational AR app developers are employed in combination with analyzing the effect of augmented reality on the user’s perception of space. Surprisingly, it was found that AR users actually became less aware of their surroundings than non-AR navigational app users. This is mainly due to the comparatively worse performance of AR apps on currently available smartphones: The overall quality regularly suffers from a cluttered and confusing presentation, leading to considerable amounts of time spent “deciphering” the layout and functionality of the presented results. Erratic result behavior, caused by frequent movement delays and unexpected lag of the virtual objects further decreases the quality of the overall experience. Finally, some initially unexpected issues related to the social acceptability of augmented reality app usage in public places were encountered during the experiment, which are explained by the physically very involved method of interacting with AR apps, namely having to point and hold the device into the direction information is being sought over. Nevertheless, augmented reality was found to have a number of distinct advantages over other navigational apps, namely the ability to improve the users’ understanding of proximity, directions, and spatial relations. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Migrant mothering and mobile phones: Negotiations of transnational identity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Transnational mothers working in foreign countries face the challenges of providing “intensive” mothering to their children from a distance, and risk being subject to the “deviancy” discourse of mothering. This paper investigates the role of mobile phone usage, via voice, text messages, and social networking sites, in dealing with the tensions and ambivalence arising from transnational mothering as a dialectical process. We surveyed 42 Filipina and Indonesian foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. FDWs addressed tensions arising out of societal expectations of motherhood and their own anxieties about children’s well-being. The reluctant obsessive struggled to maintain a balance between an intensive nurturing style and a deviant mode of mothering that respected the growing independence of the children. The diverted professional had to balance the financial empowerment of being the primary breadwinner with the risk of surrogate motherhood for the employer’s children subsuming the care provided to her own. The remote-control parent shared mothering responsibilities with caregivers, usually relatives, who acted as a contradictory proxy presence for intensive mothering. The incomplete union of stressed marital parenting put further pressure on the romantic and sexual identities of migrant women. Transnational mothers utilized mobile phones actively as a tool to negotiate and redefine identities and relationships that created fissures in their sense of self. These included the management of third-party relationships, withholding of emotions or information, and engaging in counterintuitive phenomenon such as restricting, or actively dis-engaging from, mobile phone usage as a communication strategy. The paper calls for future research into the multiple, and interacting, social identities assumed and managed by transnational mothers, and the complex role played by mobile phones in the constant process of negotiation by agentic, self-relective and multifaceted women. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigated the prevalence and antecedents of the so-called phantom phone sensations (PPS) phenomenon – the false perception that one’s cell phone is ringing, vibrating, or blinking. While previous studies have already addressed the impact of personality traits and cell phone usage patterns on the likelihood of experiencing phantom phone sensations, we were interested in additionally addressing the impact of situational context factors. An online questionnaire assessed especially cell phone usage patterns (e.g., frequency of cell phone usage), personality traits (e.g., Big Five, need for popularity), and contextual factors (e.g., awaiting a call, being in a noisy environment). Analyses ( N = 249; 137 female) revealed that the majority of participants (83.5%) have experienced phantom phone sensations. Multivariate analysis methods indicated that, in particular, contextual factors regarding the social situation (awaiting a call) along with cell phone usage patterns are predictive for the experience of phantom phone sensations. Moreover, age was also found to have a high predictive value. </jats:p>",

Changing mobile phone market conditions were associated with varying adoption levels, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita correlated with percent adoption except during the global economic crisis. </jats:p>",

In general, phubbing can negatively affect interpersonal relationships and well-being. When younger family members’ phubbing behavior is perceived by older adult relatives as a violation of their conversational expectations, these older adults may feel ignored and disrespected. This study may be the first to investigate the associations between intergenerational family phubbing expectancy violations and indicators of well-being among older adults. Survey data were derived from a sample of U.S. Internet users aged 65 or above ( n = 679). The results suggested that both perceived frequency of family phubbing and family phubbing expectancy violations were inversely associated with mattering and indicators of well-being. Study limitations and potential directions for future research are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the roles that smartphones play as young people living in low-income communities navigate everyday activities, including those of online civic engagement. Drawing on ethnographic data collected during the COVID-19 lockdown, we offer empirical and methodological support for Hartmann’s concept of mediated mobilism, highlighting smartphone-related frictions and tensions that emerge at the intersections of social and political mobilities and immobilities. Specifically, our data demonstrate that as smartphones kept young people on call for parents, caregivers, siblings and others who might need them to help negotiate the heightened demands that characterized family life during the pandemic, young people found themselves in situations that we term tethered compliance, torn between the desire to participate in online civic engagement and political mobilization and the need to fulfill various exigencies of family life that emerged as a result of physical and social immobilities. Whereas scholars previously argued that mobile media held promise for mitigating structural inequality and enhancing youth online civic engagement, our findings suggest that these technologies are instead adding a new layer to be managed. </jats:p>",

Acknowledging that contemporary markets for mobile communication are increasingly datafied, this article maps and discusses how infrastructures for mobile datafication are controlled. It combines perspectives from critical data studies, political economy of communication, and app studies in an empirical analysis of the 500 most downloaded apps in the Google Play store (November 2020). Focusing on control over and ownership in the three interdependent markets for apps, data accesses, and third-party services, the analysis documents, confirms, and explains established power structures and sheds light on the mobile datafication processes that frame the use of apps and commodification of users. As such, it provides an empirical baseline for future monitoring, and ultimately regulation, of mobile app ecosystems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "emphasizing how China’s tech industries have rapidly shifted from emulation to innovation (p. 111). The authors’ attempts at defining the sort of “mega-platform” that WeChat has grown into are a promising starting point, but fall short of engaging with existing platform studies describing the centralization of apps and their transformation into gateways or constellations. Similarly, the historical overview of WeChat’s success downplays the role of protectionist measures locking competing international services (i.e., Facebook, LINE) outside of the Chinese market, earmarking them as unspecified “political climates” (p. 43). Lastly, given the increasingly troubling insights about the Chinese authorities’ reach into messages and content exchanged through WeChat, the authors’ optimistic encouragement to migrant workers, journalists, and activists to “develop alliances and push for change, through WeChat or by using it as an integral part of multi-modal media strategy” (p. 101) seems to be a somewhat dangerous suggestion. Accessible and brimming with pointers for future research, Super-Sticky WeChat is a comprehensive introduction to the popular Chinese app suitable for both scholars and general audiences.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research has reported negative consequences, such as increased anxiety, associated with restricting people’s access to their mobile phones. These findings have led researchers to suggest that mobile phone use may pose a legitimately addictive behavior for some people. Other research has suggested negative effects of mobile phones on academic outcomes. To study the effects of phone separation on both anxiety and attainment of academic study goals, we randomly assigned participants ( N = 93) to a restricted mobile phone access condition or a control condition. After setting a list of goals for a study session, participants worked on their own, self-chosen class materials for 60 minutes. Anxiety was measured before and immediately following the study session. Attainment of study goals was assessed through a self-report estimate of the percent of study goals accomplished at the end of the session. We predicted that those who classified as high on a problematic mobile phone use scale and who had their phones taken away would show the greatest increases in anxiety over the session as well as the greatest deficits in attainment of study goals as compared to all other participants. While there was a general tendency for participants who scored higher on the problematic use scale to be more anxious, anxiety did not differ between participants with phone access and those without it. Participants without phone access self-reported attainment of 12% more of their study goals than those who had phones. This study qualified the conditions for which restricting mobile phone access increases anxiety and provided further empirical support for detriments to attainment of study goals when mobile phones are present. </jats:p>",

Based on the uses and gratification approach and self-determination theory, we aimed to identify gender-specific gratifications and determinants of fitness app usage in combination with fitness-related Facebook groups. Results of an online survey ( N = 171) and of a mobile experience sampling method ( N = 31) revealed that the app Runtastic was primarily used for achieving goals and to improve enjoyment for physical activity, with men and older participants sharing results with others in Facebook groups more often than women and younger participants.

The results showed significant discrepancies between self-reported and behavioral mobile phone use, particularly for the number and duration of mobile calls. Light users tended to overestimate, while heavy users tended to underestimate their mobile phone use. Females were more likely to underestimate their weekly number of calls. Younger adults were more accurate in reporting their weekly number of calls, but less accurate in reporting their weekly number of text messages. The discussion devotes particular attention to potential question wording effects that are likely to have influenced the results. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing convergence of mobile and social media is highly transformational because it is shifting the dominant form of digital communication from bilateral towards mobile and networked communication among distributed interactants. This paper explores the affordances and constraints of this dynamics for global health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, research and practice have focused on one- or two-way communication designs and on approaches that position health workers as passive actors. To extend current views, three domains of mobile social media usage are theorized: (a) sociocognitive learning; (b) Sociocultural professional participation; and (c) Concertive peer and multistakeholder control. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with empirical examples from a nonsystematic literature review to account for the wide and interdisciplinary problem space. In the second part of this analysis, suggestions are discussed regarding how to anchor and facilitate mobile social media spaces within existing institutional structures. Finally, this paper argues that leveraging the affordances of mobile social-media-based communication requires the consideration of several constraints and challenges, including the economics of participation, privacy and surveillance, regulation and information quality, equal sociocultural participation, and technical competencies and professionalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although access to water and sanitation have been recognized by the United Nations as human rights since 2010, that access continues to be a site of struggle in everyday life, especially among homeless populations. In this paper, we draw from two summers of a fieldwork-based course on homelessness and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene in Denver, Colorado to consider whether a Google Map of public restrooms in the city might be useful for unhoused people. The paper's conceptual framework stems from Hartmann's idea of “homing”—which refers to how digital media can help unhoused people create everyday routines, exercise some control over their lives and spaces, and gradually create a safe environment—to consider whether the Google Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene Map might help unhoused people integrate bathroom access into routines, rounding out the so-called “mobile home” to provide relief and personal agency. The effort runs up against digital literacy issues that mitigate “access” and point to the limits of techno-solutions. This paper points to the need to consider both media literacies and inclusive design in creating digital solutions to address issues faced by unhoused people. We also argue that planners should think holistically about how digital and telecom-focused “solutions” relate to other necessary infrastructures—in this case, public toilets and water access. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Welcome toMobile Media & Communication’s second decade! It is indeed rewarding to see that the journal has moved through its early teething years (and its adolescence) and is now a well-established venue for scholars working in the area of mobile communication studies. With this introductory article, we would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our colleagues who have made contributions to the success of Mobile Media & Communication. Indeed, it is gratifying to have seen the trajectory of the journal. We wish to recognize the authors who have contributed their work through the years, and, not the least, we recognize the reviewers who have contributed their time to critically read the articles that have been submitted. We would also like to thank the people at SAGE who have helped us navigate the shoals of founding and nurturing the journal. During the past decade, something more than 250 articles have been published (based on over 1,350 submissions). These have been both general submissions and submissions to special issues on a variety of sub-topics. A result of all this work is that the journal has become indexed. Indeed, as of this writing,Mobile Media & Communication has a 2-year impact factor of 3.9, positioning it among the 25 most cited communication journals.",

Facebook hails a mobile mediated self who is constrained even when not interfacing with the platform. Though Marichal deftly incorporates the insights of Continental philosophers on the nature of public life, he could have further developed the Heideggerian notion of the selfto-come that he hints at in his introduction. The notion that we should reveal ourselves as emerging possibilities for “future being” (p. 69) is an important one for understanding a mobile, multitudinous notion of self. Marichal suggests that Facebook can support the expression of such a notion of self, though he does not indicate how such mobility can co-exist within its rather rigid choice architecture. Regardless, Marichal’s book is important and makes a significant contribution to the field of mobile media and politics. 2013",

    "abstract": "In the case of topics close to my research agenda, there has been over the past years a significant shift in the theoretical understanding of the way people use and integrate mobile communication into their daily lives. Compared to a decade ago and earlier, theories of media no longer construe a sharp divide between mobile and other forms of communication, or between online and offcommunication. The distinction between digital/ mobile and real life has been largely erased. This is partly due to a change in technologies of digital communication and what might be called the mobile pivot. An illustration of this conceptual step forward may be seen in the breakdown of formerly rigid boundaries between mobile communication and other forms of communication, especially between the field of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and that of mobile communication. Newer theoretical paradigms, such as that advocated by Scott W. Campbell (2019); Scott Campbell (2020), see the inter-mixing of mobile communication processes increasingly erasing boundaries between the two fields. This erasure has implications for the field of mobile communication both internally and externally. Internally, the scope of what can be legitimately considered as a topic of interest within the ambit of mobile communication has been expanded. Externally, the field boundaries of other disciplines have expanded into the mobile communication domain; this benefits the mobile communication field by having new cadres of researchers engaged with its issues. Fresh ideas and cohorts of new researchers are now contributing",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A mobile contingency model is introduced and used to guide hypotheses about how the strength of people’s habits for using an incumbent medium (here, print newspapers), their degree of adoption of a newer medium (mobile devices), and their attitudes about the importance of professional news sources, influence their use of mobile devices for communication functions including entertainment, interpersonal communication, following news, financial transactions, and e-commerce. Secondary analysis of a 2012 U.S. national phone survey is employed. Older respondents use mobile devices less for all functions, including following news, tend to be loyal print subscribers, and highly agree that it is important for news to be produced by professional news sources. However, when the effect of age is controlled, higher levels of education, and to a lesser extent, income, still significantly predict agreement about the importance of professional news sources. The results demonstrate the crucial impact of news attitudes, and are largely supportive of the mobile contingency model. The most important practical implication is that newspaper companies should be targeting their mobile applications not to their subscribers, but rather to nonsubscribers who have adopted mobile devices, are highly educated, and have higher incomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Phubbing (i.e., snubbing someone in face-to-face interactions by focusing on one's phone instead of those present) has increased enormously in recent years and has become a widespread usage phenomenon that is associated with negative consequences, for instance for relationships and friendships. To better understand the predictors of phubbing behavior, the present paper provides a systematic overview of the growing research field. Based on a meta-analytic review of 79 studies and 526 effect sizes, we identified 10 higher-level predictor categories of phubbing behavior: sociodemographics, personality, technology-related norms &amp; experiences, technical equipment, (smart)phone &amp; Internet use, problematic use, well-being, psychopathology, and resilience as well as risk factors. The results of the three-level meta-analysis models indicated that the strongest predictors were problematic use patterns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Benefiting from the smartphone turn in wireless telecommunication, studies about mobile telephony have continued to grow in the 3/4G era. To explore the growth trends in the 3/4G era, and what and how mobile media are studied, the present study analyzes patterns and trends of mobile communication research in 512 articles published in 15 top-ranked communication journals from 2006 to 2020. Findings indicate that mobile communication research has grown into a distinctive subfield or sub-discipline, defined by four main characteristics. First, the scope of mobile communication research is broader than studies of mobile media alone. Second, mobile media as global technologies have attracted international authors, although global scholarship is uneven. Third, the boundary of mobile communication has expanded from social, economic, and cultural perspectives to those of health, education, and tourism. Fourth, although mobile communication research is increasingly theory-informed, building distinctive theories about mobile communication remains a challenge for future growth. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous phenomenon on public transport. However, little attention has been given to the effect of mobile communication on perceived security on public transport. This paper develops a model of social presence and perceived security in order to understand the widespread use of mobile phones on public transport as well as its effects. The first part of the model suggests a mediating role of social presence to understand how perceived security motivates mobile communication. The respective hypotheses are tested with a representative survey ( N = 2,267), and the results support the mediating role of social presence. The second part of the model assumes that social presence is not only a motive to use mobile communication but also helps to improve perceived security. Based on a 2-week mobile experience sampling with 86 participants and 1,264 measurement points, the effect of mobile communication and social presence obtained, as well as individual and situational factors on perceived security were tested. The respective hypotheses were partially supported but also suggest that other coping strategies might be of relevance to fully understand the relationship between mobile communication and situational perceived security. Besides the academic insights, these results suggest that public transport operators should consider expanding mobile phone coverage in their vehicles and stations to improve perceived security and make their services more attractive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores mobile phone use among people experiencing homelessness in downtown Los Angeles. It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept of access instability to capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> TikTok is one of the most popular apps. TikTok's endless stream of content, the lack time stamps or notifications of ever being “all caught up,” and concealing the phone's clock make it easy to lose track of time on TikTok. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how TikTok use may therefore interfere with our circadian rhythms, particularly our sleep hygiene. By focusing on pre-sleep cognitive arousal, this study aimed to close this knowledge gap by investigating the association between automatic TikTok use and daytime fatigue. We also investigated how individual preferences for sensation seeking and delayed gratification moderated this relationship. Within a sample of 1,050 TikTok/Douyin users in China, automatic TikTok use was associated with increased daytime fatigue that was mediated by higher levels of cognitive arousal before sleep. This relationship was aggravated by a preference for sensation seeking, and attenuated by a preference for delayed gratification. Above and beyond these early empirical insights, we also provide an early explanatory framework that is meant to systematize both existing and future knowledge about the use of TikTok. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphones have become one of the most frequently used devices for accessing the Internet. Although a growing body of research has examined the second-level digital divide with a focus on general Internet and digital media use, little is known about patterns of smartphone use and smartphone-related skills in the general population. This paper examines inequalities in the use of smartphone technology based on two nationally representative samples of smartphone owners collected in Germany in 2017 and 2020. We identify six distinct types of smartphone users by conducting latent class analyses that classify individuals based on their frequency of smartphone use, self-rated smartphone skills, and activities carried out on their smartphone. Smartphone use differs significantly by sociodemographic characteristics and operating system. The types reflecting more frequent and diverse smartphone use are younger, have higher levels of educational attainment, and are more likely to use an iPhone. Overall, the composition of the latent classes and their characteristics are robust across samples. </jats:p>",

The results indicated a positive relationship between the intensity of adolescents’ mobile phone use and parent-adolescent conflict about mobile phone use. Parental demandingness was related to more conflict, whereas parental responsiveness was related to less conflict. Moreover, moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between the intensity of adolescents’ mobile phone use and parent-adolescent conflict varied based upon the degree of parental demandingness and parental responsiveness. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on associations between parenting style and parent-adolescent conflict. Findings from this study provide parents with knowledge to reduce conflict with their children regarding mobile phone use. </jats:p>",

Faced with the challenge from streaming music, many broadcast radio stations have launched their own mobile apps to compete with the new audio services such as Spotify. Guided by the uses and gratifications conceptual framework, this study employed a national survey to investigate millennials’ perceptions of the substitutability and complementarity of broadcast radio, its apps, and music streaming services. The results showed that while radio listeners perceived broadcast radio and its apps as similar products, they regarded music streaming services as distinct from the two. In addition, this study examined motivators behind the diverse perceptions and identified information, escapism, entertainment, and socialization as important. The results suggest that radio stations should take advantage of the mobile technology and offer unique values through their apps, rather than duplicate the offline consumption experience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we examine how second-generation locative media and emerging contemporary camera phone practices are becoming entangled to create new visualities and socialities of place and place making. With location-based services (LBS) smartphone apps like Instagram geotagging is increasingly the default, rather than choice. This has transformed both how we experience and conceptualize co-present relationships across micro and macro realms and how we chart these relationships and environments as we move through the everyday world. Through a preliminary study of 10 users of smartphones in urban Australia we explore their daily routines and how camera phone and LBS practices become part of those everyday repetitions. In 2013, Australia mobile Internet subscriptions have now reached 22.1 million: basically one subscription for every person in the country. To understand these new everyday visualities we develop the notion of the “digital wayfarer” as a way to think about the perpetually moving mobile media user. Expanding upon Tim Ingold’s notion of the wayfaring type of mobility that is both routine and repetitive (i.e., “transport”) in the realm of the digital interwoven within the everyday, we reflect upon the digital wayfarer as they move through taking and sharing pictures and their tagged geographic and temporal contexts as part of broader emplaced and interwoven visualities and socialities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a very short period of time, mobile telephony, tablets, and other hand-held devices swept the world. The world’s first cellular network was created in 1977, but the mobile phone has made history as one of the fastest diffusing communication technologies, reaching nearly six billion subscribers by 2011. The time is right to define mobile media in an effort to better understand mobile communication technologies and their broad implications for the fundamental meanings of media, communication, community, social institutions, and especially society. In this article, I argue that the advent of mobile telephony as a wireless telecommunication system and portable platform for human communication has seemingly transformed the classical definition of mass communication. In fact, mobile media-supported communication, such as mobile news and mobile tweets, has accelerated what communication scholars have described as “the end of mass communication.” The article ends with a call for a holistic view of mobile communication research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article rethinks digitally mediated family, contending that WeChat facilitates the integration of digitally mediated Chinese family units and family practices into an entire system within traditional patterns. WeChat can serve as the hub for this kind of family mediation, since it is the dominant mega-platform in the smartphone-based Chinese polymedia environment, possessing superior technological convergence and sociocultural affordances. Based on qualitative data from 48 Chinese internal migrants, this article characterizes the entire system of the traditional Chinese family mediated by WeChat. First, the static Chinese family units converged on WeChat inherit spatial and hierarchical structures from the traditional models. Second, individuals’ WeChat usage for dynamic family practices is guided by Chinese family ethics, particularly those related to intergenerational and gendered ethics. Lastly, intimacy practices within Chinese families are digitally mediated to maintain ethically guided features in the Chinese style. This article emphasizes the role of polymedia-mediated ambient co-presence in activating implicit Chinese-style intimacy practices in the digital family spheres. Overall, when Chinese people log in to WeChat, they experience a return to traditional Chinese families, playing roles that contribute to the continuity of the entire traditional Chinese family system. This article suggests that the digitally mediated traditional family system ensures family stability in a highly modernized society where population mobility has become normalized. </jats:p>",

Interviews with low-income, urban U.S. residents reveal that cell phones are an asset for psychological reassurance, crime prevention, and critical access to emergency help. At the same time findings reveal that these residents often have broken and disconnected cell phones that require constant upkeep, or technology maintenance. Reliance on second-hand, government, and no-contract phones ease cell phone ownership but also normalize intermittent disconnection leading to dependably instability. These findings demonstrate the extreme value of cell phone access for residents of poor neighborhoods, and at the same time indicate that disparities in cell phone access still persist and may be worsening. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the use of smartphones for instrumental information access and use among Danish youth. Based on 31 individual semistructured interviews with Danish high school students and a grounded theory approach, it finds that instrumental use of information on smartphones has become an integrated and relied on part of everyday lives of these young Danes. Near-ubiquitous access to information is found to have consequences at both individual and social levels. Individually, users are able to look up information irrespective of the time and place and respond and adapt to this information in a rapid and flexible manner: a process the article refers to as “flexible alignment.” Further, near-ubiquitous access to information may lead to a more flexible orientation among users, who come to depend on just-in-time (rather than ahead-of-time) access to information in dealing with the contingencies of everyday life. Socially, the article finds that users may become increasingly autonomous vis-à-vis the network of social contacts, as mobile access to information is no longer exclusively available through mediated person-to-person communication but can be accessed individually as well. </jats:p>",

Using a case study of Hong Kong lesbian app Butterfly, I explicate how and why users cosituate on and off the app within their context. By analyzing digital ethnography and offline interviews data, I argue that Butterfly provides a mobile communication infrastructure for users to meet their lesbian needs and desires of (in)visible self, relationships, and community. The spatiality and mobility of the app enable users to cosituate in (a) the online and offline public and private spaces, (b) the disclosure and concealment of lesbian identities, and (c) the individual lesbian fantasies and sociocultural, political, and religious contexts. However, users’ cosituation as tactical resistance to the heteronormative context does not come without a cost. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Gauntlett describe a study that involved participants drawing “cognitive maps” of their experiences of the city where they live, and then telling stories based on those maps. Similarly, Bunting looks at the stories that players overlay on the geographical locations they encounter as they play locative games, a process that brings the game story out of the virtual world and into the player’s physical world. Exploring a different type of connection, Wilken discusses how the narratives within the locative games of Blast Theory often encourage people to interact with strangers. Whereas Bunting’s discussion sees locative games as encouraging connections with place, Wilken argues that Blast Theory’s locative games encourage connections with people. Mobile and locative stories not only create connections between people and places, but also between people and memory, history, and community. For example, Galindo’s chapter discusses the narrative and locative strategies used in the September 11 Memorial and Museum App to convey the experience of a specific traumatic event. This touches on a number of issues, including one not directly addressed in the preceding chapters: the tension between storytelling and authenticity. Closing the collection, Marino explores the ways that mobile storytelling can help to surface stories that may not otherwise be told through a discussion of two Los Angeles-based projects, Voces Móviles (VozMob) and The LA Flood Project. These chapters clearly demonstrate how locative stories can help to build connections between people and the experiences of their communities, both past and present. The aforementioned chapters work well together, presenting a coherent narrative centered on the ways that mobile storytelling helps to create various types of connections. At other times, however, the relationship between chapters seems somewhat tenuous. For a collection focused on storytelling, The Mobile Story does not always tell a very strong story. While the collection hints at the potential for mobile and locative technologies to open up new possibilities for storytelling, it could benefit from the presence of a stronger editorial voice to highlight those possibilities.",

    "abstract": "Like much of Internet studies, the volume displays a Western bias, specifically towards the Anglosphere (with the exception of Veronika Tsankova’s chapter on sexualities in Turkey and Susanna Paasonen’s on online debates that proceed in Finnish). There is a need for a heightened global consciousness in Internet studies literature; for scholarly volumes that discuss networked life via a bias towards the Anglosphere to articulate some awareness of the limitations that bias sets on a holistic understanding of the historical continuities and ruptures suggested by various kinds of digitally equipped everyday life in all corners of the planet. Nevertheless, I came to this volume as a novice, with zero knowledge of affect theory, so my reading practice was less suggestive of a knowing and critical expert, and more of an inquisitive child visiting a new friend’s toy-filled bedroom. Jodi Dean’s essay, for example, is remarkable for her ability to evoke the shapes and rhythms of networks. After several readings, the image of networks as many-to-many grids began to ebb from my mind. In its place, a series of high velocity sushi trains appeared, laid out wonkily on uneven surfaces, and messily hemmed by unruly crowds who variously cooked, plated up, swapped, shifted, and ate at breakneck speed the contents of these trains. “It’s not like cinema, where people only have to show up,” she writes. “For communication networks to function at all . . . people have to use them, play with them, add to them, and extend them. Our participation does not subvert communicative capitalism. It drives it.” (p. 94). I surmise that for other novice students of the dynamics of agency and domination in everyday social networking, this volume could also be useful for inspiring new paths of thought, when other available scholarship feels either too steeped in broadcast logics, not attentive enough to the novelties of the digital everyday, or too celebratory of participatory culture to enable a critical analysis of the role social networks play in enabling/disrupting established patterns of capital accumulation. The volume would be well suited to graduate courses, and is a must-read for scholars who approach new media from a sociological or cultural studies perspective.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reports on the findings from a field study of mobile phone use among dyads in public. Replicating an originally published field study from 2005, this study highlights how mobile phones and use have changed in the last 15 years and demonstrates the ways that mobile phones are used to both detract and enhance social interactions. Drawing on the notions of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony, we identify behavioral responses to mobile phones and the use of mobile phones by others, which help to manage both face-to-face and mediated social expectations of responsiveness. Based on observational fieldwork and interviews, we identify specific behavioral categories that demonstrate how social vulnerability and ostracism due to mobile phone use may be mitigated through parallel or collective mobile phone use. We also expand the original concepts of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony to mediated crosstalk and notification hegemony to account for contemporary changes in the sociotechnical mobile landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Pokémon Go is a hugely popular hybrid reality game (HRG) that enables players to occupy a space that is simultaneously physical and digital. The general aim of Pokémon Go is to discover and then capture Pokémon. This article reports on an original research project designed to explore the impact of Pokémon Go on spatiality and sociability. The project was conducted between May 2017 and July 2017, using an online survey which received 375 responses from users of Pokémon Go geographically spread across the globe. Drawing on the concept of the “playeur” as an established approach to understanding the effects of locative play on spatiality and sociability, this research follows three lines of enquiry. First, the research examines whether the intermingling of play and ordinary life might encourage players to spend more time outside in public spaces, and how this mode of play is experienced. Second, the research explores whether the game mechanics of Pokémon Go might lead players to traverse their environment using modified routes, as well as to frequent new places. Third, the research examines whether the praxis of Pokémon Go might enable new forms of sociability to emerge that extend beyond earlier HRGs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Almost as soon as the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading throughout much of the world, conspiracies arose that blamed the virus on the deployment of fifth-generation cellular networks (5G) infrastructure. These conspiracies had significant consequences, including protests against 5G and the destruction of 5G infrastructure. This article uses a media genealogy approach to place the 5G/COVID-19 conspiracies within the long and recurring cycle of conspiracies focused on mobile infrastructure. Placed within that broader history, this article argues that the 5G/COVID-19 conspiracies should have been unsurprising, and these types of infrastructural conspiracies should be a more significant part of mobile media and communication (MMC) research because infrastructures are an often invisible, yet crucial, part of the mobile practices studied within MMC research. The article concludes by theorizing about why mobile infrastructures are such a frequent target for conspiracy theories and argues that researchers should begin planning now for combatting the conspiracies that will almost inevitably arise when the next generation of mobile infrastructure gets linked to fears about public health. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Historians have long warned us that any prediction about the future, including the future of communication technology, is a risky business. However, adoption of mobile telephony seems to be an exception. The predictions were wrong, just in a different way— worldwide adoption of mobile phones went much faster than expected rather than more slowly. It is now proverbial to characterize mobile phones and devices as the fastest-diffused technology in human history. In my essay for the inaugural issue of Mobile Media & Communication (Wei, 2013), I described mobile media spearheaded by the smartphone as coming of age with a big splash. By that I meant that widespread adoption and novel uses of mobile media were unlike any other media technology. Looking back, the splash became a tsunami. In 2021, mobile users worldwide topped seven billion, accounting for 91.54% of the world’s population. In fact, Earth has more mobile phones and devices than people.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we explore the day-to-day importance of digital media, specifically the use of mobile phones in the lives of migrant minors—also known as unaccompanied foreign minors—in juvenile residential centres. For this study, we employed a general ethnographic methodology and, in particular, a workshop based on different artistic techniques that encouraged the young people involved to become active participants, committed from the start in the generation of the material to be used for the analysis of their daily practices. This approach emerged from the recognition of the importance for these young people to feel included and connected. Migrant adolescents take refuge in their mobile devices to participate in the youth microculture, both locally and globally. In addition, they are able to access different social networks that allow them to play out the personas they wish to adopt. Finally, we recognise the importance of digital media in allowing them to maintain close and affective relationships with their relatives, fellow citizens, and communities in their country of origin. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of mobile communication technologies and their associated professional usage within the domestic (nonwork) sphere proves challenging to understand and to establish work–life balance. To understand the foundational decisions to incorporate technology (mobile devices) within our domestic time and space, this study explores how individuals use their mobile device for professional or work-oriented communication within the nonwork or domestic sphere. Using Domestication Theory as an important guide, the research explored how the border between the two domains (spheres) were managed. From 32 semi-structured interviews, this qualitative study uncovered 2 overarching themes: Control of Time and Influences. These themes provide understanding of the role mobile devices play in professional communication decisions, what control participants have, and how individuals manage work permeations into the domestic sphere. This research makes a theoretical contribution in the spirit of Clark’s Work/Family Border Theory. With the infusion of mobile devices, a model is proposed offering a fresh perspective of how borders are conceptualized in organizational and familial communication in this context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates young people living in a regional Australian town and explores the ways that they negotiate place-making using mobile media. Australia has been characterised as a country of vast distances, and young people living in rural and regional areas are at the centre of narratives that position digital technologies as enablers or disruptors. This paper puts such deterministic discourses aside to focus on the ways place is made by young people living outside the city according to their own perspectives and experiences. Focus groups with 62 participants aged 16–28 years pointed to many of those in-the-background place-making practices and signalled the near seamless way that making places was simultaneously done online as well as in material, face-to-face contexts. The forms of place made by the young people of this study comprised a range of elasticised neighbourhoods and public spaces that were materially anchored, though extended digitally through territorially embedded socialities and shared locational information. Regional geographies retained their meaning, though traditional constraints could be renegotiated to reflect youthful relationships with local place. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how people utilize WeChat, the most popular multi-purpose mobile app in China, to manage their everyday communication with different social ties. Since Granovetter popularized the idea of social ties by noting the strength of weak ties, a long list of studies has extended social ties theory by following the quantification tradition, for instance, quantitatively examining the different functionalities of strong and weak ties. However, many aspects of social ties cannot be easily quantified. In this vein, this study, being a qualitative network analysis, offers a communicative conception and categorization of social ties. It is based on data from 39 distinctive Chinese respondents, collected through an interview-diary-interview method. WeChat, being more than a social media app, affords new technologies (e.g., mobile payment and virtual red packets), enabling users to manage and maintain their social networks in new and alternative ways. The empirical findings suggest that Chinese respondents differentiate between strong, weak, and latent ties, and they articulate three communication strategies: managing availability, managing visibility, and managing reciprocal engagement. Based on the empirical evidence, this article discusses further implications with reference to the concepts of imagined audiences and commercialization of social relations. Moreover, this study contributes to social ties theory by providing empirical insights into its cultural specifications in the context of China, such as the emphasis on the principle of reciprocity in guanxi culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "prevention messages (e.g., “don’t walk alone at night,” p. 97). Hasinoff contends that the concerns surrounding online safety should be shifted from blaming individuals whose pictures are circulated without consent, to the predators who pressure the victims to sext or who violate their trust by distributing private pictures. In the second half of the book, Hasinoff recommends several alternatives for regulating sexting by proposing legal and policy reforms that are geared towards protecting privacy and requiring individuals to provide and acquire explicit consent in online sexual interactions. Obtaining explicit consent is comparable to the existing practice of having consumers review and sign privacy agreements, currently exercised by most corporate online content producers. Overall, Sexting Panic offers an alternative, critical perspective in the discussion on teens’ sexuality in relation to their mobile technology use. Hasinoff suggests that acknowledging teens’ agency and freedom of speech, including their expression of sexuality, would empower youth media users. This point of view reflects a more optimistic stance in grappling with the complexity of teen sexting. However, one might question how the idea of expanding teens’ agency and moving away from the assumption of biological immaturity would apply to nonconsensual sexting incidents where both the perpetrator and victim are teens. Similarly, there are other issues that might also involve teens’ digital and mobile technology use that have potential legal and policy implications, for example cyberbullying (see Ellis et al., 2012; Volk, Camilleri, Dane, & Marini, 2012, for reviews on teens’ risky behaviors from an evolutionary perspective). Besides contributing to the literature on feminist media studies, youth media participation and production, and digital communication policy, Sexting Panic also illuminates the necessity for media literacy initiatives that recognize teens’ power and agency as mobile media users. The book presents compelling arguments for media education that emphasizes respect for privacy and consensual interactions. Ultimately, promoting responsible technology use among youth might be a more beneficial route to take than giving in to moral panics.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study aims to update notions of how the practical elements of mobile communication (i.e., microcoordination and synchronization) alter the interconnectedness between places and mobilities. Based on ethnographic research on personal shoppers’ mobile purchasing practices between mainland China and Hong Kong (HK), this article argues that mobile communication, as a social practice, extends relational places in cross-border shopping, on the one hand, and transforms the performances of mobilities that are used to anchor the spatial identities of shoppers and localities for consumption, on the other. Shoppers’ mobile communication practices create variable interactions between mobilities and places, manifested as mobile communicating place and place-inscribed communicative mobilities. The consumer cultures of HK personal shopping are anchored by the multiplicity of places and shifting mobilities of people, data, and objects. Mobile communication in/of HK is a medium through which people from the mainland can consume the symbolic space and “localness” of HK, embodying the “spatial selves” of personal shoppers through digital expressions of mobilities. Shoppers produce place-inscribed communicative mobilities of themselves and of commodities in HK through differing synchronization and coordination patterns in two places (Tsim Sha Tsui and Sheung Shui), based on the fact that the former is an international and local-brand tourist center and the latter has risen as a new “parallel trading hub” for cross-border consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on mHealth apps provides mixed evidence regarding their effectiveness for behavior change, including physical activity. Synthesizing prior perspectives, we test predictors of tracking app and physical activity intentions (Study 1; n = 658) and their links to everyday mobility (Study 2; n = 418; n = 27,617,440 observations). Study 1 showed that individuals have overlapping perceptions of tracking apps and physical activity. Taking a naturalistic mobile sensing approach, Study 2 found that tracking app and physical activity intentions predicted self-reported physical activity – but not logged movement (i.e., walking, cycling, or running). Tracking app use was not related to the level of logged movement in daily life. However, participants who regularly used tracking apps were more likely to view them as impactful, suggesting that daily mHealth app use is related to perceived (vs. observed) behavior change. Together, our studies illuminate how perceptions of mobility and mobile media – and their effects – can become intertwined in users’ minds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Academic publishing is under increasing scrutiny for its role in reproducing gender inequality among academics (Lundine et al., 2019) and other inequalities related to such differences as authors ’ ethnicity and geographic context (Collyer, 2018). Not only are scholarly publications a critical success factor at various stages of the academic career (Winslow & Davis, 2016), but they also constitute the very corpus of our knowl-edge, which may therefore directly suffer from given biases. This reality imposes a responsibility on the institutions and individuals involved in producing and selecting academic publications to re ﬂ ect on their part in perpetuating or countering existing inequalities. Beyond public academic discussions (e.g., #CommunicationSoWhite), such introspection within the ﬁ eld of communication research has been realized through investigations into the differential representations of genders (e.g., Trepte & Loths, 2020) and geographic contexts (e.g., Demeter, 2019) in scholarly publications. The need for such investigations has further gained urgency through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic since disasters generally tend to increase existing cleavages (Bolin & Kurtz, 2018; Ward & Shively, 2017). Institutions and individuals have indeed reacted to the situation by producing rich evidence, from individual ﬁ rst-hand accounts of scholars ’ personal experiences, shared through social media or elaborated into auto-ethnographic studies, to analyses of massive data that was publicly available.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphones are increasingly used to advance mobile media methods. The devices’ capabilities to automatically log behavioural data as well as the integration of this log data into qualitative interviews for elicitation purposes promise increased validity. The paper argues that despite recent efforts in mixed methods, the methodological potential of the personalized user interfaces of smartphones has been overlooked. As these smartphone interfaces are the result of continuous personalization processes, they can be seen as snapshots of the phone’s current use. Thus, this form of data should have strong explanatory powers for understanding the related mobile media practices. The paper discusses the implications of this interface-based approach with two example studies where smartphone interfaces were integrated into qualitative interviews. It concludes that the approach is a useful addition to existing mobile media methods and enforces the notion that researchers need to discover new forms of data. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Predicting the next decade of mobile communication studies research: More mobile media, fewer mobile phones",
    "abstract": "The growth of Mobile Media & Communication (MMC) in the journal’s first decade has been both remarkable and somewhat understandable. On the one hand, the journal—and mobile communication studies (MCS) as a field more generally—have made amazing strides in just 10 years, going from a brand-new journal in 2013 to one of the International Communication Association’s top journals by 2022. On the other hand, the growth is somewhat explainable because mobile phones have now become the dominant form of contemporary communication media. Back whenMMC published its inaugural issue, smartphones were still relatively new (at least in academic research terms) and there was a relatively small number of communication researchers who focused on mobile phone practices. But that is obviously no longer the case. At this point, most media studies research focuses on smartphones because most media are accessed through smartphones. Consequently, while the rise of the smartphone helped MMC and MCS grow, simply studying smartphones has not been what has cemented MCS as an identifiable field of research (Campbell, 2019). Instead, MCS has continued to develop as a field because of the community of researchers and, maybe most importantly, MMC. Without the mobile research community and MMC as a venue to set the tone for the field, we could have easily been swallowed up by more established communication fields. In fact, I suspect that’s exactly what would have happened as smartphones became ubiquitous and smartphone research became far too prevalent to group it all under the MCS label. If all we had tying us together as a research community was “we study mobile phones,” then we would have little reason to exist in 2022 when most communication research is at least tangentially",

In this paper, we examine selfies as a situated practice, connecting the social media phenomenon to the local spaces where it is performed. Based on ethnographic studies of selfie photography, we present and discuss three aspects of selfies in the wild. First, we consider selfies as part of a larger photographic context and show how they are often taken in series with other genres of images. Second, we expand upon the notion of selfies as conversation and show how selfie photographers exchange messages with remote friends and followers while attending to the local environment. Third, we discuss socializing around selfies, examining how copresent friends socialize around the production of selfies. These findings show the importance of considering selfies beyond the online context, and highlight the many ways that selfies are interweaved with our everyday activities. </jats:p>",

Working with a sample of 433 American young adults in romantic relationships, the study found that smartphone use was associated with increased communication between romantic partners, and increased mediated communication between partners predicted more affectionate communication. Conversely, increased smartphone dependency was directly associated with less affectionate communication and lower relationship satisfaction.

    "title": "Tethered women, mobile men: Gendered mobilities of typewriting",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, scholars have turned their attention to the nexus of mobility, space, and communication practices. At the same time, historians of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have amassed a large body of literature on the history of typewriters and their contribution to gendered office work. To date, however, these two strains have yet to converge. This article thus examines intersections between typewriting, gender, and mobility, focusing on the case of portable typewriters to investigate users’ “differential” mobilities before World War II in the United States. In this regard, it reconceives of typewriters as fluid historical objects defined significantly by their social contexts. It calls upon scholars to expand their characterizations of typing beyond thinking only of it as an immobile, desk-based practice and as “women’s work.” Instead, it draws attention to itinerant male typists as an early class of portable typewriter users who could (and were encouraged to) travel with a typewriter in tow. More broadly, the article also contributes to understandings of mobile media histories beyond mobile phones by demonstrating similar concerns related to portability, usability, and ergonomics in the early 20th century. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Accumulating phones: Aid and adaptation in phone access for the urban poor",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study draws on participant observation and interviews with low-income adults in Chicago to show how the poor stay connected to phone service and mobile Internet through the possession of multiple phones, including those subsidized by government aid. The “accumulation” of phones by individuals is widely observed, though underexplored in scholarship. Popular media coverage in the US frames the possession of multiple phones by people in poverty as criminal or excessive. In contrast, this study identifies three functions for phone accumulation as a strategy for maintaining phone access: to back up other phones, to build up capacities across phones, and to share phones with others in need. Each function responds to struggles unique for the urban poor as mobile technology advances and public phone access declines. Extra phones insure against regular disconnections due to loss and theft of devices and limits on subsidized service. Active service on one device combines with Internet functionality on another to approximate a single, high-end device and service plan. Subsidized phones help overcome the hesitation that poor people feel in lending out their devices to others in need. Accumulation thus contributes to the goal of securing reliable phone access for low-income Americans. There are limits to accumulation as a strategy for maintaining access, which result from the prevalence of inferior hardware, limited service plans, and lack of trust among strangers. Telecommunications policies should adapt to the needs of low-income phone users with accumulation in mind. The article concludes with recommendations for adapting policy to the needs of low-income phone users. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> All over the world people who use mobile phones to amplify their voices have revolutionised participatory communication in mass media. The use of mobile phones as instruments for participatory communication in public service broadcasting (PSB) has been growing and gaining strength in the so-called Third World. In this article it is argued that members of audience from different parts of Tanzania use mobile phones to participate in dialogue taking place on national radio (TBC-TAIFA) and/or national television (TBC1), and share their knowledge and lived experiences with the national audience as if they lived next door to each other. Further, the findings of this study show that TBC journalists use mobile phones to interact and involve the audiences in the processes of producing programmes. Consequently, TBC communication has become less hierarchical, more two-way, horizontal, and interactive. Moreover, the study reveals that the audiences use phone-in programmes on TBC as a platform to air the voices and concerns of the grass-roots population. Thus, the use of mobile phones as tools for participatory communication via TBC sets an agenda, which helps to bring about some social changes and transformation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Little is known about women experiencing multiple exclusion homelessness (MEH) in the UK, and even less about their use of mobile phones. MEH describes a subset of homeless people with multiple and complex needs who experience forms of deep social exclusion. Marginalized and socially excluded women often avoid social services and survive through remaining elusive and invisible. This evasion is reflected in their mobile phone practices in which both use and nonuse are expressions of their limited agency in the face of profound structural inequalities. This study explores MEH women's agency articulated through mobile phone ownership and usage in a UK coastal city. Through “deep hanging out” participant observation and interviews, it illuminates the complex ways in which MEH women access and manage mobile phones. It highlights paradoxical tensions between connection and invisibility; for example, homeless support services provide budget feature phones to MEH clients to ensure their improved safety and connectivity; however, MEH women sell these phones to meet their immediate needs. In so doing, these women reject the provision and discourse of stripped-back, financially compromised UK homeless support services. Through their mobiles, MEH women also engage with social media in uncertain ways, an activity which rather than providing connectivity and access, reaffirms social marginalization. Thus, MEH women's deep social exclusion is both mediated and reinforced by their mobile media practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "chapters strayed, for me, into content interpretation without providing a clear sense of the audience/user perspective that is key to understanding the formation of publics and places. Yet overall, by presenting a series of ambitious and diverse scholarship, this book enables one to more expansively and holistically consider the multifaceted dimensions of publics and places, and to ponder for oneself the intersections and contestations. Publics and places are particularly timely and relevant concepts to scholars of social media and mobile media respectively. For mobile media scholars, this collection has only a few chapters that specifically detail the use of mobile media. However, many, if not most, of the works in this book do make extensive reference to social media. Although few of the authors specifically mention how the users in their studies or overviews are accessing the social media sites in question, one can infer that from the clues in the articles and the generally high rate of mobile device usage. Thus there is much in this work that will be of relevance to mobile media scholars, particularly the works involving making place. Three chapters will be of particular interest to mobile media scholars. Wilfred Yang Wang’s chapter presents a study of Weibo users. Through a content analysis of Weibo posts, the study shows how an influence leader can help form geo-publics that use mobile media to remake their spaces. The chapters by Maria Cristina Paganoni and Darren Peacock and Jill MacKenzie also examine how mobile users can make and remake their places through the use of mobile media. These studies focus on heritage conservation and ongoing interpretation by demonstrating how innovative use of mobile media can transcend tired notions of heritage interpretations to offer more engaging and participatory experiences of place. Peacock and MacKenzie offer an impressive case study of an Adelaide locative media application and discuss broadly how mobile media has the potential to create, “much more flexible, less didactic, more dialogic approaches to interpretations” as “there is much greater freedom to explore, to construct, and to configure different pathways through spaces, both mentally and physically” (p. 98). Placemaking has been well studied by human geographers and urbanists, but only recently has literature begun to emerge that explores the role of mobile media in the placemaking process. This book presents an interesting array of the dimensions in the varied concepts of the public sphere and place, and it begins to examine the roles that digital media can play in forming connections and conflicts between them. The reader is left with a better understanding of these issues that highlight diverse and important considerations for future mobile media research and praxis.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper draws on qualitative data collected as a part of a comparative study on children and teenagers’ uses of smartphones in nine European countries to explore the meanings and emotions associated with the enhanced possibility of “full-time” contact with peers provided by smartphones. It argues that full-time access to peers—which interviewees identify as the main consequence of smartphones and instant messaging apps on their interactions with friends—is a communicative affordance, that is, a set of socially constructed opportunities and constraints that frame possibilities of action by giving rise to a diversity of communicative practices, as well as contradictory feelings among young people: intimacy, proximity, security as well as anxiety, exclusion and obligation. Understanding the perceptions and emotions around the affordance of “anywhere, anytime” accessibility, therefore, helps in untangling how communicative affordances are individually perceived but also, and more importantly, socially appropriated, negotiated, legitimised, and institutionalised. </jats:p>",

To address the research gap, we investigated the temporal and bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing, loneliness, and adolescent materialism. To be thorough, the mediating role of loneliness and the moderating role of gender were examined. Data were collected from 1,447 Chinese adolescents in June 2019 (T1) and January 2020 (T2). The results showed that T1 parental phubbing positively predicted T2 adolescent materialism, and T1 adolescent loneliness positively predicted T2 materialism, whereas neither of the reverse associations held. There were bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing and adolescent loneliness. Loneliness mediated the association between parental phubbing and subsequent adolescent materialism. There were no gender differences in these relationships. These findings enrich the literature by providing the first empirical support for how parental phubbing increases adolescent materialism. </jats:p>",

Findings confirm the interaction patterns of “connected presence” and further suggest an emerging “panoptic-presence” consciousness among the young adults, leading to a performative mode of interaction with their parents. Meanwhile, though individualism prevails among the younger generation, family values and norms rooted in traditional Chinese culture are found to be both explicitly and implicitly practiced. Limitations and future directions are also discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The proliferation of smartphones and their use in almost every social situation has led to controversial discussions about the smartphone’s potential impact on stress and recovery of its users. Some research has found detrimental effects of permanent availability and connectivity, other studies hint at beneficial effects resulting from users taking minibreaks from work. As there is some evidence for a recovery potential of mass media in general, the current study extends this line of research by examining whether smartphones also have such potential. To that end, we investigated the effects of smartphone use in fatiguing situations on recovery experiences and cognitive performance. After a fatigue-induction task, participants were observed in a waiting situation in order to check whether they used their mobile devices. Afterwards, data on their recovery experiences and cognitive performance were collected. The results demonstrate that smartphone use can be beneficial for some recovery dimensions but also detrimental for others. Smartphone use was positively related to cognitive performance, mediated through experiences of control. Results are discussed regarding the consequences of new mobile technologies and their potential to stay permanently Internet-connected. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media panics research is concerned with widespread social anxiety formed around a new technology or medium. This study adds to existing research by characterizing a new form of media panic around augmented reality applications, and specifically that which erupted concerning Pokémon GO, a popular augmented reality game. Based on a content analysis of items related to the game published in Israel's major print and online media in the period immediately following the game's launch, we classify the negative media coverage as a media panic and propose an explanation for its emergence. We argue that the negative reactions to the game stem specifically from the game's unique features and its mobile infrastructure, and especially its use of augmented reality that combines users’ virtual experiences and their interactions in actual physical space. We identify a third wave of mobile panic in this current phenomenon, one which takes into account the unique features of mobile technology as infrastructure for augmented reality applications. In contrast to previous incidents of media panic that focused on the harmful effects of increased technology use by young users, and their detachment from their physical environment, this wave represents an essentially opposite phenomenon, in which physical mobility itself, facilitated by the use of augmented reality, is deemed dangerous to players’ health and safety. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Tracking by mobile media has become key to coordination and surveillance of delivery gig work. Through their daily app-based media operations, delivery gig workers contribute to the capitalisation and establishment of platform companies’ spatiotemporal regimes. But this app-based tracking has been a source of tension and conflict, particularly in the face of growing organised and unionised resistance by delivery gig workers in Germany. App-based tracking is evolving into an arena for negotiating resistance, conducting counter-surveillance and (temporarily) disrupting platform-based supply chains. These forms of labour resistance and counter-surveillance by individual riders, works councils or trade unions are either 1) directed against app-based tracking itself or 2) seek to operationalise resistance through the use of app-based tracking. Drawing on an empirical analysis of different forms of resistance, this article offers a critical media studies perspective on resistant mobile media operations in response to app-based tracking. Based on a digital ethnography of resistance by German delivery gig workers, it shows how different forms of resistance in delivery gig work are negotiated against and through app-based tracking. We present local and non-hegemonic perspectives on mobile media operations of spatiotemporal coordination and surveillance that enable a critical analysis of the (non-)human power and information asymmetries involved in gig work resistance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the popularization of smartphones, location-based services are increasingly part of everyday life. People use their cell phones to find nearby restaurants and friends in the vicinity, and track their children. Although location-based services have received sparse attention from mobile communication scholars to date, the ability to locate people and things with one’s cell phone is not new. Since the removal of GPS signal degradation in 2000, artists and researchers have been exploring how location-awareness influences mobility, spatiality, and sociability. Besides exploring the historical antecedents of today’s location-based services, this article focuses on the main social issues that emerge when location-aware technologies leave the strict domain of art and research and become part of everyday life: locational privacy, sociability, and spatiality. Finally, this article addresses two main topics that future mobile communication research that focuses on location-awareness should take into consideration: a shift in the meaning of location, and the adoption and appropriation of location-aware technologies in the global south. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile apps are very popular. However, this is not true for every app, with some apps receiving millions of downloads, while other apps are mostly ignored. We investigate the popularity of apps in terms of downloads by focusing on two salient cues: (a) online recommendations (e.g., presence and valence of online reviews) and (b) visual characteristics of app icons (e.g., use of visual metaphors and anthropomorphism). Study 1 was a field study in which we content-analyzed 500 apps from the “transportation” subcategory of the Google Play Store. We found that the presence and valence of online reviews, as well as the presence of visual metaphors in app icons were positively related to the number of app downloads. Study 2 was an experiment in which we presented participants with different app icons containing different types of visual metaphors. We again found that app icons with visual metaphors led to more positive attitudes towards the apps and behavioral intentions. Combined, our studies show that both online consumers (through online reviews) and app designers (through visual design) impact an app’s popularity. </jats:p>",

Compared to the cyberspace widely celebrated as a realm apart, from the 1990s and into the 2000s, DE is a particularly ambitious example of the so-called digital twins (Savage, 2022) that promise to reintegrate online and offline realities in a new category of infrastructure, namely, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) (Bunz & Meikle, 2018)—which the field of media and communication research has barely begun to address. As I review the schedule of the 2022 Paris meeting of the International Communication Association to prepare for a hybrid online–offline reunion against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, a search for the text string “internet of things” returns neither session headings nor paper titles—none. The subfield coming together in the pages of Mobile Media & Communication, from the outset, raised shared and foundational questions concerning the definition and delimitation of media, communication, and mobility. What, indeed, is mobile about mobile media and communication (Jensen, 2013)? Ten years on, IoT is reiterating and radicalizing the conceptual and methodological challenges. From early feature phones to current smartphones, mobile media enabled users to move about as they communicated, to maintain contact with individuals and objects of interest elsewhere, to interact with other subjects, and to act on things at a distance.

Uses and gratifications theory predicts that specific features of apps can fulfill needs, but empirical evidence regarding the types of features that fulfill these needs is nonexistent. To address this gap, a multimethodological design was used. Qualitative interviews ( n = 20) revealed 23 features in children’s apps that parents believe are important. A subsequent survey ( n = 591) showed that parents want apps with (a) clear design; (b) tailorable, controllable, educational content; (c) challenges and rewards; and (d) technological innovation. Consistent with theory, analyses revealed that parents’ needs relate to these app features, but child’s age and gender play a key role in this relationship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The characteristics of mobile technology devices have enabled new ways of integrating technology in familial interactions. This study aimed to investigate (1) differences in perspectives of technoference and family-oriented mobile technology use between parents and children, (2) the relation between parent–child interactions that take place via mobile technology and the quality of the parent–child relationship, and (3) its association with the well-being of parents and preadolescents separately. Structural equation modelling was performed on cross-sectional data from 390 parent–child dyads. The findings revealed discrepancies in child technoference perceptions and varying associations of the different types of mobile technology use with the parent–child relationship and parents' and children's well-being. From children's perspective, both parent and child technoference was negative for the parent–child relationship, whereas family-oriented mobile technology use when physically together was beneficial for the relationship and the child's well-being. From parents’ perspective, only child technoference was negatively related to the parent–child relationship and parent's well-being. Overall, the findings underline that mobile technology use can be both detrimental and beneficial, however, the effects can differ depending on the family member and the type of technology use. </jats:p>",

Such data gathering, especially early in the design process, could help user-centered projects gather otherwise inaccessible feedback, leading to better designs, through tailored content and interfaces, particularly at the dynamic intersections of digital and physical space. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since Tinder's worldwide popularity, location-based dating apps have become widespread. The existing literature mainly focuses on a single app in European and US contexts and pays little attention to other cultural contexts. This paper addresses this gap by examining dating app choices and motivations of young adults (18–29 years old) in Turkey. It examines the intersectionality of socio-demographic variables in a cultural setting that is quite different not only from European and US contexts but also from other Muslim-majority contexts. Deriving from the nationally representative survey ( n = 1,498), our research finds statistically significant differences in dating app preferences and adults’ motivations regarding location, sexual, gender, and religious identities. This study underlines the crucial role of cultural geography and its social fabric in mobile dating, even within the same national setting . </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The MeTag mobile app and the web-interface MeTag analyzer by Hohman et al. (2022) provide an infrastructure for communication scholars conducting mobile media diaries and are filling a blind spot for (qualitative) diary research in communication science. The software meets high standards of transparency, open science, and accessibility. The user-friendly interface that does not require any coding skills from researchers as well as the detailed documentation (manual and tutorials) make it easy for researchers to conduct mobile media diary studies. While (media) diary studies are an essential part of many social sciences, including communication research, there is to date no standard software solution to conduct (qualitative) media diary studies. There are, of course, handwritten solutions, but the downside of this is well known. Besides accessibility, mobile diary studies carry further advantages even for a less literate sample: The smartphone is portable, and participants have it with them anyway. Some of the media usage reported is happening on the same device as the diary entries. It comes with the opportunity to do audio-based entries for those who are not able or willing to type (long) entries by hand into their mobile device. I will now list some of the characteristics that make the infrastructure a standard tool for media diary studies and fulfill all quality criteria for research software in the social sciences. Please let me elaborate on the mobile app first; that is, the interface where participants conduct their media diary entries.",

Her ability to weave the notions of yuanfen and tong together in explaining how her informants construct their social relations with relatives and strangers is extraordinary. Given all the obvious contributions, one wishes Wallis could have shared more of her methodology and research process in the fieldwork section. More detailed descriptions of how the interviews were conducted, the kinds of questions asked, strategies she used to establish rapport with her informants other than relying upon her Chinese connections and nonprofit organizations, and even challenges she encountered, would have been extremely valuable for scholars who are interested in carrying out similar projects. The absence of the digital divide in her framework and analysis is also somewhat disappointing. Digital divides are pervasive—in the young migrant women’s purchase of domestic-brand mobile phones and tailored low-rate, limited service plans, their reliance on prewritten text messages, and limited technological literacy. In one of the footnotes, Wallis points out the dualism between haves and have-nots that the concept of digital divide implies. But it does not justify the total omission of the issue from the book, precisely because she challenges the faulty premise that technology will pave the road to prosperity and demonstrates how digital divides are almost always about social and economic inequality.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 2011, mobile chat apps have gained significant popularity worldwide and the leading chat apps have surpassed social networking sites in user numbers. These apps have become the hosts for everyday communication among a wide variety of users and, thanks to the functionalities of certain apps, have taken on new significance in reporting. Especially in Hong Kong (a high-income, high-tech society in which smartphones are in widespread use) and mainland China (an emerging market with more than 1 billion mobile phone users), journalists have turned to these apps to complement face-to-face interactions to gather news. Drawing on a case study building on in-depth interviews with foreign correspondents based in China and Hong Kong, this article discusses how journalists use chat apps and establish trust with their sources. This article explores journalistic sourcing on apps (e.g., encrypted or not encrypted; open or one-to-one communication), and seeks to understand individual and systemic levels of trust. It finds that there are differences of trust depending on the functionalities of individual chat apps, and that interactions in journalistic sourcing in face-to-face and online environments affect the generation and output of news stories. Chat apps allow reporters to use open or closed networks, and adopt one of several approaches: trust the network, master the network, or abandon the network. These findings suggest that chat apps have an important role in communicating with sources, and should be a part of efforts to theorize journalistic sourcing. </jats:p>",

For many people, mobile messaging is synonymous with Facebook and WhatsApp. Outside China, where WeChat dominates, over 2.5 billion people use these two Meta platforms for mobile messaging, and the company owns 90% of the mobile messaging market share in many places. This undercounts mobile messaging because Apple’s iMessage likely exceeds Facebook’s mobile messager app in size, and the Android messaging program is similar in size to Snapchat, Telegram, and QQ (the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-ranked mobile messager apps respectively) (Statistica, 2022). Whatever you call it—texting, mobile instant messaging, direct messaging (DM), mobile chat—mobile messaging is, and long has been, an enormous part of the experience of mobile media. In this article, I will focus on messaging that occurs on mobile devices exclusively (i.e., smartphones), not desktopor laptop-accessed messenger programs. In the last five years, the boundaries between social media use (SMU) and mobile messaging have utterly blurred. Although Facebook introduced the DM in 2011, it wasn’t fully integrated with mobile devices until 2017 (Business of Apps, 2022). Earlier versions of social media messaging were bound to the platform, seldom used, and forgettable. Only in competition with WhatsApp and Snapchat and the rapid adoption of the",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> News is increasingly being consumed on a multitude of media devices, including mobile devices. In recent years, mobile news consumption has permeated individuals’ news consumption repertoires. The main purpose of this study is twofold: (a) gain insight in how mobile news outlets infiltrated the broader news media repertoires of mobile device owners and (b) understand in what circumstances mobile news is consumed within these news media repertoires. The key is to understand how and why this widening agency in appropriating various places and social spaces in everyday life relates to general news media consumption (Peters, 2012). This two-phased study aims to illuminate how mobile device owners position their mobile news consumption in relation to other types of news media outlets. First, a guiding cluster analysis of a large-scale questionnaire ( N = 1279) was performed, indicating three types of news consumers. Second, in order to thicken the originally derived clusters, a mixed-method study was set up, combining objective data originating from mobile device logs with more subjective audience constructions through personal diaries and face-to-face interviews ( N = 30). This study reveals the Janus-faced nature of mobile news. On the one hand, the majority of news consumers dominantly relies on traditional media outlets to stay informed, only to supplement with online mobile services in specific circumstances. Even then, there is at least a tendency to stick to trusted brand materials. On the other hand, these mobile news outlets/products do seem to increasingly infiltrate the daily lives of mobile audiences who were previously disengaged with news. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, as Chan shows in his encounters with queer app users, the expansion of networked sexual publics to include sexual minorities also points to an affective pathway to understanding human-technology interaction in mobile communication. For LGBTQ people in China, the mere existence of niche dating apps can be “a symbol of legitimacy for same-sex intimacy” (p. 97). The lingering gaze illuminated by the faint gleam over the screen, the tender touch at a profile ready or hesitant to swipe, and the anticipation of that unique sound of a message notification—these complicated feelings come with the use of dating apps, as queer people see their desire for belonging embodied in this emergent techno-social space.",

This article argues that it is in the negotiation of contact during hookups that college students creatively navigate their sexual identity. Using a mixed methodology, this research reveals that the cell phone, as both an object of communication and consumption, is essential to the formation of self, and, as such, it provides the means by which men and women can play with gender boundaries. And yet, the male dominated fraternity system at college restricts the ability of women to realize full agency within the hookup scene. </jats:p>",

We used a mixed-method experiment to examine the impact of phubbing on different work-related variables such as objective performance, subjective states, and first impression judgments during job interviews. Ninety-three participants took part in a simulated job interview based on the Trier Social Stress Test. In the experimental group, participants were repeatedly phubbed during both the interview and the performance test. At the end of the experiment, phubbed participants were asked to describe their experience, and thematic analysis was used to evaluate their responses. Overall, the results of the quantitative analysis revealed that first impressions, judgments, and subjective states were negatively affected by phubbing. Regarding performance, a within-session analysis revealed that participants performed faster on a performance test (mental arithmetic task) when they were not phubbed compared to when they were. A qualitative analysis of responses revealed considerable differences between interviewees in their use of coping strategies (e.g., rationalization of phubbing). These findings suggest the need to address phubbing in a professional setting. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the growing significance of mobile devices, especially among marginalized communities, there are few explorations of how participatory design (PD) can be applied to mobile communication technologies. This case study of Mobile Voices (VozMob) explores a community-based approach to PD and its potential to promote the participation of groups typically marginalized from the design process, and to empower users. VozMob is a mobile platform that was codesigned with and for immigrant workers and organizers to facilitate the online publishing of multimedia stories about their lives and their social justice efforts. Through collective visualization methods, observation, and interviews, this study investigates the factors that enabled or hindered meaningful user participation in the VozMob design process. Significant differences emerged between participants’ experiences of the design process, which allow for the exploration of themes related to technology appropriation, design ownership, and power sharing in collaborative processes. Our findings reveal that a community-based approach to PD can shed light on the degree to which—and how—collaborative design and equitable participation is possible through mobile media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile messaging is typically understood as a medium that connects people. This article argues that to better understand mobile messaging we must also attend to its disconnective affordances—the opportunities for disconnection facilitated by the material properties of messaging platforms and mobile devices. Drawing on interview research into the mobile messaging practices of 24 young people, this article proposes a typology of five disconnective affordances that participants used to manage and limit their connections to friends and family, and to mobile devices and platforms. In highlighting these affordances, this article enables a better understanding of how people manage and limit availability to and through mobile messaging, actions that are increasingly necessary as mobile communication becomes ever more deeply embedded in daily life. In doing so, this article also demonstrates the value of key developments in the theorisation of affordances by applying newly developed terms and concepts to an empirical example. </jats:p>",

Using survey data of current smartwatch and smart fitness tracker users ( N = 457), four factors—physical interaction, interface assessment, cognitive absorption, and digital outreach—were examined as the main components of user engagement. Results showed that the four concepts reliably constituted the measurement model of user engagement. The proposed user engagement scale showed convergent validity with user attitudes toward wrist-worn wearables and usage intention. In addition, the four aspects of user engagement consisted of a process model, where physical interaction predicted interface assessment, interface assessment predicted cognitive absorption, and cognitive absorption predicted digital outreach. </jats:p>",

Extant research indicates that mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle interventions are potentially effective and practical methods of weight loss, but it is less known what intervention characteristics are associated with weight loss effects.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While mobile social media has increasingly become embedded in migrants’ daily lives, how mobile social media affects migrants’ cross-border experiences remains under-researched. Based on a 2-year ethnographic study, this article demonstrates a more complex relationship among mobile social media, migrants’ spatial-temporal mobility, and their subjective experience of social inclusion and exclusion. Situated in a Chinese cross-border context (Macao Special Administrative Region), this article elaborates on how mobile social media leads to heterogeneous and synchronous spatial-temporal mobility in a homogeneous time-narrative. This article further explains how and why mainland students’ social exclusion transforms into digital inclusion, where the blurring boundaries create the possibility of digital and social inclusion but also risk deeper exclusion and internal borders. The article argues for a new epistemology of the border, which is complicated, heterogeneous, and paradoxical, while mobile social media reinvigorates the border concept in how it constructs and deconstructs territorial/internal boundaries and inclusion/exclusion dynamics. </jats:p>",

In addition, a major body of research on privacy management online focuses on predicting privacy protection behaviors based on samples primarily from the United States. This in-depth qualitative study employs focus groups to explore how Chinese young people interact with their parents after accepting them as friends on WeChat, a popular mobile social application in China. Many participants reported privacy turbulence due to parental interference with young adults’ expression of their own values and behaviors on WeChat, which reflects the deep conflict between the collectivistic culture (the parental generation) and the individualistic culture (young adults) in contemporary Chinese society. This study also finds that a family’s offline communication is generally parallel to its online communication on mobile social media after young people’s friending of parents. </jats:p>",

Drawing on a scoping literature review and expert interviews, we show how social robots come with privacy implications that go beyond those of established mobile technology. Social robots challenge not only users’ informational privacy but also affect their physical, psychological, and social privacy due to their autonomy and potential for social bonding. These distinctive privacy challenges require study from varied theoretical perspectives, with contextual privacy and human–machine communication emerging as particularly fruitful lenses. Findings also point to an increasing focus on technological privacy solutions, complementing an evolving legal landscape as well as a strengthening of user agency and literacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to the understanding of immigrants’ mobile phone uses by focusing on a particular social group, European young adults, and moment in the migration process—arrival at a new place. It analyses the experiences of 25 Spanish-speaking young adults recently arrived in London through a qualitative methodological lens based on semistructured interviews and participant observation at relevant sites of arrival in the city. We looked at the potential mobile phones have to empower youth in their migration processes—from improving their transnational communication to accessing relevant and timely information at destination—as well as the challenges young migrants face to fully enjoy mobile services in a new national context. We argue that this tension between the potential benefits and challenges of mobile communication is particularly prominent when arriving at a new place, a moment characterized by economic and emotional uncertainties. However, this temporal dimension has tended to remain underexplored in the literature that deals with mobile communication and users’ strategies. Thus we propose the concept of “immigrants’ technological adjustments” to name the set of decisions immigrants take as information and communication technologies (ICTs) users in order to ensure the availability of digital resources and services while moving between countries. We draw upon empirical examples from fieldwork in order to offer a new conceptual tool that further develops the burgeoning field of immigrants and ICT use. </jats:p>",

This article discusses the ethical dilemmas that emerged in two distinct cases where authors were part of the research teams, concluding that current frameworks fall short in the sociotechnical dimension. To address this, we complement the casuistic-heuristic model with an affordances-driven approach, which contemplates the agency of the group members within the interactive processes that take place in digital environments and the possibilities and constraints that platforms' features offer during the research process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Connecting with others through mobile dating apps has become one of the most popular ways for people to meet. These apps might help people find a suitable partner and, thus, achieve a satisfactory love life. To examine whether mobile dating apps deliver on their potential for positive relationship outcomes, this study investigates if and how the use of these apps is related to satisfaction with one's relationship status. In a survey study, we compared previous and current users of mobile dating apps with people who have never used such apps ( n= 1,054, from the United States or United Kingdom, younger than 35). Results showed that dating app users score lower on satisfaction with their relationship status than non-users. This negative association between dating app use and satisfaction was stronger for women than it was for men. The most crucial factor in relationship status satisfaction, however, is whether people are in a relationship or not. Future research should aim to disentangle the causal order of the association between mobile dating app use and relationship status satisfaction, and investigate if these apps have the potential to improve users’ satisfaction with their relationship status in the long term through facilitating romantic relationships. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Hybrid spaces 2.0: Connecting networked urbanism, uneven mobilities, and creativity, in a (post) pandemic world",
    "abstract": "Over fifteen years ago, I suggested that we were living in hybrid spaces (de Souza e Silva, 2006). More than just combining physical and digital spaces, hybrid spaces, I argued, were created by the ongoing and emerging networked relationships between people, spaces, and mobile technologies. I defined hybrid spaces as “mobile spaces, created by the constant movement of users who carry portable devices continuously connected to the Internet and to other users” (de Souza e Silva, 2006, p. 262). By walking around connected to the Internet (and consequently to other geolocated users) we could experience both digital and physical spaces simultaneously, and for this reason, it was pointless to address physical and digital as two (often disconnected) spaces. For the past decade and a half, the range of mobile communication technologies we interact with on an everyday basis has only acquired complexity. To keep up with the fast-changing technological landscape, terms such as Internet of Things (Ashton, 2009), Net Locality (Gordon & de Souza e Silva, 2011), code/space (Kitchin & Dodge, 2011), and Networked Urban Mobilities (Freudendal-Pedersen & Kesselring, 2017) have been used to describe a sociotechnical context in which people and digital technologies are increasingly interconnected. The wide range of new mobile technologies and concepts used to describe our relationships with them may bring up questions about the usefulness and validity of hybrid spaces today. In this article, I want to suggest that we still very much live in hybrid spaces. However, to successfully understand and analyze hybrid spaces today, we must take into consideration not only issues of privacy,",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Parental phubbing refers to parents being distracted by their phone during an interaction with their child. The present study investigated how parental phubbing relates to adolescents’ self-control through the mediators of parent–adolescent closeness and loneliness. The current study also compared the effects of maternal and paternal phubbing. Having a sibling may influence adolescent mental health and behaviors. Thus, this study also examined whether siblings attenuate the effects of parental phubbing on self-control. We recruited 670 adolescents to participate in our survey. Path analyses revealed that maternal phubbing had both direct and indirect effects on self-control through mother–adolescent closeness and loneliness. However, paternal phubbing had only a sequential indirect effect through father–adolescent closeness and loneliness. This shows that maternal and paternal phubbing have different effects on adolescents’ self-control. Multi-group comparisons revealed that the direct and indirect effects of maternal phubbing on self-control were non-significant for adolescents with siblings. Thus, siblings attenuated the adverse relationships between maternal phubbing and adolescent self-control. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This contribution sheds light on how people experiencing homelessness in Germany make sense of an app designed with them in mind and whether using it would be of benefit to them. However, it must be acknowledged that the app has yet to be developed. “Urban figurations of social control,” a term we use to refer to the social conditions of homelessness in Germany, give rise to a significant loss of trust as well as a state of vulnerability, feelings of loneliness, and limited agency for people experiencing homelessness. Drawing on a group discussion with 12 people experiencing homelessness that took place in Germany in 2019, our findings demonstrate that the respondents project particular fears and desires onto the use of the potential app. Whenever they fear surveillance and institutional control, they wish to be invisible to the app. On the other hand, their desire to access resources and information (food, places to sleep, housing) and to meet with peers in order to create meaningful social relationships requires their visibility. Thus, navigating between visibility and invisibility by way of a smartphone involves situationally and strategically constructing a safe environment for their digital participation, helping them to reduce their vulnerability and loneliness and restore their agency. Moreover, in that the app is used as a means of rendering assistance to homeless people (and highlighting the grievances associated with this) that is visible to others, the respondents challenge the current framing of homelessness. The supposed system of help is revealed to be the social problem itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines mediated performances of emotions by Chinese international students in their transnational journeys returning to China during the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the role of mobile media in helping students cope with their cross-border (im)mobility and symbolic immobility. By thematically analyzing 36 self-representational videos produced by returning Chinese students on a burgeoning mobile media platform Douyin, we identify 5 overarching themes of emotional performance: fear, pride, gratitude, shame, and solidarity. We propose that mobile media has the potential to create a hybrid space that witnesses and elicits empathy for the hardship experienced by marginalized mobile groups during the global pandemic. Mobile media, by enabling simultaneous communication, amplifies the sensation of belonging in times of isolation and ambiguity and offers dialogic venues for disparate groups across geographical and socioemotional distances. Our findings suggest the vulnerability of mobile communities in the event of a global pandemic, and the affordances of mobile media in confronting and resolving such precarity. We call attention to the intersections of mobile communities and mobile media amid the global pandemic, particularlyon the experiences and performances of emotions in hybrid spaces. </jats:p>",

Given the ubiquity of smartphones as mobile communication and computing devices along with the vast smartphone app market, our exploratory study aimed to understand how heuristics guide smartphone app selection. Observing 49 smartphone users from the US and Germany viewing 189 total apps from three predetermined categories, the current study identified five decision-making heuristics used to download a variety of smartphone apps. Of these, four were variants of a “Take the First” (TtF) heuristic that allowed smartphone users to quickly navigate the app market, by passing a good deal of other informational cues in order to download apps that were simply highly rated or ranked. Reliance on heuristic processing is useful in helping navigate the app market, but it also results in smartphone users overlooking potentially important app information. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the role of information provision through mobile communication in mass street protest. The argument is based on two case studies: (a) the civic outrage of young people concerning the destruction of a youth centre in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2006 and (b) the use of mobile phones in antifascist protests in Dresden, Germany in 2011. The cases are analysed across three dimensions that are relevant to mobile communication tactics for providing information in protest: Actors, power relations between the actors, and goals. By identifying the affordances of the mobile phone for providing information across these dimensions, we argue that mobile communication can be appropriated to increase activists’ repertoire of actions, foster resistance, and shut down opportunities. The ways in which the affordances of mobile phones limit and empower resistance are located at the intersection of coordination, mobilisation, and the creation of counter narratives as well as of the surveillance and maintenance of existing power relations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Set in the context of India's second Covid-19 wave (April–June 2021), this article examines the transformation of a WhatsApp group originally created to study a pool of fantasy sport players into a site of care, concern, and support. By using netnography and in-depth interviews to chart the various challenges faced by the study's participants, the article analyzes how key health information was curated, moderated, and shared by the group's participants during the period. Our findings indicate that during the Covid-19 wave, users of WhatsApp relied on the personal connections it offered as they found ways to make the platform their own. By harnessing WhatsApp's capabilities with regard to accessing and sharing essential information that was both timely and locationally relevant, users of the service found ways to stay informed in moments that were fraught with uncertainty. By analyzing the various ways in which the group's participants shared information with each other and outside of the group, this study argues that the insights obtained can be used to understand broader social realities and the possibilities offered by platforms such as WhatsApp that could help navigate the various challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic in the Global South. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile media have become increasingly popular and important in recent years as a means of accessing political information and participating in politics and elections worldwide. However, the emergent field of mobile-focused political participation research requires further definition and development to more clearly address why and how mobile media are producing distinct consequences for political participation. To address this problem, this article uses interdisciplinary insights and a critical review of relevant literature to identify research opportunities that stand to advance mobile political communication theory. Contributions and limitations of studies focused on ICTs and political participation are reviewed and discussed. Analysis of studies focused on the political participation outcomes of mobile media use is synthesized with theory from user-focused mobile communication literature to highlight the unique qualities that distinguish mobile media and the implications of those distinguishing features for studying political participation. Recommendations are made for research directions that would further investigate the association of mobile media’s distinctive features with online and offline forms of political participation. This analysis indicates opportunities for scholars to unpack mobile media’s unique features in ways that potentially redefine political participation, and, accordingly, further the development of research questions and theories that investigate the relationship of mobile media and political participation. It is concluded that research is needed that explains mobile media use in finer detail, accounts for shifting conceptualizations of political participation, and contributes to the development of cross-cultural comparative frameworks. </jats:p>",

The majority of the book presents individual interviews, but Chapter 6 provides a case study of a mass casualty disaster. While the case study provides an interesting takeaway regarding the potential of mobile media to serve as witness to death, it seems out of place in the context of an argument emphasizing individual experiences of loss. Nevertheless, this one shortcoming is eclipsed by the thought-provoking meditation that the book offers on the role of mobile media in processing loss. Beyond addressing gaps in the literature about loss, Haunting Hands_ will be useful to those interested in how mobile media penetrate the quotidian and acquire meaning as individuals embed aspects of their identity both within them and through their use.",

As the first mobile electronic device, the portable radio reveals important information about how the mobile media experience has developed over time. Portable radio afforded several new experiences that are relevant to today’s media landscape: it allowed users to create customizable, mobile media environments that they could take with them wherever they went; it redefined the radio listening context by allowing users to bring their preferred forms of entertainment with them when travelling to unfamiliar places; and it facilitated more continuous media consumption habits. This interdisciplinary essay combines close textual analysis of historical newspaper articles and advertisements, which are viewed through the lens of a range of media theories. The goal is to uncover some of the complex effects of early mobile media and to lay the groundwork for future in-depth studies of mobile media history. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smartphones have enjoyed nearly unprecedented rates of adoption, and within a short time they have quickly become a uniquely important mobile communication device, especially among young people. While such observations are compelling, they lack a conceptual context. This paper theorizes the smartphone in the general terms of mediatization. Emphasis is on existing and emerging technologies of the mediatization process and the consequent “intercorporeal” relationships users construct with the smartphone. Empirical findings about the often intensely personal usage of the smartphone document this phenomenology. The paper concludes by introducing three provocative implications of new media like the smartphone, which are both indicators and motors of mediatization, as focuses for future study: technogenesis, or the coevolution of people and their information machines; embodied and extended cognition, the intensifying interweaving of mind and thinking machines; and the subjectifying process of individualization, ever more dependent on digital self-creation and self-maintenance. </jats:p>",

It investigates the incorporation of audio and sound recording devices, observation, and note-taking into a mobile (auto)ethnographic research methodology, to research a large-scale commemorative event in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. On May 4, 2016, the sounds of a Silent March—through the streets of Amsterdam to Dam Square—were recorded and complemented by video grabs of the march’s participants and onlookers. We discuss how the mixed method enabled a multilevel analysis across visual, textual, and aural layers of the commemorative atmosphere. Our visual data aided in our evaluation of the construction of collective spectacle, while the audio data necessitated that we venture into new analytic territory. Using Sonic Visualiser, we uncovered alternative methods of “reading” landscape by identifying different sound signatures in the acoustic environment. Together, this aural and visual representation of the May 4 events enabled the identification of spatial markers and the temporal unfolding of the Silent March and the national 2 minutes’ silence in Amsterdam’s Dam Square. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using mobile media can be both detrimental and beneficial for well-being. Thus, explaining how and when they elicit such effects is of crucial importance. To explicate boundary conditions and processes for digital well-being, this article introduces the Integrative Model of Mobile Media Use and Need Experiences (IM³UNE). Instead of assuming mobile media to be pathogenic, the IM³UNE offers a salutogenic perspective—it focuses on how we can stay healthy when using mobile media ubiquitously in daily life. More specifically, the model assumes that both the satisfaction and the frustration of basic psychological needs are key underlying mechanisms linking demanding mobile media use to well-being. However, the impact of these mechanisms is contingent on how users perceive, appraise, act on, and make sense of mobile media demands according to their global orientation to life (i.e., their sense of coherence, SOC). Integrating prior work, we theoretically link mindfulness, self-control, and meaningfulness to SOC's central facets, arguing that they represent crucial personal resources required to cope with mobile media demands. Thus, the offers an integrative framework, guiding further research towards a more nuanced study of mobile media’s effect on well-being. </jats:p>",

    "title": "COVID-19 surveillance in Israeli press: Spatiality, mobility, and control",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In March 2020, Israel passed emergency regulations authorizing its internal security agency to track citizens’ mobile phone geolocations in order to tackle the spread of COVID-19. This unprecedented surveillance enterprise attracted extensive media attention and sparked a vigorous public debate regarding technology and democratic values such as privacy, mobility, and control. This article examines press coverage of Israel’s surveillance of its citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic by four leading news sites to identify and map the frames that informed their reports. Based on a thematic analysis, our findings point to supportive and critical constructions of mobile phone location-tracking and organize them within two scapes: personal; and international. These attest to the collective imagining of intimacies and public life, respectively. We draw on the case study to articulate mobile phones as devices that reduce movement into manageable mapped information and individuals into controllable data. Mobile phone location-tracking during the COVID-19 pandemic is understood as turning mobility into order and control. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the field of mobile media studies continues to grow, researchers are focusing on new developments and trends in mobile technologies. One of these areas that has been garnering interest is mobile augmented reality (AR) technologies. While much of the earliest research in AR was primarily focused on answering computer science and engineering related questions, social science and humanities scholars have started taking note of AR as perhaps the next major development in mobile media. Given that much of this research has been distributed across interdisciplinary lines and from many different theoretical perspectives, this piece identifies some early lines of media, communication, and social science research into AR and identifies key themes and areas of focus: AR users/nonusers, AR devices, AR content, and AR industry. By organizing these lines of research, this manuscript serves as a call for specific future areas of research, suggests new approaches that researchers could take to explore interrelationships between these areas, and advocates for the necessity of research that examines different levels (micro/meso/macro) of analysis within AR. The goal of this piece is to advance a framework that informs and motivates mobile scholars to consider and integrate AR into their research areas, at a moment where it is in the process of moving from science fiction to material reality, from blueprint to prototype, and from laboratory to homes, cars, workplaces, and pockets. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Increases in mobile phone ownership and Internet access throughout Africa continue to motivate initiatives to use information and communication technologies (ICTs)—in particular, mobile phones—to address long-standing socioeconomic problems in the “developing world.” While it is generally recognized that mobile phones may help to address these problems by providing pertinent information, less widely known is exactly how (and if) a handset’s human–computer interface—that is, its software and hardware design—supports this form of communication. The concept of “affordances” has long been used to answer such questions. In this paper, we use Hartson’s definition of affordances to qualitatively investigate rural Kenyan women’s interactions with their mobile phones. Our detailed analysis provides empirically grounded answers to questions about the cognitive, physical, and sensory affordances of handsets used in our field sites and how they support and/or constrain mobile communication. We then discuss the implications of our findings: in particular, how this affordance-based approach draws attention to mobile phones’ design features and to the context in which they and their users are embedded—a focus which suggests new design and research opportunities in mobile communication. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How does the use of parent–daycare mobile communication applications reconfigure the emplacement and timing of parenting? In what ways, if any, do parents’ practices challenge the distinction between warm care and cold technology? Based on 35 interviews with 18 parents, we identified 4 ways in which Aula, Denmark's parent–daycare app, reconfigures the time-space dimensions of parenting. While parents and children are apart, mobile communication via Aula allows parents to “plan ahead,” and “synchronize” expectations and schedules with those of their children and the daycare center and “look back” on their children's time away. In addition, communication via Aula enhances co-presence. Overall, this paper's findings offer an alternative to views that oppose technology and care, showing how mobile communication may reshape responsibility for childcare in the welfare state. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Elders are an important part of this society and a group for which ICTs might provide useful answers to existing problems and needs. However, elders and their interests with regard to ICTs have been largely ignored due to a presupposed missing ability to use, a general disinterest in, and a lack of will to learn about ICT developments. This article wants to contribute to the debate about elders and their abilities to use and interests in ICTs. We analysed how elders in focus groups in Spain use mobile ICT applications, how they experiment with them and why they decide to use or not to use them. In our research, we have used apps as an example for ICTs because apps are considered to be flagships for technological innovation, and because, in contrast to call and messenger functions of mobile phones, the motivation for using apps has to come from the individual that uses them. Findings from 4 focus group discussions with elders from Spain suggest that age does not directly influence the perception of, experience with, and evaluation of newest technological developments. Instead past experiences and social contexts in which the technology is introduced play a role. Our results point at the need to find new formulas for introducing, and teaching ICTs to elders, and underline the need to take elders’ emotions with regard to ICTs into consideration when evaluating elders’ ICT uses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Individuals use their smartphones for an assortment of communication and functional activities and in a variety of contexts. Researchers analyzing smartphone use during interpersonal interactions have posed hypotheses and developed theories regarding the positive and negative influences that smartphones have on individuals and relationships. However, there is little research that examines the role smartphone use plays in a public speaking context. The current study uses a video vignette methodology to explore audience perceptions of a speaker who uses a smartphone as a presentation aid at a small university in Singapore. Overall, results suggest that the speaker’s smartphone use did not have a negative impact on perceptions of credibility (likeability/trustworthiness, competence, speaker ability), speaker immediacy, or persuasion. However, there was a small interaction effect when accounting for participants’ degree of smartphone acceptance. University students who reported lower smartphone acceptance perceived the speaker who used a smartphone as less credible (likable/trustworthy) than a speaker who delivered a speech from memory. Additionally, despite reporting significantly less smartphone use than students, staff and instructors did not perceive a speaker who uses a smartphone compared to a memorized presentation differently. This exploratory study carries implications for better understanding normative and appropriate smartphone use in public speaking contexts and provides recommendations for public speaking educators. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The cellular phone’s unique characteristics—its mobility, its portability, and the constant availability that it enables—challenge the feasibility of solitary spaces in individuals’ lives. These spaces—for example, cultural “timeouts,” leisure, and backpacking travel—necessitate a certain degree of cutting oneself off from one’s daily routine, which is threatened by the constant presence of one’s cell phone. This study examines the role of cell phones in young adults’ backpacking experience. Using questionnaires ( n = 105) and in-depth interviews ( n = 14) with “cellular backpackers” and “cell-free backpackers,” the study shows how an attempt is made to reduce availability and attain maximum control over the scope and timing of communication, using a variety of avoidance practices. Those practices derived from the personal narrative structure of the backpacking experience as an escapist, “dropping-off-the-radar” one, and as an attempt to preserve the trek as a space that is cut off and isolated from a technology-saturated environment. In addition, it was found that backpackers care a great deal about their parents’ position when making their decisions whether to take their phones with them and when to use them. In this regard, the article continues the discussion on the metaphor of the cell phone as a transitional object, applying this concept from childhood and adolescence to the twenties and thirties, the ages of most backpackers. On another level, the article addresses the mobile phone’s unique function as an antistatus symbol, in a way that contradicts its function in an ordinary context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores how the playing of Pokémon Go can cause power to be assembled, and team-based expressions of territoriality to manifest. By playing the game, players become embedded within digital assemblages of power, which they reproduce through their interactions with other players, game features, and public spaces. When digital assets—such as gyms—are indexed to public spaces, players work together in teams to compete for digital ownership, and control, of these assets. In turn, this leads to the forging of a team-based sense of territoriality that is pervasive, and maximized by consolidating the power of the assemblage. Qualitative data are presented to empirically explore how playing Pokémon Go in Singapore can encourage players to forge a team-based sense of territoriality, which in turn results in the (dis)assembling of power. To conclude, I call for closer consideration of the implications of digital assemblages of power for everyday life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile media have the potential to affect how one remembers and exercises the past as they offer new and creative ways to record and document the current. These new ways of preserving the past could be in the form of sharing locational information (e.g., geotagging, camera phone photos, check-ins), which would remind our future selves where we come from and how we used to be. We sometimes consciously create our everyday life narratives intending to hang onto a moment, or simply because the technology automatically saves our experiences, we unconsciously preserve our pasts. Mobile media can contribute to the existing ways of narrating places and the self because locational information can communicate multiple and different aspects of places. Situating our analysis within the broader literature on memory and media, we draw on three different studies conducted in the UK and the US in order to analyze different uses of mobile media in remembering associations with places, past experiences, and creating a nostalgic sense of place. More specifically we draw on notions of memory work and mediated memories to explore the mutual shaping of media, place, and memory. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile apps have been developed to manage COVID-19 in many countries. However, for these apps to be truly effective, they need to be widely adopted by society. To date, there has been less qualitative research on user experiences and perspectives on these apps. The goal of this study was to explore how users perceive and use different features of a COVID-19 tracing app provided in Turkey. Semi-structured interviews ( n = 15) were conducted over the phone, audio recorded, and then transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were analyzed through thematic analysis. The analysis began by categorizing each transcript at the sentence level through open codes, which then grouped into broader themes. In total, 8 male and 7 female participants from 10 different cities took part in the interviews. On average, participants were 32 years ( SD = 6.8) old, and their app usage experience was 9.8 months ( SD = 3.1). Thematic analysis revealed five key themes: long-term adoption and engagement, perception and desired features, privacy concerns, reliability, and emotional and behavioral impact. The main reasons for users to download and use the app were to check the COVID-19 density map in their region and to access personal health codes for security checks. The COVID-19 density map caused many users to change where they usually travel and shop. Most participants felt comfortable sharing their personal data to collectively manage the pandemic. The majority found the app useful, stating that the app allows them to take precautions against the virus and therefore helps them feel good emotionally. Future contact tracing apps need to provide indicators to enable users to evaluate whether app use is making a difference in the pandemic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Organising, performing, and experiencing festive family rituals sustain relationships among family members. However, in recent times, high levels of human migration alongside the rapid development of digital communication technologies are reconfiguring family traditions. This paper investigates the ways in which 21 overseas Filipino workers in Melbourne, Australia, and their left-behind family members in the Philippines use mobile devices and communications platforms to restage festive family rituals. Employing a visual method and drawing on in-depth interviews, the empirical study uncovers the personalised and heterogenous practices of the transnational Filipino family in performing intimacy at a distance, paving the way for constructing copresence during festivities. Importantly, using the mobilities lens (Urry, 2007) as a framework for critical investigation, the findings show that a disproportionate level of network capital as informed by age, gender, and social class produces “asymmetrical mobile intimacy.” The present study also reveals how ambivalent feelings emerge due to technological asymmetries and parameters. Importantly, transnational families often negotiate such contradictory experiences through mobile device use. By comparing and contrasting the mobile practices of dispersed family members, the present study uncovers the hidden social inequalities perpetuated in a networked family life. </jats:p>",

As a notable contribution to the field of mobile media and platform studies, it attempts to move beyond a Western-centric view and highlights the fragmentation of platform governance as illuminated in the case studies covered across several chapters. Furthermore, it also prompts readers to pay close attention to the ideological conflicts shaping the processes and outcomes of regulating platforms. Indeed, by emphasizing the need for a critical analysis of the role played by multiple systems and actors in platform governance, the book serves as a valuable entry point for understanding the possibilities and politics of integrating platforms in an increasingly interconnected society.",

The main goal of the article is to show how the ludic, digital wayfaring of location-based games can be used by individual places to attract players.

    "title": "The erosion of nongambling spheres by smartphone gambling: A qualitative study on workplace and domestic disordered gambling",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The potential dangers of internet-based gambling as compared with more traditional land-based gambling have been increasingly investigated over the past decade. The general consensus appears to be that although internet gambling might not be a more dangerous medium for gambling per se, the 24/7 availability it generates for problem gamblers, however, is. Because smartphones have become the most used way of gambling online, internet gambling must, therefore, be further subcategorized according to the device by which it is accessed. This study examines the issue by exploring the views of smartphone gamblers undergoing treatment for gambling disorder in focus group settings ( N=35). Utilizing thematic analysis, the paper shows that smartphone gambling has colonized spaces previously regarded as nongambling spheres. The workplace, especially in male-dominated contexts, emerged as an accommodator and stimulator of gambling behavior, raising issues of productivity rather than criminality. Domestic gambling was mostly characterized by an invasion of bathroom and bedtime spheres of intimacy. The study examines the implications of prevention and treatment, focusing on the minimization of exposure to gambling stimuli, the erosion of intimacy that recovering gamblers must endure, and the necessity of embracing a broader definition of gambling-related harm. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although social media are increasingly used through mobile devices, the differences between mobile and computer-based practices remain unclear. This study attempts to tease out some of these differences through multiple analytical strategies and samples. Drawing on theoretical expectations about the affordances, motivations, and cognition of mobile use, we investigate who uses mobile Facebook, why they use it, and how they use it. To do this, we first compare those who use Facebook only on a PC with those who also use the service on mobile devices. Then, in order to quantify mobile Facebook use, we propose a new set of survey measures to tap into more and less mobile users among the sample of people who access Facebook through multiple modes. These questions serve to validate measures of mobile Facebook use, and allow us to examine how patterns of use relate to user motivations and experiences. Findings revealed important differences between PC-only and mobile users as well as a distinct and reliable measure of mobileness. Whereas motivations for Facebook use did not differ across users, more habitual and absorbing use of Facebook was strongly, positively associated with mobile practices. These findings illustrate that people use mobile Facebook in more automatic and immersive ways that are independent of overall frequency of use or motivations. Implications for the psychological mechanisms involved in mobile communication, as well as survey measurement of social media use, are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The second section—Practices and Performances—complicates the human–technology relationship in ambient play with the introduction of multispecies approaches to ambient play. This section explores the affective qualities of ambient play as the observation of a performance of play becomes an experience of play in and of itself. In Morethan-Human Play, the authors reflect on the role of domestic animals in ambient play as the domestic context is entangled with human and non-human media relations with our pets. As such, this chapter explores non-anthropocentric approaches to media. Waiting to Play focuses on the affect of ambient play, reflecting on “the role of time as game feel” (p. 18). Exploring the idea of our sense of worldly presence through different game media and critiquing the “casual” label of mobile games, this chapter engages with game designers such as Steve Swink and Katherine Isbister to dissect the altered temporal experience when playing a mobile game. Finally, Watching Play is a reflection on the affective performance of mobile gaming in both e-sports and Let’s Play streams; the popularity of watching others’ gameplay challenges our notions of activity, performance, and spectacle. Traditional play is an active and lived experience of playing. However, e-sports and gaming streams as a form of play have become embedded in our contemporary ontologies through the dissemination of ambient play into the playful performance. The culmination of a three-year study, visiting 60 families from five Australian cities (Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, and Brisbane), Ambient Play is a masterful dissection of mobile games as an unwitting facilitator of ambience in our contemporary lives. As Hjorth and Richardson admit, ambient play is embodied through the book as it shifts in and out between the foreground and background of discussion, paralleling ambient play in our everyday lives. In alignment with the changes in haptic reception due to mobile gaming, this study was carried out using tactile digital ethnography and emphasis was placed on the gestures of the research subjects. Having provided a compelling case for the importance of ambient play in our lives, and as the mobile gaming industry continues to grow, studies at the intersections of ambience, society, mobile media, and gaming will continue to flourish.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Any technology adoption is shaped by a myriad of factors that sometimes conflict in their ultimate goals and outcomes. So is the case with mobile Internet (m-Internet) adoption and diffusion. This paper discusses this process from the stakeholders’ and users’ perspectives and confronts their understanding and attitudes towards this technology with three complementary theoretical models: network theory, activity theory, and the technology acceptance model (TAM).The study presents results for the use of m-Internet in a southern European country and frames those in light of the activities, here understood as effects of the network, undertaken by the users. We seek to assess whether individuals perform a different set of activities when using m-Internet and how different forms of access result in different network effects, adoption processes, and distinct forms of interaction. The depicted study involved a qualitative stage, consisting of a set of interviews to stakeholders of the mobile communications industry and a quantitative study that involved the survey of a nationally representative sample of individual users. The findings of these studies provide several contributions to the understanding of m-Internet adoption and diffusion and the role network effects play in them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital back-feeding is a bottom-up process by which younger generations teach or assist older generations in digital access, usage, and literacy. This study aims to examine how two means of digital back-feeding—proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding—might be differently impacted by older adults’ perceptions of smartphone use, as well as their impact on older adults’ digital literacy. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey ( n = 433) was conducted in mainland China. Our findings revealed that perceived usefulness and perceived risk of smartphone use were positively associated with older adults’ engagement with both proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding. Perceived ease of use was found to be negatively associated with older adults’ engagement in proxy back-feeding. In addition, older adults’ digital literacy was found to be negatively associated with proxy back-feeding, but positively associated with learning back-feeding. Results suggest that digital back-feeding is a complicated process that may influence older adults’ digital literacy through different routes, which deserves further investigation to bridge digital divide intergenerationally. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The field of community informatics focuses on how information and communication technology can contribute to the development and sustainability of local communities. The ubiquity of mobile technologies, coupled with their affordances of connecting people and accessing information anytime, anywhere, brings new opportunities for community informatics research. These same affordances also entrain new methodological challenges in capturing and understanding mobile technology use, as mobile-supported interactions can be difficult to study systematically. Such interactions are often situated in complex social and physical settings, such as the local community context. In response to these challenges, we describe the method for scripting events that participants enact within their community and through which we probe how mobile technology impacts community building and vice versa. With the scripted method, we emphasize the need to integrate multiple streams of data and analyses to triangulate and obtain a holistic picture of community interactions. This scripted method is designed to afford ecological validity in employing socially and behaviorally realistic activities, while maintaining some research control, in providing a standard scaffold for participants to enact target behaviors. We discuss how our method could be leveraged in other mobile media communication studies involved in complex social and physical contexts. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we examine one such MVAS, the Nokia Usaha Wanita service running on the Nokia Life+ platform in Indonesia, and we assess its impact as an innovative means for the economic empowerment of businesswomen. Data were gathered through 282 telephone interviews with a nationwide random sample of women who subscribed to Usaha Wanita. Our research found evidence that subscribers derived economic benefit from using the service. Subscribers reported that their business profits were greater, because of what they had learned from reading Usaha Wanita content. Women who were subscribers also had higher “good month’s” profits as well. Increased profits were positively correlated with frequent reading of the tips and information provided by Usaha Wanita and subscriber perception that the service was useful for business. Women who exhibited entrepreneurial optimism also had greater business profits. Findings suggest that entrepreneurial optimism amplified the effect of mobile phone use on profits. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A key guarantor of social trust and a necessary feature of democratic societies is a stable sense of social distance. Social distance is the cultural imaginary within which an individual’s coordinates of social status and contingent social location allow or inhibit contact with similarly and dissimilarly located others. The rearrangement of customary social distances by new communication technologies is a source of considerable social anxiety. In mobile communication, this context collapse is instigated by a distinctive combination of affordances: deep connectivity, the accelerated speed and volume of communicative exchange, enhanced social legibility and asymmetric communicative transparency. Robust and effective levels of social trust depend on a political will to build strong democratic accountability and civil rights guarantees into emerging mobile architectures. Identifying specific recalibrations of familiar social distances by regimes of mobile communication and assessing the effects of these recalibrations in democratic terms is a central task of mobile research. </jats:p>",

We begin by pointing out that mobile phone/smartphone research has dominated MMCS as a field. That focus makes sense, but it runs the risk of MMCS essentially turning into “smartphone studies,” which we argue would limit our impact. To make that case, we identify a few examples of the types of oft-ignored technologies that could add to the depth and breadth of MMCS research (e.g., RFID [radio frequency identification] tags, the Walkman, barcodes). We then summarize the articles in this special issue to categorize the breadth of this research, which ranges from analyses of mobile fans to autonomous cars to mobile infrastructure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Given its role as a constant companion, the mobile phone has long been thought of as an extension of the self. However, the psychology of smartphone self-extension has received relatively little attention through empirical research. By explicating theorized facets of self-extension, we explore the dimensionality of smartphone self-extension and examine how established psychological orientations map onto these dimensions. Results provide support for a two-dimensional structure of self-extension. Specifically, we found that self-extension can be delineated on the extent to which the smartphone is viewed as (a) functional for personal goals and (b) integral to personal identity. Across two studies, habitual usage predicted the functionality dimension and problematic usage predicted the identity dimension. In addition, Study 2 revealed that the two dimensions of self-extension corresponded to different dimensions of smartphone vigilance. We discuss the importance of conceptualizing smartphone self-extension as a perceptual construct, as well as the challenges of measuring the psychological connection that exists – or is thought to exist – between self and phone. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the number of mobile phone subscribers increasing across all sections of society, this paper aims to understand if homeless women in shelter-homes of India have access to mobile phones and, if so, what are their usage patterns. Facilitated by issues ranging from domestic violence to lack of employment to forced migration and even to human trafficking and rape, women residing in the shelter-homes of India have a myriad of stories to tell. Not all of them have been on streets forever and many have the basic literacy to understand how to use a mobile phone. For the purposes of the study, the researchers engaged with women above 18 years of age up to the age of 45 in a series of open-ended interviews to understand their access to mobile phones and contextualize their homelessness within an affordances-based framework for mobile phone access. This paper takes into account the dual barriers of gender and the lack of a home to study the digital divide experienced by homeless women in India, expanding on how both these factors shape their access and usage, eventually bridging the digital divide, and whether mobile phones are required/desired by the women themselves. The study found that the women staying in shelter-homes see a window of hope in their use of mobile phones in the form of an independent financial future or an independent marital life, but the biased perception of using a mobile phone among women hinders women’s access to and use of these devices, which ultimately results in the loss of any kind of opportunity before it has even been explored, perhaps leading to the loss of a chance at a bright future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reports the findings of a multi-method study that explored whether frequency and duration of parental smartphone use in the presence of children is associated with parents’ perceptions of quality time and child restlessness, an indicator of difficult child behavior. Additionally, the study explored whether parental perceptions of technoference, respectively time displacement, mediate the association between smartphone use measures - respectively frequency and duration of use - and the outcome measures. We collected experience sampling and smartphone log data among parents of children aged between 4 and 10 years to assess momentary between- and within-person-level associations between the frequency and duration of co-present parental smartphone use and parents’ perceptions of quality time, their child's restlessness, technoference, and time displacement. We gathered 1484 observations from 56 participants. Multilevel mediation analysis revealed no between-person associations between our two measures of parental smartphone use and the outcome measures. At the within-person level, no associations were found with child restlessness. However, smartphone frequency did predict perceptions of greater technoference, and smartphone duration predicted time displacement. Technoference in turn negatively predicted parental experiences, although the hypothesized mediation did not reach statistical significance. Time displacement predicted parental experiences of quality time in the opposite direction of what was hypothesized. Some heterogeneity was found in the observed within-person associations, suggesting that there is person-specificity. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies on mobile phone attachment have often focused on addiction to the mobile phone with a particular focus on young populations to the neglect of older ones. However, attachment to the mobile phone means more than addiction as experienced by young populations in developed nations. This paper attempts to explore the various forms of attachment across a working population in Africa. It is aimed at establishing the forms of attachment to the mobile phone and their possible sociodemographic variations. Data was collected from 374 used-clothing traders in Accra, using a mixed-methods approach. Employing the conversion framework from domestication theory, a thematic analysis showed that attachment to mobile phone use is culturally specific. A principal component analysis revealed five types of attachment with significant variations across age, gender, and level of education. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The regulatory jewel of the South Pacific: Samoa’s decade of telecommunications reform",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the last decade Samoa significantly reformed its telecommunications sector. It introduced a new competitor—Digicel—into the market, privatised the state-owned company SamoaTel (now Bluesky Samoa) and established an independent regulator. These reforms have had a dramatic impact on mobile usage in Samoa, and now mobile phones and regular Internet access have become an everyday (and affordable) reality for a vast majority of the population. This paper provides a critical account of one of the most mature mobile markets in the Pacific region. Drawing on semistructured key informant interviews with individuals in the Samoan telecommunications sector and the public service (conducted in April 2014), the paper explores the emergence of a Samoan digital culture, a transformation which has only been possible thanks to the widespread take up of mobile phones on 3G networks. We outline how mobiles are being used in Samoa, the ways in which they integrate (or don’t) with existing social and cultural norms and discuss the wider infrastructural issues that have emerged in light of this increased usage. We end by reflecting on what the Samoan experience can tell us about telecommunications reform in developing countries more generally. </jats:p>",

Such messages may also offer response options, which create bilateral communications with potential voters. This article examines responsiveness to political text messages during election campaigns and the factors that affect such responsiveness, using a natural experiment in which the campaign headquarters of 3 municipal candidates sent text messages to the residents of 3 municipalities. Findings indicate that response rates ranged from 4% to 18%, which approximate the response rates to marketing campaigns and other forms of text-based political participation. Age and gender did not have a significant effect on response rates, but message personalization (texts that include recipient identity) and response mode (text reply/landing page) did. These findings offer new empirical evidence of certain patterns of mobile interactions that encourage political participation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study initiates a line of research on how the fifth generation of wireless infrastructure (“5G”) is being imagined through media portrayals—in this case through advertising. At the time of this writing, 5G is not yet widely available, however the media is saturated with narratives about how it will revolutionize everyday life. Drawing from the social imaginaries and media infrastructures traditions, this textual analysis examines the social shaping of 5G through advertisements from leading telecoms in leading markets, including China and the United States. Findings reveal an overarching trend with ads from both societies imagining 5G in futuristic and utopian ways, suggesting new possibilities for people, objects, and places to be connected through smart homes, vehicles, factories, and cities—not just through smart phones. The findings also reveal distinctions in how 5G is envisioned at the societal level. For example, ads from China imagine 5G as a source of national pride that will elevate its global standing, while the US telecoms have a more inward focus on domestic competition. The discussion offers interpretations of these and other findings, along with directions for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many aspects of our lives, such as work, socializing, schooling, and play, were confined to the home. In this assemblage (Watson et al., 2021), how we think about mobility, placemaking, public space, health, and play has been reconfigured (Hjorth & Lammes, 2020). Mobile games have a long history with regard to their ability to activate public spaces, creating feelings of connection and resilience in playful and inventive ways. In pandemic times, the ambient play of mobile games, that is, moving in and out of the background to the rhythm of everyday life, has taken on new currencies (Hjorth & Richardson, 2020). This short provocation piece explores how location-based mobile games can play a powerful role in how we reimagine, activate, and reinhabit urban spaces and placemaking as we move out of the pandemic. As we argue, games can address some of the challenges advanced by the pandemic in relation to public health messaging, crisis management, and making playful ways to connect together for a better new normal. In the United States, overall videogame internet traffic increased by 75% when COVID-19 restrictions were imposed (M.B., 2020). As the heightened threat of viral contagion gripped the popular imaginary, the debates about screen time, and especially games, shifted. Even the World Health Organization, which in 2019 officially registered game addiction as a mental health disorder, has recognized the communicative power and",

    "abstract": "The software presented is reviewed in https://doi.org/10.1177/20501579231155533 Link: http://database.mglab.chass.ncsu.edu/ Mobile games have become woven into the fabric of daily life, as individuals carry their phones with them on the go, squeezing in moments of play or setting aside specific playtimes. Since the release of the iPhone 3G and the App Store in 2008, the number of mobile games has increased substantially, reflecting what Mäyrä (2015) refers to as a growing and increasingly complex genre. Nevertheless, mobile games are not new; they have been around since at least the 1970s, serving as ground-building components of today’s mobile, ludic and digital cultures. Despite their significance, early mobile games pose challenges to research. The earliest mobile gaming platforms, such asl Mattel Football and Nintendo Game & Watch, were handheld electronic consoles. Although many of these games were popular at their time of inception, they are often no longer on the market, making them difficult or expensive to acquire. By the 1990s, mobile phones also became important platforms for mobile gameplay –with games, such as Tetris and Snake, being redesigned for mobile phones. However, these games became unplayable with the release of new operating systems, and, similar to handheld consoles, these mobile phones can be difficult and expensive to acquire. Finally, in the early 2000s, several media artists, startup companies, and academic researchers started to experiment with mobile devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, as interfaces for gameplay (Flintham et al., 2001; Sotamaa, 2002; Wagenknecht & Korn, 2016). However, these early games were often unavailable to the general public because they were restricted to small research or artistic circles. In addition, since the nature of these games was generally ephemeral (i.e., they were played during a specific timeframe in a specific location and then disappeared), it is difficult to find documentation or historical accounts about them, unless a researcher knows specifically how to search for them with exact titles, keywords and creators. Collectively, these challenges limit our knowledge about the history of mobile games and make it difficult to identify correlations between contemporary and early mobile gaming cultures.

Whether conflict over resources, knowledge, or territory, to name a few types, games challenge players to overcome obstacles in interesting and fun ways. Pokémon Go challenges players to find and capture Pokémon, which requires time, patience, skill, and the freedom to access the game map (i.e., spaces in the real world) to its fullest extent. When players are denied full access, either through a technical glitch in the game—like when a server crashes or when networks become unavailable—or through real or imagined threats of violence or harassment, the game becomes inherently unfair. How might we make sense of issues of accessibility, privilege, and race raised by the game?

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using Apple’s Screen Time application to obtain reported actual iPhone and social media (SM) use, we examined the accuracy of retrospective estimates of usage, how inaccuracies bias associations between use and psychosocial well-being (depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction), and the degree to which inaccuracies were predicted by levels of well-being. Among a sample of 325 iPhone users, we found that (a) participants misestimated their weekly overall iPhone and SM use by 19.1 and 12.2 hours, respectively; (b) correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were consistently stronger than the correlations between reported actual use and well-being variables; and (c) the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use was associated with levels of participant well-being and amount of use. These findings suggest that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be systematically biased by factors that are fundamental to the associations under investigation. We propose that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be capturing the construct of perceived use rather than actual use, and discuss how the antecedents, correlates, and consequences of perceived use may be distinct from those of actual use. Implications of these findings are discussed in view of the ongoing debate surrounding the effects of digital technology use on well-being. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the significance of user-distributed content (UDC) for news consumption, thereby offering an innovative take on mass communication and the participatory audience. From the viewpoint of media organizations, UDC is a process by which the mass media converge with online social networks through the intentional use of social media and other platforms and services in an effort to expand the distribution of media content. In order to focus specifically on mobile news consumption, this paper sheds light on the novel phenomenon of mobile user-distributed content (mobile UDC). Mobile UDC is manifested in mobile users’ ability to share online media content on a perpetual and ubiquitous basis. The study utilizes the results from a survey carried out with Finnish Internet users. The main finding is that mobile Internet users are more active in UDC than those who do not use the Internet with mobile devices. It is thus argued that mobile UDC, as a developing concept, can be used to explain the practices that are characteristic of mobile online news consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "and their surrounding cultural objects (e.g., Apple’s app store) and processes (e.g., cloud computing). “Prosthetics” provides readers with perspectives on the capabilities of apps to enhance or correct human attributes. In “The App as an Extension of Man’s Desires,” Eric Kluitenberg deems apps imaginary media or “machines that mediate impossible desires” (p. 100). Imaginary media draw from basic “human desires and anxieties” (p. 102) to provide solutions to a myriad of perceived human deficiencies. For example, productivity apps promise their users efficiency and feelings of agency. However, Kluitenberg argues that these apps ultimately undermine agency by obscuring the material conditions that caused the perceived lacks. He further notes that it is apps’ “delivery of partial solutions” (p. 108) that ensures users’ continued reliance on them, thereby perpetuating the app economy. The third section, “Economics,” positions apps as commodities and provides insightful analyses of their influences on labor and their economic repercussions. The initial chapter, Nick Dyer-Witheford’s “App Worker,” focuses on the symbiotic, but ultimately imbalanced, economic relationship between app developers and Apple’s and Google’s software engineers who provide the platform. And while Google, Apple, and their standards dominate North American smartphone markets, this is not true for all markets as discussed in Dal Yong Jin and Steven Millward’s chapter “Construction of the App Economy in the Networked Korean Society” and Millward’s “What China’s Netizens Want: Building Tech Ecosystems in the World’s Toughest Market.” These chapters provide a welcome shift from the primarily western views constituting the rest of the volume, to reveal the economic norms associated with app societies across the globe. “Remediations,” the final section, offers some alternative views on the nature of apps and their utility. Lev Manovich’s chapter “The Language of Media Software” argues that apps and other software are “metamediums” (p. 192) capable of simulating the affordances of any other medium. In contrast, Thierry Bardini’s chapter views apps as “charming junkware” that clutter our devices and prey on our addiction to them. Indeed, the critical reimaginings and creative interpretations of apps that form the final section concretizes the value of this playful yet rigorous collection for mobile media or digital humanities scholars looking to understand apps on a more critical level.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing global ubiquity of mobile phones has called into question their efficacy as dynamic tools for engagement and participation in daily life. While there is little argument in their growth as primary communication tools, scholars have actively debated their role as conduits for dynamic and diverse, information flow. This study explores how an international cohort of university students uses mobile phones for daily communication and information needs. In spring 2012, 793 students from 8 universities on 3 continents participated in a 24-hour mobile tracking exercise and reflection to answer the questions: How are college students using mobile phones for daily communication and information needs? and, how do college students perceive of the role of mobile phones for communication and information needs in their daily lives? The findings point to a population tethered to their mobile devices primarily through social networking apps, to the extent that they find it increasingly difficult to distinguish relationships that exist in their pockets from those that exist in their physical surroundings. While the participants acknowledged the diverse and participatory capacity of mobile devices, their dependence on the phone for connecting to peers left them skeptical of the phone’s efficacy for productive connectivity, vibrant communication, and diverse information consumption in daily life. The study concludes with suggestions for more inclusive and active engagement in the dynamic potential of phones that are not necessitated by a response to large-scale political or civil injustices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technological resistance practices hold significant insights regarding the media’s role as much as its adoption and usage practices. However, studies examining media non-use have generally overlooked mobile phone resisters—individuals voluntarily deciding not to own mobile phones. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with mobile phone refusers, this study presents two refuser types differing in refusal dynamics. The first are ideologists, whose rejection stems from a formulated, critical worldview towards the mobile phone, in particular, and communication technologies, in general. The second are realizers, whose “post-factum resistance” resulted from a forced but positive experience of a temporary break in use (e.g., when their device was broken or stolen), motivating them to disconnect in an attempt to preserve the new, liberated space they experienced. Additional findings reveal the non-ownership practices adopted by the mobile phone refusers; the novel psychological and sociological motives underlying mobile phone refusal concerning the home space and digital well-being; refuser resistance discourse, which focuses solely on the medium’s nature and not its content; and how refusers negotiate the social status and stigma that accompanies their mobile phone refusal. Our study illustrates how mobile phone refusal stands apart from other media resistance, providing a deeper perspective on the price of connectivity, and thus underscoring the importance of studying these refusers. The uniqueness of mobile phone refusal is further expressed in its complexity, extremity, perceived authenticity, and visibility. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although the ubiquitous connectivity afforded by mobile media brings benefits to people’s work, social, and leisure lives, these benefits are sometimes overshadowed by the burdens of 24/7 connectivity, which challenge the well-being of individuals and society. Digital well-being is an emerging concept that refers to how people experience these benefits and burdens. This Special Issue brings together five articles that push the boundaries of digital well-being research by shedding light on the opportunities and challenges that people experience in relation to mobile connectivity, exploring the role of digital disconnection for digital well-being, and theorizing the conceptual underpinnings of digital well-being. In this editorial, we first give a definitional overview of the digital well-being concept and situate it in the field of mobile media and communication scholarship. Next, we identify two key issues that emerge from the Special Issue, and explain how the individual articles further our understanding of them. These issues are: (a) the strong conceptual link between digital well-being and digital disconnection; and (b) the conceptual difference between digital well-being as a psychological condition and as a socio-cultural artefact. To end, we present a future research agenda on digital well-being by first identifying current knowledge gaps, and next highlighting several themes that we anticipate as crucial in the forthcoming decade of digital well-being research in an age of mobile connectivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Internet has been a valuable resource for many indigenous groups as a vehicle for self-representation. In this paper, we describe how the installation of a Wi-Fi signal in a Guaraní community in Greater Buenos Aires—as part of the community leader’s decolonizing media projects—generated issues within the community. While much indigenous media research concerns the politics of cultural representation, we consider the politics of everyday, intracommunity mobile communication practices. Firstly, our findings show how the choice of communication medium can become a political issue. An upsurge in mobile-mediated communication within the community contributed to the decline of face-to-face deliberations, which were the mainstay of communal sharing arrangements and which held a central position in understandings of Guaraní culture. Secondly, our findings show how discrepancies between users’ communication preferences and the readily available mobile media services can generate a use barrier by deterring users from obtaining the skills needed to effectively appropriate or transform mobile media services. Familiarity with a few mainstream social media apps not only reinforced imaginaries of the Internet as a nonindigenous space but also generated set ideas of what the Internet supports in terms of communicative form—social networking—and content type—mainstream media. In the end, the community leader’s decolonizing projects, aimed at using social media for community media dissemination, were not only rejected by community members but also undermined by the dynamics of mobile media practices in the community. We argue that limited mobile technology skills combined with commercially oriented mobile media services can hinder creative and adaptable mobile media practices, and in turn, undermine decolonizing mobile appropriations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Older people use mobile telephones extensively, yet little is known about the relevant domestication processes. Employing usage variety as an indicator, this study explores levels of mobile phone incorporation among older users, based on an online cross-European survey of 1,039 individuals aged 60 and up. Results displayed a four-level pyramid structure of mobile phone incorporation with voice calling at its base, proceeding through basic functions and Internet-based functions to media player at its apex. The two upper levels were negatively associated with reported “old” media use (e.g., television, radio) and positively correlated with use of more advanced technology-based media. Younger age, higher education and income, work force participation, and residence in Italy or Israel predicted higher levels of mobile phone incorporation. The findings suggested that the incorporation phase of mobile phone domestication by older Internet users comprises various subphases and that level of incorporation depends on one’s personal and cultural background. Furthermore, results demonstrated that mobile phones replace old media to some extent and complement the use of other new media. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Love at first swipe? Explaining Tinder self-presentation and motives",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of location-based real-time dating (LBRTD) apps such as Tinder has introduced a new way for users to get to know potential partners nearby. The design of the apps represents a departure from “old-school” dating sites as it relies on the affordances of mobile media. This might change the way individuals portray themselves as their authentic or deceptive self. Based on survey data collected via Mechanical Turk and using structural equation modeling, we assess how Tinder users present themselves, exploring at the same time the impact of their personality characteristics, their demographics, and their motives of use. We find that self-esteem is the most important psychological predictor, fostering real self-presentation but decreasing deceptive self-presentation. The motives of use—hooking up/sex, friendship, relationship, traveling, self-validation, and entertainment—also affect the two forms of self-presentation. Demographic characteristics and psychological antecedents influence the motives for using Tinder, with gender differences being especially pronounced. Women use Tinder more for friendship and self-validation, while men use it more for hooking up/sex, traveling, and relationship seeking. We put the findings into context, discuss the limitations of our approach and provide avenues for future research into the topic. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mundane citizenship on the move: A counter-public response to inbound shopping tourism via mobile social media applications use",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using digital ethnography to examine the daily mobile (micro)blogging (moblogging) practices of local residents as they confronted a wave of inbound shopping tourists in pre-Covid-19 pandemic Hong Kong, this article explores how the latest mode of mundane citizenship emerges from the communicative mobility of urban dwellers equipped with mobile phones and social media applications (apps). Recent research on the role of mobile devices and social media apps in citizen participation has focused on more visible forms of civic–political events, such as protests and voting, and tended to neglect the effects of mobile communication performed during banal travel and quotidian activities. This article offers an alternative reading of the relevance of mobile social media (MSM) in contemporary public lives by examining how they open up new temporalities and spatialities for counter-public engagement in the contexts of mundane urban mobility. The findings demonstrate various moblogging practices that entail modalities of counter-public engagement that traverse the personal, proto-political, and communal, and reveal how local residents used these modalities to articulate alternative public agendas, connect acts of consumer activism, and perform communal belonging vis-à-vis inbound shopping tourism amid their daily routines and modest journeys. Focusing on mobile socialities enabled by smartphones and networking apps, this article explicates how contemporary moblogging can, on the one hand, extend people's capacity to engage in citizen talk and connective action, while on the other hand, allow them to flexibly connect and contribute personal photobiographies and narratives to counter-public communities. By unpacking the novel pathways to citizen participation, it offers insights into new ways in which everyday mobile communication can be transformed into public involvement, albeit often in agonistic and emotional forms, and the role of MSM in this process. </jats:p>",
