In this article, I will make the case for reparative reading as a consciously political project, inspired by Sedgwick’s deep commitment to making oppositional strategy, and bring this understanding in critical conversation with some examples of its uptake during the post-critical “reparative turn” in the Humanities. I further posit that Sedgwick was already engaging in such reparative projects even before she explicitly theorized this practice through a close-reading of her 1991 article ‘Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl.’ My overarching argument is that reparative reading, while at times misappropriated, can still provide the foundation for a larger project of queer repair – a prefigurative politics of the imagination.\r\n </jats:p>",

This article brings together the concept of the Plantationocene, an era marked by the iniquitous movement of people and seeds, with scholarship on the pharmakon, or the poisonous as well as therapeutic potentials of technologies, to interpret ethnographic field research with drone activists and drone engineers in Indonesia.

Its notes that Hermanâ€™s contribution has often been underappreciated due to Chomskyâ€™s enormous stature as a public intellectual, and argues that as the principal author of the â€˜propaganda modelâ€™ Herman made a significant contribution to scholarly and public understanding of the private news media. It notes a number of weaknesses in Manufacturing Consent, some of which are well known and have been addressed by the authors: an overemphasis on â€˜closureâ€™ and homogeneity in media systems, and a related â€˜media centrismâ€™ that may engender a certain political fatalism; an underdeveloped conception of the role of ideology; and a lack of empirical evidence on the operation of the five â€˜filtersâ€™ as casual mechanisms giving rise to media content. It concludes that such weaknesses notwithstanding, Hermanâ€™s model is an exemplary piece of sociological theorising, and is only deterministic or simplistic insofar as it is ambitious and schematic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The eavesdropper and the onlooker have become models of activist potential. Their proximity to enactments of racist and gendered social violence, and their abilities to witness, record and disseminate records of this violence via smartphones and social media networks, define some of the conditions for social change around the situations in which bystanders are located online. Drawing from John Peters’ analysis of eavesdropping as the transformation of private talk into public communication, this article examines the contemporary activist reclamation of eavesdropping and onlooking as small-scale, networked conditions of social transformation. Imagined as small acts of intervention tied to participation in contemporary social media environments, their models of social change leverage the positionality of the eavesdropper and the onlooker, transforming the “listening in” that people do on social media and elsewhere into acts of agentic response. In the process, they recode the conditions in which harm is enacted from being surveilled online into conditions that also enable activist intervention. \r\n </jats:p>",

In this paper, I use three cases of socially engaged art archival practices â€“ namely, Archive for Human Activities (AHA!), â€œThe Day Afterâ€ and â€œSocially Engaged Art (SEA) CHINAâ€ â€“ to illustrate how artists in East Asia utilize archives as a means of social and individual articulation and conversation.

Through the adoption of digital technologies and fetishization of data above all, it has centralized its strategies in the hands of an elite class of overconfident political experts and number-crunchers whose practices are characterized by the rapid platformization and professionalization of party processes. Placing these changes in the context of the partyâ€™s long history of control, this manifesto critiques these practices, particularly the use of predictive analytics and the inability to see volunteers beyond tools to gather and input data. It argues that the party needs to focus on collaborative, grassroots party-building activities and leadership development of local volunteers. Its focus must shift from one of control to one that encourages and emphasizes contention and pluralism as positive aspects of democracy rather than as problems to be obscured or controlled.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper will describe BATTERCTRAX, an experimental geolocative media project undertaken during 2014. It examines the possibility that cinematic media (in this case audio from films) can be repurposed within an immersive, mobile heritage guide. The paper will describe the project in broad terms but will focus on certain unexpected and unusual perceptual effects generated during the test phase of the project. BATTERCTRAX began as an adjunct to a larger academic initiative called Cinematic Geographies of Battersea: Urban Interface and Site-Specific Spatial Knowledge, a collaboration between Liverpool, Cambridge and Edinburgh Universities and English Heritage. Amongst many outcomes, Cinematic Geographies built a comprehensive database of films shot in the London district of Battersea, which created ways to mobilise historic moving images for the analysis of social and material change in cities. As a tangential outcome of this project, BATTERCTRAX was a mobile phone app that played audio content from feature films, documentaries and TV shows at the places where they were originally recorded. The user would walk through clusters of GPS-enabled geofences in the test zone of Battersea Park, triggering a succession of historic cinematic sounds from across the 20th century. However, by anchoring fictional audio content to the places of their origin, BATTERCTRAX appeared to create a sense of dissonance between sensory stimulants, destabilising a sense of perceptual cohesion in the user. These novel effects lead the researchers to speculate that such technology could not only be used to construct highly immersive, location-based urban experiences, but that it could also trigger psychoactive effects in ways that media developers and users had not anticipated. This paper will propose that geolocative media has the ability to tap into unexplored realms of \"collective\" cultural memory, but can also elicit unexpected psychological and perceptual responses.</jats:p>",

This article provides an accessible introduction to the French critic of the art of technology Paul Virilio’s writings on the new media of what Virilio calls ‘the information bomb’ and ‘the overexposed city’. Steering the reader through this crucial thinker’s often challenging work, the article considers Virilio’s ongoing impact on present-day critical new media theory by contrasting it with that of the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler. With extensive discussion of Virilio’s and Stiegler’s very different technological and spatial viewpoints and careful appreciation for questions concerning contemporary temporality, the article guides the reader through part of the electronic labyrinth that is new media.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article argues that Wilfrid Sellars’ work has implications for the notion of medium (and media) and how we discuss it in cultural and media theory. The research introduces Sellarsian materialism, which is both non-dualist and non-reductionist with respect to conception, in the context of Media Theory and traces within it an otherwise implicit articulation of the notion of medium that, is argued, becomes necessary when accounting for the working of rules of validity in a manner that does not naturalise the normative. The article, which begins by putting Sellars in dialogue with authors influenced by Kittler’s work, mobilizes Sellars’ writings on language acquisition and epistemology to show how a notion of medium emerges in Sellarsian philosophy of language, as a consequence of a non-dualist account of validity in linguistic behaviour. This notion explains the relation between language and conception: language can be described as the medium of conception, as opposed to being its means of expression or identified with conception.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article aims to contribute to the burgeoning exchange between media theory and the environmental humanities by considering the ecological implications of contemporary digital technology in relation to user experience. It does so by arguing for a reconceptualization of the classic philosophical concept of the pharmakon. This concept, which underlines how technology is always simultaneously poison and cure, has been mobilized to assess how human perceptual and sensory capacities are both augmented and curtailed by technology. However, as this article demonstrates through a reorientation of the work of pharmacology’s prime philosopher Bernard Stiegler, familiar interpretations of the pharmakon exhibit an important shortcoming: such interpretations fail to consider how the ostensibly curative perceptual effects of technology may be supported by the propagation of poison elsewhere. This quandary is argued to be especially pressing in light of the dominant digital design philosophy of frictionlessness: in order to facilitate increasingly convenient user experiences, contemporary technology exploits but also increasingly hides its material conditions of production from view. Underlining the pharmacological ramifications of frictionlessness, the article concludes by suggesting that an environmentally sustainable pharmacology would mean appending the common definition of the digital user with a second definition: the user as a usurping subject whose supposedly frictionless experience is pharmacologically facilitated by and perceptually divested of vast networks of exploitation and environmental destruction.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Ruts of Gentrification: Breaking the Surface of Vienna's Changing Cityscape",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Last year, the city of Vienna celebrated the 150-year anniversary of the opening of the Ringstrasse, the central ring road that stands as symbol of the huge structural renewal that accompanied the transformation of the Habsburg empire’s capital into a rapidly growing modern city. The anniversary acquired poignancy on account of the way Vienna’s population is once again growing rapidly, with an estimated ¼ million people to be added to the city’s population over the next decade. While accommodating urban migrants was not a priority in Ringstrasse Vienna, and working class districts are not part of iconic mapped mediations, the current city council, a coalition of Social Democrats and the Green Party, studiously tries to avoid 19th-century urban modernity’s “mistakes” in their efforts to accommodate the growing population, and they let the Viennese, and the world, know. This time, GIS and digital mapping are mobilized for planning, mediating and communicating large-scale development and renewal projects.\r\nThis paper looks at the mediations of three crucial sites of contemporary urban transformation in Vienna that mobilize the affordances of new technologies: “Loftcity,” a loft development cum cultural centre on the site of one of Vienna’s largest factories, the Ankerbrotfabrik; the transformation of the district surrounding Vienna’s new Hauptbahnhof; and Aspern, “Vienna’s Urban Lakeside,” a new satellite town promoted as a city of the future. By comparing the historical traces that remain in the mediations of these sites with their 19th-century counterparts, a geocritical reading of Vienna’s gentrification emerges that situates spatial practices in historically grown lines of connectivity, presaging and transcending traditional forms of classification, such as national divides or urban/suburban dichotomies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How to tell “good” critique from “bad” critique, meaningful encounter from opinionated tokenism, or a genuine investment in political emancipation from the cartoonish contrivances of a recuperated emancipatory gesture refolded as empty pastiche? This paper begins with the assumption that we can no longer make any such distinctions. What if all critique nowadays is a spectacle, or perhaps better described, not as critique at all, but merely the proliferation of opinion and criticism? Merely the “unreflective to-and-fro of claim and counter-claim” (MacKenzie, 2004: 6), the “anarchic debris of [already] circulated knowledge” (Badiou, 2001: 50), mere “propositions ... defined by their reference” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1994: 22), by the relationships with what has been said before and what will be inevitably said after. What if the pertinent question is not whether we can tell “good” critique from “bad” critique, but in the wake of all contemporary communication becoming repetitive and impotent, why do we insist on talking at all? And what if, in light of all this, the only potentially radical response is to remain silent? To find “little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say” (Deleuze, 1997: 129). A conjuring of the gentleness, the quiet solemnity and the right to have nothing to say is perhaps the condition that has a “chance of framing the rare, or even rarer, thing that might be worth saying” (Deleuze, 1997: 129).\r\n </jats:p>",

Results suggest that analog and digital maps generate different virtual images of space, while the navigational use of digital maps in particular generates multiple representations of the territory. The mediation of different narrations and the description of encounters within the Person-Place-Process triad helped us to establish the importance of in-between places for a complete conceptualization of place.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>During WWII a particular type of face mask was designed for and distributed to children, referred to as ‘Mickey Mouse’ respirators due to their distinctive form and colour. Some of these masks contained asbestos in their filters. Asbestos is a toxic substance that is now banned in over 50 countries. Here we have a case in which a material used for protection from toxicity proves itself to be toxic. In other words, asbestos-filter gas masks function as both remedy and poison – a pharmakon. As such, these masks embody the double logic of the materiality of the media condition, which is advanced in this article through a discussion of the materiality of masks from what I call a media-pharmacological perspective. The article takes asbestos and plastic as key substances that mediate the relationship between the body and its environment in the form of masks. This translates into a discussion of harm and protection within this material register. The substances here provide a link between the material use and politics of masking with its aesthetics.\r\n </jats:p>",

It then raises questions about the political effects of critique in contemporary culture and its potential to trigger counter-productive or unwanted results.

The subsequent examination of ‘diffusion’ as a key concept that underpins the text-to-image generation process leads to some broader questions about the ongoing instability and dissolution of our current epistemological and political frameworks. Taking seriously the charge issued by some critics equating developments in generative AI with nihilism or even fascism, the article considers whether the current socio-technical moment can also offer some emancipatory possibilities.

This article considers the relationship between image creation, illusion, and the notion of space in multimodal models. The photographic form of AI-generated images, coupled with a lack of understanding or experience of space undergirding their creation, reveals the illusion and artifice that is part of all photography.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores how Berlant’s concept of ‘genre flailing’ offers productive ways of understanding the circulation and sharing of memes during the Covid-19 pandemic. It focuses on our collaborative research project that deployed Feel Tanks to consider experiences of pandemic time, and specifically on how one participant unexpectedly responded to research prompts with a series of disjointed memes. Genre flailing refers to the thrashing around that happens when conventions and expectations about the world are paused or ruptured. Through the text, we grapple with the memes to explore their flailing as research data, as a response to the invitations extended in the Feel Tanks, as a popular pandemic medium, and more widely as a genre. We work with Berlant’s emphasis on embracing irresolution and their attentiveness to unfolding scenes of encounter which we argue offer valuable frameworks for sense-making with media and popular culture amidst crisis and uncertainty.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, I show how Berlant offers important resources for thinking about the relationship between affect, mediation and global nationalism, and for considering how to build alternative forms of belonging. These resources include: how they address people’s sense of belonging to an affective space, and how they map the affective states that form part of living in the present under late capitalism. In these ways, Berlant offers material for helping us understand why nationalist ways of understanding belonging should appear so persistent, and continue to provide convincing narratives of attachment. The article goes on to outline methodological approaches pursued by Berlant, which I suggest others interested in engaging the mediation of national affects can adopt. This includes paying attention to moments that do not appear to form significant “national events”. Taken together, I demonstrate how these different elements can teach us a substantial amount about the rise of global nationalism.  \r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Postcritique is the name given to a recent intellectual trend which opposes the practices of suspicion and theoretical abstraction in literary and cultural studies. Its proponents champion the alternative dispositions and epistemologies of attachment, hopefulness, and care (Anker &amp; Felski, 2017; Felski, 2015). Embedded in a longer and broader intellectual current encompassing the humanities and social sciences, postcritique crystallizes a set of critical sensibilities particularly compelling for our contemporary historical conjuncture. We delineate these sensibilities by examining works on postcritique in literary and cultural studies, briefly discuss critical expressions of such sensibilities in the 1960s and 1970s, and link them to related work in the social sciences. We then present three vignettes from our research on the COVID-19 pandemic to illustrate how an ethos of openness, hopefulness, and vulnerability may inform the study of the catastrophic experiences of an ongoing global pandemic. The three vignettes highlight the importance of documenting and understanding emotional experiences through digital media such as mobile-phone photography, audio diaries, and podcasting.\r\n </jats:p>",

Gibsonâ€™s concept of perceptual affordances has a long history, particularly within the field of human computer interaction (HCI) where the concept has been used in various ways to address both the material and cultural requirements of interactive systems. New modes of digital media which look to engage a range of affordances as present in contemporary smartphone platforms offer an opportunity to rethink this critical divide within the use of the concept of affordances. Defining a concordance between Gibsonâ€™s use of the term and Manuel DeLandaâ€™s theory of assemblages, it becomes possible to chart the networks of affordances present in the interaction with and function of these new media forms. Through an analysis of Kate Pullingerâ€™s Breathe, a redefined understanding of the possibilities of affordances is developed, one that is concerned with both the materiality of the system itself and the speculative frame that is developed.\r\n </jats:p>",

The locative mobile application that we have produced, Global Urban Wilds, complicates notions of time, space, and preservation in ruderal landscapes that survive in city spaces, demonstrating that they come into tension with layers of biodiversity, technological development, and settler culture in urban contexts such as MontrÃ©al, Canada.

Providing an overview of my long-term ethnographic, historical, and web-based research on digital death care practices, I highlight some of the techniques that constitute breakdown as a method of scholarly inquiry. I present screenshots as mourning objects and breakdown research tools. The screenshot represents and captures a distinct point of view and provides material evidence for slippery, ephemeral communications even as the screenshot, as a media object, is subject to decay. Drawing on temporally-oriented or ethnographic approaches to studying dynamic social media cultures (Bonilla, 2015; Christin, 2020; Karpf, 2012; Seaver, 2017) in addition to the work of John Durham Peters, I position breakdown as a method befitting fragile digital social worlds. I argue that death, through the practice of screenshotting, provides a framework for grasping the transcendent capacities and material limits of technologies.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Memory, movement and mobility characterise our everyday being. Our bodies are in constant processes of motion: our body remembers movement. Memory of movement, of and in the body, is key to our capacity to move, even if we are not aware that we are remembering movement. Mobility with, from, and in the body is (re)produced and performed by a repertoire of movements, orchestrated (for the most part) synchronously. While studies of mobility have received much recent scholarly attention, the interlinkages between memory, movement and mobility have received far less attention (see Anderson, 2004 and Casey, 2000 for notable exceptions). In redressing this omission, this paper delves into the relationship between memory, movement and mobility by directing its lens on two themes: body memory, that is memory of and in the body felt through movement, and movement and mobility, that is how mobility influences our capacities to remember, what we remember while mobile, and how specific sites of memory are designed with mobility in mind. \r\nI consider intersections of mobility and memory in the context of empirical work undertaken at sites of Singaporean World War II commemoration. I used my body as a tool for this research; I felt and read memory at the memorial sites. I also used movement through the sites. Being mobile prompted consideration of how movement, spontaneous and along designed pathways, at/through/with these memory sites, influenced memory, its (re)production, transmission and/or performance.</jats:p>",

Where Stability AI proceeds through direct appropriation, the stock agency proceeds through contractual appropriation using its dominant position in the market. The article discusses Getty Images’ release of an image generator trained on its own image collection and critically reflects on the stock agency’s attempt to insert its contractual engine in the core of the generative AI technology, making copyright the regulating principle of the relations of ownership of the system and the principle that constrains the range of images it can produce.</jats:p>",

This article will explore photography’s rather unsettled relation to media and media theory by drawing on the writings of Vilém Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, and Bernard Stiegler, who have all — albeit in different ways — positioned the emergence of photography in the 19th century as a signal event in the history of media. Photography marks the point at which cultures long organized around ‘writing’ began to cede ground to cultures in which ‘technological images’ play a growing role. In the 21st century it has become increasingly common to ask whether photography remains faithful to its past or has become something else. My approach here is slightly different: what does the historical transformation of photography tell us about how we understand ‘media’ in the present?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the entanglement of human perception and machine operations in contemporary photographic culture, using montage as a conceptual resource to interrogate our understanding of photography in the context of computational vision and algorithmic culture. It takes as a key example the ‘Memories’ feature of the Apple Photos application, in which ‘For You’ albums organize and (re)present images from a personal camera roll back to the viewer-user as a slideshow montage. Through a combination of technical analysis and auto-ethnography, it argues that the relation between stillness and motion in this instantiation of montage offers a productive way of understanding what it means to ‘see photographically’ within the contemporary socio-technical assemblages that comprise digital photography.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay takes on Lauren Berlant’s mapping of intimacy as ‘connections that impact on people, and on which they depend for living’ in order to address attachments, dependencies, and vulnerabilities in datafied contexts where digital platforms operate as infrastructures of everyday life. Building on interview material, we explore such intimate attachments as ones rife with friction and inconvenience, asking how vulnerabilities emerge and become differently distributed among our study participants. We argue that thinking about the datafied everyday in terms of intimacy opens up space for considering the fundamental ambiguities involved in what matters to people, what they are attached to, and what they simply need to live with. We further suggest that attending to the complexity and vitality of mundane relating, impacting, and world-making offers ways of exploring and techno-capitalist infrastructures of data extraction and mass surveillance in tandem with other attachments and connections that bind, and matter.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a critical study of the discursive positioning of social robots as intermediaries in remedial practices of care in autism therapy. It begins by examining the promotion of social robots to augment autistic children’s social skills as a form of remediation in which they take on a mediator role between therapist and patient. Drawing from McGuire’s genealogy of autism advocacy, I argue that the therapy robots operate as part of a network of coordinating and normalizing strategies that emerges in response to the evident “crisis” of autism. Hayle’s concept of material metaphor is then applied to highlight the potential discursive-material relations of the interposing role played by the robot. Finally, I argue that though designed as an enabling device, in actuality, metaphoric transferences make the robots mimetically disabling.\r\n </jats:p>",

I will argue that the post-prosthetic and non-correlational character of these technologies prompts us to pursue a line of inquiry that calls for a different understanding of contingency. Instead of solely assigning it to domains external to computational technologies (the ‘externality thesis’), this perspective identifies a form of contingency inherent in these technologies themselves (the ‘internality thesis’). I will develop this approach through a comparative analysis of the work of M. Beatrice Fazi and Mark B.N. Hansen, authors who both draw from Alfred N. Whitehead’s process ontology. I will underscore the tensions between their proposals, trying to identify the main divergences within their speculative ontologies of computation. However, I will also propose that we can read them as complementary propositions that account for the ontological productivity of computational media and operations, allowing us to theorise a form of computational contingency independent from the tendencies towards algorithmic closure and determinism present in contemporary technical systems.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>During recent years, geocomputation has become increasingly entangled with so-called 4D visualization. The contemporary infrastructure of fossil fuel extraction depends on these software tools for geological data handling, interpretation and modelling of subterranea. This paper makes use of the contaminated and contaminating practice of figuration to plot stories that highlight some of the milestones of deadly collaboration, of optimised acceleration, and of sedimented damage. It engages with three figurations of timely extraction (Consortium, Borehole and Amalgam), to tell stories that provide a way to make present the time-space complexities that emerge from the connections between extractivism, computation and semiotic-material values. The Underground Division studies those rocky figurations to expose some of their interdependent articulations such as transnational alliances, gold mining and geocomputation and how they shape life/non-life temporalities. We argue that the dynamic crossings of time and matter that Consortium, Borehole and Amalgam are embedded in establish a dynamics of repeated damage, via latent regimes which maintain extractive forces, practices and modes. We amalgamate the clock time of turbo-computing with the megaannums at the timeline of digitally mediated rocks to present agential combinations of exclusion and occlusion that each create unique modes of discrimination and privilege.\r\n </jats:p>",

Focusing on a close study of Simondon’s On the Existence of Technical Objects and Individuation, I argue that the process-philosophical work of Gilbert Simondon, with its critique of Norbert Wiener’s first-order cybernetics, offers a precursor to the conception of second-order cybernetics (as endorsed by Francisco Varela, Humberto Maturana, and Ricardo B. Uribe) and, specifically, its autopoietic treatment of information. It has been argued by those such as Frank Pasquale that neuro-inferential deep learning systems premised on predictive patterning, such as AlphaGo Zero, have a veiled logic and, thus, are ‘black boxes’. In detailing a philosophical-historical approach to demystify predictive patterning/processing and the logic of such deep learning algorithms, this paper attempts to shine a light on such systems and their inner workings à la Simondon.\r\n </jats:p>",

Images of polar bears and melting icebergs paint climate change as a de-humanized and irrelevant phenomenon. But global warming is anything but irrelevant â€“ it is a very real, very tangible and very material present reality â€œstuckâ€ to each and every one of us. Global warming is a physical act of unresolved imperial violence â€“ with a disproportionate degree of impact on the â€œformerlyâ€ colonized world. And yet, this violence often goes unnoted. A visual intervention is required. In my manifesto, I propose a set of three intercessions for the mediation of global warming. I argue that global warming should be mediated as: (1) Situated and Intimate, (2) Transhistorical Trauma of Imperial Modernity and (3) Uncanny Undulation. Mediations must overwhelm, disturb and break the binaries of self and other, seen and unseen, here and there, now and then. Recognition and resolution of the material consequences of global warming will not occur otherwise.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay looks at the role of drones in contemporary culture, including cinema. It suggests that drones are the latest in a long line of media that involve the physical separation of humans from the world and from each other, a logic of separation that intersects with military and entertainment interests. In this way, the drone signals the simultaneous and interlinked cinematisation (or kinocentrism) and militarisation of society. Looking from a distance and fighting from a distance, as combined in the drone, not only have a militaristic purpose; they also serve to render god-like the unseen and unquestionable operator of the drone (and the viewer of images). This becoming god-like can also be seen in the conquest of time, as the never-ending and real-time demands of permanent surveillance, permanent war and permanent work all relegate other times (for example, peace and leisure) into unreality; the permanent now of media, war and capital is the only perceived â€˜realâ€™ time. As humans via separation become media, so, too, do media become more like humans. The essay ends, then, with a â€˜weirdâ€™ suggestion that drones constitute a â€˜sky-netâ€™ that signals an imminent technological singularity.</jats:p>",

    "title": "‘Alternative Ways of Being’: Reimagining Locative Media Materiality through Speculative Fiction and Design",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the ‘material turn’ in media studies and a growing intersection with posthuman philosophies, theorists and practitioners in the field of ‘locative media’ have recently sought to make more explicit and visible the underlying material infrastructure and processes of location-aware technologies. These approaches, we argue, concentrate on two, interrelated layers of locative media materiality: the ‘infrastructure’ itself and its socio-political consequences; and the material relations between human and non-human elements that act upon one another to create the ‘performance’ of locative media. These approaches offer a vital and necessary challenge to the predominantly human- and user-centric focus of existing locative media studies. To date, however, they have been focused on rendering visible the infrastructure and performance of locative media as it presently exists; and still remain centred around the human body as the site and metaphor for understanding this materiality. In this paper, we further complicate this human centricity around the infrastructural and performative layers of locative media to challenge and reimagine the role of the human in locative media art and practice. Drawing on the traditions of speculative fiction and design, we propose fiction, design, and world-building as methods for developing imaginaries and alternative futures that expand the potential for locative media to be reframed from a non-human centric perspective. Such an approach emphasises creativity and imagination, in addition to purely empirical knowledge of locative technologies and processes; and allows for a more speculative, playful, and questioning approach to this materiality, taking into account not only ‘what is’ but also ‘what could be’. Through a discussion of two experimental projects undertaken by one of the authors of this paper, we advocate opening up locative media studies to encompass speculation about its alternative and future potentialities.</jats:p>",

The author discusses the complex and unevenly distributed effects of the digital era, raising a set of questions, such as: Whose time is accelerating? What happens when everyday culture is militarised, while military technologies are civilianised? How does the information bomb explode beyond the visual?  Reflecting on the prophetic character of Virilio’s theorising, the author argues that in the days of platform labour, disappearing job stability, as well as mass imprisonments and growing precarity, we need new ways of thinking about the right to time, and about the slow violence of both acceleration and timelessness. In the days of “smart” warfare, digitally-operated borders, biometric surveillance, as well as of global spectacles of “real life” killing and dying we need to fundamentally rethink the meaning of “civilianised” and “militarised”. In the days of massive celebration of AI, smart technologies and the overall digitisation, we need to envision new forms of (data) justice, to live in the aftermath of the exploded information bomb and its fire that continues burning.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Hyperdodge: How Users Resist Algorithmic Objects in Everyday Life",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper asks what we can learn if we research algorithms via a bottom-up methodology from a usersâ€™ perspective to see how everyday users can resist algorithmic objectives. In doing this, this paper theorizes the framework of agency in which users can shape and reshape algorithmic outcomes. The argument draws on theoretical knowledge grounded in empirical data produced in 10 in-depth interviews, Heideggerâ€™s phenomenology of experience, and De Certeauâ€™s notion of practices in everyday life. It explains how the phenomenology of experience can render algorithms visible for users by asking not what algorithms are, but by reflecting upon their meaning and how these reflections can transform into practices of everyday resistance. Finally, this article speculates about the potential implications of (meta-)data on machine learning that is purposely being manipulated by users, creating the possibility of what I am labelling a â€œhyperdodgeâ€.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Notes on Oceanic Pharmacology",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent oceanographic research indicates that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the earth’s major oceanic circulatory systems, has begun to weaken rapidly. Should the system continue to slow, it will have potentially devastating consequences for climatic negentropy. Given this situation, the world ocean might be understood as a vast, watery pharmakon: a material space of ambivalent effects, yielding up both life and death on a planetary scale. This article explores the pharmacological dimensions of seawater, in four parts. Part one establishes the concept of oceanic pharmacology in conversation with Jacques Derrida’s reading of Plato’s Phaedrus. Part two looks at Bernard Stiegler’s theorization of Derridean diffe?rance and phusis, or nature, in order to argue that the ocean is not a natural thing at all, but must instead be understood as a technical object, i.e. as pharmakon. Part three critically surveys geophysical research on AMOC decline in an effort to shift the concept of oceanic pharmacology into a materialist register. Finally, part four takes up the crucial temporal dimensions of oceanic pharmacology in the context of Christina Sharpe’s notion of residence time. Thinking with Sharpe, the paper concludes with a discussion of what I call resonance time: an oceanic temporality of pharmacological uncertainty.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Special Issue Introduction",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>How might we map the different horizons, questions, topics and concerns that come into view when we bring together the signifiers “critique”, “postcritique” and the “present conjuncture”? The canvas suggested by the question might seem impossibly broad and disorderly, but the different contributions to this special issue of Media Theory share a common desire to confront the question of what critique means today. This editorial introduction identifies different political and cultural developments which justify discussion of this topic now. None seem more salient than the rise of a culture of reactionary media politics that normalises its own image of critical thinking, sometimes in forms that stage a wholesale authoritarian attack against different critical theoretical traditions. Our introduction reflects on the political and cultural resonances of “postcritique” as a provocative keyword for work in literary studies and other fields that questions critique’s reliance on a “hermeneutics of suspicion”. The postcritique literature has been read by some as symbolising a simple renunciation of critique: an antagonist that the defenders of critique need to polemically combat. We approach it instead as an insightful theoretical perspective for illuminating how critique can potentially take repetitive, predictable and regressive forms, both in scholarly work and in cultural contexts that go well beyond the world of the academy. Inspired by this journal’s expansive conception of media theory, we also explore how the postcritique literature’s attention to the affective disposition(s) of critique speaks to the notion of critique as a medium of communication. Far from wanting to disavow a commitment to critique, we affirm the importance of asserting a democratic vision of critique in a conjunctural context where the political valences of critique are more ideologically confusing. We conclude with a brief preview of the different contributions to the special issue.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>David Beer is a Professor of Sociology at the University of York. He is the author of seven books and dozens of articles that encompass the culture and politics of new media, data, and technology. His most recent works have focused specifically on the implications of data analytics industries and the social power of metrics to govern everyday life. David sits on the editorial boards of several key journals in these fields, including Theory, Culture &amp; Society, Information, Communication &amp; Society, Cultural Sociology, and Big Data &amp; Society. His work has made significant contributions to advancing contemporary understandings of new media cultures, as well as the histories and philosophies of social theory, such as his most recent works on Georg Simmel. This interview examines some of the underlying rationales and approaches to David’s work. We focus on key themes of ‘quirks’ and ‘impressions’. The interview looks at how data analytics industries imagine and actualize specific kinds of relationships between populations and data, and how these relations are subsequently ordered for value production. We discuss how platforms and data analytics industries negotiate the rules of social interaction in a context of cultural eclecticism. Finally, we discuss how art and popular culture can guide the creative process for academic research and writing.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Parameters of Media Engagement",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Engagement is a tricky term to pin down, shifting meaning in the media industries, across political communication and within popular culture. But the definition of engagement matters, as new currencies circulate in academic and industry discourses. The argument put forward here is that media engagement is a term that has been used in a strategic way within the media industries to capture social media analytics and ratings performance, thus instrumentally using a reductive meaning of engagement as a measurement of interest. We argue for a new definition of the term as an energising internal force; engagement is a subjective experience, protean in character, driven by affect yet always retaining some elements of rationality. We theorize media engagement as linking the personal, the socio-cultural, and the political, and these elements serve as a horizon in the parameters of media engagement. A matrix of five parameters offers a model for analysing engagement in relation to media contexts, motivations, modalities, intensities, and consequences. The parameters of media engagement highlight the trajectories of engagement, including the build up to engagement, the moment and place of engagement itself, and also what happens beyond engagement, such as participation and social activism, or fan production and user generated content. This way of conceptualising and contextualising media engagement offers analytic purchase for empirical research and reflexive theorisation that is attentive to the nexus of relations at the heart of engagement. We illustrate the empirical utility of this theoretical trajectory with an example from professional wrestling and populism. In such a way, media engagement can be a useful analytic term to map and understand how and why engagement matters to people in the context of political and cultural spheres.\r\n </jats:p>",

Digital platforms have become adept at collecting historical data and using it not just to predict future outcomes, but to produce the present through cultivated expectations of what it will have been. By exploring the case of amateur sound-recording media such as the mixtape, the writable CD, and online playlists, this paper explores how the material constraints of these media change the possibilities for what curated music can communicate. If one result is to mediate different temporal experiences by using timely music to elevate moments into events, then algorithmic music recommendations foreclose the affectability of experience by circumscribing it in advance as deliverable.\r\n </jats:p>",

Choosing the site of mines and mining as a central way of articulating energy regimes, this article addresses three levels of carbon energy as encountered in historical and contemporary coalmining films. By following the black gold from modernity to the contemporary age increasingly marked by the Anthropocene, I will propose a three-folded entangled pharmacology of carbon energy. Inspired by an ecological approach to cinema and Guattari’s ethic-aesthetic ecosophy, a material ecological approach will look at the carbon rock in the earth crust as well as the atmospheric carbon cycle; at another level the socio-economic ecosystems surrounding coal mining are addressed in terms of labor politics and exploitation; and thirdly I will investigate the mental ecologies of coal mining and carbon cycles in relation to our consciousness of emancipatory struggles of rights and recognition but ultimately of a consciousness of the earth, life and death.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the often unremarkable and unremarked upon activity of the refreshing of digital media streams and feeds, paying particular attention to its temporalities. It draws on original empirical research with UK based digital media professionals, mindfulness practitioners and school students to highlight the ways in which the temporalities of refreshing are embodied and experienced. To do this, it considers what theorisations of the prefix ‘re’ might offer, arguing that the ‘re’ indicates a non-linear temporality that is, at once, creating anew, going back, being behind or after, as well as repeating, again and again. Building on these explanations of ‘the re’, the paper argues that the refresh be understood in terms of a present temporality, which is both now and ongoing, and that can be constantly moving, stuck or stilled, and skipped or reset. The paper seeks to understand these specific embodied experiences of the refresh in terms of what Raymond Williams calls a structure of feeling: a ‘temporal present’ that ‘gives the sense of a generation or period’. Taking up Williams’ explication of a structure of feeling in the 1970s through the relatively new experience of the medium of broadcast television, the paper posits that the present temporality of refreshing might be key to the composition of a contemporary structure of feeling.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In certain corners of media theory, the fanciful origin myth of writing furnished in Plato’s Phaedrus, one of his most enigmatic and intricate dialogues, has in turn come to serve as the origin myth for media critique itself. And yet, having been committed to writing, this is an origin myth that underwrites both its own non-originarity and non-truth, its very status as a written text ensuring it will never meet the criteria it sets for a reasoned account of things. This antinomy is not a shortcoming of the dialogue though, but a performative device, encouraging the reader to involve themselves in the dialogue and reflect upon their own relationship to it as audience. Plato does not proscribe writing, but he does prescribe a means for guiding one’s soul onto the path of knowledge – a prescription enacted within his writing itself, even as it points beyond the limits of the written word. The Phaedrus is not just diagnostic, but therapeutic.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Paul Virilio’s work has largely been utilized in theories of media and war, specifically his discussion of ‘pure war’, or the continuance of war beyond its physicality. Cinema, for Virilio, was a pedagogical tool toward preparing populations for such a war. Cinema produced images of objects, perceptually distancing audiences from said objects; it, thus, prepared ‘everyone’ to become objects open to being watched, holding relevance for cinema, surveillance, and information studies. Yet, this concern with watching and surveillance is not race neutral. I argue that Virilio’s work on pure war can be reinterpreted as ‘dark pure war’, concerned with a militaristic, unending war against nonwhite populations. Such war presumes both physical and digital forms of colonialist militarism, policing, and surveillance, particularly as information is often assumed to be race-neutral, while also being weaponized toward dark pure war’s continuance. Thus, race is an underexamined, overlooked element of Virilio’s theory.</jats:p>",

Dramatizing critique in this way shifts the methodological focus away from the redemptive gesture that guides the critique of critique toward the creative exploration of what can be done to make critique work within the gamified battlefield of contemporary social media environments. Doing so invites a provocative change of critical tone, reflections upon who counts as a critic, and an encounter with everyday moral calculations. It culminates in a deflationary image of critique as everyday practice.\r\n </jats:p>",

Second, we present the alternative genealogies of the pharmakon in reference to material, chemical and medical contexts. Taking the approach Galen developed to the pharmakon in the context of medical practice in Classical antiquity as its guide, this section presents an alternate history of the concept in order to illustrate how else it might be conceived and used.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Upon arrival in Sweden, Speaking into the Air was not spoken about. Instead, it was whispered about—often with admiration, sometimes in perplexment. This article contextualizes the non-reception in light of three circumstances: the Swedish consensus culture in which dialogue is sacred, the role of media in the nation for disseminating the dialogical praxis and its results, and the Swedish model of media studies. The article shows how the book’s many open secrets (the stress on the simplicity of being there, human fragility, death and communication, embodiment and interruption) eventually provided the richest source of inspiration, as Speaking enjoyed new life in existential media studies.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on the authorâ€™s keynote lecture at the 2018 â€˜Rethinking Affordanceâ€™ symposium (Stuttgart, Germany), this essay offers a comprehensive survey of the tensions between J.J. Gibsonâ€™s and Don Normanâ€™s perspectives on the concept of affordance, and formulates an incisive critique of how Norman reconfigured Gibsonâ€™s initial theory. The essayâ€™s key arguments are triangulated in a critical dialogue between design practices, affordance theory, and a critical reading of design pedagogy. Drawing on her own practice as a pioneering net artist and digital folklore researcher, the author moves from early internet design practices through human-computer interaction and user experience design towards a speculative consideration of the affordances of human-robotic interaction.\r\n </jats:p>",

As a technical principle, motion itself makes possible the location of devices as elements of the network. With a short overview of media archaeological approaches to cellular networks, the paper explores the introduction of an ontology in which the position of every object is constantly registered. In such spaces of address, the politics of remembrance and forgetting have to be rethought, because only that which is not part of the network can be forgotten. The arbitrariness of addresses and the difference between bodies and devices offer a chance to stand still while not being forgotten.</jats:p>",

Close analysis suggests that the heart of his concerns lay in the photographers’ love for their subjects based in an unexpressed but significant ecological orientation.

The article criticises the idea that this mass image is single and unified. Developing ideas of love and fantasy, the article argues that, in an era when the unconscious is structured not like language but like code, massed image databases lack a single present time, with consequences for photographic aesthetics.</jats:p>",

I look at the writings of a core Cultural Studies tradition represented by Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, especially in areas of their work which relate to the “structure of feeling” (Williams &amp; Orrom, 1954). This work offers productive avenues and metaphors for thinking affective critique anew. Evaluating and disagreeing with Hall’s critique of the refusal of systematization holed away in Williams’ well-worn concept, I argue that attendance to the unsystematised is its chief virtue. Finally, I draw this abstracted discussion into the terms of ‘mutual vulnerability’ and debates over ‘safe spaces’ to argue that our time of multiplying crises and routine commodification asks us to remember our interdependency and foster mutually vulnerable modes of relation.\r\n </jats:p>",

The contributions to the special issue see time not as a neutral backdrop to, but as actively constituted by and constitutive of, (digital) media, and develop broad understandings of both media and the temporality of the present/present temporalities. The special issue develops theoretically informed and engaged understandings of digital media presents, drawing from and expanding a range of theoretical traditions, including feminist, queer and anti-racist theory, science and technology studies, media theory, philosophy and cultural theory. They similarly take seriously an array of objects, practices and processes, extending from public and academic debates and figurations, mundane and routinised activities, the affordances of specific platforms and computational and data-driven software.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 1959 and 1963, the German Informel painter K.O. Gotz produced a series of works inspired by what he perceived to be television's potential to initiate a new form of \"kinetic electronic painting\" (Gotz, 1961: 14). His corresponding production of the Rasterbilder (Raster Pictures) and the film Density 10:2:2:1 were mapped on the technical and formal possibilities of analogue electronics in general, and of television in particular; however, these works were made without any direct use of the new medium, to which Gotz had failed to gain access. This article argues that the concept of \"imagined affordance\" (Nagy and Neff, 2015) enables a critical reassessment of Gotz's elusive relation to television. Rather than focusing on the lack (of cognition or access) that this concept implies, I argue that \"television\" functioned as a flexible paradigm through which the artist was able to combine Modernism with the emergent field of information aesthetics. Inspired by the discretized aesthetic of the electronically-produced image, the Raster Pictures and Density 10:2:2:1 predate - albeit in an analogue manner - the first works of computer-generated art by several years.\r\n </jats:p>",

Actual understandings and invocations of these ideas, however, are complex and multifaceted. Graduate students tend to have a superficial understanding of these ideas without a grasp of Herman and Chomskyâ€™s broader critique of the political economy of global communication. State propaganda officials and communication strategists tend to accept these concepts for their demystification of the US media system on the one hand, and use Manufacturing Consent as a â€œhow toâ€ guide to enhance the effectiveness of Chinese official communication on the other. While there are also examples of more substantive expositions of Herman and Chomskyâ€™s ideas on their own terms, a strong liberal perspective continues to take the US media as a normative model for China and ignore works such as Manufacturing Consent. As China expands its global reach, how Chinese scholars come to terms with Western critical communication scholarship and develop their own indigenous critique of the political economy of global communication has emerged as an issue of both theoretical and practical importance.</jats:p>",

Yet, what is generally unnoticed about it is a screen-induced inter-subjectivity that supports a significant level of exploitation in communicative linkups where affective contagions are rapidly propagated. Through the entanglements in interactive communication that technological innovation promotes, smartphone users can become vulnerable to new forms of predatory economic relations not immediately visible in their daily routines. It can be proposed that the techno-hegemonies have tapped into these entanglements to inculcate contagious behavior as fundamental to the operational enterprise of affective capitalism. This is a capitalism that relies on collective social relations as a springboard to mediated relations of production.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The discussion on Neo-feudalism, in scholarship and politics, the way Neo-feudalism is conceptualized and contested, reflects deeper problematic cultural and political dynamics. This article argues the debate is framed in a tinted fashion, particularly regarding method; Neo-feudalism is essentially a neo-romantic project, a desire to return to the European past as a universal future. The article responds to Evgeny Morozov’s ‘Critique of Techno-Feudal Reason’, published in the New Left Review. Morozov’s critique is exemplary as it ignores the collective subject and reifies much of what “the nineties crowd”, often referred to in the debate, argued against, especially in terms of epistemology. This article critically recasts the ‘lord’ in Neo-feudalism and contrasts it with ‘master-slave’ dialectics, ironically placing aristocracy and the politics of Balkan nation-state formation into the picture. This article situates the discussion within the context of Greek politics and the rise of Syriza, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of power relations in the digital age and the importance of addressing the epistemological foundations of contemporary capitalism in relation to rising nationalism in Europe.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Proposing a Postcritical AI Literacy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>So-called artificial intelligence (AI) is infiltrating our public and communication structures. The Dutch childcare benefit scandal, revealed in 2019, demonstrates how disadvantageous the opacity of AI can be for already vulnerable groups. In its aftermath, many scholars urged for the need for more explainable AI so that decision-makers can intervene in discriminatory systems. Fostering the explainability of AI (XAI) is a good start to address the issue, but not enough to empower vulnerable groups to fully deal with its repercussions. As a canon in data and computer sciences, XAI aims to illustrate and explain complex AI via simpler models making it more accessible and ethical. The issue being that, in doing so, XAI depoliticises transparency into a remedy for algorithmic opacity, treating transparency as artificially stripped of its ideological meanings. Transparency is presented as an antidote to ideology, though I will show how this is an ideological move with consequences. For instance, it makes us focus too much on algorithmic opacity, rather than explaining the wider power of AI. Second, it hinders us from having debates on who holds the power around AI’s explanations, application or critique. The problem is that those affected by or discriminated against by AI, as in the Dutch case, have little tools to deal with the opacity of AI as a system, while those who focus on data opacity are shaping the literacy discussion. To address these concerns, I suggest moving beyond the focus on algorithmic transparency and towards a post-critical AI literacy to strengthen debates on access, empowerment, and resistance, while not dismissing XAI as a field, nor algorithmic transparency as an intention. What I challenge here is the hegemony of treating transparency as a depoliticised and algorithmic issue and viewing the explainability of AI as the sufficient path to citizen empowerment.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Critiquing the Vocabularies of the Marketized University",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Critique is in crisis. Spaces in the university, where critique once flourished under the banner of academic freedom, have been appropriated and hollowed out of meaning. External pressures from the failed project of privatisation of higher education in the UK result in internal pressures from a marketized model of university management that sees critical thinking as branding content to influence market share, rather than relevance for (social) science. This paper considers how the deeds and vocabularies of neoliberalism and the market operate in academic institutions to shape the context in which critical scholarship takes place – a context in which alternative possibilities of what education should or could be for outside of “growth”, “choice” “value for money” and preparation for work, are becoming increasingly rarely envisioned. Simultaneously, academic institutions have appropriated some of the vocabulary of critique, hollowing it out so that it can be consumed without challenging the business objectives that now structure higher education. The thoroughgoing renaming of institutional practices and their sanctioned practice and operation in the context of the ongoing destruction of the university as a public good are tied to the new institutional practices, in an effort to pressurise those who work in higher education to accept that there is no alternative.  We consider the consequences of these practices and argue that, in this context, critical scholarship must also be tied to resistance, both to the vocabularies of the neoliberal university, as well as to its actions. Critique ought to expand our understanding of the possible while demonstrating that existing reality in academia and beyond can be contested in practice. \r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In his famous discussion of the transparency of the photographic image, Walton (1984) claimed there are opaque photographs that fail to be transparent because of technological error, willful dishonesty, or author experimentation. Photographic history, philosophy, and epistemology have rarely interpreted such photos. The Fraenkel Gallery’s exhibition Unphotographable (2013) explored such failed, doubtful, and experimental photographs. This essay aims to further advance the concept of the unphotographable by interpreting this exhibition in relation to abstract images from the project Scotoma (2014–2018) by the Slovenian artist DK. Evoking Lacanian scotomization, DK’s project Scotoma points towards defining the unphotographable as a photographic black spot enforced by its technological, ideological, or operator-imposed conditions. Yet, since these shots are still photographs, the unphotographable is part of the photo-universe (Laruelle, 2011). Thus the unphotographable becomes a way of defining the photographable, revealing it as a dynamic field in which technology makes something that was previously unphotographable into part of the photographable.  </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this essay, I argue that Lauren Berlant’s work poses the question of how and to what we are attached by and through our media and popular culture. Beginning from a scene of listening, and juxtaposing it throughout the piece with the popular culture of romantic love, the piece encounters Berlant as a thinker of the movement of attaching-detaching. Attachment is a special type of relation, through which an ‘object’ becomes promissory. The first part of the essay summarises Berlant’s theorising of ‘attachment’ and argues that media and popular cultures circulate and distribute ‘promises’ that serve as resources to organise and intensify attachments. It then shifts to the importance of detaching and detachment in Berlant’s writings, arguing that detachment is the ever-present condition and accompaniment for attachment. As media circulate and distribute promises that are enacted through popular cultures, they simultaneously detach and (re)produce detachments. In conclusion, I advocate for a media theory that centres the dynamics of attaching-detaching and performs Berlant’s ethical-political imperative and methodological call to not shame people’s attachments.    \r\n </jats:p>",

This continuum once buried under people’s daily routines is constantly re-excavated in a smart home and re-differentiated into the new service domains of the IoT. This paper develops a topological framework to analyze the new form of media power behind this perpetual place-binding of smart spaces, which I term topological power.

Firstly, it analyses post-digital handwriting in the political sphere using the example of the social media posting and sharing of Donald Trump’s signature after he took presidential office. Secondly, it elaborates post-digital handwriting as an aesthetic phenomenon by discussing the Instagram account of renowned Swiss curator Hans Ulrich Obrist who has posted nearly 4,500 handwritten notes to 320,000 followers over eight years. Finally, it places these discussions into the context of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger to arrive at a better understanding of how the ontological difference of post-digital handwriting is produced.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The world is currently witnessing a revitalisation of the right and of authoritarian political tendencies. Right-wing forces across the globe have been able to push misogynist, homophobic and xenophobic discourses into the mainstream of politics and media. Whilst these developments have been fuelled by the neoliberal economic programmes unrolled since the 1970s, sexism and racism have always been anchored within the structures of real existing capitalism. This suggests, then, that many of the societal issues we are encountering today are rooted in structural disadvantage and oppression pertaining not only to economics and class but also to gender, race and ethnicity. Yet, approaches in Communication Studies and Cultural Studies have often engaged in separate interrogations of media misrepresentations in relation to either class and economics, or gender and/or race. On the other hand, intersectional scholarship has long highlighted how these societal spheres are interconnected and should thus be researched simultaneously. The Herman-Chomsky Propaganda Model constitutes the leading analytical tool to theorize and investigate media bias. The following contributions will conceptualize and illustrate how the PM relates to intersectional scholarship and societal structures. This will be done on the basis of theoretical elaborations and empirical case studies as well as broader discussions of the politics within the disciplines of Communications Studies and Cultural Studies. It will be demonstrated that the PM can be used to unveil interlocking media biases and misrepresentations deriving from parallel societal discriminations including classism, sexism and racism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contrary to the widespread view of myth as falsehood, its hermeneutic interpretation has long been seen as providing insight for life’s conundrums. Peters’ (1999) juxtaposition of perfect angelic exchanges of meaning with flawed human discourse opens up fresh approaches for examining communication’s complexities. Religious thought has dealt intriguingly with the ‘media problem’ posed by angels and mortals’ incommensurable difference. Muslim philosophy posits a subtle faculty of the creative imagination / active intellect as a pristine mediator between them. This article explores reparative potential for disinformation’s chaos-inducing harm in our time through an intertextual study of old Jewish, Christian and Muslim narratives, in which speaking and hearing’s relationship with truth is a core value. Scriptural discourses about the discerning mode of the Virgin Mary and the Prophet Muhammad’s respective receptions of the Word offer understanding for engagement with our turbulent mediascape and underline the always current value of such symbolic narratives.\r\n </jats:p>",

At the core of Serres’ relevancy for media theory (on whose project this article focuses mainly) is the architectonic status of public knowledge in what he calls the Chronopedia. This architectonics involves radical re-conceptions of space and time that allow philosophy, at least in principle, to maintain compatibility with contemporary science and technology. This article profiles two related projects in the light of each other, that of a Grand Récit of the Universe (Michel Serres) and that of The Unnameable Present (Roberto Calasso). For both projections, there appears nothing more urgent today than re-connecting a broad public vocabulary, repository of images and ideas, puzzles too, as well as expectations and understandings with regard to the abstractions and powers at work in the technology and science that organise how we live today, in the dawn of the Anthropocene.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Interactive documentary is a non-linear digital form of documentary that allows users numerous pathways through multimedia content. This was the original meaning behind the abbreviation i-docs (Aston and Gaudenzi, 2012) and the sense in which I use the term. While in recent years the ‘i’ has expanded to include immersion, my focus remains on interactivity and nonlinearity. The nonlinearity and multimodality of i-docs are being taken forward into experiments with i-docs as an academic method, including my own.\r\nIn this paper I discuss my use of i-docs to study London’s pop-up culture, focusing on two kinds of ‘present’ that i-docs illuminated. First, I explore how working with i-docs elucidated present moments as they are imagined and experienced in pop-up culture: a phenomenon defined by its celebration of ephemerality and unpredictability. Secondly, I explore how the i-doc foregrounded pop-up culture’s role within the present era; revealing pop-up as implicated in politicized processes of urban change in the post 2008 crash climate. Overall, the paper demonstrates how i-docs can make us attentive to both present moments and present eras as well as, crucially, to the relationships between these two kinds of present.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article proceeds from the observation that, in 21st century cities, algorithmic technologies engage people as bodily beings in the production of space in ways that warrant theoretical discussion on urban infrastructure and infrastructural power. While human corporeality is an increasingly prominent issue in critical (media) infrastructure studies, my argument in the article is that the structural role of corporeality in the pervasively computed urban context remains undertheorised. A key starting point demanding reconsideration concerns the ontological separation of human embodiment from the materiality of infrastructure. To overcome this separation, I direct attention to urbanites’ mediated bodily habits and routines, stressing their importance in infrastructural constitution. The power-infused interrelational dynamic that these routines enact is addressed in the article by developing a conceptualisation that combines views of classic social and urban thinkers with more recent, particularly nonrepresentational, theorisation. As a methodological bridge towards empirically investigating how mediated bodily routines ‘infrastructure’, I propose a reworking of Henri Lefebvre’s notion of rhythm in terms of the algorithmic qualities of contemporary cities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper highlights several key principles of the work of Michel Serres and considers them in relation to life in contemporary socio-technical worlds, e.g. notions of relationality, noise, bodies, sense and data. A journey with Serres involves seeking novelty in spaces ‘outside’ of existing knowledge producing practices. This paper highlights how, for Serres, mediation as noise does not operate via a singular universal interface, but is multiple and processual – in essence, everything is mediation. Using contemporary examples of new technologies (e.g. AI and play writing; AI and emotion) the paper considers the value of a Serrian mode of thought for understanding emerging relations between bodies and technologies. It concludes with acknowledging the growing political focus on Serres’ later work, in which he became increasingly concerned to (re)define the contract between humanity and the world. His notion of appropriation through pollution encompasses notions of information and data as forms of algorithmic appropriation, as much if not more, than physical pollution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Late in the summer of 2019, Gary Hall gave a series of talks hosted by the Philosophy Department at Universidad Iberoamericana, Mexico City. One of them was titled ‘Liberalism Must be Defeated. On the Obsolescence of Bourgeois Theory in the Anthropocene’. As the organizer of this event, I was curious about the reception of this argument in a context that does not usually name ‘liberalism’ as the enemy, even though it is no stranger to anti-bourgeois positions on intellectual activity. Universidad Iberoamericana is a private Jesuit college that has catered historically to the Mexican elites while upholding a reputation for its political commitments to democracy and social justice. Indeed, one could argue that it is a liberal alliance between religion and business that provides the conditions for the Philosophy Department’s younger generation of scholars to teach and write about the kind of (French, German, Italian) radical theory that Gary Hall’s work embraces and seeks to renew. While most attendants of the talk at IBERO did not at all lack the theoretical framework to understand in what sense liberalism must be defeated, or why bourgeois theory should be regarded as obsolete, I was curious about the conditions of taking Hall’s performative argument on board. Was it a critique of how successful Anglo scholars operate, or was it also about how ‘we’ operate here in Mexico City? Is ‘our’ work liberal bourgeois theory too, and therefore obsolete? If so, could we do better than appear tolerant of a disruptive performance that was challenging us to aspire to something different, something unknown, something like existing otherwise?\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "(Digital) Media as Critical Pedagogy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>From chalkboard sites to social media, from smartphones to interactive grading software, there is an overabundance of digital learning tools at our fingertips, many of which float into our classrooms on airy praise from university administrators, politicians, and corporate technicians alike who tout the incorporation of these technologies into our teaching as an undeniably positive step toward the â€œenhancementâ€ of student learning. Rather than promoting a critical model of learning by which students and teachers can explore the matrix of possibilities â€œaffordedâ€ by their relationship to new media, the techno-fetishist instrumentality of â€œtechnology-enhanced learningâ€ functions as an efficient means of materializing neoliberal market ideology and adjusting us to accepting our positions as self-contained users of discrete tools that define for us what the goals and processes of learning will be. It is imperative, then, that we engage ourselves and our students in the critical pedagogical process of learning to learn in conversation with â€“ not at the behest of â€“ media. To do so gets to the very heart of critical pedagogy itself, because, as I argue, the ontological assumptions underwriting the very hope and possibility of critical pedagogy as a political project are nothing if not the essential coordinates for a media theory of being. If we are to determine how to develop a sufficiently critical pedagogy in the age of digital media, we must first re-locate the learning process in the exploration of the open, dialectical circuits between human and world through which life itself is mediated, and from which political change is made possible.\r\n </jats:p>",

My corpus included articles from leading national newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post and metajournalistic discourse from the Columbia Journalism Review. I show how journalists discursively rely on historical analogies to make sense of an unprecedented political phenomenon known as Donald Trump and Trumpism, and how, by looking to the past, journalists seek to bolster their cultural authority at a time when trust in the media is at record lows.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of the techno-pharmakon, introduced by Plato in Phaedrus and later adopted by Jacques Derrida, reached the apex of its philosophical utility in the work of Bernard Stiegler. The simple idea that technology can either be a remedy or a poison, an idea central to Stiegler’s work, is an irresistible binary for media theorists. This essay begins with a critical reflection on that useful binary and on the white male legacy of the pharmakon itself, a legacy that I confess to have perpetuated. If technology can either cure or kill, it does not do so equally; rather, the pharmakon achieves radical variability depending on factors of race, gender, and ability. Put simply, this essay argues that the very same systemic power asymmetries that are responsible for our most pressing social problems are embedded in our technological systems. Moreover, these same power asymmetries haunt media theory itself, leading me to argue that the pharmakon needs to be troubled. I draw carefully on queer theory to recommend a path toward this disturbance of the power systems embedded in both technoculture and in media theory.\r\n </jats:p>",

Pharmacological media rely on digital wellness ideologies and offer datafied solutions to the toxicity of both big tech and big pharma. Beyond questions of efficacy—that is, the question of whether neuro devices do what they say—this essay focuses on matters of cultural framing and aspiration that underpin the wellness industry. Our interest is to supplement current understandings of bio-technical management by tracing the emergence of what we term the data pharmacy—where data and pharma industries and cultural imaginaries are increasingly fused within an emergent paradigm of computational wellness. This pivot in big tech’s wellness portfolio translates existing biodata and health analytics into pharmacological techniques that aim to automate ways of thinking, feeling, and being.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses a significant if imperceptible feature of how audio compact discs (CDs) inscribe sound: interleaving. It shows how CDs materialize interleaving—the microtemporal re-ordering of data—as a cultural technique of contemporary digital media, and, as such, how the CD’s surface testifies to much more general operations of cultural data processing than those that appear to be at stake in the few media-theoretical discussions of the format to date. First, I provide a brief overview of the CD’s operating principles, followed by a closer examination of the error-correction and detection system used in CD media. I explain how interleaving co-operates with this system to improve the resilience of disc media to both pre-sale defect and post-sale damage. I interpret this tacit and little-remarked-upon operation of CD players in cultural-technical terms. The perplexities of digital sound media push the principles of contemporary sound reproduction well beyond the kind of efficient and effective critical scrutiny we may associate with what I here call archaeophonographic sound media (for example, tape and vinyl LPs), unless we are willing to confidently assert the value of the media-technical explanatory register to digital media history.</jats:p>",

The article describes how in eighteenth century electricity research, the aesthetics of electricity – the forms in which it appears and its representations – are haunted by the anaesthetics of its object. It investigates one specific challenge in the early history of electricity research, in which questions of mediation, aesthetics, perceivability and causality are fundamentally connected: attempts to measure the speed of electric transmissions through wires. The article describes these phenomena as ‘specters of causality’, that means forces that become perceivable only in the form of aesthetic effects which cloak the physical events which happen in the realm of the invisible. Specters of causality made imperceptibility perceptible. These ghosts of mediation materialized the invisible transmission of electricity as an aesthetic experience. The causality that connects actions with effects at a distance through a wire challenges the perceptual status of immediacy and mediation.\r\n </jats:p>",

This essay sets out to revisit the case of aerial advertising, mobilizing some of the key lessons and themes from Speaking into the Air. I explore the specific symbolic and technical configurations of transportation and communication put forth by aerial advertising. Then, turning to the two foundational models of dissemination and dialogue, I address the ambiguous role of pilots as speakers/writers.

In this article I analyse the terms of the transition in Serres’s affirmation of a philosophy grounded in the potential for connection between the traditions of storytelling and the sciences of connection. The article rediscovers within his overt Hellenism a figure of the Anthropos affirmed in the Sophist philosophies that Plato had set out to destroy. If science proceeds, first in its Hellenic dawn, and more recently in seventeenth century arithmetic, then it must be disabused of its war-game attitude. Serres affirms science (almost singularly) as the condition on which the species might continue its adventure into the future, and in the process he establishes a position that may challenge ecologically oriented discourses.</jats:p>",

This can be seen in the circularity of displacement, deportation and return, where waiting and disorientation become forms of control. The discussion emerges from field research and interviews I carried out in the villages of north Punjab, Pakistan, where many people are caught in this chronopolitics of migration. The migrant experience of borders is read alongside a critical interrogation of the computational technologies deployed in border management, including EuroDAC and iMap. They produce a form of imperial temporality for which the horizon acts as a constitutive trope of progress, while simultaneously producing a sense of a horizonless world through the networked logic and ubiquity of datafication. I end with a discussion of how it may be possible to find other orientations within these normative spatiotemporalities of a bordered world.\r\n </jats:p>",

That the canals were an effect of dust, as both elemental medium and noise, encourages broader questions concerning how futures pivot on what lies at the blurred edges of media and beyond rather than on what media make clearly visible. This paper argues for an analytic of futures, both potential and prescribed, situated in the anesthetic fields of media ecologies, spaces of speculation, contestation, and the non-dyadic play of visibility-opacity-invisibility.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this Introduction to our special section on ‘Laurent Berlant and Media Theory’, I argue, with our contributors, that both appreciating and extending Berlant’s vital contributions to media theory requires addressing the distinctive place of ‘mediation’ in her/their writing. The first section addresses the challenges and potentialities of efforts to position Berlant within existing genealogies of media theory, with particular attention to their work on affective genres, scenes, cases, and attachments. The second section explores the shifting relations among infrastructure, data politics and the making of media theory that Berlant’s capacious mode of cultural critique helps us sense and make sense of – with a focus on intimacy-infrastructure entanglements, whether with respect to the ‘inconvenience’ of networked media and AI or the affective possibilities of collaborative projects of writing otherwise. What constitutes Berlant’s most profound lesson concerning what it means to live lives immanently mediated by aesthetic-material forms, genres, and infrastructures, I conclude, is that friction, vulnerability, and ambivalence, are our vital animating conditions – and how we negotiate them personally and collectively is both a matter of survival and an affective-political art.  \r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Turn towards New Criticalities in the Study of Media, Communication and Journalism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Using Boltanski’s (2011) idea that critique is the contestation of social and cultural orders, different ways of such contestations in the social sciences and the humanities and in media, communication and journalism research are mapped. Four overarching orientations towards doing critique are identified – open, reforming, resonant and emerging. The critical is seen to reside in a wide landscape covering many forms of critique articulating different criticalities. It is argued that these developments in different research fields, together with new ways of looking at and relating these fields, shows a turn towards new criticalities. A communicative critique is also advocated as an instrument for more dialogue across divides of ontology and epistemology, theories and methods, in the mapping of how the critical is articulated in the social sciences and the humanities as well as in the studies of media, communication and journalism. Thereby, the article is an invitation to consider the relevance of critique and criticality, also for the post-critical movement and scholars not labelling themselves critical.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Automation of Style",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In histories of photography, the notion of ‘seeing photographically’ is associated with so-called ‘straight’ photographers such as Edward Weston. It means to train the human-camera eye – to ‘previsualise’ – by conforming to the conditions of what Vilém Flusser calls the “photographic program”. At the same time, seeing photographically is a constant dynamic between a protean technical practice and aesthetic conventions or styles. This paper revisits the notion of seeing photographically to contextualise how notions of photographic style operate in generative imaging practices and AI discourse. We argue that since not only photorealism but the look of photographs from any period or style can be generated with the right combination of prompts and parameters, it has become possible to ‘previsualise’ and ‘see photographically’ by treating the history of photography as a style market. The concept of ‘style’, outdated in art history, becomes newly important and photography becomes a memory to be evoked in ahistorical stylistic evocations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This Introduction to the ‘Seeing photographically’ special issue begins with four vignettes drawn from (nearly) two centuries of photographic history. These examples are leveraged to pose critical questions about photography’s transformation since the 19th century, and especially in the first decades of the 21st century, as trajectories associated with digitization, networked distribution, the widespread integration of cameras into mobile devices and the growing application of machine-learning to image-making have all taken hold. Photography has never been more widespread, but its boundaries and specificity seem to have become less and less certain. Beginning from the premise that ‘technological change’ is never simply technological, this issue challenged authors to respond to the theme of ‘seeing photographically’. Their responses clustered around a set of intersecting problematics: the impact of ‘generative AI’ on the photographic field; the way that photography has consistently challenged the (often unconscious) human-centrism of most accounts of perception and seeing; and the challenges associated with theorizing photography as media in the present. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article adapts Walter Benjamin’s theory of technological reproducibility to examine how generative AI transforms art. Through analysis of a range of works of art and online popular culture, the article theorizes the aesthetics of generative AI. From the characteristic glitches and recurrent formats, the aesthetics are conceived as muddled confusions of parts, attempts at reinserting what Benjamin terms aura, and as surrealist assemblages of characters, styles and worlds. In Benjamin’s conception, popular culture becomes our collective imaginary, which today feeds into a memetic visual conversation of imitation and variation. AI points toward an age of multiverses where characteristics, current events and cultural artifacts blend together to achieve success in social network attention economies. Following Benjamin, the article examines the politics of these transformative media technologies. More than a risk to the livelihood of artists and deep-faked disinformation, this article argues for the radical potential in freeing visual culture from the property rights of corporations.\r\n </jats:p>",

A major component of this transformation is the political process: both how it is enacted and how effective it is for the promotion of democracy. The political process has become both faster and ‘lighter’. The acceleration of the political process has received considerable attention over the last decade, but the essay introduces the idea of a ‘lightness’ that accompanies acceleration. This is connected to digitality and its concomitant diminution of our inherent human analogue capacities. The analogue capacities that enabled democratic politics in its modern version have been eclipsed by what are their digital antitheses. An analogue engendered political process continues to exist, but it functions at the elite levels of business and government; whereas the digitally-created ‘lightness’ of the virtual sphere constitutes the political process for the growing millions. The essay argues that this is an essentially alienating sphere that offers little by way of the traction and roots necessary for democratic and inclusive politics to grow and flourish.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On digital platforms a distinct form of reactionary politics has gathered, intensifying and focusing its political arguments. Composed of diverse strands of political ideology it is unified by opposition to any and all forms of politics concerned with claims for equality. Key avatars of this politics are ‘ideological entrepreneurs’, individuals untethered from modern political institutions and engaged in the business of manufacturing criticism not only of this or that form of politics but of modern politics as such. While highly politically consequential these political forms are peculiar insofar as their goal is not primarily political consciousness raising and organising but the growth of an audience and the intensification of its parasocial attachment. Because they are not seeking to attain political legitimacy or win office, standard forms of counter-critique, which measure the distance of reactionary political claims from what is imagined to be universal and legitimate, are misdirected. In addition to such normative critique those who would defend politics must learn how to do it better, in ways which understand the digital political conjuncture and the opportunities it contains. The force and meaning of political critique is found only in its effects. \r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article provides an archaeology of John Durham Peters’ historiographic methods and strategies by comparing three distinct approaches that the author names JDP1999, JDP2009, and JDP2019. For each of these three JDPs, one key theoretical figure functions as a historiographical guide. Walter Benjamin leads the way for JDP1999. Friedrich Kittler guides JDP 2009. Harold Innis hovers, Google Earth-like, above JDP 2019. The dominant forms of historical evidence are also fundamentally different. JDP 1999 delves into the hidden philosophies and theologies of communication buried in canonical Western texts. JDP 2009 opens up the diagrams, patents, and formulas of scientists and engineers used in the creation of media. JDP 2019 examines the ‘natural world’ as the inscription of being that encodes and decodes itself into existence. A further distinction to be made between JDP 2009 and JDP 2019 regards tools and knowledge of the natural world, both of which figure prominently in the histories discussed. The natural world preexists tools and humans. Its history is deeply inhuman, whereas the history of ideas and of tools is clearly not.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>J.D. Peters’ communication theory rehabilitates communication in the form of non-reciprocal dissemination as a complement to the dominant position of dialogue, which is usually considered the primary form of close communication. This essay, in turn, now complements Peters’ communication theory with the cultural-historical phenomenon that we use the stable surfaces of materials to write and to illustrate, starting with cave paintings and skin tattoos and to the invention of writings, diagrams and maps. The ‘cultural technique of flattening’ is conceived as a projection of spatial and non-spatial facts onto two-dimensionality. ‘Artificial’ flatness—there is no empirical flatness—forms a productive potential and power that is essential for the development of sciences, many arts, technology and architecture, and complex administrative technology is unthinkable. What this means is (i) examined in a media theoretical context and (ii) explored in connection to digital technology, which establishes a link to Peters’ reflections on ‘clouds’.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Drawing upon the critical scholarship on drone warfare, this article argues that drones' mistargeting of civilians is neither exception nor error but is instead intrinsic to the rationale behind militarized drone strikes. A historical overview of the cultural imaginaries and biopolitical formations corresponded to drone warfare reconfigures drone technology as an apparatus of racialized state violence. Therefore, an analysis of the affordances corresponded to drone technologies cannot be thought in isolation from the historicity of the material and discursive systems that underline those strikes. Forensic Architecture's investigations of covert drone strikes address the material, media, and legal systems through which these strikes operate and thus intervene in the time-space relations that characterize the entangled politics of verticality and visuality. As a result, they invert the forensic gaze through an architectural mode of analysis and political commitment to \"the right to look\" in Nicholas Mirzoeff's terms. Ultimately, their investigations are direct interventions into the operationalization of drone technology as a technical, discursive, and political apparatus.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In The Administration of Fear (2012), Virilio returns to his old 1977 theme of speed as the driving force in politics. For Virilio, modern power involves ever-accelerating speed, but in this work he takes it further by arguing there is a ‘cult of speed’, which is not progress but its ideology, whereby fear is hidden by the ideology of progress. Speed’s impact is mediated by affect, which produces social effects, such as loss of continuous action, ecological destruction, devitalisation, placelessness, fractal fragmentation, and group nationalisms or communalisms. This situation becomes particularly dangerous when the affective structures, which become viral are those – so common in turbo-capitalism – of fear, panic and hatred. As a result of telepresence, there is a ‘synchronisation of emotion’ which goes beyond the earlier standardisation of opinion. Virilio christens this regime the ‘communism of affect’ leading to new forms of politics: transition from a democracy of opinion to a democracy of emotion. In this article, we elaborate on this line of argumentation, and then discuss how Virilio may resonate and inspire analysis of contemporary political phenomena, such as affective polarisation in anti-immigrant fears driving the far right in Anglo-Saxon politics, securitisation in France, developmentalist acceleration and telepresence in India, and the dystopian extremes of the Chinese model.</jats:p>",

Using the relationship between the University of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia as an exemplar, I base my analysis upon three bodies of empirical evidence: the interlocking directorates of university regents; publicly available urban planning reports; and newspaper coverage of development in Philadelphia. I show that the university is essential to a social process that has as its aim the erasure â€“ both physical and symbolic â€“ of Black and Brown bodies from urban space. In addition to its role in the bureaucracies of urban power, the university is central within strategic narratives that mythologize the white savior and legitimize crude forms of capital accumulation. Finally, I explore the university as a site for counterhegemonic urban practice, calling on academics to integrate the notion of the Right to the University with the politics of the Right to the City.</jats:p>",

This manifesto outlines the contours of this economic and political power. It frames its growth as a failure not just of policy, but also of the policymaking process and the political culture that underpins it. To address this failure, it articulates â€œthe public panopticonâ€ â€“ a new policymaking structure that reimagines the power dynamics within the policymaking process, a reorientation in policy priorities, and a revived public interest at its core.</jats:p>",

I will argue that Bernard Stiegler’s organological approach to the human as “technical life” takes care of the question of the nature of creative making, and the pharmacological critical practice that it mandates takes care of the question of the stakes. I say “takes care” to emphasise that Stiegler’s theoretical enterprise is dedicated to a “therapeutics” of contemporary technocultural transformation, because culture is best understood as a taking care of the technical pharmakon – both poison and cure – that is our irreducible technical supplementarity. After providing an assessment of Stiegler’s thinking on organology and pharmacological critique, I will discuss the work of some creative makers I have worked with or was able to interview as part of the South West Creative Technologies Network’s Automation Fellowship programme in 2019-2020. The goal is to interpret their work pharmacologically and so to elaborate and extend Stiegler’s work on contemporary technocultural becoming. Digital automation and AI are powerful drivers of the so-called Silicon Valley era of disruptive “creative destruction”. This means that the stakes of creative making and its possibilities for taking care of the future cannot be higher today.\r\n </jats:p>",

The media-archaeological approach to geospatial â€œmemoryâ€ therefore analyzes data transfer from distributed storage agencies and interactive â€œonlineâ€-citizenship. Geospatial media analysis (navigation, mobility, orientation) is necessarily accompanied by micro-temporal analytics. Digital communication of cultural memory transforms from the traditionally space-based archives (its â€œtectonicsâ€) into dynamic up-dating in high frequency steps; site-specific memory is substituted by media-specific storage, recall and transfer. Symbolic urban cityscapes become a phenomenal function of underlying media infrastructures which take place at the emptiness left by former cultural and collective memory.</jats:p>",

The assumption of a static Cartesian, metric space of two or three dimensions only and defined by coordinates makes it difficult to create GIS and Historical GIS (HGIS) interfaces and representations that include the dynamics Bergson and later Deleuze describe. They argue that temporal memory is the basis of attention in encounters and perception of situations. This “affiliation” of the past enlivens the present perceptual life of experience. Video gaming and the combination of Google Earth and Street View are explored as limited alternatives that draw on embodied, kinaesthetic experiences of movement in space to open up or “uncurl” extra dimensions that allow more nuance in digital representations of spatiotemporal encounters, and the many modes and rhythms of duration found in the environment.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Writing onto the Clouds: John Durham Peters and Inscription Media",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This short essay suggests that John Durham Peters’ Speaking into the Air (1999) re-capitulates its arguments through form. In its written medium, with its hermeneutic mode, and by its promiscuous prose, the book exemplifies its own moral case for dissemination over (in Peters’ chilling phrase) ‘interpersonal mimesis’. The essay positions the book’s first chapter, on Jesus and Socrates, as an unannounced nesting, in which Peters uses the parable mode to endorse a parable about the virtue of parables. Another facet of the book’s formal re-enactment of its argument surfaces in Peters’ method of discrete and serialized exegesis of old texts. Speaking into the Air is, in its way, a celebration of temporary breakdown, of the otherness of the other, of slippage and ellipses. Thus, it is fitting that the bulk of the book’s page-time is given over to dialogue at a distance, suspended dialogue, dialogue with the dead. There is, finally, the book’s polymathic weirdness—aphoristic, punning, etymological exuberance. Peters, on most pages, is overtopping the levees of meaning—a nod, I argue, to the book’s skepticism about the dream of easy lucidity.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "Lauren Berlant on Genre",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is no doubt that the writing of Lauren Berlant is influential in media and cultural studies as well as across gender and feminist studies and other work in critical, cultural and materialist traditions. Given the complexity of Berlant’s work and its integral refusal of taxonomic and hegemonic terms, it can be difficult for the reader to coherently grasp the singularity of even their most powerful concepts. This essay attempts to think with Berlant’s conceptualisation of genre without displacing the concept from their work through representational summarisation. The essay is part close reading, part exegesis and part experimentation – I hope just as Berlant would have wished. Rather than aim for an even description that accounts for Berlant’s various interventions in a measured way, the method of this essay is to think-write with the ellipsis, to undertake a translation that puts to one side the fantasy of mastery but still seeks to deepen our understanding of the intended meaning of Berlant’s texts. For Berlant, intended meanings would be about what something brings into the world. At minimum, this is my best effort at partaking in a cultural studies pedagogy that foregrounds the practice of critical thinking as world making. The essay then offers an invitation to the reader to learn from Berlant’s work about what the theoretical concept of genre can do. Just as this abstract does, the essay moves in and out of convention, where the sociality of affect does its work to congeal, to disturb, to make sense and make senseless. To move on.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the late-1890s, five cities in the United States set up miles of tubing that would send canisters filled with mail sailing from post office to post office, pushed through the length of tube by compressed air. These letters could arrive within the hour and were delivered throughout the day regardless of the constraints of weather or traffic on the streets above. Anticipating our contemporary uses of text messages, the pneumatic mail services offered people the ability to stay in touch throughout the day, coordinating plans or exchanging love notes through an infrastructure that was a key part of defining modern American society. The tubes and the pneumatic mail delivery went defunct in the 1950s; yet, years later, in the early-2000s, a New York entrepreneur came across the archives of these old tube systems and decided to run fiber optic cable from building to building through the now-obsolete tubes. Comparing how these two technologies â€“ pneumatic tubes and fiber optic cables for the Internet â€“ created an imagination of the instantaneous in their respective times, I explore the powerful allure of the instantaneous and how such ideas open up an exploration of the relationship between proximity and everyday temporality as the pace of communications are affected by the desire for ever-accelerating technologies for communication.</jats:p>",

Ultimately, through my proposal for an aesthetic strategy in “thinking-with the artwork,” I propose provisional terms for a novel experience of the extractions, abstractions, and subtractions the zonal artwork practices upon, and undergoes in relation to, its ambient environment and the attendant human subject.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This text responds to Alan Díaz Alva’s careful and compelling account of the tensions between and ultimate compatibility of Beatrice Fazi’s work on the formal incomputability of computation and my account of computational media in Feed-Forward. I recount Díaz Alva’s reconstruction of the “claim for inversion” I introduce in my book and suggest that the priority it grants the “superject” over the concrescing subject means that all process is both self- and other-determined. Linking this double determination to Whitehead’s insistence on the basal “dipolarity” of process according to which all prehension involves both physical and conceptual feelings, I question what Díaz Alva felicitously dubs Fazi’s “minimal definition of computation as self-determination.” Linking it to Fazi’s effort to isolate the conceptual-formal dimension of computation from its physical-sensible dimension, I try to show that this limitation of computation to self-determination provides the ground for Fazi’s effort to conceptualize computability and the incomputable on the basis of an internal contingency that is purely formal. I suggest that this effort is in fact what Whitehead would call an “abstraction,” which is to say, an empirical experience of “preanalytical,” in-itself unknowable process. Treating it as abstraction allows us to discern the operation of a more basal contingency – an intrinsic contingency – that lies at the core of all process and that is the source for the formalist abstraction (and all other possible abstractions). Returning to Díaz Alva’s generous proposal regarding our respective projects, I conclude that our accounts can indeed be made compatible although on slightly different terms than the ones Díaz Alva outlines. To that end, I introduce an account of the incomputable rooted in the excess of the sensible over computational measurement (Giuseppe Longo) and offer a concrete proposal for how to incorporate the formal dimension (pure potentiality) of computation into the concreteness of process.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What has replaced the still photograph are dynamic and distributed image-assemblages that unsettle received notions of space-time — no longer limited to traditional representation and not necessarily even visual. When it comes to computer vision for example, the descriptor photography seems largely redundant (despite deep learning computer vision systems being trained on large datasets of photographic images), and so too the tired metaphor of the eye that once supported its theories and practices. What is at stake here, as ever, is a kind of ‘seeing’ (if we continue to call it that) that makes clear what is visible, sensible and knowable, and crucially also what is not. We might call this seeing algorithmically, or seeing like a dataset, or perhaps even seeing like an infrastructure, comprised of fake images that render fake history. The logic of this invokes the complex notion of ‘image is dialectics at a standstill’, encapsulating a constellation of possible outcomes. To what extent is the radical potential that Benjamin once foresaw in montage applicable to image-based AI given that it seems less an instrument to imagine a qualitatively different future but simply more of the same. What can be seen is not so much representational nor photographic but latent traces of material relations and infrastructures that render historical experience in compromised form.</jats:p>",

In this essay, we argue that theorizing photography from the perspective of filtering reconfigures photography as the entire field of material elements and processes involved in the production of an image and presents the photographic image itself as a distribution across a field of perception that includes various forms of technical sensing and formation. Ultimately, attending to filtering as the technical realities as well as aesthetic propositions in recent art projects allows us to understand photographic conditions as a wider and more general set of environments in which image-events occur with many kinds of causality and manifestation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article traditional paradigms of photographic seeing undergo scrutiny through the perspective of non-human sensory processes, notably echolocation, fostering a diverse, interspecies interpretation of vision. This inquiry unsettles the anthropocentric norms prevailing in photographic scholarship and technological innovation. Redefining “seeing” as a layered, multisensory activity extending past human limitations propels a revision of photography’s foundational assumptions, undermining the conventional dependency on light and human vision for defining the essence of photography. Incorporating non-human perspectives, like the echolocative engagements of bats and dolphins, introduces “active sensing” – an interactive engagement between emitter and receiver, shifting away from the static, observer-centric photography paradigm. This conceptual transition advocates for an engaged, participatory framework in image creation, challenging established passive viewing models. The article particularly emphasizes the implications of these insights for autonomous transportation, like vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication systems, which arguably mirror biological active sensing methods. This confluence of biological senses and technological advancements not only enhances our understanding of autonomous systems but also invites a dialogue with speculative narratives from science fiction, where the fusion of organic and engineered forms of sensing often prefigures the future trajectories of technological evolution and societal adaptation.</jats:p>",

We were going to explore issues of autobiography and the non-personal, memory-work, the relationship between practices of censorious silencing and cover stories, and class differences, with an explicit focus on writing styles and method. We never quite got to the interview as our conversation digressed.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>“Seeing photographically” is an act of cultural memory. In an era of AI-generated images, screenshots, “disappearing” or “view once” photographs, and myriad other practices that challenge the definitional boundaries of photography, the phrase invokes past understandings of the medium’s sensory affordances, transferring them into a continually changing present. Focusing on a case study of the digital “rescue” of found film chemical photography, the article excavates cultural memory processes that relocate photographic seeing to digital arenas. The memory of “seeing photographically” does more, it claims, than preserve photography as a “zombie category” that disguises the reality of computational imagery. Rather, it helps construct and maintain a media ideology of what photography was and is, and of its continuing cultural, and especially existential, significance. Mobilizing worldviews, social values, and moral obligations associated with photography in the past, “seeing photographically” reanimates them in contemporary contexts of media ubiquity, intensified visibility, and existential anxiety, with profound ramifications.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article sets out to challenge the idea of photography as a medium that deals purely in the visible. Taking the example of the mid-twentieth-century British photography industry, this article considers photographic sensitivity as part of a sensory economy in which human, technological and environmental sensing are mutually entangled. I emphasise these interlinked sensing systems, and what I see as the “passive agency” of photographic materials, showing how photographic emulsions are capable of registering much more than visible light or even radiation. Chemical photographic materials had distinct cultural biases built into them, yet often registered entities other than those they were designed to picture. Great effort went into restricting photographic sensitivities, as well as into cultivating them. By the 1930s, the photographic materials factories had air purification and climate control systems, sensitometry laboratories and specialist tropical materials. Their sensitised materials and chemicals transformed ecosystems and participated in a “technological sensory training”, shaping what people could perceive.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A slightly modified transcript of the Bernard Stiegler Memorial Lecture given on August 5, 2023, at the invitation of Yuk Hui and the Research Network for Philosophy and Technology, Hong Kong. From a reflection on Engels reflecting on the too-soonness and too-lateness of the French Commune government, via a film by Huillet and Straub to which these words of Engels gave birth, the author begins to reflect on Stiegler’s memorial text for Jacques Derrida. In an effort to reflect on Stiegler’s own position of advance and delay, three philosophical viewpoints on the significance of ChatGPT are offered, as a way into grappling with Stiegler’s most private, idiolectal concept: the idiotext. The recursions of AI are thereby distinguished from the recurrences of idiotextual “protension”, which invokes the question of desire. The latter leads to a little-known text by Stiegler on his time in prison, and on the meaning of prison as a locality of sublimation: a place in which time is in a way freed up, but also a place of sexual deprivation – how to think this conjunction?\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Missed Feelings’ addresses the complex repercussions of traumatic experience Lauren Berlant lays out in their article “Structures of Unfeeling” (2015). The article helps to trace the unexpected mediations of injury into affect and discusses the role of victimhood from sexual assault in patriarchal societies. With regard to a case of systemic sexual abuse in Germany, I argue that unfeeling is an essential element of sexual violence. Berlant’s theoretical account of life-sustaining attachments and affect as mediation makes the dialectic of harm and lack of feeling understandable. Unfeeling in the form of social indifference enables gendered violence to occur and to continue uninterrupted, while at the same time, unfeeling is a tool used by survivors in order to be able to live with their experience of assault while often it remains legally and socially unacknowledged. This dynamic of unfeeling explains sexual violence’s subjectifying power: the expectation of not being seen as a credible victim forces survivors to search for other affective mediations of their reality. Therefore, self-protection in a patriarchal world might look risky, idiosyncratic and often unexpected.\r\n </jats:p>",

We explore how, for Berlant and Williams, mediation requires a suspension or dislodging of direct cause and effect relations in favour of an intuitive (and conjectural) analytics of the ongoing overdeterminations that circulate through and about any particular affective/historical conjuncture. Reckoning with mediation has a profound impact too on our practices of writing and theorising – as critical-creative impulses, drawn from the intertwining rhythms of experience/experiment, emerge from the changing yet precise situations of the ordinary day-to-day. We argue that such a conceptualisation of mediation offers a productive means for attuning to and transforming the capacities of intellectual work, media/digital culture, and everyday life from within the midst of a continua of transformation.\r\n </jats:p>",

However, rather surprisingly, Berlant’s work does not engage directly with explorations of digital culture and its effects, nor has it been used extensively in the analysis of digital culture. We begin by updating Berlant’s descriptions of how we think about the contemporary culture of ‘crises’ (2011), drawing on recent documentations to illustrate the interconnected phenomena of “epidemics of loneliness” and isolation in the face of uncertainties of the historical present. To address those gaps, we then explore how cruel optimism and intimate publics have been taken up in studies of digital and social media. We will conclude by addressing how these concepts, as well as Berlant’s most recent work on the inconvenience of others, can best be engaged to help navigate and theorize digital culture. Finally, we take up their 2022 work to explore the crises of polarization as a manifestation of loneliness, through the lens of inconvenience. In conclusion, we will suggest how Berlant’s concepts provide valuable insight for further studies of digital culture.\r\n </jats:p>",

We then give a brief overview of the current institutionalization of the field and connect it to the founding of the Network for Critical Communications Research (abbreviated: KriKoWi) that aims to (re-) introduce critical theories (that is the critical theory of the Frankfurt School but also other critical approaches). Last but not least, we sketch our understanding of critique which ought to help scholars using different methodological and theoretical approaches to work together.

    "title": "Anti-Bourgeois Theory",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In his celebrated 2009 memoir Returning to Reims, the Parisian intellectual and theorist Didier Eribon travels home for the first time in thirty years following the death of his father. There he tries to account for the change in politics of his working class family over the period he has been away: from supporting the Communist Party to voting for the National Front. But Eribon also discusses the transition he himself has undergone as a result of having escaped his working class culture and environment through education, and how this has left him unsure whom it is he is actually writing for. He may be addressing the question of what it means to grow up poor and gay, however he is aware few working class people are ever likely to read his book.\r\n \r\nAt the same time, Eribon emphasizes that his non-conforming identity has left him with a sense of just how important it is to display a ‘lack of respect for the rules’ of bourgeois liberal humanist ‘decorum that reign in university circles’, and that insist ‘people follow established norms regarding “intellectual debate” when what is at stake clearly has to do with political struggle’. Together with his friend Édouard Louis and partner Geoffroy de Lagasnerie, Eribon wants to ‘rethink’ the antihumanist theoretical tradition of Foucault, Derrida, Cixous et al. to produce a theory ‘in which something is at stake’: a theory that speaks about ‘class, exploitation, violence, repression, domination, intersectionality’, and yet has the potential to generate the same kind of power and excitement as ‘a Kendrick Lamar concert’.\r\n \r\nWith ‘Anti-Bourgeois Theory’, I likewise want to reinvent what it means to theorise by showing a certain lack of respect for the rules of bourgeois decorum the university hardly ever questions. I want do so, however, by also breaking with those bourgeois liberal humanist conventions of intellectual debate that – for all his emphasis on rebelling ‘in and through’ the technologies of knowledge production – continue to govern the antihumanist theoretical tradition Eribon and his collaborators are associated with. Included in these conventions are culturally normative ideas of the human subject, the proprietorial author, the codex print book, critical reflection, linear thought, the long-form argument, self-expression, originality, creativity, fixity and copyright. I will argue that even the current landfill of theoretical literature on the posthuman and the Anthropocene is merely a form of bourgeois liberal humanism that is padded with nonhuman stuffing – technologies, objects, animals, insects, plants, fungi, compost, microbes, stones, geological formations – to make it appear different.

The author’s central argument is that, in addition to the more or less clearly stated intentions of this image-use, these transmediations of Muybridge’s historical photographic images also activate and extend questions and concerns from recent media theory: contributing to notions such as image ecology and image liveness, and proposing challenges to established distinctions between new/old media, still/moving images, and material/immaterial media qualities. A further suggestion is that their ability to carry out complex theoretical work relating to present-day media practices can help explain why these images have come to have such staying power in visual culture a century and a half after they were first made.\r\n </jats:p>",

Building on Jane Bennett’s critique of the modern narrative of disenchantment, this article explores ambiguity as a means of resisting totalising accounts of the present, as well as for accounting for the affective complexities involved in our engagements with devices, apps and platforms as these yield different rhythms and experiential horizons of possibility.

    "title": "The Art of Tokenization: Blockchain Affordances and the Invention of Future Milieus",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Ten years after the introduction of the Bitcoin protocol, an increasing number of art-tech startups and more or less independent initiatives have begun to explore second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum and the emergent practice of tokenization (i.e., the issuance of new cryptoassets primarily to self-fund decentralized projects) as a means to intervene in the structures and processes underlying the rampant financialization of art. Yet amidst the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, tokenization has been critiqued as a way to reinscribe and proliferate current financial logics in this new space. Acknowledging such critiques, in this essay I foreground the novelty of cryptotokens and blockchains by exploring different examples of how tokenization has been deployed in the art market-milieu. In spite of recent attempts to extend the scarcity-based paradigm to blockchains, I argue that cryptotokens do introduce differences in kind in the ways in which value generation and distribution are expressed and accounted for in digital environments. In this context, artistic approaches to tokenization can illuminate new aspects of the affordances of these technologies, toward the disintermediation of art production and its networked value from the current institutional-financial milieu. This can open up new ways to reimagine and reprogram financial and social relations, and gesture toward new opportunities and challenges for a practice of digital design focused on the ideation and realization of cryptoeconomic systems.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this note of commentary, I want briefly to reflect on how questions concerning aesthetics variously figure, lie just below the surface or are simply ignored across the increasingly diverse academic approaches to investigating media. This is in a situation in which the array of activities and practices under the heading ‘media’ is undergoing steady expansion, as is the spectrum of ideas, approaches and objectives informing study. Better cross-connection, first of all between studies variously addressing aesthetic issues and then between these and the many approaches currently placing them as marginal could, it is argued, be a productive intellectual development, bringing increased understanding of the relations between media forms, social feeling and social imagination.</jats:p>",

Taking the dialectical tension between affordance and determination, between medium and dispositif, as its point of departure, the article explores Transmute Collectiveâ€™s Intimate Transactions (2005) as a problematic fusion of the two approaches. A historicising re-reading of Guy Debordâ€™s Society of the Spectacle with regard to current forms of digital control and modes of production then argues that contemporary alienation takes place within the digital interface as the zone of indistinction between affordance and determination, and that instead of designing liberating machines or inventing subjective evasions of the dispositif, emancipatory engagement requires a destitution of the interface.\r\n </jats:p>",

In this article, the 2017 translator Professor Jianguo Deng discusses the history of communication studies in China, the usual approaches to translating English language scholarship in communication theory, the flawed 2003 text, his approach to re-translating Speaking into the Air, and the influential reception of the 2017 text among humanities scholars working in Chinese languages and cultures. \r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Virtual reality proponents often promise the technology will allow a more fully embodied sense of presence at a distance, or what researchers have called ‘telepresence.’ Departing from telepresence’s original focus on providing access to dangerous environments, VR and robotics researchers in Japan now promote everyday service and factory work via telerobots as a solution to the country’s rapidly shrinking workforce. Telepresence becomes a way to access the physical labor of the elderly, persons with disabilities, and foreign workers, while at the same time keeping them fixed in place at home or behind closed borders. This essay theorizes the perceptual segregation imposed by these immersive labor platforms as a form of telepresence enclosure: the mediated privatization of presence itself. If VR continues on its current trajectory, the telepresence enclosure is poised to enable technologically advanced countries to extract the physical labor of marginalized populations at home and abroad, while at the same time ensuring these workers remain excluded from a more fully embodied social mobility.\r\n </jats:p>",

This view of communication has followed the itineraries of the neoliberal economy and its expectations. Communication today is the site where individual aspirations, market expectations and national interests meet and collide. Taking a cue from Peters of thinking with the past, this essay follows the dualistic narrative in the complex linguistic terrain of India today where the English language and communication serve as a space for defining failure and promoting the remedy of self-development. Engaging with postcolonial examples, the discussion illustrates how narratives of miscommunication are integrated and reinforced in the entrepreneurial space of communication skills training.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>During the Spanish Inner Colonisation â€“ a large-scale agricultural reform and land settlement program of the central decades of the 20th century â€“ new towns were built in the middle of the arid areas that were going to be transformed into irrigated lands. Their names and locations were announced in the Official State Gazette together with their proposed locations. The system employed to address their positions in the wastelands was based on the road network: it involved the distances to the nearest roads, and the specification of the kilometric milestones concerned. \r\nThis paper proposes to analyse the positioning system in relation to one of the most salient features of this Spanish program: the use of the so-called cart-module to distribute the settlement towns. These were arranged in constellations so that each piece of land could be addressed through a walking distance from the closest town. Taking into account also the role of the authoritarian State, present in the technical management of the irrigation systems, the agriculture put into work will be analysed as a vertical practice. \r\nThis paper will consider these operations from what social anthropologist Penelope Harvey has pointed out as the topological quality of infrastructural spaces, where space is apprehended in relation to the effects of a calculating framework. The material transformation of this topological zoning through irrigation, finally, will be examined in relation to Lisa Parksâ€™ critical infrastructure notion of satellite footprints and signal territories.</jats:p>",

Medialization and mediatization are among these expressions that have achieved a high degree of popularity especially in German scholarly discourse. In this paper, we first examine some aspects of the politics of concepts of corresponding discourses in German media and communication studies. In contrast to synonymous or all-inclusive uses of the terms, we argue for a conceptual differentiation and constructive coexistence that can prove fruitful for both theoretical and empirical research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Pluriversal Socialism – The Very Idea’ starts from the position that politics in the West today is typically conducted in liberal humanist terms. This is the case regardless of whether those involved identify as radical democrats, socialists, communists, feminists, Greens, Marxists or anarchists.\r\nContemporary antihumanist and posthumanist theory is meant to offer something very different to liberal humanism. Media ecology, media archaeology, new materialism and object-oriented philosophy are all positioned as representing a shift away from anthropocentrism and a modernist epistemology based on the separation of human from nonhuman, subject from object, masculine from feminine, culture from nature, living from non-living. Instead, they champion a radically relational approach to the world that is designed to destablise such ontological dualisms. Yet while antihumanist and posthumanist theorists may write about transgressing the boundary that divides the human from the nonhuman, when it comes to their own ways of being and doing they too often end up operating as bourgeois liberal humanists.\r\n‘Pluriversal Socialism’ continues with my exploration (in texts such as Pirate Philosophy and ‘Anti-Bourgeois Theory’) of how we can not only write non-liberal humanist theory but actually work, act and live as non-liberal humanists too. It does so by drawing on the emphasis that is currently placed by a number of Latin Americanist theorists on pluriversal, ontological, radically relational politics (as distinct from the universal, modernist, counterhegemonic politics of most left thinkers in the Global North). In the process it addresses two important questions that have been raised recently by Arturo Escobar and Boaventura de Sousa Santos respectively: ‘Can we unlearn the liberal individual … in a similar way that we endeavour to unlearn patriarchy, racism and heterosexism?’ And is what we need to do so ‘another theory of revolution’ or a revolution of theory?\r\n‘Pluriversal Socialism’ is part of an ongoing discussion with Gabriela Méndez Cota and Jeremy Gilbert, who wrote responses to my 2019 essay for Media Theory, ‘Anti-Bourgeois Theory’. See Gabriela Méndez Cota, ‘Pirate Traces’ and Jeremy Gilbert, ‘Anti-Bourgeois for What?’, in Media Theory, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2020.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile games downloads have witnessed a surge during the covid-19 lockdown. Gaming is said to provide a much-needed distraction from the crisis whose intensity is felt as shrunk space and paused time. This article concerns the seemingly contradictory modes of attention – bored/disengaged and intensely engaged – during the covid-19 pandemic. It rethinks the relation between boredom and care by zooming in on the present of the gamer subject. Drawing on feminist theorizations of care and time, critical game studies as well as theorizations of boredom, especially in the context of digital games, this article analyses a hyper-casual game called Helix Jump and rereads the temporality of the covid-19 narrative in China through the logic of digital gaming. It suggests that boredom should be understood as an im/possibility, that is not antithetical to, but an expression of the as-well-as-possibleness of care.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article addresses ableism in 21st century netÂ­work society by analysing affordÂ­ances in the practices of visually impaired photographers. The case study details how these photoÂ­graphers use assistive deÂ­vices, tweaking affordÂ­ances of both these devices and the photoÂ­graphic apparatus: its techÂ­nical materialities, cultural conceptÂ­ualÂ­izations and creative exÂ­pressions. The main argument is that affordances operate in exÂ­changes where sharing differÂ­ences is key; visually imÂ­paired photoÂ­graphers make differÂ­Â­ences sharable through images, revealing vulnerÂ­abilities that emerge within a socio-digital condition that affects users across a spectrum of abiliÂ­ties. The argument unfolds through a rare combination of affordance theory about imaginative and diÂ­verse human-technology reÂ­laÂ­tions, media theory about technological deÂ­penÂ­dÂ­ence and disÂ­Â­ruption, disability studies on normÂ­Â­aÂ­tivity and variÂ­ation, and art histoÂ­rical readÂ­ings informed by semiotics and phenoÂ­menÂ­oÂ­logy. The article conÂ­tributes to cross-disciplinary research by demonÂ­strating that affordances can be tactical, inÂ­terÂ­vening in pervasive socio-digital systems that limit who counts as a normal user.\r\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Drawing from our collaboration on an AHRC funded research project, this essay will look at the production and reception of an artwork and offer an account of the tension in the work between the â€œauthoredâ€ time line, the userâ€™s temporal experience and the impact of mediated time on that experience. The artwork itself utilises a combination of pre-recorded audio, geo-locative technology and printed material to create an urban walking experience. The route is not pre-determined, but is created uniquely each time by a participating audience member in response to thematic and reflective provocations. Locations they are invited to choose while walking become part of their internal memory map of the city, while the GPS co-ordinates are stored by a mobile device. In the second half of the experience, the walker retraces their steps, layering their own experiential memory within media triggered by the stored locations. The audio and written material in the piece was collected from regions around the world at risk of disappearing. These include emptying Latvian villages, the sinking wetlands of Louisiana and the rising edge of the Tunisian Sahara. A particular affect of critical awareness of planetary presence is produced as an event at the interface of the spatial and temporal elements that compose it.</jats:p>",

The motif of the dawn in Virilio’s writing brings his focus to bear on the phenomena of rapid transport and electronic transmission technologies as they come to reproduce and in principle to replace the spatial and temporal environment of bodies illuminated by solar optics. In this article, I raise a question concerning the experiential sphere of morality, consciousness and community in Virilio’s explanation of an epoch increasingly dominated by these technologies. If Virilio is correct, we are in a transition towards the final epoch of humanity, governed by a quasi-theological media environment, and characterised by an experience of disappearance that was entirely novel to the twentieth century. The article assesses Virilio’s account of the paradoxical emergence from the ruins of the urban architecture of a city characterised by the phenomena of disappearance and substitution: a city that functions as the museum of the phenomena it supplants.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The opening of CityCenter, Las Vegas in 2009 marked the single largest privately funded?development in American history. The sprawling resort campus signalled a departure from all-encompassing themes of kitsch that had long defined the Las Vegas Strip, obfuscating the threshold between public and private. It is indicative of the broader push for deregulation and monopolization that are characteristic of neoliberal processes. This raises pertinent questions around the implications of the apparent ‘de-theming’ of these leisure environments and the wider normalization of neoliberal principles in architecture and urbanism. The seminal Learning from Las Vegas identified the merging of sign and building alongside the widespread adoption of neoliberal ideology, where the roadside sign advanced from “decorated shed” to “duck” to atmospheres and, eventually, urbanism. Employing Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s concepts of “de-territorialization” and “re-territorialization,” this process of de-theming can be theorized as the reconfiguration of leisure as the totalizing image of gentrification and urban renewal.\r\nThrough an examination of the overlapping histories of organized crime, federal funding, migration, class struggle, and an entrenched regional military presence, Las Vegas can be understood as a city undergoing constant flux. The Las Vegas Neon Museum has become an important indexological catalogue of signage from lost buildings, attempting to preserve the collective memory of Las Vegas while reinforcing the prominence of the image within the American commercial vernacular.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its initial formulation in 1988, the Herman-Chomsky Propaganda Model (PM) has become one of the most widely tested models of media performance in the social sciences. This is largely due to the combined efforts of a loose group of international scholars as well as an increasing number of students who have produced studies in the US, UK, Canadian, Australian, Japanese, Chinese, German, and Dutch contexts, amongst others. Yet, the PM has also been marginalised in media and communication scholarship, largely due to the fact that the PMâ€™s radical scholarly outlook challenges the liberal and conservative underpinnings of mainstream schools of thought in capitalist democracies. This paper brings together, for the first time, leading scholars to discuss important questions pertaining to the PMâ€™s origins, public relevance, connections to other approaches within Communication Studies and Cultural Studies, applicability in the social media age, as well as impact and influence. The paper aligns with the 30th anniversary of the PM and the publication of the collected volume, The Propaganda Model Today, and highlights the PMâ€™s continued relevance at a time of unprecedented corporate consolidation of the media, extreme levels of inequality and class conflict as well as emergence of new forms of authoritarianism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholars working within different critical theory traditions are not unfamiliar with the experience of encountering dismissive representations of their work, including from parts of the academy that disavow the politics of academic research and knowledge production. However, the political project of delegitimizing critical research and scholarship seems to be intensifying. Signifiers like “critical theory”, “critical race theory” and “gender theory” have become objects of antagonism and moral panic for a diverse cast of political, cultural and media actors, including self-styled academic dissidents with audiences well beyond the academy. In tandem, critical scholarship faces an increasingly inhospitable ecology within the neoliberal university, even while the latter simultaneously brands itself in the language of social justice. Chaired and introduced by Gavan Titley, the panel contributions from Sahana Udupa, Éric Fassin, and Diana Mulinari reflect on the challenges faced by critical scholars and critical scholarship in a time of emboldened reactionary politics. It asks how these challenges might be intellectually and politically confronted, and countered, in light of the special issue’s reflections on the current condition of critique.\r\n </jats:p>",
