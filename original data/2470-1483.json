    "title": "Let’s play something awful: a historical analysis of 14 years of threads",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Something Awful Let’s Play subforum is widely acknowledged as the birthplace of the Let’s Play (LP) media phenomenon. LPs typically involve people recording themselves playing games while providing commentary. LPs are an important media form in themselves as well as being an important antecedent to many contemporary and popular media forms such as live streaming, esports and speed-running. An examination of the Something Awful LP subforum can contribute to an understanding of the origins of LPs and the community that created them. In this paper, we report on a study of the Something Awful LP subforum and describe the kinds of engagement the community participates in the top threads, as well as looking to see if there are specific individuals responsible for guiding the subforum overall. We collected data from the thousands of public threads posted in the LP subforum, from its inception in 2007 to the end of 2020. The analysis of these postings presented in this paper draws on previous understandings of the behavioral roles, forms of engagement, and policing of practices that often occur on internet forums as part of the regulation and organization of associated online communities. Our results show that the LP subforum was not dominated by a small minority of users that dictated the community’s LP posting, recording and commentary practices, and that the content of the specific threads was much more important in determining what forms of LPs became popular.",

    "title": "The first propaganda war through computer networks: STEM academia and the breakup of Yugoslavia",
    "abstract": "Abstract The history of computer networks is relatively well described in Western literature but some parts of the world have been neglected. This paper explores the first ways in which computer networks were used in Yugoslavia, since these are different from the modes used in the West or Russia, because the dissolution of the country – mixed with its transition from communism to democracy and the wars for independence – created an environment which allowed computer networks to be used in unprecedented ways. The paper uses a mix of historical method, computational methods for collecting and analysing USENET data, semi-structured interview, archival research, and qualitative online observation. The main findings show that access to Western technology and participation in academic networks enabled Yugoslavian STEM academia and hackers to use computer networks for the first computer networks’ propaganda war. Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians created electronic mailing lists through which they tried to manipulate international actors and to bond the diaspora for a common cause, and they additionally fought in USENET discussion groups by implementing trolling techniques.",

    "title": "Becoming a semiotic technology – a historical study of Instagram's tools for making and sharing photos and videos",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Since October 2010, Instagram has provided its users with photo filters and other visual communication features with which they are changing the semiotic landscape of mobile photography. These tools, used to make and share images, are continuously updated. While these functionalities have been studied from a synchronic perspective, a diachronic study of their semiotic and interactive features has been overlooked. The purpose of this article is to investigate the design history of the tools in Instagram's mobile user interface. Drawing on a social semiotic multimodal framework, this article presents an analysis of selected tools in the Instagram mobile user interface from 2010 until 2017. It reports on the findings of how tools changed quantitatively and qualitatively. Three interrelated developments are tracked: the number of tools, their semiotic representation and the potential meaning of these. Subsequently, the study shows that the Instagram application makes knowledge and skills available to a community of amateurs that used to be reserved for professional photographers. Thus, the study characterises the ways Instagram as a semiotic technology over time has facilitated and structured visual meaning-making.",

Middens are pits of domestic refuse filled with the discards and by-products of material life: the gnawed bones, ashes, fruit stones and potsherds, shells and chips and hair and drippings which together constitute the photographic negative of a community in action and an invaluable record for archaeologists. Using this analogy, I will discuss two from my own research: the archives of spam, which we would all rather forget, and the records of the communities and marketplaces of the so-called “Dark Web,” which would prefer to be forgotten. I will also address the challenges of research with other kinds of eccentric, troubling or speculative archives, like blockchains, ephemeral imageboards and doxxes. I will close by discussing ways that we can think of digital historiography, in particular, in terms of these accidental, unwanted, averse archives.",

    "title": "The field of communication’s uptake of computers, networks, and the internet: 1970–2000",
    "abstract": "Abstract Our goal in this article is to understand the historical sequences as well as consequences of the internet on the development of the academic field of communication. As a field that has one foot in the study of a most basic and necessary human activity, and another foot in the study of innovative technology, has scholarship in the field of communication followed internet developments? Is there a lag between technological developments and communication research focused on those developments? We attempt to answer our questions by searching for keywords (such as computer, internet, CMC, etc.) in content from communication journals from 1970 to 2000. We find that a large number of keywords were entirely absent, and many of the occurrences involved the same small number of terms, indicative of a relatively narrow and/or shallow amount of interest in these phenomena. The dominance of terms like ‘computer’ and ‘internet’ (and, eventually, ‘Web’) indicate a generalist tone at work in these articles. There is relatively little breadth in the vocabulary related to computers and the internet, suggesting that the field of communication that was seemingly trying to digest the entire (constructed) category of behavior associated with computers and the internet in one gigantic linguistic bite rather than focusing on activities taking place via this new medium. There was not yet a sense of meaningful differentiation in what internet-based communication could involve; ‘internet’ communication was simply communication occurring by means of an internet-based delivery system; a new medium, figuratively and literally.",

    "title": "Women's knowledge co-production and sharing in online communities",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The co-production and sharing of lay knowledge among Internet users have grown. A large variety of communities of interest have contributed to redefine knowledge as a social construction and to redefine the mechanisms, elements and modes of knowledge sharing. I will draw on two case studies that were carried out in Italy in what has become commonly referred to as a shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 inside the European funded project SIGIS Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society (SIGIS). This project took place from 1 January 2001 to 31 January 2004. The first case study deals with a website on the rare disease Lupus erythematosus, and the second with the forums on the website of the most read Italian women's weekly, Donna Moderna. The ethnographic analysis of the two websites included the application of various methodological tools, among which were non-participant observation, interviews, online surveys and the collection of the messages exchanged in the two sites. Here I will focus on the content analysis of the messages: 1,845 from the first website and 4,287 from the second. The main result is that a practical knowledge deriving from an intertwined process of information, experience and experimentation that supported the decision-making process in users’ everyday life emerged. Consequently, the knowledge produced in the vertical axis of specialists’ knowledge was complemented by a knowledge produced in the horizontal axis of the peer.",

    "title": "When search engines stopped being human: menu interfaces and the rise of the ideological nature of algorithmic search",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Algorithmic search is entangled with a positivist ideology biased towards the assumption that neutrality can only be provided when search is performed by computational processes while shielded from human agencies. This article critically examines the ideological nature of algorithmic search, by showing how, between the mid-1970s and late-1980s, long before the birth of algorithmic search by search engines in the 1990s, a transformation from human interfaces to menu interfaces in online search helped encourage and normalise algorithmic ideology at the expense of a more humanistic ideology of search connected to library traditions. Based on a study of a broad corpus of archival materials in which online search appeared as a central object of description and discussion, it argues that the rise of menu interfaces in the 1980s encouraged the positivist nature of algorithmic search by decoupling a democratic service function at the front-end from the editorial function in the back-end, and by discouraging the use of human selection power and intellectual labour in the search process.",

    "title": "Semantics of the internet: a political history",
    "abstract": "Abstract The history of the Internet has been narrated many times. However, political histories of the Internet with a non-US-centric focus are still an uncharted research area. This paper contributes to closing that research gap. It reconstructs the Internet’s history in Germany through the lens of semantic changes in press coverage on politics. In our investigation, we sought to analyse semantic change as a political history by drawing on insights concerning the relationship between semantic change and political conflict from the perspective of discourse theory and theoretical reflections on politicisation. The study follows our intuition that semantic struggles of the past leave traces in word contexts. Conversely, it uncovers semantic change by following the traces of semantic struggles in these contexts. In line with this rationale, we conducted a ‘blended reading’ of word contexts that relied on a quantitatively assisted qualitative text analysis. The study finds that the Internet has long been understood predominantly as a tool for politics in the political public. In the late 2000s, its perception as a highly politicised object of governance also became dominant. While the Internet was always associated with a medium and a public sphere, its characterisation changed from ‘web 1.0’ to a ‘web of corporations’.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The digital exhibition space called Header/Footer Gallery hosted by the nonprofit organization New Media Caucus web presence has presented numerous exhibitions highlighting innovative work by artists across new media art. Established in 2020, Header/Footer has invited curators to curate exhibitions that explored the themes of technological malfunction, the legacies of cyberfeminism in the twenty first century, and Afrofuturism. Since then, taking up the role as the official curator for Header/Footer Gallery, the New Media Caucus’ curator has created different exhibitions concentrating on inclusivity and the exposure of emerging artists through creative curatorial design strategies. For this paper, we take Header/Footer Gallery as a case study to analyze the development of virtual exhibition spaces, their histories, benefits, challenges and their futures. Taking Header/Footer Gallery as an example of a virtual space, we analyze its challenges including the promotion and dissemination of exhibitions and their digital engagement, despite the increase in accessibility of virtual galleries, as well as the challenges of archiving virtual exhibitions. We also examine the creative freedom in creating a virtual gallery from the ground up and in establishing and promoting inclusive practices that emphasize diversity.",

If we consider ARPANET as a first step towards the Internet, how did it determine – and how does it continue to determine – our current understanding of the Internet?

Whilst the cypherpunk’s ideology, which is predominantly the output of Timothy C. May, is well understood, less is known about the composition of the cypherpunk’s community. This article builds on past studies by Rid and Beltramini by using the cypherpunk’s mail list archive to profile the most active and influential cypherpunks. This study confirms the May-derived ideology is broadly, though not entirely, representative of the cypherpunk community. This article assesses the cypherpunks were a highly educated, mostly libertarian community permeated by aspects of anarchism which arose from a societal disaffiliation inherited from the counterculture. This article further argues that the cypherpunks were also influenced by the hacker ethic and dystopian science fiction.",

    "title": "The engineer–criminologist and “the novelty of cybercrime”: a situated genealogical study of timesharing systems",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Novelty of Cybercrime is a research problem in criminology where scholars are asking whether cybercrime is a wholly new form of crime compared with traditional–terrestrial crimes and whether new criminological theories are needed to understand it. Most criminological theories focus on the human rational aspects and downplay the role of non-humans in explaining what may be novel in cybercrime. This paper shows that a sociotechnical perspective can be developed for understanding the Novelty of Cybercrime using some insights from criminology. Working from the agnosticism principle of Actor-Network Theory and a situated genealogical perspective, it is possible to see that a criminological vocabulary can accommodate both the roles and relations of rational human and non-human actors. This is achieved by proposing the concept of the engineer–criminologist, developed by conducting a study of the development of information security for timesharing systems in the 1960s and 1970s. Timesharing security engineers were facing a completely new form of rule-breaking behaviour, that of unauthorised access and at the same time they were constantly using criminological concepts to shape their design of security and explain this behaviour. The concept of engineer–criminologists affords the use of criminological concepts in the sociotechnical study of the Novelty of Cybercrime.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Web archives are increasingly considered key infrastructure for web histories, yet the story of their initial development is often overlooked. Paying attention to the period between the emergence of the web and the first web archives, this article asks: how was the archived web conceived as an object of knowledge? And how have its conceptual origins shaped web archives as a window into the web’s past? Drawing on ethnographic and historical research at one of the first web archiving institutions, the National Library of Australia, it details how systems, standards, and skills in use at the library were applied to a nascent web. It shows how archiving the web became both conceivable and actionable by library workers as they came to understand and act on various web-based materials as types of publications. Reflecting on this history, this article argues that present-day web archives have inherited both strengths and limitations from the older knowledge infrastructures from which they emerged. By detailing the messy, incremental path of infrastructural development, this article extends recent STS-inflected work on web archives as epistemic agents, adding a historical dimension to our understanding of how web archives enable and constrain particular ways of knowing the web’s past.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In today's hyper-mediated world where computer software can deal seamlessly with a variety of the world's languages and scripts, it is difficult to recall the seemingly insurmountable computing problems raised by “Han” character-based scripts such as Chinese, Japanese (and to a lesser extent, Korean). In the early days of networked computing, some commentators even argued that the continued use of Han characters was a lost cause, and could only result in “intolerable inefficiencies” when used to communicate digital information. In this paper, I consider the orthographic factors that delayed the implementation of cross-platform protocols allowing for the input, display and transmission of character-based scripts across early computer networks (mid-1980s to mid-1990s). I note how Anglophone Internet histories have been largely oblivious to the inherent biases of Internet infrastructure that were built by programmers using ASCII (based on the limited range of characters provided by the Roman alphabet) who also assumed the QWERTY keyboard to be the obvious human–machine interface. Instead of stressing the deficiencies of character-based scripts, I invite the reader to consider how the Internet might look today had it not been founded upon assumptions based on Anglophone usage, and consider the potentialities of a non-phonetic character-based writing system.",

    "title": "From closed world discourse to digital utopianism: the changing face of responsible computing at Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (1981–1992)",
    "abstract": "Abstract Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) began in 1981 as a group of computer scientists concerned about nuclear destruction. Early CPSR members analysed military planning documents and levelled technical critiques at how computers were to be used in battle, highlighting the limits of computing technologies. Although early CPSR arguments were primarily technical, as responsible professionals their practices were based on a collective morality and a willingness to question their profession’s economic self-interest. As the Cold War thawed in 1989, CPSR met a series of challenges, including financial issues, leadership turnover, and a changing and expanding role for information technology. CPSR emerged from this crisis with a renewed focus on “civil liberties” that was largely underwritten by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Although CPSR’s civil liberties advocacy sometimes retained its early arguments and practices by addressing the limitations of information technologies, they also adopted the emerging views of Silicon Valley’s “digital utopianism,” advocating for the growth of information technology. We describe this seemingly contradictory shift in responsibility along three axes: the use of standpoint epistemology for responsible computing, a transition from professional choice to lobbying, and a transition from substantivism to instrumentalism. In this paper, we characterize an important instance of collective responsibility for computing by tracing the evolution of CPSR’s first decade of practices, techniques, and arguments with an eye towards the challenges of responsible computing today.",

    "title": "The Internet as a structure of feeling: 1992–1996",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Between 1992 and 1996, the Internet went from being an experiment in connecting computers to being the inevitable next step in delivering the digital “revolution.” This change in perception was not just a recognition. It was an act of social construction, setting the stage for the major reorganisation of global communications over the next two decades. The Internet as we know it was constructed with a species of elite cultural imagination. Building on earlier work, this essay elaborates the causes and character of the particular “structure of feeling” that emerged during this period. The resulting habits of thought can be seen in a number of subsequent developments, from the rapid build out of Internet infrastructure in the late 1990s, to the net neutrality debates and to design choices favouring intense, always-connected interaction. The essay concludes by suggesting that technologies are best understood, not so much as agents in their own right, but as thought-objects for the collective enactment and exploration of hopes, desires and political visions.",

    "title": "Situating dead-and-dying platforms: technological failure, infrastructural precarity, and digital decline",
    "abstract": "Abstract This double special issue explores internet histories through the lens of “platform death” as a way of understanding how digital communities grapple with absence, invisibility, and disappearance. Collectively, the contributions in this issue address the cultural, geopolitical, economic, and socio-legal repercussions of what happens when platforms fail, decline, or expire. The manuscripts draw on divergent methods, data, and analytical frameworks; in turn, they address what digital death as a metaphor reveals about the internet’s growth and stagnation, its present and futures, and its multiplicities. This collaboration has drawn on a collective understanding that mortality as a metaphor can serve as a discursive mode of contesting the control and corporatization of the internet. The impetus for it came from a panel in the Communication History Division at the May 2020 International Communication Association’s Annual Conference, entitled “Dead-and-dying platforms: The poetics, politics, and perils of internet history.” We hope its contents inspire other scholars to think creatively and daringly about technological failure, infrastructural precarity, and digital decline.",

    "abstract": "For more than four decades, the Internet has grown and spread to an extent where today it is an indispensable element in the communication and media environment of many countries, and indeed of everyday life, culture and society. These precipitous changes have called for the understanding of the innovations, actors, changes and continuities involved in these evolutions, from a technical, but also from a social, scientific, politic or economic point of view. Although the history of the Internet has not been yet very predominant within the academic literature, an increased number of books and journal articles within the last decade attest to the fact that Internet history is an emerging field of study across a number of scholarly disciplines and fields. This is most evident in Internet and new media studies, but also is clear in culture, media, communication and technology research, across the diverse settings and institutional locations where such work may be encountered. A central issue for the advancement of the field is that historical studies of the Internet have mostly been published in journals related to a variety of disciplines, and these journals only rarely publish articles with a clear historical focus. The situation has greatly improved with the various recent issues dedicated to Internet and web histories,",

    "abstract": "Abstract Through a case study of the January 6 U.S. Capitol riot, this paper looks at how Reddit users came together to document what they perceived as a significant historical event in United States history. By comparing how three subreddits selected content for archiving and the discussions they sparked, this paper contributes a perspective about how archiving efforts are carried out by everyday internet users and how researchers might put these efforts to use in the future. Studying everyday internet users’ compulsion to document reveals not only their approaches to archiving, but also how they are experiencing a historical event. “Rogue archiving” has saved what might otherwise be lost to content removals and overnight website closures. But even rogue archiving groups have set processes and structures which enable them to produce web and digital archives. What about archiving efforts that are even more informal and spontaneous? On Reddit, people responded to January 6 by self-organising archiving efforts, thereby revealing logics to and motivations for archiving—and their reactions to the day’s events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines women-exclusionary discourses on the popular anime Usenet newsgroup, rec.arts.anime. By going back to pre-2000 online anime histories, this paper proposes to understand how women-exclusionary discursive practices on rec.arts.anime have contributed to shaping contemporary toxic technocultures’ discursive identities, as it is admitted that forum 4chan originated from online anime fandom. By using a data set of 252 messages related to gender issues posted from 1992 to 1996, I identify 7 discursive practices that I am theorizing here under the name of negative networking: 1. Blaming female anime fans for their lack of visibility; 2. Doubting the authentic interest of women in anime; 3. Mystifying the female anime fan; 4. Harassing female anime fans; 5. Criticizing the association of feminism with anime, both as interpretive practices and as scholarship; 6. Belittling female anime fans’ concerns; and 7. Denying or ignoring the challenges faced by female anime fans. I argue that the impact of these discourses must be understood as determinant in the establishment of the online anime hegemonic fan identity and its prediscourses, especially as they relate to the long-lasting marginalization of women and gender diverse anime fans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This essay explores the emergence of self-archiving practices in the 1990s as a form of academic labour that is intimately tied to the popularisation of the Internet. It argues that self-archiving is part of a sociotechnical imaginary of networked scholarly communication that has helped to shape understandings of digital scholarship and dissemination over the past three decades. Focussing on influential texts written by open access archivangelist Stevan Harnad in 1990 and 1994, the essay analyzes the language and discursive strategies used to promote self-archiving as form of collective scholarly exchange. Through these writings, Harnad helped to articulate scholars to the Internet as a medium of publication, with impacts still seen today in policy discussions around open access and the public good that shape relations of knowledge production under contemporary forms of capitalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Web archives are not direct traces of the web, they are direct traces of crawlers. By design, the structure of web archives limits our capacity to explore the memory of the Web. These structural issues induce temporal discontinuities such as inconsistency, redundancy and blindness. In this paper, we address the question of re-injecting continuity within large corpora of web archives. We introduce the notions of persistences (series of time-stable snapshots of archived web pages) and continuity spaces (networks of time-consistent persistences). We demonstrate how – on the basis of a quality score – persistences can be used to select subsets of web archives within which in-depth historical analysis can be conducted at scale. We next propose to make use of a new visualization approach called web cernes to reconstruct the multi-level temporal evolution of an archived community of web sites. We finally apply our framework to study the history of the firsttuesday movement: a constellation of entrepreneurial web sites that acted in the interest of the economical growth of the web in the early 2000s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While automatized content identification of audio data, in critical discourse analysis, is bound to the symbolic order of monitoring, control, surveillance, censorship and copyright protection, the very tools and algorithms which have been developed for such purposes can be turned into instruments of knowledge production in the scientific sense. Audio content identification is not simply an extension of cultural taxonomies to machine listening, but an operation with its own eigen knowledge. Audio content identification is not simply a continuation of analog techniques for monitoring sonic objects. From a media-epistemological perspective, new forms of audio content identification open different orders of the sonic archive. What is practiced in the online domain has been preceded by experimental investigations of archival storage. The real l'archive, though, are the technological (hardware) and mathematical (software) criteria defining content identification. A media archaeology of audio content identification reveals the technological l'archive governing such forms of enunciation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The escalation in geopolitical tensions between China and the United States raises the critical issue of revisiting cyber nationalism in various contexts. A topic of critical inquiry, recent scholarship addresses the changing face of Chinese cyber nationalism since the 2010s, focussing on its connection with fan communities, cosmopolitan visions and the interplay of multifarious stakeholders. However, the ways in which emerging forms of cyber nationalism connect with its predecessors remain to be studied. To explore the historical connections of cyber nationalism across media platforms, this article investigates the role that MIT BBS, one of the most influential forums among overseas Chinese communities, played in organising pro-China protests during the 2008 Beijing Olympics torch relay. An examination of online political expressions not only unravels the multifaceted dimensions of nationalism, but it also deepens scholarly understanding of discursive activism, which emerged from text-based platforms prior to the dominance of mobile communication applications.",

    "abstract": "Aleksandra Kaminska is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at the Universit e de Montr eal, Canada, where she also co-directs the Artefact Lab and the Bricolab. Her research is based in media studies and aesthetics, and the history of technology. She is currently preparing High-Tech Paper: Security Printing and the Aesthetics of Trust, a monograph that examines the making of authentic paper for circulation in secure systems and infrastructures. She situates security printing within media and printing histories, but also as it intersects with art, craft, and design. Her work on authentication devices includes the production of Nano-verses (nano-verses.com), an art-sci collaboration that explored how the technology of nano-optical authentication can be rethought as artistic media. The articles discussed in the following interview are: “Storing Authenticity at the Surface and into the Depths: Securing Paper with Humanand Machine-Readable Devices” (Interm edialit es, 2018); “‘Don’t Copy That’: Security Printing and the Making of High-Tech Paper” (Convergence, 2019); and “The Intrinsic Value of Valuable Paper: On the Infrastructural Work of Authentication Devices” (Theory, Culture & Society, 2020). She recently co-edited an issue of PUBLIC: Art/Culture/Ideas on “Biometrics: Mediating Bodies” (2020), and is currently finalizing a co-edited volume of the Canadian Journal of Communication on the theme of “Materials and Media of Infrastructure.” In 2020–2021 she is co-organizing the online series Paperology: A Reading and Activity Group on Knowing and Being with Paper. Your work centers on efforts to secure the authenticity and identity of things and highlights how material standards contribute to the ordering of the world. In much of your writings, you place focus on techniques for identifying analog objects such as money and documents/valuable paper but we have also found your work to be highly stimulating for thinking about efforts to identify digital content like moving images and sounds. In “Storing Authenticity at the Surface and into the Depths” you introduce the concept of “authentication devices” to discuss the role and function of identification techniques. Could you explain a bit more about what you mean by this concept and how/ why you think it is useful for thinking about strategies of identification?",

    "title": "Forgotten passwords and Long-Gone exes: the life and death of Renren",
    "abstract": "Abstract Founded in 2005, Renren was a popular and leading Chinese social media network, especially among college students. However, after reaching its heyday in 2011, user growth dwindled and advertisers fled. By 2018, Renren morphed from a social network to a secondhand car sale business. This paper reconstructs the history of Renren and documents its failed transformation from a social network to a platform. Grounded in platform studies and a political economy theoretical framework, this paper traces Renren’s platform evolution from two perspectives: first, from an end user’s point of view, it examines how Renren’s user interface registered and mirrored shifting corporate strategies and platformisation processes writ large; second, given Renren’s status as a privately-owned, publicly-traded and for-profit business entity, the paper examines how Renren pursued different strategies in search of a viable business model and later on in managing shareholder value and profitability. Ultimately, this paper presents the rise and fall of Renren first and foremost as a platform historiography project. It then discusses Renren’s demise by looking retrospectively at changing interface design, business strategies, and financialisation against the broader dynamics and shifting sociocultural uses of the commercial Chinese internet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many Western social scientists have believed that South Korea, as one of the typical East Asian developmental states, was greatly influenced by state-led IT development, at least in its early technological development. However, both the 80s and the 90s were autonomous and exceptional periods for computer geek communities and start-ups, which were relatively free from developmental state initiatives. The present study calls attention to the little-known and undervalued historical phase of grassroots computing culture in the early history of the Korean Internet, which can be characterized as a pure Hangul (Korean) movement, even under the dominant paradigm of the developmental state. By investigating the socio-cultural history of that period, the present study aims to articulate the double-sided national motive of compromising the developmental desires of the state and the grassroots practices of the early computing culture in the midst of IT development in Korea. In doing so, the present study delineates how the early computer amateurs and tech-savvies were highly distinctive in localising non-commercial and reciprocal IT drives, and how their PC culture became a historical prelude to the civic hacking culture.",

    "title": "Laying the foundation for a commercialized internet: international internet governance in the 1990s",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the current era, the commercial nature of the internet seems like a foregone conclusion. However, during the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, the structures and guidelines for how this global system would operate were unresolved. Clinton took direct steps to ensure the commercialization of the internet and made a deliberate effort to gain agreement with public and private interest groups both in the United States and abroad. This article examines those efforts, focusing on three key questions present in the global discourse: First, where does oversight for internet structures come from, both in terms of country of origin, but also in terms of public versus private sectors? Second, how do traditional economic concerns translate to this new system? And finally, what protections are prioritized in this system? In looking at the patterns in that discourse, I argue that the Clinton Administration’s leadership in the area of internet governance projected a concern for an open, global internet while in actuality, the Administration pursued a U.S.-centric approach to governance that prioritized commercial interests. Given the continued importance of national sovereignty in debates around internet governance, the decisions being made in the 1990s demand further consideration.",

    "title": "Rethinking openness: a social constructivist approach to the promises of the new museology",
    "abstract": "Abstract From open-source software for collection management to open access initiatives for public reuse, the museum community is experiencing an ongoing transformation in what the concept of openness truly means. Adopting the social construction of technology as a theoretical framework and analytical method, this study investigates the changing attitudes and practices among museum professionals, especially how the intellectual precepts of the “new museology” have influenced the conceptualisation and operationalisation of openness. Methodologically, this study explores the archive of the Museums and the Web conference and conducts a qualitative content analysis of papers presented between 1997 and 2020 related to the topic of openness. By identifying and comparing how these papers discussed open-oriented practices, this study demonstrates how museum professionals have socially constructed the changing meanings of openness in the past twenty years and provides empirical evidence about how the new museology discourse has been realised in practice.",

    "title": "When Wikipedia met Tor: trials of legitimacy at a key moment in internet history",
    "abstract": "Abstract In 2005, the paths of Wikipedia and The Tor Project crossed publicly and ferociously. Tired of trolls and vandals, Wikipedia decided to block all Tor users from editing encyclopaedia articles. The Tor Project protested, arguing that such a block was not only ineffective, but constituted a form of censorship. This conflict came at a time when both projects were fighting to establish, maintain, and expand their perceived legitimacy. Using a threefold definition of “legitimacy,” this essay explores the Wikipedia/Tor conflict as a legitimacy conflict. We argue that Wikipedia was heavily invested in a conception of legitimacy as authenticity, focusing on who should be counted as a Wikipedian and who should be excluded. In contrast, the Tor Project was more concerned with Weberian legitimacy, challenging states’ claims to the monopoly of violent power. However, both projects shared an interest in acquiring resources and respect, or legitimacy as propriety. To explain this conflict, we draw on an archive of primary source emails and historical documents focusing on the early days (2001–2005) of both projects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Launched in 1993, the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV), located in Blacksburg, Virginia and connected to Virginia Tech, was an experiment in community computing. Through its funding models and technologies, the BEV united government, municipal, corporate, and university interests. While it received media attention and scholarly engagement in its prime, the BEV has not yet been reconsidered as part of the larger critical history of virtual communities and platforms. Through primary and secondary accounts of the BEV, I argue that the BEV’s trajectory is emblematic of how communities learn to negotiate going online for the first time, balancing the visions of designers and funders with those of users. The BEV was both a prototype and, later, a laboratory for participatory design, connecting an entire town to the World Wide Web. Its online listings of local businesses and e-commerce hub, known as the Village Mall, applications like MOOSburg—a multi-user domain—and an interactive Virtual School wired the town. The BEV was a small, rural, geographically-situated community used by senior citizens and college students alike, but it was not always inclusive. I point to critical scholarship about the BEV and other early electronic communities to situate the BEV within larger theoretical considerations regarding the relationship between electronic communities and local geographies, the different expectations of designers versus users, and the problems of inclusion, moderation, and control, even when access is provided.",

    "title": "“Tom had us all doing front-end web development”: a nostalgic (re)imagining of Myspace",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper provides an analysis of a nostalgic Myspace discourse that contradicts the narrative of Myspace as a failed platform. The Myspace nostalgia discourse is especially dominant on Twitter and responds to what Miltner refers to as the “coding fetish discourse”. It re-imagines Myspace through the lens of digital skill development and reinforces the framing of coding as a net good for social mobility, particularly for women and people of colour. It also offers trenchant critiques aimed at platform capitalism and platform governance that position Myspace as a foil for “toxic” and “gentrified” contemporary social media platforms. Contrary to previous popular framings of Myspace as an unsafe environment, Myspace coding Tweets offer a generative reimagining of Myspace as a place where young people learned valuable skills. In doing so, these Tweets take the very elements that supposedly caused Myspace’s decline—its chaotic aesthetics and the dominance of people of colour and young women—and reposition them at the core of Myspace’s value and worth. We argue that these nostalgic reframings of Myspace ultimately reflect contemporary discourses about coding and social media platforms: Myspace may have “died”, but it is our current sociotechnical ideals and anxieties that brought it back to life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Value creation is increasingly based on knowledge and intangible assets. This trend has gained momentum with the development of the service sector, the rise in competition as a result of globalisation and deregulation, and the impact of the digital revolution.Innovation has proven to be a key factor in economic growth. In the aftermath of the global crisis; public authorities, states, European organisations (the EU and the Council of Europe) and transnational and international bodies (UN, OECD, WTO, IMF) have a major role to play in regulating the multi-dimensional potential of global growth and defending against the problems inherent in these new, unavoidable processes.The EU sees the Digital Single Market (DSM) and the capital markets union as two priority aspects in the completion of the European Single Market (ESM), This article aims to highlight the main political, technological, institutional and regulatory characteristics and contradictions of the DSM from a global perspective, tracing its development over time and particularly analysing the taxation of the digital economy. The article also examines the EU’s changing role in a complex system of players worldwide, its contribution in setting global standards on fiscal and technological development, its involvement in the governance of new networks. This research is based on a wide range of multilingual and multimedia sources, relevant statistics on the digital economy, and clarifications of notions and terminology as needed.",

    "title": "Network neutrality in the European Union: A communications policy process analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Few Internet governance issues raised a similar level of public alertness, as it has been the case with network neutrality. Advocates in favour of strict rules feared the end of the Internet itself, while access providers fought against interferences in their business areas. The regulatory process in the European Union was multi-faceted and faced several key changes and turning points. This paper examines the positions at stake from the emergence of the network neutrality debate in 2009 during the amendment of the Telecom Single Market Directive to its aftermath in 2019. Focussing on the implications for public and private online communication, a normative and social value framework provides us with the basis for interpreting key developments. The methodological setting is a multi-method-design consisting of a comprehensive literature review, a document analysis as well as expert interviews with involved stakeholders. The results shed light on the importance of the EU Internet market, its characteristics and challenges and allow to draw a comprehensive image of the European Union’s performance in regulating network neutrality. Albeit the complex institutional setting slowed down the process, the outcome is characterized by the inclusion of multiple stakeholders and the possibility to adapt legal norms on a dynamic basis.",

    "title": "Cryptoeconomics as governance: an intellectual history from “Crypto Anarchy” to “Cryptoeconomics”",
    "abstract": "Abstract Existing scholarship on cryptoeconomics describes this field as a new and emergent phenomenon. In this paper, I claim that crypto anarchists and cryptoeconomists design and build decentralised networks as governance systems according to the common principles of cryptography, economics, and engineering, and thus, cryptoeconomics is not new but has historical intellectual roots in the political ideology of Crypto Anarchy. Cryptoeconomics is a multidisciplinary field of study concerned with the design of decentralised systems that facilitate the coordination of multiple actors. Practitioners of crypteoconomics, known as “cryptoeconomists,” employ engineering and economic methods to create institutional infrastructure for social coordination. Crypto Anarchy is a political ideology that emphasises autonomy and anonymity and the practice of self-organising through technical means largely attributed to a counter-cultural subgroup known as the “cypherpunks”. I demonstrate the link between Crypto Anarchy and cryptoeconomics through the analysis of empirical evidence from primary archival sources, secondary sources, and academic literature. The implication of these findings is a deeper understanding of what the creation of cryptoeconomic systems does in enabling a political economy of distributed, autonomous coordination. What cryptoeconomists did not adopt and perpetuate is a value for anonymity, which is where the social outcomes of Crypto Anarchy and cryptoeconomics diverge.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Both the Internet and the Web beat out numerous rivals to become today's dominant network and online system,1 respectively. Many of those rival systems and networks had developed alternative solutions to issues that face us today, from micropayments to copyright. But few scholars, much less thought leaders, have a meaningful overview of the origins of our online world, or of the many systems which came before. This exclusivity is a problem, since as a society we are now making some of the permanent decisions that will determine how we deal with information for decades and even centuries to come. Those decisions are about regulatory structures, economic models, civil liberties, publishing and more. This essay argues for the need to comparatively study online information systems across all these axes, and to thus develop a “common language” of known precedents and concepts as a prerequisite for making informed discussions about the future of the online world. Doing so depends on two factors: (1) preservation of enough historical materials about earlier systems to be able to meaningfully examine them; (2) interdisciplinary, international attention to “meta” stories that emerge from considering the evolution of multiple networks and online systems.",

    "title": "Introduction: Internet histories and computational methods",
    "abstract": "The internet is a born-digital medium, but for a number of years many histories of the internet have used traditional non-computational methods such as document analysis and interviews (e.g. Abbate, 2000; Banks, 2008; Goggin & McLelland, 2017; Poole, 2005; Turner, 2006). However, recent studies of Usenet and of the archived web have benefited from the born-digital nature of computer networks and have fruitfully used computational methods to explore the internet’s past (e.g. some of the chapters in Br€ ugger & Schroeder, 2017, in Br€ ugger 2017, and in Br€ ugger & Milligan, 2019), and monographs have been published where computational methods play a key role in the unlocking of the Web’s past (Milligan, 2019). Although the use of computational methods is not necessary just because the object of study itself is digital, with this special section of Internet Histories we present the possibilities and challenges related to the use of computational methods within historical studies of the internet and the web. The articles in this special section use varied computational methods to study the internet’s history in different ways, from quantitative and qualitative methods supported by computers to a variety of methods used to study the archived web. The special issue begins with “Internet Histories and Computational Methods: A ‘Round-Doc’ Discussion.” We invited a series of seven scholars to reflect on common questions around the themes of this special issue: why computational methods are important; what they need to look out for; how computational researchers need to understand their sources; as well as the history and future of these sorts of approaches. As it can be difficult to get all seven people together into one room, we decided to use “computational methods” to bring scholars together – collaboratively carrying out our conversation in a live-written document. Our first two formal pieces then explore Usenet and mailing lists. Avery DameGriff’s “Herding the ‘Performing Elements’: Using Computational Methods to Study Usenet, explores the challenges of exploring this medium. Dame-Griff explores the term “cisgender” in five transgender newsgroups, and discusses work on the innovative Transgender Usenet Archive. Several challenges lie at the heart of this work: technical ones (platforms and interfaces), the issue of contextualizing information, and of",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article compares the socio-legal factors and challenges contributing to the failure of the deceased anonymous, hyperlocal platform, Yik Yak, with a living anonymous, hyperlocal platform, Jodel. By analysing each platform’s Terms of Service (ToS) statements alongside their guidelines and values, the article traces how anonymous, hyperlocal applications both diverge from and mirror communication law in fashioning their approaches to content moderation and responses to the dark side of communication. The article concludes that in contrast with Yik Yak, which attempted to rely on its ToS and limited community monitoring system to curb cyberbullying and harassment, the case of Jodel—and by extension, the German approach to regulating hate speech and bullying—suggests that surviving hyperlocal, anonymous platforms of U.S. origin should not solely hide behind Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). Instead, they should aim to combine (1) robust ToS statements with (2) specific community values or guidelines that are fortified by (3) a comprehensive monitoring system in order to curb abusive behaviour on their platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a media biography of Wikipedia’s data that focuses on the interpretative flexibility of Wikipedia and digital knowledge between the years 2001 and 2022. To do so, I not only follow a strand of media historians who argue that the imagination is an important component for understanding how media change, but I also argue that Wikipedia’s data has been incorporated, re-imagined, and repurposed by sociotechnical projects in ways that have often been side-lined despite acting as the boundary lines of what is considered digital knowledge. It combines Patrice Flichy’s longitudinal theory of technical development as an imaginaire, Frederik Lesage and Simone Natale’s historical approach of biographies of media with an analysis of the interpretative flexibility of new media. Through an eclectic corpus of project websites, new articles, press releases, and blogs, I demonstrate the unexpected ways the online encyclopedia has permeated throughout digital culture over the past twenty years through projects like the Citizendium, Everipedia, Google Search and AI software. As a result of this analysis, I explain how this array of meanings and materials constitutes the Wikipedia imaginaire: a collective activity of sociotechnical development that is fundamental to understanding the ideological and utopian meaning of knowledge with digital culture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Earlier studies describing and categorising the development of museum websites either build on theoretical knowledge or the analysis of a qualitative sample of relatively few, but prominent museum websites. The present study takes a broader approach and aims to characterise the development across Danish museum websites through the years 2005–2020. The methodological approach is a diachronic (temporal) analysis of Danish museum websites using data extracted from the Danish Web. A cluster analysis was used to identify similarities between museum websites. The cluster analysis shows that the museum website representations possess distinct attributes pivotal to their degree of resemblance with others, such as collection type, geographical location, organisational structure and whether the communication and dissemination strategy focus on disseminating collection content or extends to a broader communication scope. However, the quantitative text analysis approach to studying archived museum websites did not identified a new typology. Instead, the study suggests how a cluster analysis of the Danish museum web sphere can constitute an initial step in comprehending domain development, and ultimately discerning the attributes that characterise the different museum website clusters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the early days of the Web, the International Museum of Women emerged with the mission to highlight the achievements of women throughout history. Headquartered in San Francisco, the museum experimented with the rise of new digital technologies and evolved into a virtual museum with global outreach. Through innovative online approaches, they actively engaged communities around the world and gathered perspectives from a wide spectrum of visitors, whose voices were included in the exhibition narratives. In order to safeguard the museum’s legacy and its groundbreaking digital exhibitions, The Feminist Institute in New York launched a digital preservation initiative, working closely with the Global Fund for Women, a non-profit foundation that merged with the International Museum of Women in 2014. On July 31, 2023, we conducted an interview with Marie Williams Chant, Director of Archives and Special Projects, to delve into the museum’s historical significance. We also discussed their archival strategies and procedures, along with its potential impact on the museum’s legacies.",

    "title": "Digital Pierrot Museum from Pristina to the Moon: an interview with Willred Dallto",
    "abstract": "Abstract In this interview with Willred Dallto, recorded on April 2nd 2023, the founder of the Digital Pierrot Museum explores how artists can create autonomous spaces in a context of fragile crossborder contemporary art scenes in the Balkans. The Digital Pierrot Museum first began in 2018 with a physical exhibition in the Termokiss social centre in Pristina. Inspired by the poems of symbolist Belgian poet Albert Giraud, 50 digital illustrations were exhibited with the respective poems in French translated to English and Albanian, accompanied by music performances and film screenings. The planned transfer of the exhibition from Pristina (Kosovo) to Tirana (Albania) proved to be complex. The lack of a contemporary art scene and museums in Tirana fostered misconceptions about contemporary and digital art, all occurring in an aggravated context of the COVID 19 pandemic. Acting as curator, Dallto decided to digitalize the museum. Experienced in Microsoft Encarta virtual tours, it was logical to take the leap towards the digital space. Rather than being purely an online tool, the museum seeks to empower the visitors to have their own individual experience by exploring the virtual building freely. Relying on Unity Gameplay, the museum enables the visitor to navigate and interact with the surroundings. It seeks two objectives: “educating youth regarding art, multimedia and culture, while showing adults and parents the educative sides of video games”. This “unfinished museum” constantly receives new contributions and provides an open and living space for all artists in the Balkans.",

This free web-hosting site was a place where people from a range of geographic and socio-cultural locations could build their own websites and communities online. In 1999, Yahoo! acquired the platform in a historic USD$3.7B transaction, but the following decade saw the platform decline into a state of near total non-use. In 2009, it was taken offline. This paper demonstrates how the GeoCities web archives can be used to find digital traces of destroyed web pages and “platform eulogies” from the user’s perspective that provide insights into the tensions that ultimately led to GeoCities death.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Even before his death in 2013, the federal prosecution of Aaron Swartz for hacking crimes was being called a “cause celebre” of activists protesting government regulation of the Internet. After his death, Swartz became what some called a “Cyber martyr” for the ideals of Internet freedom, free culture, and free information. This study focuses on the journalism surrounding Swartz, exploring how the ideals and values of cyberlibertarianism—a combination of techno-utopian enthusiasm and libertarian approaches to free speech and market principles—were embodied by Swartz in the press’s interpretations of his actions, life, and early death. The press, for the most part, boiled the apparent contradictions of this ideology down into a simple narrative about Swartz as a political activist in a way that not only failed to challenge the corporate neoliberal order emerging online, but also helped lay the ideological foundations for it among a broader public.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT What would a cultural history of the Internet look like? The question almost makes no sense: the Internet spans the globe and traverses any number of completely distinct human groups. It simply cannot have a single culture. And yet, like the railroad, the telegraph and the highway system before it, the Internet has been an extraordinary agent for cultural change. How should we study that process? To begin to answer that question, this essay returns to four canonical studies of earlier technologies and cultures: Carolyn Marvin's When Old Technologies Were New; Leo Marx's The Machine in the Garden; Ruth Schwarz Cowan's More Work for Mother and Lynn Spigel's Make Room for TV. In each case, the essay mines the earlier works for research tactics and uses them as jumping-off points to explore the ways in which the Internet requires new and different approaches. It concludes by speculating on the ways that the American-centric nature of much earlier work will need to be replaced with a newly global focus and research tactics to match.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this article is to operationalise an evolutionary perspective on the history of social media and to trace Facebook’s evolution from a social networking site to a “platform-as-infrastructure”. Social media platforms such as Facebook change constantly on the level of their platform architectures, interfaces, governance frameworks, and control mechanisms, all while responding to their larger environments. By examining the evolution of Facebook’s programmability and corporate partnerships, we develop an empirical historical analysis of the platform’s boundary dynamics that ultimately determine its operational scale and scope. Based on our analysis of a unique set of archived primary sources, we discern four main stages in Facebook’s long-term evolution and discuss the interplay between ongoing processes of “platformisation” and “infrastructuralisation”. We argue that these terms foreground complementary aspects of the platform’s efforts in balancing its expansion and adaptability to changing user needs and other “environmental dynamics” without risking its integrations and embedding in other domains, such as advertising, marketing, and publishing. Ultimately, our contribution illustrates how empirical platform histories can denaturalise the current dominant position of social media platforms, such as Facebook, revealing over a decade of incremental evolution rather than revolution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article frames the cultural significance of web archiving through an ethnographic study of Archive Team and their efforts to archive “Not Safe for Work” posts on the popular social media platform, Tumblr. This research first sheds light on the origins and organisation of Archive Team, a long-running site of web archiving and “loose collective” of volunteers dedicated to saving websites in danger of going offline. I outline two Archive Team “tenets of practice” that reflect and frame an approach to web archiving centred on cultural values dedicated to the preservation of access. Using examples from their efforts to archive Tumblr NSFW, I examine how the entanglement of practice, participants and platform resistance ultimately shapes what was deemed worth saving (and conversely, not). I argue that web archiving is a transformative force that requires attentiveness to who is archiving, but also the cultural dimensions of practice that inform everyday decisions about how the Web is “saved.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although the ARPANET was a United States-funded project that was deeply rooted in US post-war science and technology policies, it had an international dimension from its very early days. The memories of Michel Élie and Gérard Le Lann are oriented towards their US experience. They testify to an early French presence in the ARPANET project at two stages of its history: in 1969–1970, when the first nodes came into activity, and in 1973–1974, when TCP, which evolved into TCP/IP and became the Internet’s flagship protocol, was defined, replacing NCP, which was at the heart of the ARPANET. They thus highlight crucial but different sides of the ARPANET’s genesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the trajectory of inline and block quotation over the period in which HTML has undergone standardisation, from the introduction of the blockquote element to the HTML 1.0 specification (1993) to the current HTML 5 standard. The focus of the study is the distinct difference between the web’s current quotation practices and the legacy rule for short versus longer quotations as mandated by the body of academic style guides that began to emerge from the early 20th century. Working from a wide range of heterogeneous sources, the academic length-differentiated quotation rule is tracked from its inception, through its establishment as the academic norm in print, through its faithful remediation for digital workflows by the proximate antecedent of HTML, the leading SGML applications in text processing of the nineteen-eighties and early nineties. The consecutive hybridisation of block quotation with the text elements of the epigraph and the pullquote in the course of HTML’s standardisation process is treated as a misremediation that needlessly abandons continuity and vitiates the academic legacy’s virtues of clarity and coherence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In 1997, the recently appointed French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took a firm stance in favor of the Internet and announced an ambitious program to develop information technology and networks. In a country characterized by the lingering presence of the Minitel and bureaucratic reluctance to Internet solutions, this allocution, referred as the Hourtin speech, has been acknowledged as a turning-point in French internet policies. However, little is known about the dynamics that made such a statement possible. Based on interviews and personal archive of key actors, this paper offers to investigate the administrative and political processes that enabled such a change of position at the highest level of the State. While the role played by civil servants or government officials in promoting the development of the Internet in France has often been overlooked in internet histories, we offer new insight on the political work and administrative mobilizations that contributed to the diffusion of internet solutions and more broadly, to the advent of a digital revolution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the relationship between disembodiment and cyberspace in early internet culture by analysing how bodies are represented in Wired magazine. Using a multi-stage qualitative analysis of the cover images, the cover titles and the cover articles of the magazine between 1993 and 1997, it reconstructs Wired’s discourse on bodies and cyberspace. The article suggests that Wired employs a discourse that I term selective disembodiment, a white male fantasy in which white women and people of colour matter only when they are disembodied in cyberspace, and only as disembodied entities: the voice and recognition they acquire by inhabiting cyberspace does not carry over in their embodied lives. This operates a political differentiation: between bodies that matter and bodies that don’t. It is a vision of politics and society that, while superficially inclusive, downplays and curtails the agency of non-white, non-male bodies and still has implications for the internet today.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The following pages are taken from a long interview (more than eight hours of footage in total) that Viviane Reding granted us in 2015 in connection with the “Pierre Werner and Europe” research project. Drawing on more than 40 years’ experience in politics, Viviane Reding spoke about her career, the role of Luxembourg and Luxembourgers in the European integration process, and various key events in which she played a part. In these extracts, she discusses her role as a member of the first and second Barroso Commissions (2004-2009 and 2010-2014) and her efforts to help build an information and knowledge society in Europe, one that serves citizens and protects their rights and fundamental freedoms. Her achievements in this respect include capping mobile phone roaming charges (they were subsequently abolished in 2017), advocating for the introduction of a single emergency number (112) in all EU countries, launching the Europeana digital library, and spearheading a programme to use technological innovation for climate and energy solutions. She also describes the process of developing a Digital Agenda for Europe to improve the continent’s digital competitiveness compared with the United States, China and Japan – a complex and challenging task given the context of globalisation and the divergent interests of the various stakeholders (research, industry, consumers, etc.). Finally, she mentions the reform of personal data protection that she initiated (leading to the GDPR, adopted in April 2016).",

    "title": "Archaeology of the Amsterdam digital city; why digital data are dynamic and should be treated accordingly",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT One of the major initiatives in The Netherlands promoting the use of the Internet by private individuals was De Digitale Stad (DDS), which is the Amsterdam digital city. DDS was launched in January 1994 and soon evolved from an elementary bulletin-board-like system to a full blown virtual city with squares, houses, post-offices, cafés and a metro. Archaeology of the digital city makes it clear that there is no beaten track for preserving and, after two decades, unwrapping “born digital” material. During the research to reconstruct the digital city two routes were tried, one emulating the old system, another replicating it. The outcome, together with the harvest of two working systems, is a lesson, a concern and an appeal. From the experience of reconstructing digital heritage, we draw pragmatic lessons. Tools for digital archaeology are tried and contemplated. The lessons, however, do not unequivocally support the use of the notion “archaeology.” The concern is one of the social responsibilities. Web archaeology, being part of contemporary history, confronts the researcher with such issues as privacy and the ethics of “young” data. A case is made for treating digital data dynamically.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article traces the development of Internet communication by examining online names and pseudonyms. I argue that choosing a username, as the first interaction a person has with a platform, sets the tone for how communication and content flows through platforms. By focusing on pseudonymity as an enduring, if contested, affordance of online communication, I consider the sociocultural conventions of naming in early computer terminals and operating systems, email, bulletin boards, chatrooms, chat programs and social networking. In doing so, I demonstrate that pseudonymity remains a way to deliberately compartmentalise identities, and therefore audiences. I map two broad shifts in online communication: from people who belonged to institutions reaching each other in the 1970s and 1980s, to usernames and channels on bulletin boards and chatrooms in the 1990s, and networked profiles on social media in the 2000s. While recognising cultural and socioeconomic factors influence engagement in online communication, I argue that we are moving towards increasing use of multiple accounts and platforms.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Internet as we currently recognise it was institutionally established in 1983 when all hosts connected to the then ARPANET were required to have adopted the relatively new Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies. Thirteen years later, in 1996, a replacement standard was established for the IP protocol, to resolve key anticipated technical problems. More than 20 years later, those technical problems have indeed arisen, and yet the “new” protocol, IPv6, is still not widely deployed. This paper explores technical and institutional aspects of this case in order to examine how the evolving contexts of infrastructure use may turn technological solutions into infrastructural problems.",

Many studies implicitly define the Internet in material terms, as a particular set of hardware and software, and consequently tend to frame the development of the Internet as the spread of these technologies from the United States.

While there is not a single “correct” definition, historians should be aware of the politics of the definitions they use.",

In particular, researchers face three challenges: accounting for the different platforms and interfaces through which users could access Usenet, contextualizing newsgroups within their contemporaneous topic-specific discursive sphere, and accounting for the ethical concerns of working with message metadata. Each of these challenges shaped the author’s research: transgender newsgroups could not be studied individually, but as a niche “discursive sphere” within Usenet. Users had a variety of access points into this sphere, which shaped their particular reading and posting practices. Lastly, all identifying data were removed from all public-facing copies of this research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research traces a cultural lineage of streaming technology, moments of streams and counterstreams in the history of radio, video and internet broadcasting. By making contact with a number of points of innovation, it is possible to realize not only a technological genealogy of streaming, and its antecedents, but also an account of accompanying cultural meanings and practices. In this cultural lineage of streaming, I point to moments of audience participation in the flow of media and technology where these flows organize and order as infrastructure, with particular attention paid to moments of rupture and negotiation within the control of media and media industries. Building from Altman’s (2004) “crisis historiography,” technologies never reach equilibrium and are always unsettled in a struggle of strategies and tactics.",

    "abstract": "The three research articles in this special issue and the interview with Ronda Hauben are partly the result of the 4 th RESAW conference, that brought together through the RESAW network 1 a community of researchers, web archivists and professionals, united around a common interest, namely web history and web archives. The 4 th RESAW conference, organised on 17 and 18 June 2021 by the C 2 DH (Centre for contemporary and digital history) at the University of Luxembourg, 2 sought to examine the tension between marginal and mainstream in web history, and to go beyond this binary view. The aim was to study all the nuances, shifts in meaning, difficulties in defining and measuring audiences, as well as the evolution over the course of history of digital practices, content, producers, and communities, from the fringes and peripheries to the centre and the core of the Web. The RESAW conference was also an opportunity to launch the HIVI research project 3 , hosted at the C 2 DH, and the topics that were addressed at the conference were also related to virality, as reflected, for example, in Gustavo Gomez-Mejia’s article on “buzz.” 4 Studying online virality and historicising the Web actually raise a number of methodological questions concerning the producing and user communities, movements between web spaces and socio-digital networks and the challenges of measuring and searchability. These topics could benefit from the issues raised by other web history researchers, such as the question of comments and moderation in the article by Jonathan Paßmann, Anne Helmond and Robert Jansma, that of scaling up and popularising software in the article by Derren Wison and his colleagues, or the question of the vocabulary to qualify phenomena linked to developing digital cultures, thanks to the study of Gustavo Gomez-Mejia on the word “buzz” and its shift from the marketing sphere to the general public sphere, notably via the press. The articles are the result of this meeting in 2021, but also discussions with Ronda Hauben on that occasion, setting out her account on the twenty-fifth",

    "abstract": "Abstract Once overshadowed in a tightly controlled media environment, alternative voices in contemporary Singapore found new avenues through the emerging cyberspace from the 1990s. As irreverent satire, critical commentaries, community networks and knowledge repositories blogs, websites and forums, they came to reflect the digital presence and extension of a nascent, autonomous and enduring digital public culture. Extending the discussion of democratic enclaves within authoritarian political cultures, this article positions such sites as democratic enclaves within alternative digital histories, once alluded by Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as “cowboy towns.” Amidst the creeping trends of “flawed democracies” as historical precedence, these sites are reminder to the precarious democratic foundations, possibilities and networks pioneered over the early years of the internet.",

The results of this thesis, which strongly echoes other articles and interviews, that are part of this special issue on ARPANET, remain still relevant and valid and we have chosen to introduce the reader to the final part of Serres’ research – an inevitable choice within the 600 pages of this work",

    "abstract": "Abstract Netizens, Michael and Ronda Hauben’s foundational treatise on Usenet and the Internet, was first published in print 25 years ago. In this piece, we trace the history and impact of the book and of Usenet itself, contextualising them within the contemporary and modern-day scholarship on virtual communities, online culture, and Internet history. We discuss the Net as a tool of empowerment, and touch on the social, technical, and economic issues related to the maintenance of shared network infrastructures and to the preservation and commodification of Usenet archives. Our interview with Ronda Hauben offers a retrospective look at the development of online communities, their impact, and how they are studied. She recounts her own introduction to the online world, as well as the impetus and writing process for Netizens. She presents Michael Hauben’s conception of “netizens” as contributory citizens of the Net (rather than mere users of it) and the “electronic commons” they built up, and argues that this collaborative and collectivist model has been overwhelmed and endangered by the privatisation and commercialisation of the Internet and its communities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Queer transformative media fandoms have experienced multiple platform deaths due to “adult” content bans that remove queer content because it is considered “not safe for work” or pornographic. Such bans are biopolitically charged because they effectively regulate and erase queer sexualities and genders. Newer fan-created or moderated platforms such as Archive of Our Own (AO3) and Discord receive credit for rescuing queer fanworks and communities. These platforms are developed and used in direct response to content bans, and they therefore maintain a reputation for including queer people and their works. However, biopolitics continue to perpetuate marginalisation within newer fandom spaces because they ignore inequities that intersect with sexuality and gender. In particular, platforms like AO3 and Discord continue to perpetuate racism in fandom. Using data from interviews with queer fans and platforms’ features and policy statements, this paper traces how platform deaths and rebirths both respond to and perpetuate biopolitics throughout queer fandoms online.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines how the commenting platform Disqus changed the way it speaks about commenting and moderation over time. To understand this evolving self-presentation, we used the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to analyse the company’s website and blog between 2007 and 2021. By combining interpretative close-reading approaches with computerised distant-reading procedures, we examined how Disqus tried to advance online discussion and dealt with moderation over time. Our findings show that in the mid-2000s, commenting systems were supposed to help filter and surface valuable contributions to public discourse, while ten years later their focus had shifted to the proclaimed goal of protecting public discourse from contamination with potentially harmful (“toxic”) communication. To achieve this, the company developed new tools and features to keep communities “healthy” and to facilitate and semi-automate active and interventive forms of moderation. This rise of platform interventionism was fostered by a turn towards semantics of urgency in the company’s language to legitimise its actions.",

    "title": "A history of crypto-discourse: encryption as a site of struggles to define internet freedom",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores a history of “crypto” as a battlefield in a larger discursive struggle to define the meaning of Internet freedom. The term crypto is short for cryptography, which refers to the practice of encrypting, i.e. rendering information illegible to anyone but its intended recipient(s). Drawing on Laclau and Mouffe's theory of discourse, this study investigates how public-key cryptography advocates, and in particular Cypherpunks and technology journalists, have articulated “crypto-discourse”: a partially fixed construction of meaning that establishes a relationship between encryption software and a negative conception of Internet freedom, in relation to the state. I map events pertaining to the articulation of the empty signifier “crypto” among interrelated discourse communities of cryptographers, hackers, online rights activists, and technology journalists during a period of forty years (1975–2015). I present the Crypto-Discourse Timeline as comprised of three periods: the origins (1975–1990), crystallisation (1990–2000), and revitalisation of crypto-discourse (2000–2015). The timeline provides an overview of the complexity and contingency of crypto-discourse as a practice that shapes public policy over time. Crypto-discourse excludes other possible, positive meanings of Internet freedom, removing responsibility from democratic states to uphold privacy rights and freedom of speech online.",

    "title": "EC competition law and the idea of “open networks” (1950s–1980s)",
    "abstract": "Abstract Competition policy has been on the top of the European Community’s political agenda since the construction of a European Common Market in the 1960s. A comprehensive body of law was created to eliminate market dominance, cartels or state aid and to control mergers and competition. A key issue of the EC competition law was the Council Regulation 17/62, which established the idea of ‘openness’ of competition in European market law for the decades to come. Infrastructure sectors like telecommunications were, however, mostly excluded from the Council Regulation 17/62 in the early 1960s. The European Commission put the question of an application of EC competition law again on the political agenda in the 1980s. Dramatic losses of European producers of telecommunication technology in the share on global markets further backed the Commission, which in 1987 issued a first green paper on telecommunications. This paper had an enormous effect on the liberalisation of the telecommunication sector across Europe and subsequently incorporated the sector into the scope of application of EC competition law. The Council Regulations 17/62’s idea of ‘openness’ and ‘open networks’ were established as basic principles for European telecommunication markets with three decades’ delay and made Europe ready for digital technologies and in particular for the internet. The paper analyses the discourses and imaginaries of ‘open networks’ in the debate about the relationship between EC competition law and the telecommunication sector in a long term perspective from the 1960 to the 1980s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While web archiving techniques capture snapshots of websites in real time, this article introduces an approach for building special collections for web archiving in retrospect. Retrospective web archiving (RWA) aims to fill-in gaps in existing archives, as well as to expand the boundaries of web archiving from the open web to cross-platform curation, and from national to international perspectives. The proposed approach is tested on a case study of the 2014 War in Gaza. The retrospective collection contains 118,508 unique URIs and relevant metadata, carbon-dated to the period of the military operation, in 46 languages and 5692 domain suffixes, collected from Wikipedia, Google, Twitter and YouTube. Findings suggest that four years after the war, 50% of the URIs were still available on the live web, but only 38% of them have already been archived elsewhere. Although URL sharing on social media was found the most relevant for retrospective curation, the platformisation of the web, along with the popularity of URL shortening services, severely impacts their archival coverage. The article suggests taking into account platform dynamics and cultural differences in link sharing practices, when thinking about future curation policies for both real time and RWA.",

    "title": "How “open” are Australian museums? A review through the lens of copyright governance",
    "abstract": "Abstract Museums are increasingly employing innovative digital techniques to curate, link, and market collections, enabling new kinds of public engagement to better connect with popular culture. By embracing contemporary modes of delivery to open access to their collections, museums are signalling a drive toward greater democratisation of knowledge and information through increased interaction and accessibility. Yet with this has come a series of copyright and legal complexities. This paper reviews current copyright barriers for museums in Australia and examines how international examples offer potential models and ways forward. The authors conclude that recent copyright modernisation reviews offer the museum sector an opportunity to restructure its strategies. As online formats evolve, there is an urgent need to explore how amendments to copyright laws in some countries have allowed for more fair and flexible use of cultural artefacts and orphan works.",

    "title": "Accessing the artwork in covid-19: loss, recovery and reimagination",
    "abstract": "Abstract Being ‘there’ and present within a physical space has been a long-accepted part of any art museum visitor experience. Once the sole access route, the emergence of digitisation and the Internet has since offered a new flexibility for visitors. Such online provision is often considered supplementary, ancillary, yet the year 2020 was witness to a seismic shift, when museums were compelled to unilaterally close their physical doors in response to Covid-19. This paper explores the sense of loss engendered by the abrupt removal of a direct interaction with physical artworks and examines the online initiatives that took its place. The theme of loss is explored through phenomenological experience of artworks/objects, an experience which cannot be recaptured virtually, in relation to the interchange between the physical and the virtual at both an individual artwork level and within a curated museum space. Advances in digital access, exciting new realities and future possibilities are examined, considering how this sense of loss might be accommodated in lieu, mitigated online. It is argued that a multiplicity of approaches that seek to redefine rather than replicate will engage new audiences experientially and offer a refreshed look at access between the physical and virtual art museum space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article studies the evolution of the internet infrastructure and assesses emerging digital power structures and regulatory dynamics. We revisit and develop Thomas P. Hughes’ momentum theory (1994) and contend that the internet, as other large technological systems, has evolved in different phases reflecting a shift from being mainly influenced by socio-economic conditions to having a determining influence on the development of societal structures. We argue that contemporary internet infrastructure studies can benefit from Hughes’ theoretical approach, but also need to strengthen their methodological and empirical strategy. The article contributes to this by approaching the changes in digital infrastructures, markets, and state policies in Denmark from 1992 to 2019. Building on database material, we analyse the development of digital devices and internet connections, submarine fibre optic cables and internet exchange points, websites, and digital content. We conclude that the identified changes confirm Hughes’ momentum hypothesis: in the beginning the implementation of the internet reflected historical market structures and institutional characteristics, while the later development challenges and transforms the established regime.",

    "abstract": "Since the early years of the personal computer, when computing began to diffuse to the general public, social researchers have focused on the (non)use of information and communication technologies in the household and the impact of the resulting digital divides on social and economic inequalities. The Internet's diffusion led this work to become an increasingly central focus of research, but not following a sustained trajectory of attention. This study tracks the questions used to operationalise digital divides as a heretofore unexplored history that throws light on the course of social research – illuminating problems that are masked by traditional studies that follow the responses to these questions, but not the questions. By focusing on surveys of Internet use, analysing questionnaires from the USA, Britain, Hungary and South Africa reaching back to 1997, we examine how survey research questions on Internet (non)use have evolved. Study of the changing operational definitions of Internet use across time and space provides a formerly unexamined perspective on the ebb and flow of academic interest in digital divides, the changing meaning of that term and the relationship of social research to technology and policy change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For the last 30 years, the web has been used as a space of debate and knowledge creation, including historical knowledge. The digital space has the potential to provide a more democratic history that relies on the inclusion of different voices. However, it also raises questions about editing and authority. When attempting to understand authority relations on the web, moderation gains special prominence as it involves actions of exclusion, organisation, and establishment of norms; moderators heavily influence the content created by web users. Here, we investigate knowledge creation considering moderation bias. We address the effects of different moderation practices in history subreddits by analysing how moderators establish authority relations with other users. For that, we use a mixed-methods approach by interpreting the subreddits’ rules and performing network analysis based on the subreddits’ dialogues (2011–2020). The study indicates that the rules have become progressively extensive and stricter over the years, creating appropriate ways for posting submissions and commenting but also affecting broad participation. As central authority figures, moderators engage in processes of sharing authority, rather than shared authority, tending to dominate knowledge creation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract ARPANET demonstrated that packet switching was an effective routing principle for computer networks, accelerating the evolution towards the current network paradigm, in which packetization is found in almost all forms of digital communication. The decision to use the packet switching principle was crucial to the development of the Internet and computer networking broadly, and in popular literature, packet switching is often attributed to three originators: Paul Baran, Donald Davies and Leonard Kleinrock. This paper does not concern itself with who invented packet switching, but rather, who had the greatest influence on the risky and highly consequential decision to base the ARPANET design on this previously untested technology. A close examination of the available documentation, including two newly re-emerged documents, indicate that Paul Baran had a much more substantial influence on the decision to use packet switching for ARPANET than most retellings of Internet history portray. The findings also show that Donald Davies’ role in the adoption of packet switching as a dominant principle for digital communication may have been less impactful than depicted in current literature and that Kleinrock may have played a significant role in bringing packet switching to the ARPANET, influenced by interactions with Baran.",

    "title": "The SAGE handbook of web history",
    "abstract": "The SAGE Handbook of Web History is a rich and varied handbook that seeks to map the entirety of Web History as a field. Edited by two of the field ’ s frontrunners, Niels Br € ugger and Ian Milligan, the volume includes no less than 40 chapters written by scholars from history, programming, social sciences, media studies, communication, cultural studies, computer science and digital humanities. This variety reflects the multifaceted nature of web history as a field but also the editors ’ willingness to let the volume reflect this richness. In the handbook they have aimed to show the duality of web history in that the volume encompasses both histories of the Web (this is by far the theme in the majority of the entries) and histories using the Web as a record. The volume does an excellent job in placing emphasis on the centrality of web archiving to web history, explaining how archiving the Web differs from archiving of other sources and why this makes the archival research infrastructure different, including new kinds of challenges and opportunities for historical (web) research. The chapters are organized into six parts; The Web and Historiography; Theoretical and Methodological Reflections; Technical and Structural Dimensions of Web History; Platforms on the Web; Web History and Users, some Case Studies; and lastly The Roads Ahead. The first part, The Web and Historiography, is divided into four chapters, each addressing what it actually means to do web history and work with the archived web as a source. Together the part ’ s chapters by Ian Milligan, Niels Br € ugger, Peter Webster and Richard Rogers fully live up to the introduction promise of this part being a “ crash course into the world of web archives and web archiving, ” including how to use them (XXX). One take-away from this ‘ course ’ is that historians are at a crossroad where they need to gain algorithmic and computational literacy if they are to embark upon the journey that is the world of the archived Web. This knowledge is needed because the archived Web has special digitality due to its",

    "title": "The Evolution of Internet Routing: Technical Roots of the Network Society",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the humanities and some social sciences, many social theories, histories, and philosophies of networks often draw on incomplete representations of the Internet’s evolution and structure. Empirical and analytical difficulties result when scholars select this partial understanding as an archetype that they use to derive underlying social properties, and consequences, of networks. These networks, in turn, are put to work as both as a metaphor to describe a (our) new kind of society, and a fundamental, causal force that is bringing it into being. In other words, society is said to be governed by networks, but the network ideal-type—insofar as it is based on visions of the Internet—is inaccurate. A common problem with this work lies in its misunderstanding of the technical functions of the Internet Protocol (IP): specifically, the misidentification of IP with routing, and thus with the distributed property of the Internet. As a corrective, I offer a brief history of Internet routing, the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) and autonomous system in particular.",

    "title": "Metadata dating the digital city: a software archaeological approach",
    "abstract": "Abstract De Digitale Stad was a pioneering website of the early Dutch web. Historical study of its remnants has required extensive system knowledge, which may pose a new challenge for digital humanity researchers. The study of remnants is covered by the metaphor of “archaeology.” In view of software character of web artefacts, the metaphor “web archaeology” is implicitly limiting. An approach is proposed that considers the working character of the software, “software archaeology.” In a case study it is shown by the example of “metadata dating” how the software archaeological approach can be brought to bear on born digital artefacts. The case illustrates the historical value of extracting time-related metadata from digital artefacts, “metadata dating.” Metadata dating is performed on three archives related to De Digitale Stad. By aggregation of time-related metadata, new historical insights into De Digitale Stad have been gained. Whereas the early internet has often been presented as ever changing, novel and revolutionary, the results bring to light strong continuities in the usage patterns shown in De Digitale Stad. Contrary to expectations, it is observed that the citizens of De Digitale Stad, were primarily interested in the preservation of the traditional content in their files, and less in the results of their own coding efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Web archives collections have become important sources for Internet scholars by documenting the past versions of web resources. Understanding how these collections are created and curated is of increasing concern and recent web archives scholarship has studied how the artefacts stored in archives represent specific curatorial choices and collecting practices. This paper takes a novel approach in studying web archiving practice, by focusing on the challenges encountered in archival web crawling and what they reveal about the web itself. Inspired by foundational work in infrastructure studies, infrastructural inversion is applied to study how crawler interactions surface otherwise invisible, background or taken-for-granted aspects of the web. This framework is applied to study three examples selected from interviews and ethnographic fieldwork observations of web archiving practices at the Danish Royal Library, with findings demonstrating how the challenges of archival crawling illuminate the web’s varied actors, as well as their changing relationships, power differentials and politics. Ultimately, analysis through infrastructural inversion reveals how collection via crawling positions archives as active participants in web infrastructure, both shaping and shaped by the needs and motivations of other web actors.",

In this interview, made on 23 June 2017, Guy de Téramond, more commonly known as “The Father of the Internet in Central America”, recalls some of the main events that led the connection to BITNET and the Internet in this region. De Téramond talks about the motivations, challenges and satisfactions involved in regional connection projects in countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, during the 1990s; the role of the Organization of American States; the foundation of academic networks in Central America; and the privatisation of telecommunications in the region. These discussions are updated by addressing the contemporary state of these academic projects and some of the main challenges faced by countries of the Central American region in the global geopolitics and governance of the Internet.",

    "title": "Towards a nonlinear, material history of digital swarms",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In contemporary internetworked societies, digital media and networks have increasingly become a “battlefield” where, following the emergence of novel power relations, new forms of resistance have come to the fore. Amongst these resistances, there are the so-called “digital swarms”. This is a communicational disruption also technically known in computing as “Distributed Denial-of-Service” (DDoS): a form of political dissent that, in the last years, has hit the headlines, thanks to the digital media actions of Anonymous. This article focuses on these forms of mediation, approaching digital swarms via a historical analysis that stresses nonlinearity and materiality. I argue that digital swarming actions cannot be read as an issue of obtaining attention through media visibility, and that the disruptions these lead to cannot be accounted as mere metaphors of street political action, finding conversely their cultural history in other forms of media disruptiveness. This historical excavation points, then, towards a different genealogy for digital swarms, acknowledging the key material dimensions at stake via the infrastructural character of disruptive mediations as well as via non-anthropomorphic patterns of enunciation.",

    "abstract": "Stuart Dunn’s concern is the manifold and changing ways in which place may be understood, and in particular the impact of digital mapping and spatial analysis in the field of spatial humanities. The evolution of the ‘Geo-Web’, ‘the Internet’s own spatial turn’ (p.11), figures prominently, as a substratum of the Internet at large, delivering spatially-defined data by means of Linked Open Data protocols. But the Internet as a whole, Dunn suggests, began as ‘an experiment in collapsing space’ in which ‘place and space were thus collapsed, and merged both experientially and conceptually.’ (p.12) It is in chapter 2 in particular in which Dunn places the development of the Internet in a long historical succession of technological changes that conditioned the ways in which place was communicated and represented, including the work of ARPA in the 1960s, the emergence of HTML, the rise of user-generated data and the ubiquity of the geo-enabled smartphone. Chapter 3 focusses in particular on the study of archaeology, and the impact of GIS. Although the rest of the book is only very intermittently a ‘history’ in the sense that most contemporary historians would recognise, it nonetheless contains much that may be of value for readers of this journal.",

    "abstract": "In September 2012, two academics at Aarhus University in Denmark, Niels Br€ ugger and Niels Ole Finnemann, convened the first meeting of a new research network, A Research Infrastructure for the Study of Archived Web Materials (RESAW). Their aim was to promote the use and value of web archives for academic research; to bring together key stakeholders with an interest in the field, from librarians and archivists to historians and researchers in media and communication studies; and to plan, and ultimately deliver, effective infrastructural support for scholars interested in working with the archived web. The network was explicitly European, but from the outset it was more global in focus than this would suggest, with members also drawn from Australia, Canada, Taiwan and the US. Around 50 people from a range of different countries, sectors and institutions attended the inaugural gathering in Denmark to discuss future collaborative activities (RESAW, n.d.). RESAW was a timely and welcome initiative. In 2012, the web had been with us for 23 years, and web archiving in one form or another for 16 (Br€ ugger, 2017, p. xi; Winters, 2016, p. 239). This was long enough for both the live and archived web to have become objects of academic attention, but those interested in the latter were generally working on their own, without access to an obvious community of peers. RESAW provided the mechanisms to address this isolation, and as it matured so too did the study of web archives. A key point in the development of the network was the first major RESAW conference, held in Aarhus in June 2015. Delegates explored “Web archives as scholarly sources: issues, practices and perspectives”, and took the opportunity to plan new projects and publications (RESAW, n.d.). Two years later, momentum was such that it was possible to organise an entire week of events in London celebrating the most innovative research and practice concerned with web archives and web histories. Web Archiving Week included an “Archives Unleashed” hackathon and a public debate on “Web archives: truth, lies and politics in the 21st century”, both held at the British Library, but the centrepiece of the programme was a major international conference at the School of Advanced Study, University of London, organised under the auspices of RESAW and the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) (Web Archiving Week, n.d.). Over the course of three days, more than 150 delegates from around the world heard presentations concerned with everything from the most recent technical innovations in web archiving to the latest ground-breaking research in the humanities and social sciences using web archives as a primary source (School of Advanced Study, 2017). Central to the ethos of the conference, and to RESAW more generally, were the conversations that took place between disciplines and across sectors: librarians and archivists talked to historians and media specialists; computer scientists and academic technicians met with scholars in modern languages and the history of medicine. The three articles in this special issue of Internet Histories reflect this energy and diversity, both in the backgrounds of the authors themselves and in their choices of subject",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, I review and critically discuss the histories of mobile Internet and markets in Europe. I examine the emergence of mobile Internet as an important though relatively minor part of European development of mobile technology in the 1980s and 1990s. I take up the story of how Europe then failed to capitalize on its global success with 2 G digital mobiles, and faltered with initiatives in mobile web and mobiles services in the late 1990s and early 2000s. I discuss the various factors It is with the smartphone, from 2008 onwards, that mobile Internet becomes widely established and used in Europe — yet this takes diverse, complex forms. Finally, I offer concluding remarks on the implications of the paradoxes in these mobile Internet histories for understanding of the evolution of complex socio-technical systems, including the contemporary imaginaries of integrated digital markets in Europe and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cookies are a legacy of the early commercial web. Developed and deployed by Netscape in 1994, debated by developers since 1995, and subject to political scrutiny since 1998, cookies have grown in visibility as they have become more mundane. While the United States was able to push for a consumer framing supported by self-regulation, it rested on effective notice and choice. As the European Union sought to establish a successful Single Market, consent in European data protection law grew in use, prominence, and strength over iterations. Although cookies were chosen as a privacy preserving mechanism for establishing state in web based interactions, they became a lightning rod for privacy concerns that have never been resolved. This article details the history of cookies as an exploration of the normative cultural constructions of a simple, unremarkable, entrenched technology using www-talk archives, IETF working group archives, browser versions, and trade literature, as well as U.S., UK, and EU government reports, caselaw, and legislative history.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research selects art museums in four cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) region for relevant research, namely Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macao and Shenzhen, which are important representatives of the artistic, cultural, economic and technological development of the GBA. It examines the digital technology strategies used by six selected art museums within the four GBA cities to promote the co-development of collections, exhibitions and audience engagement. The objective of the study has been approached through the following research question: How are art museums using digital technology to improve the relationship among collections, exhibitions and audience engagement from the perspective of online exhibitions? In this article, online exhibitions are seen as an invaluable virtual platform for art museums to display art to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. The necessity for art museums to use digital technology to develop online exhibitions in the face of the plight of the COVID-19 pandemic is first introduced in this article. It then addresses how online exhibitions and online technologies in art museums have influenced the development of collections from offline to online, as well as how to further strengthen the relationship between collections, exhibitions and the audience. Some of the key challenges for art museums in developing online exhibitions using digital technology are also mentioned, and possible future developments of online exhibitions in art museums are discussed. At the same time, there is a need to consider the issues faced by art museums in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as they continue to use digital technology to develop collections, exhibitions and audiences in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period.",

From a curatorial perspective, it discusses the potential of themed web archive collections for researching commemorative events, outlines the evolving understanding of archival material, reviews the project, and explores the technical, legal, and methodological problems and opportunities that emerged as the project progressed. It highlights the challenges that arose from collaborating across multiple jurisdictions with differing arrangements surrounding non-print legal deposit, and the impact of institutional and legislative frameworks on collection building.",

    "title": "Between two Acts: competing narratives, activism and governance in Singapore’s digital sphere",
    "abstract": "Abstract Civil society in Singapore has existed in the interstices of society with frequent instances of conflict with the government. The ruling People’s Action Party government has had a long history of quashing its political opponents, and this same approach has influenced how the government deals with social-political dissent, ranging from human rights groups being gazetted and their funding source curtailed, to opposition politicians and free speech advocates sued for libel and contempt of court. This paper examines how the Singapore government has made two significant moves towards online media that appears at once restrictive and accommodating towards dissent. The first is the increase in legal and regulatory burdens on the media, while the second is a perceptibly generous invitation for media freedom advocates to discuss and debate about such legal frameworks. We contend that this dualism, far from signalling inclusive governance with a firm hand, only affirms the Singapore government’s authoritarian tendencies towards media freedom advocates. This paper juxtaposes the evolution of narratives of dissent between the 2013 Amendment to the Broadcasting Act to the 2019 public debate on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). We explore the dynamics of resistance and posit that, even with the enlarged space for free speech in Singapore, the practice in public discourse points to further curtailment of such free speech.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although the Internet is a key global infrastructure, it is still often perceived in an abstract manner by the general public, which tends to disregard how the Internet emerges in different places. In contrast, this paper situates the Internet as infrastructure development in post-socialist Lithuania against the backdrop of multi-sited fieldwork within its telecom industry. Drawing on fieldwork material analysis comprised of qualitative interviews, participatory observation and archival research as well as previous research from media studies, this paper contributes to Internet studies via three conceptual motifs that emerged from fieldwork material—infrastructuring practices, geopolitical imaginaries and critical negotiations—that were evaluated in order to research media infrastructures and argue for the situated analysis of infrastructural labour, geopolitics and critique that frame Internet development. It further argues for the need to explore Internet infrastructure developments in post-socialist Eastern Europe that remain unrepresented in media infrastructures research, despite the rich potential of case studies into the simultaneous emergence of the Internet within new nation states.",

    "title": "The Italian network hopes: Rise and fall of the <i>Socrate</i> and <i>Iperbole</i> projects in the mid-1990s",
    "abstract": "Abstract The article retraces the histories of two Italian networking projects of the mid-19990s: the national infrastructural plan named Socrate, launched by the monopolist Telecom Italia in 1994 and the civic network Iperbole, launched by the municipality of Bologna in 1995. Relying upon a corpus of primary sources and in-depth interviews with key-informants, the article stresses the complex relationship between infrastructures, networks and media imaginaries in Italy at a time when the large-scale diffusion of the Internet and the World Wide Web were still in fieri. The same years of the WWW's first diffusion were in fact a period of negotiation at local, national, and international level between various actors and different ways of envisioning the upcoming digital age. The article shows how the history of Socrate challenges the idea of the centrality of the Web and the Internet in company discourses of the mid-1990s juxtaposing a different narrative and an imaginary of networking infrastructures linked to broadcasting media. Conversely the case of Iperbole is a particular example of public service use of the Internet on the wave of a political and cultural tradition that looked at media as strategic tools, rather than theoretical models, for democratisation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the key role played by political elites in enacting and justifying policies related to the internet in India over the past few decades, the manner in which they viewed digital technologies has received relatively little attention. Using Charles Taylor’s notion of social imaginaries, this work attempts to help address this gap by examining the key values espoused within the narratives put forward by high-ranking government functionaries to understand the perspectives of this small yet powerful group. Through a thematic analysis of Prime Ministerial speeches from 1998 onwards it explores their visions in terms of the kind of internet users these were centred on, the role such technologies could play in pursuing development agendas, and how they addressed major issues such as private enterprise, the rural-urban divide and infrastructural gaps. Augmenting this with data on the growing accessibility of the internet itself during this period and major legislative acts passed, it offers a glimpse at the on-going process of shaping the internet by elite groups through the narratives they represent it by.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This roundtable, which unfolded over many months in 2021, brought fourteen technologists and scholars together for a full-fledged discussion of platforms and death as a metaphor. The discussion proceeds with each person responding to the previous question and then posing one of their own. Some contributors discuss the ethical quandaries that await researchers attempting to exhume digital lifeworlds of the past. Others contemplate who gets a say in what aspects of platform life are preserved. Reflecting moments of convergence and divergence around the ethics and politics of platform death, the roundtable reads as a kaleidoscope of sociotechnical values and a map of the people fighting for control over digital infrastructure that has fallen apart.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article challenges a narrow, teleological approach to ‘platform death’ by looking at discursive continuity of a ‘dead’ men’s rights Usenet newsgroup. Using a data set of 1250 posts spanning 1994 − 2002, I track three thematic trends in the data: the ‘special treatment’ women and minorities receive that deny men their rights, the inverse relationship between men’s rights and responsibilities, and men’s anxieties around gendered roles in the family and at work. However, the ‘prelife’ and ‘afterlife’ of these themes in the men’s rights movement indicates the ways in which discourses persist across time and media formats despite ‘platform death.’ This has implications for how we understand and contextualize the contemporary men’s rights movement and highlights the limitations of platform-focused responses to online misogyny and extremism.",

Social Media and the Automatic Production of Memory offers an expansive series of provocations in a compact volume, one of Bristol University Press’s “Shorts” Research publications. Ben Jacobsen and David Beer are well-placed to pose these questions as sociologists at the University of York, whose work on memory, metrics and techno-social transformations moors empirical research to critical theory and to emerging theories of data and the self. The book interweaves a comprehensive literature review with a short overview of empirical findings from a larger qualitative research project exploring people’s experiences and perceptions of algorithmic systems in their remem-brance of the past. Highlighting the algorithmic interaction of classification and ranking that work together to define and resurface “memories” on digital devices and platforms, the book introduces a useful vocabulary for making sense of our abounding, algorithmically mediated personal repositories of remembering stored in social media archives.

    "title": "The rise and fall of MapQuest",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article builds an historical account of the rise and fall of US mapping firm MapQuest. It charts the emergence and rapid rise of MapQuest as a popular early provider of online maps – detailing notable innovations, key developments, and successive ownership changes, and the significance of these for MapQuest – and it documents its equally rapid fall. The article draws on political economy of communication (and geographic political economy) approaches in its analysis of MapQuest. This critical framework is valuable for the way that it draws attention to the different stakeholders involved in controlling and commercialising MapQuest’s applications for web-based and mobile devices, and the structural factors that shape and influence the industries in which it operates. From this analysis, it is argued that a range of factors led to MapQuest’s dramatically diminished market share within the field of online mapping. These included: a lack of revenue generation opportunities; significant map data quality issues; loss of consumer visibility due to search algorithm interference; and a reactive rather than proactive approach to innovation under consecutive owners. This account of MapQuest is important in two ways. First, while MapQuest is a significant firm in the history of contemporary digital mapping, particularly as a pioneer of online distributed mapping, the firm’s history and its contribution to digital mapping remains under-represented in internet histories scholarship. Second, this article contributes to growing interest in and deepening critical understanding of platform precarity, asking: What becomes of platforms when they falter? And what are the factors that contribute to their decline?",

Drawing on Giorgio Agamben’s concept of the ‘state of exception’ and Partha Chatterjee’s notion of ‘the rule of colonial difference,’ the article seeks to interrogate India’s Internet governance practices in peripheral regions and the disabling impact of shutdowns and filtering on local e-communities. In critiquing the Internet historiography of the technology predicated on its materiality, rendered through numbers and events and centred around the nation’s urban technoscape, it explores local imaginations of the Internet in particular regions alternative to the one perpetuated by the Indian state and market forces while highlighting the strategies used by e-communities to circumvent state filtering mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Women in the early 1990s went online for the first time and brought media fandom with them. Drawing on oral history interviews conducted with fans in 2012, this article describes the ways in which women’s burgeoning participation in internet spaces both defied and reinculcated pre-existing gendered divides in computing. Women used the new affordances of the internet to create and to augment social relationships with far-flung like-minded fans and to forge new communities devoted to their particular interests, especially via self-hosted mailing lists. They also established web archives devoted to preserving and maintaining their own fan production and history. However, the technical constraints of mailing lists and early archives drove fans to third-party journal sites in increasing numbers after the year 1999, setting up conflicts between fans and site owners with fans at the disadvantage. Nonetheless, the legacy of the first media fans online primed the expansion of fandom and especially fan fiction after the year 2000, to the extent that the internet is now understood to be for fan fiction.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As a whole, existing histories of the Internet's creation and development are stories of success and triumph. In this respect, they resemble hagiographies, a literary genre that consists of accounts of Christian saints and their miraculous deeds. Internet historians should break free of their familiar hagiographic mode, and treat their historical subjects more critically. The starting point for revisionist histories of networking is an acceptance that the Internet is flawed, dangerous and ephemeral.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Humans who encounter social media platforms have a role to play. They are expected to generate content, a demand starkly illustrated by a mid-2010s Facebook prompt: “Write something.” This essay recuperates the history of this role, the “instrumentalised user,” and traces its development from the mid-1960s to the present. Drawing on evidence from scholarly texts in ergonomics, media studies, computer science, psychology, Human-Computer Interaction, and political economy, the essay traces the instrumentalised user’s emergence from decades of efforts to characterise and problematise those actors who encounter computing. Using Actor-Network Theory to show how humans and computing machinery were imagined to work together, the essay reveals that social media’s efforts to extract labour from its users are the heirs to a recurring theme in computer and internet history.",

    "title": "From public sphere to magic circle: playful publics on the Chinese internet",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reassesses comparisons of online Chinese networks to the Habermasian public sphere through a dialogue between sinology and ludology. Play has long been considered an integral component of public activity and of the Chinese internet. Researchers emphasised the importance of playful behavior and creative self-expressions for various purposes, including the formation of community ties and identities. However, studies tend to scrutinise the socio-political effects of playing rather than the fundamental connections between play and cultural life. This paper investigates the underlying cultural elements of play that are absent from or underdeveloped in the rational-critical framework and discourses of the public sphere. Building upon this ludological tradition, and specifically focusing on the autotelic, contextual, and appropriative nature of play, we conduct an exploratory, inductive thematic analysis of three case studies that garnered significant domestic and international attention – the abolishment of term limits in China, the #MeToo movement, and the COVID-19 pandemic – to understand the role of play in public communication. Our analysis reveals insights into the creative structural dynamics that underpin the Chinese internet – rules, reciprocity, and irrationality – three aspects that broaden discussions of online activity and engagement. The paper centers itself at the nexus of three separate strands of histories – the public sphere debate, ludology, and the Chinese internet – that have rarely been in dialogue with one another and, in doing so, examines and explains the Chinese cybersphere’s current formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The subreddit r/WatchRedditDie was founded in 2015 after reddit started implementing anti-harassment policies, and positions itself as a “fire alarm for reddit” meant to voyeuristically watch reddit’s impending (symbolic) death. As conversations around platform governance, moderation, and the role of platforms in controlling hate speech become more complex, r/WatchRedditDie and its affiliated subreddits are dedicated in maintaining a version of reddit tolerant of any and all speech, excluding other more vulnerable users from fully participating on the platform. r/WatchReditDie users advocate for no interference in their activities on the platform—meaning that although they rely on the reddit infrastructure to sustain their community, they aim to self-govern to uphold a libertarian and often manipulated interpretation of free expression. Responding to reddit’s evolving policies, they find community with one another by positioning the platform itself as their main antagonist. Through the social worlds framework, I examine the r/WatchRedditDie community’s responses to platform change, bringing up new questions about the possibility of shared governance between platform and user, as well as participatory culture’s promises and perils.",

    "title": "<i>Know Your Meme</i> and the homogenization of web history",
    "abstract": "Abstract As memes circulate and spread throughout different Web communities, their meanings are continually changing. In the last decade, the website Know Your Meme (KYM) has become popular among researchers, educators, and day-to-day Web users to understand memes and their meanings. KYM is a frequently cited resource among Web researchers, and as a result it has become instrumental in establishing dominant histories of memes on the Web. Though KYM remains an invaluable resource, it is often cited with minimal context, and an uncritical reliance on KYM’s definitions may overlook the polysemy of many memes. Accordingly, this paper uses a discursive interface analysis of the KYM website along with examples of incomplete meme definitions to demonstrate how the website constructs itself as a cultural authority to define and classify memes. Given that memes themselves are artifacts of Web history, I argue the overreliance on KYM as an authority on memes and their history can contribute to the homogenization of Web histories. However, this paper acknowledges that KYM can still be a useful resource and to that end, offers recommendations for how researchers might better introduce and contextualize KYM within their own work.",

He played a leading role when South Korea joined the global race in technological innovation, and is generally considered key to the entrance of the Internet on the Asian continent. I wanted to discuss with Chon about the hypothesis that himself and his peers from South Korea and Asia got a kickstart from Unix culture and did initially follow UUCP routes, in close connection with their Internet pioneering.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Across time, space and language, the meaning of “the Internet” is taken to be self-evident; appearing to both the scholar and the everyday user as a singular, homogeneous sociotechnical phenomenon. But the Internet, as it is generally known, is as much mythology as technology, a shared set of narratives that frame our expectations of the future. As we begin to write comparative, critical histories of the Internet, this seemingly stable object breaks apart, revealing a diversity of experiences, technologies, norms and motivations. The epistemological problem at the heart of Internet history requires us to borrow creatively from other fields and develop new historical methods. To arrive at new operational definitions of the Internet, we advocate the pursuit of hidden histories, obscure sources and less visible networks, stoking new life into vernacular terms such as “the Net.”",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article analyses the socio-technical epistemic processes behind the construction of historical facts by the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (IAWM). Grounded in theoretical debates in Science and Technology Studies about digital and algorithmic platforms as “black boxes”, this article uses provenance information and other data traces provided by the IAWM to uncover specific epistemic processes embedded at its back-end, through a case study on the archiving of the North Korean web. In 2016, an error in the configuration of one of North Korea's name servers revealed that it contains 28 websites. However, the IAWM has snapshots of the majority of the .kp websites, which have been archived from as early as 2010. How did the IAWM accumulate knowledge about the .kp websites that are generally hidden to the world? Through our findings we argue that historical knowledge on the IAWM is generated by an entangled and iterative system comprised of proactive human contributions, routinely operated crawls and a reification of external, crowd-sourced knowledge devices. These turn the IAWM into a repository whose knowing of the past is potentially surplus – harbouring information which was unknown to each of the contributing actors at the time and place of archiving.",

    "title": "Innovation on the web: the end of the S-curve?",
    "abstract": "Abstract Rigorous research into the historical past of Web technology-driven innovation becomes timely as technological growth and forecasting are attracting popular interest. Drawing on economic and management literature relating to the typical trends of technological innovation, we examine the long-term development of Web technology in a theoretically informed and empirical manner. An original longitudinal dataset of 20,493 Web-related US patents is used to trace the growth curve of Web technology between the years of 1990 through 2013. We find that the accumulation of corporate Web inventions followed an S-shaped curve which shifted to linear growth after year 2004. This transition is unusual in relation to the traditional S-curve model of technological development that typically approaches a limit. The point of inflection on the S-curve coincided reasonably closely with the timing of the dot-com crash in year 2000. Moreover, we find a complex bi-directional relationship between patenting rates in Web technology and movements in the NASDAQ composite stock index. The implications of these results are discussed in theoretical and practical terms for sustained technological growth. Specific recommendations for different stakeholders in commercial Web development are included.",

Rather than focusing on individual case event, we showcase how Weibo is enveloped by and also mutually shapes the push-and-pull forces of the platform’s commodification, political control and the Chinese internet ecology writ large. We argue that under these three forces, Weibo transformed from an online space for public discussions to a platform for marketing and advertising, and entertainment uses.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT PLATO was a pioneering educational computer platform developed at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the 1960s and 1970s. It quickly evolved into a communication system used for educational purposes, and also for social interaction (message boards, real-time messaging), collaboration and online gaming. The PLATO system was one of several precursors to today's Internet, but it has been little studied. It illustrates the value of the study of Internet histories and pre-histories (insofar as PLATO and other computer-mediated communication infrastructures like it predated Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), particularly as those histories entail rhetorical discursive elements regarding technical resources, social values and ethical norms that continue to shape the development of Internet technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes the history of Couchsurfing, a platform matching free, peer-to-peer hospitality launched in 2004, as a series of four deaths and resurrections. The platform was first brought back to life by its members, in the spirit of open collaboration, then by its leaders, in an effort to legitimize the platform as a US-based charity, then by Silicon Valley investors, seeking to mold it into a profitable startup, and finally by private investors, only to find itself yet again in jeopardy as a result of Covid-19. The aim of the paper is to consider what the history of this niche platform tells us about the changing ecology of the Web as a whole. Through that lens, Couchsurfing’s struggles to respond to drastic changes in its environment are indicative of the growing specialization of the Web into a closed and monetized information ecosystem.",

    "title": "VidAngel: Content filtering technologies, religion, and American copyright law",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article traces a cultural history of the visual media filtering industry in the United States—from VHS tapes to internet filters to digital streaming platforms. Through an analysis of the company VidAngel, a video filtering start-up, and its recent copyright lawsuit brought by a group of major Hollywood film studios, we highlight the influential role that religion and copyright law, as interanimating forces, have played in the development of content identification and moderation technologies and practices. Emerging from this cultural history is a discourse that insists consumer rights to protect their families from morally objectionable content outweigh the copyrights of content creators. Used as a legal justification for content filtering, this family media rights discourse conflates personal moral decisions based on conservative religious values with neoliberal consumer empowerment in an effort to subvert hegemonic media systems by returning the power of media influence to private families in private settings. This article argues that religiously-motivated systems to identify and remove morally objectionable content have not only resulted in innovative business models targeting niche conservative religious audiences but that such businesses inevitably challenge and shape U.S. copyright law, significantly impacting several areas of contemporary media regulation well beyond the Mormon communities at the center of this narrative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Online spaces provide opportunities for creating ties with other people, allowing us to communicate and share content with them. Sometimes, though, we wish to break some of these ties; we wish not only to friend and to follow, but to unfriend and unfollow as well. In this paper, we present a history of the many features for online interpersonal disconnectivity, showing how they have developed over time. We present five main findings: the language of tie breaking is consistently bureaucratic; over time, the features for tie breaking tend to operate on the feed rather than on social ties themselves; platforms are more reactive than proactive when it comes to tie breaking features; new ways for preventing interactions are launched over time; and the features for tie breaking sometimes create what we call “impossible social situations.” This approach shines a spotlight on a neglected aspect of social media, and opens up new ways of thinking about how the platforms conceive of–and construct–online sociability.",

    "abstract": "In December of 2010, I visited Professor Leonard Kleinrock in his office at UCLA. It was not the first time I had done so. I had already completed a round of interviews in 2004 with several ARPANET and Internet pioneers, Kleinrock among them. The 2004 interview took place on the day of that year’s presidential election, only days after the 35th anniversary of the launch of the ARPANET, so Kleinrock was busy, and our meeting was brief. But in 2010, Kleinrock had much more time and was generous with it. In a friendly and relaxed manner, we talked for almost three hours about how he began his career at MIT with two other friends who would later become legendary pioneers in computer history in their own right, Larry Roberts and Ivan Sutherland. Professor Kleinrock took us all the way up to the present time and touched upon some entertaining and unexpected stories. He has given many interviews over the years and participated in in-depth oral histories like the invaluable one recorded by Judy O’Neill for the Charles Babbage Institute as early as 1990, months before Tim Berners-Lee released the World Wide Web documentation. The interview below has been edited for length and for any redundancies with these prior interviews, unless they were deemed necessary for context. Kleinrock also talked about being right in themiddle of a small group of people who would change networked communication forever. Not just through the emergence of the Internet, but also through mobile communications and the development of personal computing devices. Before the interview was over, however, Kleinrock had dished out stories of the mad capers he and Larry Roberts were involved in while they were working on the development of the ARPANET. They included being thrown out of Las Vegas casinos for counting cards and collecting silver quarter coins for future melting, because these tech wizards had found out that the silver content in the coins was worthmore than the coin itself. Two years later, I would enroll at UCLA myself, where I would have many more enlightening and fun interactions with Professor Kleinrock. But back then in 2010, I was just a willing listener. Because even though Leonard Kleinrock is just one of the many, many key",

This article rethinks legacies in internet history by positioning the notion of legacy systems as conceptual basis for a genealogical and non-teleological framing of internet history aimed to investigate lost network events as legacies of European pasts that persist and continue to affect our networked present. To demonstrate its historiographical value, I use the history of Euronet as a case in point, using a variety of primary and secondary sources, to argue that the legacy system of European cooperation and politics on which Euronet was imagined and built, persists within internet history through a variety of “successes” and “failures,” of which Euronet is only one.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since its inception, the internet has been as much technological as social, practical as ideological in character. This article examines academic discourse and asks how research on the multifaceted internet has evolved over the past 25 years. In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the socio-material infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyses the French mainstreamisation process of web related vocabularies through the lens of a collection of archived fragments from national and regional media outlets. A cultural materialist approach is chosen to question the “naturalisation” of a so-called “web language” (langage web) and highlights the role of mediations which help turn once-marginal “jargon” terms into popular digital keywords. This perspective is explored through a diptych of case studies on the discursive journeys of “Buzz” and “Trolls” (1999–2021) using texts and screenshots from Europresse and Internet Archive.",

    "title": "Radical praxis of computing in the PRC: forgotten stories from the maoist to post-Mao era",
    "abstract": "Abstract In his 1937 essay \"On Practice (Shijian lun)\", Mao Zedong argues for a distinctively Chinese model of communism that merges practise with theory, combining objective experience and subjective knowledge into a coherent dialectical process of praxis. This was, at the time, a radical idea within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the global communist movement dominated by Stalinism at its heyday. But it became institutionalized as a guiding principle of CCP, the ruling party of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) since 1949, which has led, among other things, to the establishment of one of the world’s most important computing industries since the 1950s. This article interrogates the idea of “radical praxis” and applies it to the Chinese contexts of the 1950s–2000s in developing a holistic, emic understanding of the computing industry from the Maoist to the Post-Mao era. As such, we aim at reconstructing plural histories of Chinese technology that are longer, less deterministic, and more imaginative than mainstream accounts that would begin, almost always, with Deng Xiaoping’s marketization reforms. Longer, because we trace the radical praxis of Chinese computing back to the 1950s with remarkable continuity. Less deterministic, because it has multiple trajectories full of unforeseeable twists and turns. More imaginative, because praxis is as much about knowing, theorization, and subjectivities as it is about doing, implementation, and embodied struggle. Drawing from policy documents, news archives, memoirs of key CCP leaders as well as secondary materials in both Chinese and English, this article reveals and discusses hidden stories of Maoist radical praxis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the field of media art, mailinglists such as nettime, -empyre-, SPECTRE and CRUMB have functioned as important para-institutional formations that have influentially played host to a diverse community of artists, critics, curators, activists and academics since the 1990s. These lists, we suggest, are of particular epistemological and methodological interest for the field of internet history due to their critical and experimental nature. This stems mainly from the cultivation of highly reflexive, at times ambivalent, stance towards the technical, social and aesthetic limits of such networking activity itself. In this sense, they present unique objects of study for exploring what difference computational methods might make for understanding mailinglist cultures over time; what we refer to in this article, drawing on Wolfgang Ernst, as counting and recounting the past. Our aim in this paper is, therefore, to both introduce these lists to the emerging field of internet history and scope out medium-specific methods that take the measure of concepts, discourses, cohorts, and events that have taken place through them over time.",

    "title": "Web 25: histories from the first 25 years of the World Wide Web",
    "abstract": "This self-evidently timely publication, prompted by the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web in 2014, is an important contribution to the growing field of web and Internet history. It is one of the first serious scholarly attempts to consider the factors – social, cultural, technical and economic – which have shaped the web as we know it today; and to examine how the web in turn has shaped contemporary society and our daily lived experience. The book is divided into four sections: the early web; the web of culture and media; methodological reflections; and web archives as historical source. As these headings reveal, the histories of the web are approached here from a variety of different disciplinary standpoints, using different methodologies, and shaped by different sectoral interests. Archivists and librarians, scholars in media and communication studies, journalists, information scientists and historians are all present, reflecting the interand multi-disciplinary nature of web studies. Similarly, most chapters take an admirably multi-source approach, studying the web in its wider, often analogue, context. The first section on the early web begins with Niels Br€ ugger's discussion of the hyperlink, which he rightly identifies as “a defining feature of the web”. He places it in a long tradition of human attempts to navigate between and link related data, establishing that while much about the web might be novel it is far from introducing a complete break with the past. Next, Simone Natale and Paolo Bory discuss the narratives and myths that have come to shape understandings of the web's history. They highlight the many contrasting, even divergent, stories that have taken hold of the popular imagination, from “the recurring narrative pattern of the hero” (p. 33) to “arguments about the web's decentralized and egalitarian character” (p. 35). Their choice of the plural “biographies” is deliberate. Jean Marie Deken's chapter provides a detailed case-study of the development and influence of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's website between 1991 and 1993. It perhaps tends towards the “hero” narrative identified by Natale and Bory but is nonetheless an interesting and forensic reconstruction of events. The section concludes with Marguerite Barry's fascinating study of the language used to describe the web in its formative years, discussing evolving, and sometimes opposed, concepts such as birth and parenthood; domesticity and ferality; availability and accessibility; the commercial and the utopian. The importance of storytelling again emerges strongly. The next three chapters deal with online culture and media, ranging from changing publishing and reading behaviours in China, to the development of blogs in Italy and the impact of the web on an Australian newspaper. The international scope of the section is significant, reinforcing the argument that the impact of the web has not been experienced in the same way across nations and cultures. Michel Hockx's account of the extraordinary explosion of online literary reading in China made possible by the web is one of the strongest chapters in the collection. It reminds us that the West's concentration on the “great firewall” prevents us from fully acknowledging the vibrancy of Chinese web culture: ‘‘Not only does the world inside the great firewall get by without the core websites associated with the ‘free’ world, but it even exports websites and applications that are preferred by Chinese users outside China over the ‘free world’ INTERNET HISTORIES 2018, VOL. 2, NOS. 3-4, 351–353",

    "title": "Fixing the earth: whole-systems thinking in Silicon Valley’s environmental ideology",
    "abstract": "Abstract Today, American tech actors express optimistic ideas about how to fix the Earth and halt climate change. Such “green” initiatives have in common that they capture the world in systems and propose large systemic, and mostly technological, solutions. Because of their reliance on techno-fixes, representatives of Silicon Valley express an ideology of ecomodernism, which believes that human progress can be “decoupled” from environmental decline. In this article, I show how “whole-systems thinking” has become a key discursive element in today’s ecomodernist discourses. This discourse has developed from the 1960s onwards – inspired by cybernetic, ecological and computational theories – within the tech culture of California. This paper discusses three key periods in this development, highlighting key publications: the Whole Earth Catalog of the 1960s, the Limits to Growth report in 1972 and the cyberspace manifestoes of the mid 1990s. These periods are key to understand how techno-fixes became a popular answer to the climate crisis, eventually leading to a vision of the world as an ecosystem that can be easily controlled and manipulated, and of technological innovation as harmless and beneficial. I argue that “whole-systems” thinking offers a naive and misleading narrative about the development of the climate crisis, that offers a hopeful yet unrealistic perspective for a future threatened by climate change, built on a misconception of Earth as a datafied planet.",

    "title": "Forensic approaches to evaluating primary sources in internet history research: reconstructing early Web-based archival work (1989–1996)",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article examines early digital archival practices, especially those related to historical sources digitised and published to the World Wide Web in the 1990s. Without well-documented professional standards for the digitisation and publication of archival materials online during this period, many archival workers developed innovative, yet idiosyncratic methods of arranging and presenting archival material. Using historical methods informed by digital forensics, this article reconstructs the development practices of one such group of archival workers. The article is structured around a case study examining digitised archival materials pulled from the personal records of American psychologist Timothy Leary, published to Leary.com in the mid-1990s. Forensic analysis of the interface and contents of Leary.com is used to ascertain the dates of development, as well as the specific techniques employed. Next, analysis of the archival arrangement bestowed upon the Web site contents is compared against the professional guidelines generally followed by American archivists, highlighting key differences between the ad-hoc practices of non-institutional archivists and the more formalized procedures followed by peers at established institutions. In conclusion, the article argues that this case study is valuable insofar as it establishes both methodological and historical precedents for deeper engagement with primary sources in Internet history research.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The focus of this paper is the role and context of electronic mail and Internet use in the evolution of the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at UC San Diego, a long-lived international and interdisciplinary social science collaboratory or “laboratory without walls”. I analyse excerpts from LCHC publications, presentations, project reports, websites and archival materials to show how LCHC performs the functions of two collaboratory subtypes (Distributed Research Centre and Virtual Community of Practice) identified in the Science of Collaboratories literature. Strategic use of information and computing technology (ICT) amplified members’ inclusive practices predating the Internet to support collocated and distant researchers. Furthermore, becoming a hybrid collaboratory using ICT to support said practices was crucial to LCHC's sustainability. While prior research on collaboratories identified taxonomies (success factors, main functions), this paper explores connections between collaboratory technology use, membership and sustainability. LCHC members’ adaptation to organisational challenges over several decades may be of interest to scholars of early uses of the Internet to support international and interdisciplinary work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the mid-1990s, as the Internet underwent a major wave of growth and commodification, it also became increasingly politicised. In this article, we analyse the process that led to the birth of the digital rights movement in France. Based on archival work and interviews with key protagonists of the movement, this article blends historical, sociological and policy analysis to help explain the politicisation of French “Internet pioneers”. It documents the emergence of alternative Internet service providers, their relationship to other activist groups, and to the wider digital economy. It then shows how the same small group of individuals turned to political advocacy by surveying some of their interactions with policy-makers, focusing in particular on the debate on intermediary liability and freedom of expression. We stress that the particular social trajectories of these digital rights activists confronted with the commodification of the Internet and the power practices of the state converged to create a “perfect storm” that led them to wield exceptional influence on Internet policy in this early phase of development. We also highlight some of the movement’s internal contradictions and explain its waning influence from the early 2000s on. Through this article, we hope to help diversify the historiography of digital activism as well as to contribute to comparative-historical approaches.",

It standardizes the representation of most of the world’s writing systems on digital media, thus enabling the process and transmission of information through such technologies. Unicode is a contemporary character code, and this paper traces its evolvement out of previous code-layouts, starting with Morse code in telegraphy. Focusing on the adaptations of character codes to Modern Hebrew, I show how representing languages in technology is intertwined with internal and transnational regional concerns, and argue that from its beginning character code has been a locus of struggle over power and sovereignty: first between colonial regimes and resistance movements, and then between global corporations and local agents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Secondary markets have a coextensive history with the world wide web – from email lists to message boards, people have consistently used the web to facilitate the exchange of used goods, job ads and apartment listings. As a way of tracing the socio-technical trajectory of secondary markets, this article offers an extended comparison of two online platforms: craigslist and VarageSale. The former represents one of the earliest and most stable platforms for the online secondary market, whereas the latter is a newcomer that both critiques and seeks to improve on older visions of peer-to-peer exchange. By comparing the monetisation strategies, aesthetics, marketing and user policies of these two platforms, this article generates a historical discussion of key shifts in the online sharing economy specifically and online interactions generally. In particular, this article argues that the gap between these two companies illustrates a transition towards monetisation and away from anonymity, and demonstrates the difference between anonymity as a tool versus anonymity as a way of being.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Infonie was launched as a company offering online services in France in October 1995. Aimed at a limited group of affluent and, above all, inexperienced consumers, the new company saw itself as an alternative to the Internet, offering targeted content in French. Subscribers would be provided with a connection to specific services established by Infonie, together with French partners. However, the development of the Internet and in particular the range of services offered by French Internet Service Providers (ISPs) obliged Infonie to rethink its strategy and look increasingly to the Internet, integrating its services with the norms of the latter and acquiring the search engine Lokace, along with shares in Caramail, a specialist site providing free email addresses. The emergence of free service providers from 1999 onwards reinforced this trend and Infonie finally became just another ISP. We analyse this process by examining both the company's communications strategy, in particular its TV advertising campaigns, and the development of its Internet portal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article argues that transnational flows of knowledge, data, and technologies are not only an actual feature of the Internet, but rather a constitutive characteristic of its historical development. To make this case, it discusses how six countries in Central America-Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama-connected to and through computer networks and technologies such as UUCP, BITNET, and the Internet in the first half of the 1990s. Drawing on archival research and interviews with protagonists of networking initiatives, this article argues that the establishment of these projects in Central America required forging a transnational network of collaborations, enabled by international organisations with presence in countries of the region. This study reveals how the Internet was imagined and enacted in a part of the world largely absent in academic literature. It thus broadens our understanding of the early development of computer networks in the global South.",

It is about web archiving a selection of web incunables published on the Dutch web before 2000 and has a special focus on home pages or user websites from internet provider Euronet* Internet from the period between 1994 and 2000. It explains how internet archaeology can be an innovative way to investigate the new digital cultures through insights from the past. Although many Dutch websites dating from before 2000 are still present on the web and some fine examples of web incunables could be saved, due to technical, legal and other issues it is still hard to archive them. The web collection which is a result of our research cannot therefore be considered as a representative selection of born digital heritage from service provider Euronet, but as the outcome of a learning process.",

    "title": "Mailing list archives as useful primary sources for historians: looking for flame wars",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper aims to show the potential of mailing list archives as primary sources for studying recent history of science. In order to focus on the debates regarding software within the computational chemistry community in the 1990s, the corpus we rely on consists in a scholarly mailing list, a typical corpus from its time, conceived, constructed and maintained by a community. The threaded conversations of the list also constitute a unique rhetorical form in its organisation which is technically bound to the Internet-based media of that time. We first present the issues at stake within our research topic and show how relevant is such a corpus to address them. We then discuss the “ethnographic” characteristics and the structure of the corpus. Its most interesting parts are the “flame wars”, that is outbursts of heated, short and dense debates, in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages. We unveil how the relevant flame wars are located and extracted by producing a graphical representation of the number of messages per day over time. Once flame wars are isolated, the messages exchanged by practitioners are studied precisely to comprehend the argumentative structure of the debates and the different viewpoints of actors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract After Edward Snowden’s revelations, encryption of online communications at a large scale and in a usable manner has become a matter of public concern. The most advanced and popular among recently-developed encryption protocols is currently the Signal protocol. While the Signal protocol is widely adopted and considered as an improvement over previous ones, it remains officially unstandardised, even though there is an informal draft elaborated towards that goal. The analysis of how this protocol was introduced and swiftly adopted by various applications, and of subsequent transformations of the encrypted messaging ecosystem, sheds light on how a particular period in the history of secure messaging has been marked by a “de facto standardisation.” What can we learn about existing modes of governance of encryption and the histories of traditional standardisation bodies, when analysing the approach of “standardisation by running code” adopted by Signal? And finally, how does the Signal protocol challenge a “linear,” evolution-based vision of messaging history? Drawing from a three-year qualitative investigation of end-to-end encrypted messaging, from a perspective informed by science and technology studies (STS), we seek to unveil the ensemble of processes that make the Signal protocol a quasi-standard.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The 5-star Movement (Movimento 5 Stelle, M5S) is a political party in Italy operating almost exclusively online. It was officially established as a political movement in 2009, and quickly became the second most important political force in Italy. Unlike traditional political parties, the Movement operates almost exclusively online, without any headquarters and non-digital types of communication (until recently, candidates were forbidden to give interviews on TV or to the press); Beppe Grillo's blog (www.beppegrillo.it), used as an aggregator by early activists, is now the main “spokesperson” of the party; it is not just a tool of communication that replaces traditional party newspapers, but an integral part of the party's life and of its history. This research will first give an overview of the relation between the 5-Star Movement and the World Wide Web, particularly the blog. In second instance, through a deeper analysis of the blog posts from 2008 until the end of 2017, the paper will try to determine what is the main political discourse underlying the M5S on two key “ideological issues”: migration and the European Union, and how the party's positions have evolved over the years.",

    "title": "Framing digital identities through social media in museums",
    "abstract": "Abstract Drawing on evidence from literature in branding, marketing, digital media, and communications, this article finds that museums’ branding strategies are framed within marketing disciplines and therefore create simplistic dichotomies between “internal” and “external” actors, as well as between “physical” and “digital” spaces. This marketing frame inevitably led museums to create their identities by placing higher value on their physical attributes (collection and building) as well as to the stakeholders (curators and visitors) who either managed or engaged with these physical attributes. Therefore, when museums began using social media, their approach was to instrumentalise these platforms as communication tools and to reflect the identity they had built “offline” through marketing or broadcasting-style online posts. This approach to social media is limiting because it does not acknowledge the role of the platform and that of the user within these online spaces. Based on a systematic review of literature, this article argues the need for a different approach to museums’ digital identities by proposing an approach based on Actor-Network theory and a new media frame. In doing so, it addresses the need for an integrated approach that connects mission and social practices to create value for online audiences and that is open to the active participation of networked users.",

    "title": "Early virtual science museums: when the technology is not mature",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses three case studies of early science museum-related websites in the 1990s and early 2000s, when web technology was still relatively new and evolving. The Virtual Museum of Computing (VMoC) was a completely virtual museum, originally produced in 1995 as part of the Virtual Library museums pages (VLmp), an international online museum directory within the WWW Virtual Library, adopted by the International Council of Museums (ICOM). The Science Museum in London was one of the first museums in the United Kingdom to have its own web server. The museum hosted an early meeting on web service provision by and for museums, concurrently with an exhibition on the Information Superhighway at the museum in 1995. Exhiblets were launched online in 1998. Ingenious was a multi-site digital collections transformation project, launched as a website in 2003. Virtual Leonardo and Leonardo’s Ideal City were two experiments conducted by the digital team of the Science and Technology Museum of Milan, between 1999 and 2001. The experiment consisted of the creation of a shared online 3D world, namely a reconstruction of the real museum in the first case and a completely imaginary world in the second case. This paper describes the above three case studies from the early World Wide Web and then draws some conclusions, from first-hand experience of developments at the time. We cover both the advantages and the challenges encountered by the various projects and illustrate why they did not necessarily become established, despite promising early results.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This short article explores the challenges involved in demonstrating the value of web archives, and the histories that they embody, beyond media and Internet studies. Given the difficulties of working with such complex archival material, how can researchers in the humanities and social sciences more generally be persuaded to integrate Internet histories into their research? How can institutions and organisations be sufficiently convinced of the worth of their own online histories to take steps to preserve them? And how can value be demonstrated to the wider general public? It touches on public attitudes to personal and institutional Internet histories, barriers to access to web archives – technical, legal and methodological - and the cultural factors within academia that have hindered the penetration of new ways of working with new kinds of primary source. Rather than providing answers, this article is intended to provoke discussion and dialogue between the communities for whom Internet histories can and should be of significance.",

    "title": "From RangKoM and JARING to the Internet: visions and practices of electronic networking in Malaysia, 1983–1996",
    "abstract": "Abstract Early electronic networks were established for a variety of purposes, to serve different kinds of people and needs, and in vastly different political, social, and economic contexts. Examining some of the earliest electronic networks established in Southeast Asia provides us with a glimpse of the contrasting and diverse aims for which they were established and used. At the time electronic networking began to be developed in Malaysia (during the 1980s) its potential was far more open-ended. Although networking pioneers in Southeast Asia were influenced by North American experiences, they quickly developed their own ideas about what networks could be, could do, and how they could serve national or local purposes. This essay uses the concept of a “networking imaginary” to conceptualise the ways in which networks became associated with particular ideals, goals, and futures. The pioneers of electronic networking in Malaysia articulated a unique networking imaginary that anticipated networks playing a critical role in Malaysia’s developing economy. Networking, in the vision of its Malaysian founders, would play a key role in propelling Malaysia forward as a wealthy, stable, and harmonious society. These visions continue to impact the ways in which networks are imagined and used in Malaysia today.",

    "title": "The narratives we inherit: the local and global in Tomsk’s internet history",
    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years scholars have called for more attention to local net histories, work that demonstrates how networked computing developed in specific geographical, material, and social contexts. Research carried out in this spirit stands in contrast to a canonical and popular history of the (singular) “Internet,” and thus sets up an opposition or dyad between “local” net histories and the “global” or mainstream history of ARPAnet, the Internet Protocol, and the World Wide Web. This article takes up the call for local net histories by focusing on Tonet, a local network that was developed in the Siberian city of Tomsk and which peaked in usage in the early 2000s. However, rather than assuming an opposition between local and global Internet history, this article interrogates how the local net and global Internet were articulated by Tonet’s computer scientists and regional journalists at the time. The article thus enquires into symbolic connections between a local net and the global Internet, unsettling this opposition while also drawing attention to the specific legacies that shaped these concepts in the case of Tonet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Notwithstanding the growing interest in cyberactivism in Brazil since the 2013 protests, not much is known about the previous unfolding of this kind of activism before it became a major actor in challenging the political system. Thus, this paper aimed to offer a first outline of cyberactivism’s history in Brazil, taking into account which actors and practices were present in each moment, stressing their continuities and discontinuities. To this end, we used existing empirical literature – predominantly focused on particular actors, practices or moments – to gather data, facts and processes. Our investigation found out three moments of cyberactivism in the country, disrupted by an entaglement of socipolitical and technological factors and classified on the basis of existent actors, practices and platforms. First, the emergence, whereby web portals served as a source of information and a space for self expression and political articulation. Second, the consolidation, in which blogs provided networks for debates known as blogospheres. And, finally, the routinisation, when the emergence of social networks – stimulating debates, individual political manifestations, exchange of strategic information and calls for demonstrations – enabled cyberactivism to become part of everyday life.",

The contributions revolve around a socio-cultural sense of legacy – of ideas built into Internet culture and how Internet devices continue to operate into the present. They also address cultural and political legacies relevant to histories of networks and digital culture, and investigate how specific technologies bear the marks of past debates and decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Web and Internet historians have never been able to consider the sources preserved at CERN because of a 30-year closure law. The WWW collection is of major importance not only because it is located where the Web was born but, more importantly, because it preserves documents produced during the early and little-known stages of its development. Our study has a qualitative approach and is based on in-person discussions, e-mail exchanges, and a focus group we conducted with five main actors responsible for the birth and development of the WWW collection at CERN. Through this method, we co-constructed with them a discourse, which we later analysed through inductive thematic analysis. We extracted six main topics reflecting the principal themes represented in the collection: reasons for creating a specific collection of web-related documents; salient moments in the history of the collection; discussion about its naming; issues about the originality of the documents; and future digitisation projects. This paper may be of interest to web historians and archivists looking for an overview and hidden reasons for the creation of the collection.",

    "title": "Google’s Post-IPO Development: risks, rewards, and shareholder value",
    "abstract": "Abstract Internet history shows that states, military, universities and other public institutions were essential drivers of innovation in the early stages of network development. However, once risky stages pass, commercialisation starts and investors often reap disproportionate rewards from technological innovation. In this paper, we use the risk-reward nexus (RRN) approach (Lazonick & Mazzucato, 2013; Mazzucato, 2013, 2018; Mazzucato & Shipman, 2014) to understand the imbalance between risky public investment and private allocation of rewards regulated by financial markets. We analyse risk reporting in Form 10-K market reports submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Google Inc. (Alphabet Inc.) for the period between 2005 and 2019. We detected 58 organisational, marketing and advertising, technological, legal, competitive, and macroeconomic risks. Based on changes in risk reporting three stages of Google’s development can be discerned: post-IPO growth and expansion (2005-2008), growth management and investment diversification (2009-2013), legal struggles and regulatory scrutiny (2014-2019). Reported risks are primarily directed at shareholders, omitting risks relating to internet users, courts, regulators, and nation states. Such an approach is historically rooted in the construction of financial regulation in the name of public interests and markets, with public interests largely interpreted as a proxy for investors’ interests.",

    "title": "Emigration to the internet: “Samizdat” and the genesis of contemporary Russian nationalism",
    "abstract": "Abstract During the mid-1990s the Pro-European concept of the Russian nation was formed in the post-Soviet ideological space, contrary to the prevailing traditionalist, soil-based forms of Russian nationalism, mainly focused on the search for a “special way”. The former is based on the values of democracy and individualism while the main emphasis of the ideology is the leadership of intellectuals in political life. This article studies the genesis of aforementioned trend in contemporary Russian nationalism in the context of two historical circumstances: the ideological and social status of post-Soviet intellectuals and the Russian-language Internet at the stage of transition to social networks. A key element of the transition period is the emergence of mass online communication, anticipating the beginning of social networks era. Combination of elitism and emphasis on the text were combined with increasing popularity and anonymity, where all these qualities were embodied in guest books. Thus, we will try to show how the communicative environment of the early Runet was arranged and how it influenced rhetorical strategies, styles of public behavior and ideology of contemporary Russian nationalists. As an example in our work, we will consider Dmitry Galkovsky’s Internet resource “Samizdat”, which was functioning in the late 1990s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Museums have widely used digital technologies to expand their societal and cultural impact. In terms of their use of information technologies (IT), museums have evolved from initial experiments in the 1950s to a significant online presence today. In the process of digital transformation, museums have shaped their digital identity, aiming to expand their activities beyond museum walls with emerging new roles in the digital era. The concept of museums’ digital identity is the focus of this paper. To articulate the concept, the theory of digital identity, the methodology of web history, the concept of virtual museums, and museum branding, are brought into consideration. The author articulates the concept of museums’ digital identity and outlines a number of components at the collective and individual levels embodied in national strategies and policy documents relating to digital transformation, articulated in statements by museum associations, revealed in features of their online presence, and embedded in brand design. In the conclusion, the author raises questions about the driving force of museums in developing digital identity and the need to comprehensively analyse the multiplatform museum presence.",

    "title": "Demonstrating and negotiating the adoption of web design technologies: Cascading Style Sheets and the CSS Zen Garden",
    "abstract": "Abstract Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) express the visual design of a website through code and remain an understudied area of web history. Although CSS was proposed as a method of adding a design layer to HTML documents early on in the development of the web, they only crossed from a marginal position to mainstream usage after a long period of proselytising by web designers working towards “web standards”. The CSS Zen Garden grassroots initiative aimed at negotiating, mainstreaming and archiving possible methods of CSS web design, while dealing with varying levels of browser support for the technology. Using the source code of the CSS Zen Garden and the accompanying book, this paper demonstrates that while the visual designs were complex and sophisticated, the CSS lived within an ecosystem of related platforms, i.e., web browsers, screen sizes and design software, which constrained its use and required enormous sensitivity to the possibilities browser ecosystems could reliably provide. As the CSS Zen Garden was maintained for over ten years, it also acts as a unique site to trace the continuing development of web design, and the imaginaries expressed in the Zen Garden can also be related to ethical dimensions that influence the process of web design. Compared to Flash-based web design, work implemented using CSS required a greater willingness to negotiate source code configurations between browser platforms. Following the history of the individuals responsible for creating and contributing to the CSS Zen Garden shows the continuing influence of layer-based metaphors of design separated from content within web source code.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study critiques the way in which journalism and other media used John Perry Barlow, an early Internet enthusiast, as a source to make common sense of cyberlibertarian ideology as the Internet emerged as a dominant communications technology in the 1990s and early-2000s. During this period, journalists used Barlow, someone with no technical expertise but a reputation as a prophet of the new technology, to translate the deregulatory, conservative ideals of free markets and speech so central to cyberlibertarianism for mass consumption. In the process, Barlow and these journalists depoliticized a central political question about the Internet that remains today: how and how much it should be regulated. This amplification of cyberlibertarianism as doxa in popular discourses during this period helped foreclose on alternative conceptions of the Internet not only in the press but also in discussions of policy.",

    "title": "The efficacy of civil society in global internet governance",
    "abstract": "Abstract Civil society plays a critical role in the multistakeholder approach adopted in Internet governance. However, little is known about the dynamics within that stakeholder group. Besides the struggle and contestation for recognition, civil society actors face less well-known challenges such as managing the diversity among them while striving to arrive at decisions when they participate in global multistakeholder processes as a group. This article investigates the effort of and the challenges faced by civil society in managing its diverse entities to participate while aiming to be influential in watershed multistakeholder fora, namely in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) I and II, Internet Governance Forum (IGF), and the 2014 Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial). Using observational data, documents, and mailing-list messages, this study found that the coordination struggles within civil society affected their goals when they participated in multistakeholder processes. This study suggests that civil society actors need to manage their short- and long-term goals in Internet governance in order to strengthen the legitimacy and efficacy of their participation as a group in Internet-related multistakeholder policy-making processes.",

    "title": "Digital cynical romanticism: Japan’s 2channel and the precursors to online extremist cultures",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the West, the concern surrounding the rise of online harassment, trolling and other malicious and antisocial behaviors tend to be hyper focused on websites like 4chan, 8chan and reddit. However, the rise of online hate culture that laid the groundwork for movements like Gamergate and the alt right has a precedent in Japan – specifically, the culture that was borne out of the 2channel text board, which was the inspiration for the American 4chan. As society decayed around many Japanese in the 1990s (an economic recession, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, to name a few events), the Internet came to prominence in the form of Bulletin Board Systems. Despite its lasting impact and influence on digital culture more globally, it is understudied and ignored in larger discussions around trolling, harassment, and online hate. Using a case study of the anti-Korean manga Kenkanryu and through the lens of Cynical Romanticism, this essay examines the ways that 2channel and the netto uyoku (the Japanese extreme far right) created a digital subculture that has had a lasting impact on global online hate. Though the netto uyoku never achieved significant successes in terms of actual societal and political change, what they did leave behind is a blueprint for online reactionaries.",

    "title": "Technology, ethics and religious language: early Anglophone Christian reactions to “cyberspace”",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The very recent past has seen an upswing of scholarly interest not so much in the Internet and Web themselves but in the terms in which they have been discussed and understood. This article examines a remarkable effusion of writing in the 1990s that addressed the spiritual and ethical implications of “cyberspace”. Christian critics reacted in different ways to prophecies of technological revolution. Some saw ethical challenges in relation to economic and social exclusion and the nature of interpersonal relations. Others elaborated a semi-mystical evolutionary understanding of the Web as an ontologically concrete “space”. Others again revived older anxieties about the challenge apparently posed to human uniqueness and autonomy posed by computerisation more generally, which cyberspace threatened to magnify. However, this thinking did not occur in isolation from the sweep of Anglophone social thought. I suggest instead that the wider discourse about the ethics of the Internet and Web, both learned and popular, was infused at every level with religious imagery. As such, the article contributes to the ongoing debate on the extent to which the cultures of the UK and North America have been secularised: even if religious observance has declined, the English language still bears the marks of its Christian past.",

The 2010 conversation represents one of last times Baran participated in an interview before his death in March 2011. Topics discussed include how Baran drew upon inspiration from Warren McCulloch's work on neural networks to bring distributedness to communication networks and how this led to Hot Potato Routing, which later became known as packet switching. The latter, being an foundational part of Internet technology, has placed Paul Baran firmly in the histories of networking and the Internet, even if the origins of packet switching are hotly contested – a topic that is also discussed in the conversations. Finally, Baran also shares his views on technological development and determinism and what the future for the Internet holds.",

    "title": "Internet histories: the view from the design process",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The electrical engineers and computer scientists who have designed the Internet are among those who have written Internet history. They have done so within the technical document series created to provide a medium for and record of the design process, the Internet Requests for Comments (RFCs) as well as in other venues. Internet designers have explicitly written the network's history in documents explicitly devoted to history as well as indirectly in documents focused on technical matters. The Internet RFCs also provide data for research on Internet history and on large-scale sociotechnical infrastructure written by outsiders to the design process. Incorporating the history of the Internet as understood by those responsible for its design, whether in their own words or by treating the design conversation as data, makes visible some elements of that history not otherwise available, corrects misperceptions of factors underlying some of its features, and provides fascinating details on the people and events involved that are of interest to those seeking to understand the Internet. Within the RFCs, history has served both technical and social functions.",

    "title": "Experimenting with computational methods for large-scale studies of tracking technologies in web archives",
    "abstract": "Abstract The use of tracking technologies to collect data about web users and their online behaviour has played an important role in the development of the web. Most studies of tracking examine the current extent of tracking on popular websites on the online web, while historical studies are rare. Large-scale historical studies of web tracking are important for a more comprehensive understanding of the development, spread and implications of tracking technologies across the web. Historical studies of tracking are challenged by the lack of access to the original data flows in the tracking and by the characteristics of the archived web. This article proposes an approach to a web historiography of tracking, which focusses on the potentials of analysing the source code and metadata, which can be processed on a large scale. Using the archived Danish web as a case, the article describes an approach to studying web beacons in historical web data using computational methods, and showcases how experimenting with new approaches can bring new knowledge about the historical development of web tracking but also about the significance of understanding the technical aspects of archiving and archived web when using sources like source code, crawl logs and indices as data.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article discusses the method and results of research using web archives to explore the development of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Armed Forces websites. The methodology shows how an initial corpus was created and analysed to establish the purpose of the MoD and Armed Forces websites. Visual hierarchy design, thematic content analysis, and an understanding of website design were used to contextualise online content. Recruitment content is shown to have been a chief concern of the Armed Forces websites throughout the period, particularly for the British Army. Changes in recruitment terminology and the increased employment of interactive content are examined. It is argued that the greater use of content such as videos was not the result of a change in approach towards recruitment but an adoption of the increased capabilities of websites. The importance of the MoD and Armed Forces websites as a means of influencing public opinion is established and the Army's development of its website as a communication channel is explored. Link analysis was used to investigate the central position of the MoD campaign Supporting Britain's Reservists and their Employers in the visualisation of the .mod.uk domain and the Territorial Army's attempts to recruit personnel for the Army Medical Service.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Our paper focuses on the Interface Message Processor (IMP), an important device in the history of ARPANET. Designed as the interface between ARPANET nodes and the common carrier telephone system, the IMP actualized the ARPANET as an experimental packet-switching communication system. We conceptualize the IMP as historical boundary object that exposes ARPANET’s close relationship to the telephone system. Our analysis offers a novel history of ARPANET as a repurposing of the existing telephone infrastructure. Beyond the historical contribution, this approach has wider implications for the theory of media infrastructures, specifically the “inter-structuralism” of ARPANET and the nature of borders between seemingly disparate social, political, and technological regimes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Chinese Internet has developed rapidly in the past decade and given rise to many online phenomena, including digital vigilantism (DV). It refers to citizens’ practice of weaponising online visibility for retaliation when collectively offended. In China, since the Cat Torture Case in 2006, DV has been widely adopted by citizens to defend social norms and values. With recent technological developments and socio-political changes in China, how Chinese citizens conduct DV and its influence have also changed along various dimensions. This research, therefore, identifies the historical changes of DV in China and situates these changes in relation to contemporary Chinese technological and socio-political development. The study constructs a database of 1265 Chinese DV cases that receive media coverage between 2006 to 2018 and conducts a thematic analysis to identify characteristics, changes, and trends of DV in China. The author argues that these developments demonstrate the mediation and more importantly, the mediatisation of justice-seeking on the Chinese Internet conditioned by the ubiquitous state power.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Among the conceptual and methodological opportunities afforded by the Internet Archive, and more specifically, the WayBack Machine, is the capacity to capture and “play back” the history a web page, most notably a website's homepage. These playbacks could be construed as “website histories”, distinctive at least in principle from other uses put to the Internet Archive such as “digital history” and “Internet history”. In the following, common use cases for web archives are put forward in a discussion of digital source criticism. Thereafter, I situate website history within traditions in web historiography. The particular approach to website history introduced here is called “screencast documentaries”. Building upon Jon Udell's pioneering screencapturing work retelling the edit history of a Wikipedia page, I discuss overarching strategies for narrating screencast documentaries of websites, namely histories of the Web as seen through the changes to a single page, media histories as negotiations between new and old media as well as digital histories made from scrutinising changes to the list of priorities at a tone-setting institution such as whitehouse.gov.",

It chronicles the four central ways that employees related to Friendster’s end: through three diagnoses of the reasons behind its closure, or through claiming its persistence in platforms that thrive today. Arguing for the utility of technological death as a lens–especially within Silicon Valley techno-cultures saturated with death discourses–this article critically analyses these narratives to reveal otherwise obscured power dynamics, especially in regard to platforms’ purported support of global community. Finally, the article notes how death discourses are productive within Silicon Valley techno-cultures, as employees mobilize these failures as instructive assets in their careers.",

    "title": "Building Internet policy on history: lessons of the forgotten 1981 network neutrality debate",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The US-centric Internet history situates the start of the net neutrality debate around 2003, but a look at global Internet histories indicates otherwise. To wit: this case study of the forgotten net neutrality struggle that took place in France between 1979 and 1982. In 1978, the French PTT started “Minitel,” the world's first successful mass market online ecosystem. The Minitel experience prefigured most of the legal, economic, industrial, and other public policy issues we face today in cyberspace. The concept of network neutrality was explicitly debated by administrators and regulators – only to be rejected upon pressure from the incumbent print press industry, which foresaw its own impending demise and did all it could to hinder the development of open and neutral digital fora. Minitel has been derided by many scholars and policy wonks as the epitome of statism that precluded real and meaningful innovation from emerging from the edges. This article demonstrates instead that hindrances to net neutrality in France in the early 1980s were the result of private sector lobbying, not of PTT administrators. It provides a counter-narrative grounded in historical data, to fuel further thinking about what policies will better support private innovation over modern online platforms.",

    "title": "Against technocratic authoritarianism. A short intellectual history of the cypherpunk movement",
    "abstract": "Abstract This essay aims to correct the established idea that the cypherpunk movement was organically embracing libertarianism. By addressing the cypherpunk movement, the intellectual roots of many of the concerns about freedom and about a surveillance society that dominate this internet age come to light. The cypherpunks, a heterogenic group of entrepreneurs, engineers, and activists in the San Francisco Bay Area, argued in the nineties that the Internet would make more pervasive the phenomenon of surveillance of individuals. In the context of this increasing process of surveillance, individual autonomy would be dismissed as an obsolete fiction and social engineering would be elevated to totalitarianism. This article frames the cypherpunks as a movement in opposition to an emerging technocratic authoritarian order.",

    "title": "Little history of CAPTCHA",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article traces the early history of CAPTCHA, the now ubiquitous cybersecurity tool that prompts users to “confirm their humanity” by solving word- and image-based puzzles before accessing free online services. CAPTCHA, and its many derivatives, are presented as content identification mechanisms: the user is asked to identify content in order for the computer to determine the identity of the user. This twofold process of content identification, however, has evolved significantly since CAPTCHA’s inception in the late 1990s. Pivoting away from a realist framework, largely dependent on the standard tenets [of] cryptography, toward a relational framework premised on aesthetic contingency and social consensus, CAPTCHA’s arc uniquely illustrates how contested notions of both “content” and “identity” become materialized in contemporary internet infrastructure. Inspired by Walter Benjamin’s exegetical study of early photography, this critical historicization aims to foreground CAPTCHA as a particularly fraught juncture of humans and computers, which, as with Benjamin’s intervention, productively troubles received ideas of humanism and automation, mediation and materiality.",

    "title": "What is “internet”? The case for the proper noun and why it is important",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Academics, style manual editors and others have recently pushed for an elimination of the capitalisation of the word “internet”. This choice may have consequences that reach far beyond language and spelling, as it lends authority to the claim that there could be more than one “internet”, which in turn is based on a historical narrative that is not necessarily accurate. By first exploring the meaning of the word “internet” and subsequently tracing its origins, this article shows how “internet” evolved from an adjective describing a class of networking activities into a proper noun defining the foundation of the current “internet” as early as 1976. It is shown how the use of “internet” as a common noun emerges post-hoc and may have commercial origins rather than historical. The article concludes by showing how both the current, popular, broad definition of “internet”, as well as its historical roots, make the plural use of the term impossible, and why it should only be considered a proper noun, written as Internet.",
