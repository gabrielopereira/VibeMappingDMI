    "title": "Building on diversity: crafting a paradigm for digital design environments",
    "abstract": "Advanced computer systems for 3D design and modelling are widely used in many areas of design and manufacturing. However, although they offer undoubted benefits, there is growing awareness of their inadequacy to meet the range of capabilities required by designers. Limited types of design representations can be created in the virtual environment. The precise, detailed geometric modelling techniques are unsuited to the earlier stages of design, and emphasise the creation and visualisation of three-dimensional form, rather than the more dynamic and functional aspects of working with materials. There is a discrepancy between the highly sophisticated three-dimensional models, and current ‘two-dimensional’ ways of interacting with them via mouse and screen. In most systems, a complex user interface requires extensive experience before it can be used transparently. Ways of interacting intuitively and expressively in three dimensions are now highly desirable. Rapid advances in digital technologies, such as haptic and gesture interfaces, 3D imaging, and more intuitive modelling techniques, offer us a means of moving away from the ‘desk-top box’ scenario to more fluid and flexible human-centred ‘digital design environments’. The potential of such technologies to allow a less constrained, more naturalistic interaction with virtual models has increased the drive towards computer support for the whole design process, in particular for conceptual design. To take full advantage of these developments, we must understand how the types of interaction they enable are, or could be, used in the design process. Existing systems have developed around the ‘design-by-drawing’ paradigm, but this does not adequately reflect the complexity, diversity and individuality of designers’ processes. To truly move forward, a radical re-evaluation is required.",

    "abstract": "This research project, based in the School of Communications at the Royal College of Art, has involved an examination of the influence of significant developments in video technology and electronic imaging techniques on British and American video art and these influences on my own fine art practice, in order to provide a detailed background and context for three new video installations; Mind’s Eye (1997), Mothlight (1998–99) and Merging/Emerging (1999). The overall purpose of this aspect of my research has been to examine the influences of a range of representative works of American and British video art that have been significant to the development of my own practice (either by direct influence, or because of their position within the cultural context in which I was working) and to gain insight into the context of my recent work through an understanding of the complex interrelationships between developing electronic imaging technology and cultural form. This historical and contextual research forms the background to the production and exhibition of the three installations that form the core of my project.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Every Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), in order to justify the term ‘intelligent’, has to contain the specific knowledge of the taught subject as well as to embed several modules with those mechanisms that are able to handle the knowledge in an intelligent way (e.g., using rules of thumb, tricks etc.) and, in general, behave in a way that would be considered intelligent if observed by a human. Such modules are apparently necessary in ITS generators too. In this paper, the Hybrid Methodology Tutor (HMeT) is presented. HMeT is a hybrid expert system that is embedded in an ITS generator and supports the description of the structure and dynamics of the procedural knowledge, during authoring; it is also responsible for its presentation during tutoring. HMeT was designed and implemented to replace an earlier version (MeT ‐ Methodology Tutor), in order to provide for higher inferential capabilities, better user interface and more user friendliness in authoring as well as in tutoring. HMeT functions li...",

    "title": "Artful surfaces: an ethnographic study exploring the use of space in design studios",
    "abstract": "A largely overlooked aspect of creative design practices is how physical space in design studios plays a role in supporting designers' everyday work. In particular, studio surfaces such as designers' desks, office walls, notice boards, clipboards and drawing boards are full of informative, inspirational and creative artefacts such as, sketches, drawings, posters, story-boards and Post-it notes. Studio surfaces are not just the carriers of information but importantly they are sites of methodic design practices, i.e. they indicate, to an extent, how design is being carried out. This article describes the results of an ethnographic study on the use of workplace surfaces in design studios, from two academic design departments. Using the field study results, the article introduces an idea of ‘artful surfaces’. Artful surfaces emphasise how artfully designers integrate these surfaces into their everyday work and how the organisation of these surfaces comes about helping designers in accomplishing their creative and innovative design practices. Using examples from the field study, the article shows that artful surfaces have both functional and inspirational characteristics. From the field study, three types of artful surfaces are identified: personal; shared; and project-specific. The article suggests that a greater insight into how these artful surfaces are created and used could lead to better design of novel display technologies to support designers' everyday work.",

    "abstract": "This essay proposes digital video (DV) as a new centre of gravity for the design/production process of architecture and its kindred arts. DV's capacity to work with synthesised and captured images, that can be modelled and reverse engineered, offers a powerful mode of exploration, iterative development and communication for information-rich projects that depend on a complex mobilisation of team skills and technical resources. The promise of DV is that it taps into the great fund of visual/operational knowledge held in the culture at large, and that it can enable the design/production process to become more responsive and more open to a wider group of interested parties. The essay argues that the fulfilment of this promise becomes increasingly urgent as our moving-image-saturated environment melts the boundaries of place and time, and dissolves the distinctions that separates the permanence of architecture from the transience of events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many web designers approach the design of the graphic user interface on principles derived from either graphic design or usability, conceiving each web page as a static entity without regard for the user's interactive activities and experiences. This research seeks to define some fundamental characteristics of design for the online user experience by looking to examples where online participation is both immersive and empowering for the user. This research draws on principles of co-creation from ‘Net art’ and the capacity of usersin online communities to create alternative identities and experimental modes of being, it seeks to identify those characteristics that make online experiences truly compelling, reconceptualising the relationship between user experience, interaction processes and design elements. The research contributes to the field of web design by offering a new conceptualisation of the user experience that escapes the current limitations of both graphic design (visual focused) and usability design (functional focused).",

    "abstract": "3D computer graphics has been under-used by fine artists. This paper explores some of the possible reasons for this and also some of the possible attractions of 3D. The rigid depiction of three-space, as performed so accurately by the camera, had been a goal of painters since the Renaissance, but in the twentieth century a host of factors led to its subversion. Only in the sixties and in the US did a photorealist painting become popular. The author suggests that linear perspective has been seen as a tyranny, but the time has come to re-evaluate and liberate it through 3D computer graphics as a medium for fine art. The author's own work using ray-tracing software is described.",

    "abstract": "The authors use their different work and training background as perspectives for discussing the changing world of graphical design. In this digital world, expert knowledge of the technology is essential, but the authors argue that a consequence of prioritising technical expertise in the new interdisciplinary IT- design studies may be a loss of quality in design. To improve the depth in design the authors introduce a psychological framework for design work and on this basis they suggest a systematic method. The method is a 4-step conceptual model: reason, function, emotion and senses, and technology. The model interacts with all phases of the design, and functions as a generating-creating and execution-evaluation system. The authors emphasise that evaluation is embedded throughout the design process. They suggest that a systematic method becomes the guiding tool in interdisciplinary design education, an essential part of the students design qualifications as well as an essential tool in design work.",

From inventing the digital computer and helping to decode the German Enigma machine, to founding the science of Artificial Intelligence, the world today would have been a very different place without him and his ideas. His work on morphogenesis (the biological processes that cause organisms to grow into particular shapes) and the now famous Turing Test for machine intelligence have captured the imagination of artists for decades. Furthermore, his technological developments have given them the tools to create new kinds of artwork. Who knows what else he could have achieved had he not tragically taken his own life just over two weeks before his 42nd birthday, following prosecution for homosexuality and a subsequent sentence of oestrogen treatment (chemical castration). Prime Minister Gordon Brown publicly apologised for the ‘appalling’ treatment Turing received in 2009, saying on behalf of the British Government ‘we’re sorry, you deserved so much better’. This exhibition, to celebrate his life takes its name from Turing’s own writing on the subject of mathematical reasoning. It brings together a number of important artists, from digital art pioneers to emerging contemporaries, to investigate Turing’s enduring influence on art and contemporary culture. Artists taking part include: Roman Verostko, William Latham, boredomresearch, Patrick Tresset, Paul Brown, Sue Gollifer, Greg Garvey, Martin A. Smith, Anna Dumitriu and Alex May. Intuition and Ingenuity, the exhibition, which was curated by Sue Gollifer, Nick Lambert and Anna Dumitriu, was composed of several new commissions as well as important works from the history of computer art. Intuition and Ingenuity toured throughout the UK during 2012 and 2013 including the Victoria and Albert Museum and Bletchley Park.",

    "title": "Interview with the drone: experimenting with post-anthropocentric art practice",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The main idea behind the development of the art project discussed in this artistic contribution, called MNEMODRONE, is to have people share private memories with a drone and then use those memories to create an artificial intelligence. Is it possible for a machine to act based on collective memories? Although there is not a definitive answer, I discuss the ideas behind the project: the problem of quantifying nonhuman forms of consciousness, a model for the drone's artificial intelligence and the advantages of a post-anthropocentric artistic investigation. The second half of my contribution discusses the limits of post-anthropocentric creativity and proceeds more speculatively, proposing a theoretical model of metamorphosis that could be useful for understanding technology and also for artificial intelligent systems to understand humans. My contribution advocates for a creative analysis of future scenarios, both technological and cultural, beyond the boundaries of traditional methodologies. I conclude with a fictional interview that could eventually take place between an interviewer and MNEMODRONE. This fictional interview allows the artwork to speak for itself, and is based on the data collected by the drone in its first year of activities, mimicking its discursive capabilities once the artificial intelligence is fully developed.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the hardware and software capabilities of interactive media has allowed an increase in the use of animated imagery within software learning environments. New animation software programs, targeted specifically for use on the World Wide Web (WWW) and CD-ROMs, have been introduced into the market place for programmers, designers and others who may have little training or experience with incorporating animated imagery into interactive content. This paper provides an overview of theories which relate to motion in the areas of education, science and culture. This paper is not meant to be an exhaustive source, but more of a reflective piece on work done in other fields that relates to animation within software. The final portion of this paper lists six common uses of animation in learning software, as well as ten recommended guidelines for evaluation of animations within a software learning environment.",

    "title": "Combining Digital and Traditional Visualisation Techniques in Community-Based Planning and Design",
    "abstract": "Public participation is a key component in environmental planning and design. Yet too often, architects and planners are not equipped with effective tools and visualisation techniques to generate meaningful public input. Architects and planners are increasingly turning to computer technology; computer imaging can be used to support exploration of alternatives by enabling community members to visualise opportunities and scenarios before committing to a course of action (McClure, 1997). This paper explains how a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an artist played critical roles in a participatory planning process in Chicago's Pilsen neighbourhood. The GIS provided community leaders, planners, architects and designers with an interactive visualisation of the neighbourhood context. It also provided examples of design prototypes in relation to their geographic context. The artist, on the other hand, translated neighbourhood residents' ideas into quick sketches, merging their ideas and thoughts into a shar...",

    "title": "Spatial dialectics: montage and spatially organised narrative in stories without human leads",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article analyses and formulates mechanisms for creating meaningful and engaging narrativity in interactive movies not based on character, where the dialectic relationship between architectural space and the rules that govern montage shape the narrative structure. Formalist analysis of Dziga Vertov's film Man with the Movie Camera (USSR, 1929) highlights two significant terms which play a centralrolein the formulation of the rhetoricalargument of the moving image. ‘Punctus-contra-punctum mon-tage’(‘counterpoint montage’) describes a technique that exploits analogies in form or content between adjacent clips, to produce meaningful thematic sequences; while Lev Kuleshov's ‘artificial landscapes’—the imaginary, creative geographies constructed of moving images that exist only on the screen—offer a way of arranging media spatially. A proof-of-concept, prototype production, Cambridge City Symphony (Alifragkis & Penz 2006), where these approaches are instantiated as rule-sets, and handled by the computer, illustrates how these produce engaging interactive narrativity.",

As a step toward addressing this, we present our constructural design philosophy: a set of principles that can be applied to software in any creative medium and under which we believe effective, early-stage creativity tools can be created. We then illustrate the application of these principles with Wheelsong, a complete, constructurally designed, early-stage music composition exploratorium and discuss a selection of musical sketches resulting from its use.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper builds on previous work into the development of a live improvising software system, Zamyatin, which is designed to perform in duets with improvising musicians. The research looks further into the issue of how performers conceptualise and approach working with the system. It takes the form of a detailed interview and analysis of the musical performance of one musician with the system, framed according to theoretical issues of the analysis and perception of agency, and the notion of how we approach different systems in the world according to Dennett's notion of ‘stances’ and principles of embodied cognition. The results of this study further support the idea that musicians maintain an ambiguous stance towards improvising software systems that do include concepts of autonomy, but do not depend on comparisons to human behaviour.",

What seems to be neglected in the development of these spaces are the personalities that form these very communities and the issues of privacy and freedom of expression being integrated into the technologies allowing these exchanges. The author proposes the development of an agent named Information Personae, that incorporates disembodied information on the Web and re‐embodies it through the data, links and people.",

    "abstract": "Notions of skill and sensitivity in fine art printmaking have been transformed by the new action and knowledge environments brought about by digital technologies. However, the off-the-shelf programs used in these environments are still influenced by an ideology that promotes the simulation of traditional techniques, which in turn prevent a move away from conventional forms of depiction. The ideological stance that drives these programs is problematic because it re-enforces out-dated artistic paradigms. In order to move beyond these paradigms, artists who work with digital technologies will need to be more critical of attempts merely to import techniques analogous to those used in traditional practice (e.g. processing applications that only provide a virtual equivalent to traditional painting, drawing, montage, and photographic methods) and will have to face down the tendency to mimic existing paint and print media. What we need for computer printmaking is the sort of interdependence and autonomy gained by an all-digital approach.",

Such a portrayal of these computational infrastructures as neutral solutions that open participation in design hides the social, political, and environmental entanglements involved in their creation and expansion. This special issue spotlights power relations between computational practices, technology infrastructures, knowledge, and their reproductions of bias at multiple scales.",

    "title": "Book Review",
    "abstract": "This is an excellent book! It presents a broad range of designers and products by way of interviews with 40 designers who have shaped the field of interaction design. It captures the essence of interaction design in a very convincing manner. It is highly informative and dense, yet very accessible. It addresses the merging fields Industrial Design, Human Factors and HCI very well. It integrates breadth and depth elegantly. It has an excellent balance between text and illustrations. The book is a must for interaction designers as well as students and researchers in interaction design. So far for the initial praise – now some facts. It is a big book: 766 pages and 700þ illustrations. It weighs no less than 2.3 kilos. It is organised into 10 main sections: The Mouse and the Desktop; My PC; From the Desk to the Palm; Adopting Technology; Play; Services; The Internet; Multisensory and Multimedia; Futures and Alternative Nows; People and Prototypes. Each section presents interviews with 4–5 prominent designers such as Bill Gaver, Larry Page, John Maeda and Jane Fulton Suri. The coverage is excellent in that not only traditional design areas are covered, but also services, web and games. The book also covers research and industrial aspects of design – as illustrated by interviews with the researchers Stu Card and Terry Winograd and the game designer Will Wright. Another excellent feature is the historical perspective, including interviews with Doug Engelbart and Larry Tesler. The author Bill Moggridge, one of the founders of IDEO, not surprisingly also presents a touch of IDEO: “The introduction and final chapter combine to describe the approach to designing interactions that has evolved at IDEO.” This in no way implies an incoherent book. These two chapters are very good in their own right, IDEO or not. Many design books do not really address the processes behind the wonderful products – this does. The reader gets a clear impression of the twists, turns and hassles associated with good design. In addition the final chapter in the book – almost 100 pages – addresses design processes: “The author’s own ideas about how to design interactions . . . ” This chapter provides a lot of relevant material, ranging from theoretical issues such as ‘What is design’ to practical areas such as prototyping techniques and IDEO Method Cards. The book is accompanied by a DVD and a website with lots of relevant supplementary materials. So what are the drawbacks of this excellent book? I can only think of one: the book is not suitable as textbook in a university course in Interaction Design due to its focus on cases, products and people at the expense of concepts and methods. However, the book is an excellent source of cases in a course in Interaction Design by way of the DVD and the website. Finally, the book is priced very reasonably, given its quality and volume: $40 or £26. The book offers unusually good value for the money. Bravo!",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how the new communication technologies have impacted on the 'Graphic Information Design' BA Hons at the University of Westminster and uses a reading of the degree course documents from 1970 to the present day to identify and trace the history of this impact. The paper outlines, in particular, the development of the theoretical component of the course and argues that this component, known as contextual studies, has done little to address the impact of the new technologies and the radical paradigm shift from 'page' to 'screen'. It suggests that contextual studies should develop a more appropriate framework which would address these developments and details the content of one module 'Critical Theory' as a possible site for a more appropriate framework. In conclusion, it suggests that the Internet has greater potential than conventional teaching to deliver a more appropriate contextual studies programme; one which would also address the needs of graphic information design students into the 21st century.",

    "title": "Wearable performance",
    "abstract": "Wearable computing devices worn on the body provide the potential for digital interaction in the world. A new stage of computing technology at the beginning of the 21st Century links the personal and the pervasive through mobile wearables. The convergence between the miniaturisation of microchips (nanotechnology), intelligent textile or interfacial materials production, advances in biotechnology and the growth of wireless, ubiquitous computing emphasises not only mobility but integration into clothing or the human body. In artistic contexts one expects such integrated wearable devices to have the two-way function of interface instruments (e.g. sensor data acquisition and exchange) worn for particular purposes, either for communication with the environment or various aesthetic and compositional expressions. ‘Wearable performance’ briefly surveys the context for wearables in the performance arts and distinguishes display and performative/interfacial garments. It then focuses on the authors' experiments with ‘design in motion’ and digital performance, examining prototyping at the DAP-Lab which involves transdisciplinary convergences between fashion and dance, interactive system architecture, electronic textiles, wearable technologies and digital animation. The concept of an ‘evolving’ garment design that is materialised (mobilised) in live performance between partners originates from DAP Lab's work with telepresence and distributed media addressing the ‘connective tissues’ and ‘wearabilities’ of projected bodies through a study of shared embodiment and perception/proprioception in the wearer (tactile sensory processing). Such notions of wearability are applied both to the immediate sensory processing on the performer's body and to the processing of the responsive, animate environment.",

    "abstract": "Practice-based research for the PhD thesis Ephemeral architectures: the body and landscape in augmented reality includes experimentation in the creation of installation environments and the synthesis of moving image and virtual structures. This experimentation both acts as a proof-of-concept demonstration of theoretical principles, and provides actual material on which to reflect in order to adjust and modify theory. This article describes the installation Choreography of the Void, which focuses on issues of why and how augmented environments lead to a re-situation of the body through the fusion of spatial configurations, in the slippage of the boundary between the body, the organic, and visual representation. Conventionally, only the fixed is regarded as substantial and the moving is disqualified as accidental; but the augmented-reality installation can invert this condition, making a land scape of spatial constructs and relationships in which stability is accidental and movement substantial.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper takes an interaction design approach to explore how children perceive augmented toys, assign symbolic meaning, and perform pretence socially in technology-mediated playing. We developed a system with three kinds of toys—each with distinct abstract appearances and audiovisual augmentation—based on several design decisions. An observational user study with thirty-two young children aged 3–7 years revealed that children utilized digital augmentation as a facilitator of pretending behaviour with the possibility for subjective interpretation while substituting an object for another. Digital augmentation was not only a social cue for children to respond by gathering together and negotiating socially for mutual pretence—it was also a hindrance by amplifying conflicts in a shared space. Our study empirically clarifies children’s cognition and behaviour in an interactive system for pretend play and provides broader insight for the design of an interface enriching symbolic interpretation and social interaction.",

    "title": "Agency as commitment to meaning: communicative competence in games",
    "abstract": "Agency has long been considered one of the core pleasures of interacting with digital games. Recent treatments of agency in games culture and game design have grown increasingly concerned with providing the player with limitless freedom to act. While this describes one form of pleasure, in narratively focused games it has the unfortunate consequence of pitting the agency of the player against the will of the designer. We contend that for narrative games it is valuable to refocus our definitions of agency on the notion of meaning, and propose a treatment of agency that emphasises communicative commitments. This form of agency draws on ideas from speech act theory, and relies on a degree of ‘communicative competence’ on the part of both the game designer and player in order to function. We discuss mechanisms for training players in the necessary literacies needed to commit to meanings in games, and provide an example analysis of a game that successfully accomplishes this task.",

    "abstract": "The role of women in games is changing, although the media and sometimes games designers have been slow to catch up with this. This paper argues that games are adopting a more gender-neutral approach and that in cases where this does not happen, players are taking matters into their own hands. Fan texts reappropriate the female in games to present a more playful aspect and the growing sociality of games, especially online games, means that designers are taking note where players find difficulty with gendered representations. At the same time the female gamer is becoming less of a trope as players accept more freely that men and women play a diverse selection of games that cannot be categorised by sex.",

For our presentation at SIGGRAPH 2004, we concentrate on three cases that make use of state-of-the-art technology in order to create specific bodily sensations.

With the use of mobile devices and sensing technologies, practitioners and researchers of ICT and ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) are paying attention to the planning and use of u-learning components to provide users more interactions with authentic learning objects in a real context. Meanwhile, English for specific purposes (ESP) with interaction design has been a focus in recent years; however, few ESP practitioners and researchers have explored fitness-related English with ubicomp. All of the users were satisfied with the use of the smart phones and scanning of QR codes on the machines in the fitness centre to develop their reading comprehension of fitness-related English. Finally, a learning design model for Fitness English reading with u-learning components was developed and elaborated from designers' perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents Compensating Scaling, an advanced method for changing the dimensions of glyphs. Working with MM fonts that have a weight axis, the ‘boldness’ information is used to compensate for changes in stroke weight caused by the scaling. The method helps to create true small caps, Cyrillic lowercase and – since the horizontal and vertical scale factors can be chosen independently – even true condensed fonts. Comparisons to existing typefaces show that the output generated by the model is rather close to that of the true glyphs. In contrast to ‘intelligent’ data formats the model suggested here is a technology-independent formula for the processing of pre-existing shapes. The output has the same format as the input and can be subsequently processed, making the method a tool for the automation of a specific design step rather than a stand-alone technology.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interactive costumes enrich performance concepts and means of artistic expression. However, their creation challenges costume designers and technicians because they demand expertise in interaction design and electronic engineering. This article aims at empowering performance professionals to exploit the full potential of interactive costumes by discussing the creation process from the creators’ perspectives. Insights from expert interviews highlight that costume design combined with interaction design underlies the profile of interactive costume designers, whilst costume construction combined with electronic engineering underlies the profile of interactive costume technicians. Together, these profiles are capable of creating interactive costumes if complemented with expertise in e-textiles and body-centred design and development approaches. The findings suggest that teamwork between disciplines is essential, resulting ideally in transcending disciplinarity through shared practices, and using diverse methods, materials, and knowledge. All of this might evoke a paradigm shift in the practice and education of costume creators and other respective professions.",

Both cognitive psychology and communication theory offer great insight into the evolution of human cognisance and provide pointers to models with which the activity of musical improvisation could be interpreted. In the course of this paper I have tried to relate academic concepts and theories to material gleaned from improvising musicians, giving credence to their opinions and drawing inference from their experiences.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Storytelling plays an important role in early childhood education. Advances in digital technology have allowed storytelling to expand into shared and collaborative experiences. While mobile apps have enabled children to engage in creating digital stories, there has been relatively limited research on how children create and engage in digital storytelling experiences in ‘in the wild’ mobile environments. In this study, we developed Animation Kit, a digital storytelling application that enables children to create and share short and simple animated stories. We conducted a thematic analysis on a random sample of 200 animations submitted to the app's gallery and conducted semi-structured interviews with three heavy users to gain insights into their creative appropriation, sharing, and collaboration behaviours. Our analysis revealed several interesting forms of appropriation of sharing and collaboration and strong demand for communication. Based on the insights gained through data analysis, we propose design implications for digital storytelling platforms, such as a nonlinear storytelling approach contests and an asset-sharing system that empowers users to share their creations with others and one that can maintain a history of user edits.",

    "abstract": "This study employed a qualitative approach to obtaining an in-depth and holistic understanding of reminiscing in the elderly. Inviting elders as participants, this investigation aimed for full descriptions of individual cases, while also attempting to identify general trends and significant patterns among them. This empirical study comprises a two-year research project. The first year involves an exploratory study, including surveying the related literature and identifying key concepts. During the second year, this study designed a ‘Story Frame’, and conducted case studies and qualitative interviews. Story Frame is an artefact to record the vocalised responses of elderly subjects when viewing photos of the past. To better understand digital material regarding reminiscing in simple form, this study establishes conditions to identify families to participate in three studies using Story Frame. The results indicate that sharing the recorded audio-photos can trigger further conversations. By successfully catalysing embodied and social interaction, reminiscence can establish self-identity, improve social connectedness and create feelings of well-being.",

We draw inspiration from the ability of interactive art technology to merge electronics into artifacts whose aesthetics are shaped by their craft components.

Therefore, we developed an interactive art-making program for seniors at local assisted-living facilities aimed to enhance cognitive engagement, social connectedness and sense of well-being in older adults.

    "abstract": "Dutch artists Erwin Driessens and Maria Verstappen work with generative techniques in a range of media, from digital imaging and software to sculpture and robotics. In their own words, they pursue “an activity that explores the unseen, the unthought and the unknown”. To this end they create rich, elegant, self-constraining generative systems, which draw on, and re-engineer, techniques from the field of artificial life. This paper sets out a critical survey of the artists’ generative work, and shows how their application of a-life techniques destabilises, and enriches, some of the problematic aspects of those techniques. Specifically, where a-life frequently ignores complex morphogenetic processes, dematerialising them into a formal and instantaneous moment of genetic expression, the artists demonstrate the possibility and potential of richer, more complex and more ‘materialised’ models.",

This paper lays out the disciplinary contexts and development process for working across design and history disciplines, curricular organization, assignment process, and offers analysis of examples from student work. Additionally, this paper details how ‘Speculative Pasts’ offer a critique of the narrowness and problematic futurism of ‘speculative futures.’ Altogether, the authors offer this course and its primary project as a model for making history essential, rather than supplementary, to design and for leveraging practice-based production as a valued mode of historical inquiry.",

    "abstract": "As a result of technological advancements in performance practice, I am arguing that new liminal spaces exist where there is a potential for a reconfiguration of creativity and experimentation in performance practice. Within my current research I explore performance practices which explode the margins between the physical and virtual and what is seen as dominant traditional art practices and innovative technical experimentation. Blue Bloodshot Flowers (2001) is one of a series of experimental performance projects which explores and examines this physical/virtual interface from the audience but also from the performer's perspective.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The paper focuses on the concept of technical word or technical text having similar meaning to the concept of technical image defined by the Czech media theorist Vilém Flusser, who described the change in visual media from traditional to mechanical, digital or technology dependent. To justify the possibility of a similar term in linguistic arts, the ideas about the involvement of various technical devices in (literary) writing are discussed. The paper begins with Ada Byron’s insights that meaning can be calculated. In addition, speed is discussed as a determinant of the characteristics of writing influenced by the mechanical algorithm-based typewriter along with a possibility to manipulate, which relates to writing on a computer. Finally, the paper presents the most recent version of technical literary words telling how natural languages are rejected as the main medium and programming languages are used as the sign systems.",

    "abstract": "The social, ecological and technological challenges, starting on the scale of a small-scale city block to the megapolises and further, force us to rethink the user agency in design. What is needed is a Copernican Revolution that will question the centrality of the user and the human and offer a more balanced model for interaction between different agencies, that is more sensitive to the issues of sustainability, co-dependence and symbiosis which we face within such complex and hybrid systems. One way to go is to rethink the early phenomenological concepts of a subject that is more tightly connected and even defined by its environment (Lifeworld, Dasein). Another approach is to thematise the possibilities and limits of non-human agency and define design in terms of creating new networks and assemblages as described by science technology studies (STS) and posthumanist philosophy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents the key components required to properly understand remote creative interactions associated with three collective design stages: co-definition; the ideas co-production; and the co-evaluation in the formulation of a design concept. We compare five brainstorming modalities: traditional brainstorming—graphical interaction, reverse brainstorming, brainwriting and brainsketching—adopted by six delocalised teams working through a cloud computing environment. We analyse: co-authoring production; the ratio of ideas production according to task-goal; and the variation of brainstorming modalities. Our results show that designers work on brainstorming modalities according to the task-goal assigned, and we see that task content and the verbal and graphical communicative modes are supported by the proposed computational environment; as well as all brainstorming modalities. Because co-authoring or collective sketching are hardly possible without verbal communication support in graphical production, we propose the use of these new cloud computing functionalities to enhance the distributed design work.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article discusses the research findings from a year-long investigation funded by a Digital R&D for the Arts grant. The overarching aims of this research project were to understand how arts and cultural organisations can access mixed-reality environments and digital technology for creative play and learning, and how they can enable children and young people to access meaningful digital realm engagement. The article starts by introducing the underlying philosophical and cognitive framework built from embodiment philosophy, gaming theory and digital pedagogy that helped the research team determine what was meant by meaningful engagement in mixed reality. This is woven into an analysis of the four action-research case studies, followed by a discussion on the potential future areas for investigation. The conclusion evaluates how the resultant Pop Up Play product (free software download, supporting materials and bespoke digital creative play framework http://thesparkarts.co.uk/popupplay/) can be considered an environment for communications skill development, innovative thinking and immersive exploration through experiential play.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Drawing on research conducted in ten Norwegian households, this article describes the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing regulations have had on the research design and, consequently, on research data. The article describes how the research design had to be adapted to a variety of containment measures that were imposed during the fieldwork, and how this has influenced the researchers’ rapport with informants and access to the field and the challenges that emerged. It also describes a more active role for the participants in the study, whose agency was enhanced. The article proposes a new way of approaching fieldwork in homes adopting ‘methodological improvisation’ and concludes with recommendations for future research, proposing digital ethnography methods as both an option that enables data collection during a pandemic and as a sustainable alternative to certain methodologies that belong to traditional ethnography.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Innovations in digital cultural communication for museums challenge us to develop appropriate methods for participation in curatorial processes and to rethink the role of audiences inside exhibitions. The article explores the potentials of scaffolding sites of dialogue and creative engagement through the design process and final exhibition. It draws upon experiences from an interactive exhibition project, Digital Natives, in which we combined principles from Participatory Design with issues of contemporary digital culture to explore possibilities for creating heritage innovation. We suggest three critical stages of the dialogic design process in which engagement between stakeholders, researchers, and audiences can be central to shaping and transforming future conceptions of digital cultural heritage, through process and final exhibition. In this way, we argue that a participatory design anthropological approach to digital culture can expand opportunities for heritage innovation through technological means of engagement in museums.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effectiveness of participatory design study in rendering the students' capability of producing innovative design solutions to problems with uncertainties with which the students have no prior experience. At the project, the students were given a case to work on augmented reality technology with which they had no previous experience and design a tactical interface for sailing boats, a field they had no competence in. While the students were asked to develop proposals for this design problem with which they were inexperienced, a two-stage study was conducted to enable them to produce ideas on the topic. This paper discusses the impacts of such a participatory method in terms of design education. At the end of our study, it was observed that the students were positively influenced by the process in which they worked collaboratively with an expert user group.",

Although the field has developed rudimentary tools for accounting for subjective aspects of chronic pain that have gained widespread acceptance, more tools are increasingly needed, especially as medicine tends toward more patient-centred approaches. The project described is in preliminary, conceptual development. It is a visualisation tool that accounts for important, subjective aspects of pain: type, intensity, duration, and when it is possible to do so, location. The nature of communicating difficult, highly subjective experiences by patients and the ability of physicians to interpret them demand a new methodological approach, as outlined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The designation ‘computer artist’ seems to carry little meaning these days. Observing that computers permeate artists' daily lives is hardly news. Observing artists fulfilling their creative role by entering into collaborations with computer programmers or heading up teams of technical experts to support the electronic needs of their multi-media, interactive, or installation work is common place. But observing artists who program in the strict sense of the word, by writing code in a symbolic language to implement algorithms, is still enough of a novelty that it continues to raise questions about what it truly means to say that an artist is a person who is “skilled in the creation of aesthetic works”. Based on practical experience writing computer programs to output aesthetic imagery, I outline what I believe it means for a programmer-artist to be creative.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over 30 computational scientists, designers, artists, and activists collaboratively performed eight Museum of Random Memory workshops and exhibitions from 2016 to 2018. Here, we explore how the framework of ‘experimentation’ helped us analyze our own iterative development of techniques to foster critical data literacy. After sketching key aspects of experimentation across disciplines, we detail moments within where researchers tweaked, observed, tested, reflected, and tweaked again. This included changing scale, format, and cultural context; observing how people responded to digital versus analog memory-making activities; modifying prompts to evoke different conversations among participants about how future memories might be imagined or read by future archeologists; and finding creative ways to discuss and trouble ethics of data sharing. We conclude that coopting some of the techniques typical in natural science laboratories can prompt scholar activists to continuously recalibrate their processes and adjust interactions as they build pedagogical strategies for fostering critical data literacy in the public sphere.",

    "title": "Let the games begin: social media and creative citizenship during London’s Olympic #savethesurprise campaign",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper analyzes #savethesurprise, the hugely successful social media campaign launched prior to the London 2012 Olympic Games. In brief, #savethesurprise helped to persuade over 100,000 audience members not to divulge on social media any of what they saw during the two, live dress rehearsals of the Games’ opening ceremony; this ceremony then went on to become a part of the most watched television event in history. To explore how and why the campaign worked, this paper introduces the concept of ‘architectures of participation’ (AoP). AoP are socio-technical structures and practices that shape the ways in which people and organizations co-construct events and realities via communication. By applying this concept to the #savethesurprise campaign, this paper presents a participatory architecture undergirded by strong legal, technical and social layers. Furthermore, a sense of creative citizenship and fair play emerge as key audience motivators.",

    "title": "Good grief: the role of social mobile media in the 3.11 earthquake disaster in Japan",
    "abstract": "While the deployment of social mobile media expands earlier modes of civic engagement and media, it also departs from previous media by providing various modes of networked visual and aural communication with greater affective personalisation. In news media of late, much has been touted about the agency of social and mobile media in the events of political uprising or at times of natural disasters and crisis management. While these events didn't happen because of social media, the media did impact upon how we experienced the situation. This leads us to ask: just how helpful are social mobile media in maintaining relationships in times of crisis management and how, if at all, do they depart from previous media and methods? Drawing from case studies conducted with participants living in Tokyo at the time of the horrific events surrounding Japan's earthquake and tsunami disaster of 11 March 2011 (3.11), as well as a historical discussion of media usage in times of crisis in Japan, this article reflects upon the role of new media in helping, if at all, people manage crisis and grief. We argue that while social media provides new channels for affective cultures in the form of mobile intimacy, it also extends upon earlier media practices and rituals such as the postcard.",

    "abstract": "Logic programming provides ways of composing time-based generative art that has great advantages for art practice. It is very concise and productive in enabling thinking at the structural level. Furthermore, it is relatively natural to extend the method to unify interactive work and, with the help of metarules, interactive work that performs differently over time according to experience. As the artwork learns, it changes the way that it develops rather than simply the way that it employs stimulus-response rules. The learning interactive video construct is an art system that evolves in response to the interpretation of participant interaction with the work by a software agent. It was developed from video constructs, which are computer animations where a computer program provides the underlying structure that generates the work. It is possible to add meta-rules, which use the history of interactions between participants and the work to modify its performance. By analysing the interactions in real-time, the system applies meta-rules as it learns from experience about human reaction to it.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article will address the question of how fiction films are individuated in terms of image quality on the grounds of the recording technology used. As new cost-effective digital recording technologies are introduced to the marketplace, this becomes a salient issue to understand for producers and production teams. In order to define cameras’ image quality capacities, three almost identical short fiction film sequences were tested on a young audience in a comparative blind test. Surprisingly, the result unambiguously showed that most viewers preferred the film recorded on an iPhone. Based on Barbara Maria Stafford's theoretical framework on the cognitive work of images and theories that concern ecological moving image theory, the analysis of this article aims to explain the reception study's result by illuminating the sublime and ambiguous figure–ground constellation of the iPhone video and its cognitive ramifications.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes new research into the use of evolutionary ecosystem models as tools for creative artistic discovery. We give a brief history of the use of artificial evolution in the arts, and discuss difficulties with interactive and optimisation-based approaches to creativity. We present an approach based on evolutionary ecosystemic models. We propose that evolutionary ecosystemic models are capable of (i) driving the evolution of interesting novel interactive behaviour in a population of agents, (ii) exhibiting stimulating global dynamics which make them a suitable medium for artistic exploration and experience, and (iii) offering radically new ways to interact with complex dynamical software systems. We show three studies using evolutionary ecosystemic models in creative domains, demonstrating the potential for ecosystem dynamics to drive the emergence of novel behaviour. The benefits and challenges of these models are discussed, leading to a proposed framework for developing more sophisticated creative ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ubiquitous music (ubimus) frameworks imply a flexible approach to the design, implementation and deployment of networked resources, featuring characteristics that challenge current conceptual groundings of music-making. As a potentially unifying place-holder for post-2020 musical practices enabled by ubiquitous technologies, musical stuff presents specific potentialities and caveats. We discuss the requirements for ubimus technological designs and analyze the possibilities and problems of adopting ‘stuff’ as a theoretical construct for ubimus endeavours. Several case scenarios tied to specific qualities are described, addressing aspects such as volatility, antirivalry, semantic strategies and fluidity, targeting the deterritorialization of resources and the application of aesthetic pliability. We highlight the challenges presented by the disruptive tendencies of fast or socially brittle technological change, with particular attention to the monetization of network assets. Stuff is proposed as nonrival, genre-neutral and pliable material for the development of a community-oriented musical internet.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social networks are important communication channel where individuals and emergency agencies can exchange information during disasters. The ability to detect disaster information or ‘reporting’ tweets would provide many advantages in disaster management during crowded events. This study explores Twitter behaviour during the Mina stampede tragedy in the 2015 Hajj by processing tweets posted over seven days during and after the incident (24–30 September 2015). Statistical features were derived from tweets, such as the number of hashtags, user mentions, and links, to provide an overview of the use of Twitter during this disaster. A classification model was built to filter reporting tweets using two Arabic natural language processing tools: Farasa and MADAMIRA. A support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel generated the best results in both tools (F-score: 88%–89%). The results will be useful to those who manage large, crowded events such as Hajj in Arabic-speaking regions.",

The introduction of code-based design practices in the design studio has altered this balance, introducing new models of joint authorship and new ways for individuals to contribute to co-authored projects. This paper presents a case study describing four design studios in a higher education setting that used code as a tool for generating architectural geometry. The format of the studios encouraged the students to reflect critically on their role as authors and to creatively address the multiple opportunities for shared authorship available with code-based production. The research question addressed in this study involved the role of code-based practices in altering the model of architectural education in the design studio, in particular the role of visual representations of a code-based design process in the production of shared knowledge.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The parameter space offered by neural network image synthesis offers a creative environment that is little understood and quite literally emergent. In an attempt to come to terms with this space, an artist enters into an improvisational reflection on ‘neural painting’, made possible with what are called style transfer algorithms (Gatys, Leon A., Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. 2015. “A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.” ArXiv: 1508.06576 [Cs, q-Bio], August. http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) Artistic painting offers access to transitional states existing at the interstices of expression and reflection in the creative process. Of all the conceptual dimensions offered by neural style transfer models (where the ‘content’ of one source is blended with the ‘style’ of another), the convolutional blending of ‘content weight’ offers a fertile metaphor for artistic painting phenomenology, providing a tool for the investigation of stylistic schema in the iterative, improvisational movement from concept to representation. A preliminary phenomenological framework describing the process of neural painting is developed, offering an art-as-research perspective on intersubjectively positioned creativity support technology.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Designers desire to sketch their concepts and produce prototypes in a real-time setting. This study developed a virtual reality (VR) supported lighting sketch tool for vehicle interior designers. The tool incorporated lighting design with drag-and-drop functionality and high-definition vehicle rendering. The tool also used the Wizard-of-Oz method to help design participants easily immerse themselves into the design tasks. Six designers participated in two consecutive hour-long design workshops to evaluate the design tool. Each designer sketched eight scenarios, and the workshop gathered 48 design outcomes. In addition, a thirty-minute post-interview evaluated usability, the immersive experience of the virtual environment, and the expected role of the wizard. Finally, thematic coding was used on both workshop and post-interview verbal records to further evaluate the tool's compatibility. As a result, three vital roles of the tool were identified. First, the tool encouraged the iteration process. The tool also gave realistic design-practice experiences and would be suitable for sketching lighting in the workplace. Finally, the tool allowed designers to immerse themselves in the design space. This research anticipates a well-illustrated virtual context and situations that invite designers into an inspirational lighting design workplace.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Media architecture community systematically explores the potentials of computation and digital media to intervene in form-finding, fabrication of buildings and urban data collection processes. Combining social media topic modelling techniques with the review of media architecture-related literature, I discuss methods to locate the media architecture community in social media, conduct initial discourse analysis and pursue a deeper investigation of the topics addressed by community. In the literature, media architecture is presented as an interactive set of technologies for a participative public life. And yet, while a dynamic facade increases possibilities for participation and creative expression, it also facilitates reframing participation as a technical problem. I position optimization and efficiency in media architecture discourse as a form of optimism and offer insights into its political implications. I propose to rethink the shortcut between optimism and optimization by tracing conceptual and professional relations that inform media architecture.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents the remediation of a nineteenth century Korean manuscript (the 1809 Uigwe) as an interactive digital experience using creative algorithms and gesture recognition developed by LG Electronics. The interactive media project we created using sound visualization invites visitors to jointly experience Joseon’s royal music and the manuscript’s pictorial illustrations. We present the media development process and the results of a survey assessing users’ engagement. Our findings show that technological remediation can be a fruitful way to elicit interest for cultural heritage. The Uigwe media project enhanced the participants’ curiosity for the 1809 Uigwe, and the added sound of the traditional court music (Yeominlak) and the images of the musical instruments increased users’ understanding of the 1809 Uigwe and of royal court music. Overall, the study provides evidence about the use of multisensory digital media for fostering learning about and cultural appreciation of historical artefacts.",

    "title": "Audio-augmented arboreality: wildflowers and language",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Before colonization, there were over 250 languages spoken in Australia. Today only thirteen Indigenous languages are still being taught to children). Language has an important part to play in cultural maintenance and ‘closing the gap’ in terms of First Peoples’ cultural heritage, identity, and sense of belonging. In this work, we aim to develop an engaging and easy way to teach and learn the local Indigenous names of wildflowers using a mobile device. This paper presents the development of a phone application that runs on a local machine, recognizes local wildflowers through its camera, and plays associated sounds and displays associated text in the Noongar language. The prototype mobile application has been developed with MobileNets model on the TensorFlow platform. The dataset is derived from Google searches, while the sound files are generated from label text by running an apple script. UI and interactivity have been developed by using Vuforia and the Unity game engine. Finally, the Android Studio is used to deploy the app. At this point in time, the prototype can only recognize ten local flowers, with 85%∼99% of accuracy. We are working with a larger dataset towards developing the full application.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article investigates the role of social and technological factors in enabling sustainable creative participation in online environments. To facilitate a deeper understanding of these dynamics, I describe and analyse the implementation of a creative participatory project across three online platforms: as a series of tasks on Mechanical Turk, as a public collaboration on hitRECord, and as a participatory online course on Peer 2 Peer University. In discussing the three implementations, particular attention is paid to the norms and hierarchies of participation on each platform, the motivations driving participants to engage in online creative projects, and the significance of technological features in supporting the aims and ethos of participation in each case. This comparative analysis allows for a better understanding of the factors that facilitate or, conversely, hinder participatory creativity online, contributing to contemporary discussions aiming to explicate the parameters of creative participation and collaboration in online projects.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper discusses improvisatory musical interactions between a musician and a machine. The focus is on duet performances, in which a human pianist and the Controlling Interactive Music (CIM) software system both perform on mechanized pianos. It also discusses improvisatory behaviours, using reflexive strategies in machines, and describes interfaces for musical communication and control between human and machine performers. Results are derived from trials with six expert improvising musicians using CIM. Analysis reveals that creative partnerships are fostered by several factors. The reflexive generative system provides aesthetic cohesion by ensuring that generated material has a direct relationship to that played by the musician. The interaction design relies on musical communication through performance as the primary mechanism for feedback and control. It can be shown that his approach to musical human-machine improvisation allows technical concerns to fall away from the musician's awareness and attention to shift to the musical dialogue within the duet.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Drawing on my experience as a critical interlocutor within the AHRC research projects Live Notation: Transforming Matters of Performance (2012) and Weaving Codes | Coding Weaves (2014–2016), in this article, I propose a conceptual framework for considering the challenges and opportunities for kairotic improvisation within live coding, conceived as an embodied mode of imminent and immanent intervention and invention-in-the-middle, a practice of radical timing and timeliness. Expanding my previous reflections on kairotic coding [Cocker, Emma. (2014). “Live Notation: Reflections on a Kairotic Practice.” In Performance Research Journal, on Writing and Digital Media, edited by Jerome Fletcher and Ric Allsopp, 18 (5), 69–76. London: Routledge; Cocker, Emma. (2016). “Performing Thinking in Action: The Meletē of Live Coding.” International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media 12 (2): 102–116. Cocker, Emma. (2017). “Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves: Penelopean Mêtis and the Weaver-Coder’s Kairos.” Textile 15 (2): 124–141], in this article, I address the kairotic liveness within live coding’s improvisational performance by identifying two seemingly contradictory tendencies within this burgeoning genre. On the one hand, there is a call for improved media technologies enabling greater immediacy of semantic feedback supporting a faster, more fluid—perhaps even virtuoso—approach to improvisation. Alongside, there remains interest within the live coding community for a mode of improvisational performativity that harnesses the unpredictable, the unexpected or as-yet-unknown. Rather than regard these two tendencies in antagonistic relation, my intent is to invite further debate on how the development of intelligent machines might better facilitate improvisatory flow, without eradicating the critical intervals and in-between spaces necessary for creative invention and intervention, without smoothing away the points of technical resistance and intransigence which arguably form a part of live coding’s performative texture.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Many worlds’ is a short narrative live-action film written and directed so as to provide multiple linear routes through the plot to one of four endings, and designed for showing in a cinema environment. At two points during the film, decisions are made based on audience bio-signals as to which plot route to take. The use of bio-signals is to allow the audience to remain immersed in the film, rather than explicitly selecting plot direction. Four audience members have a bio-signal measured sensor for each person: ECG (heart rate), EMG (muscle tension), EEG (‘brain waves’) and Galvanic Skin Response (perspiration). The four are interpreted as a single average of emotional arousal. ‘Many worlds’ was the first live-action linear plotted film to be screened in a cinema to the general public utilizing multiple biosensor types. The film has been shown publically a number of times, and lessons learned from the technical and cinematic production are detailed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The way architects observe and interpret space influences the way they design. A conscious practice of observation of space through movement aims at extending the understanding of space from static and singular to transitory and temporal. Through the use of the moving image space can be captured in time, enabling the documentation of its lived experience and addressing qualities of subjectivity and temporality. Aimed at creating links between the built and the lived environment, the moving image is proposed as a tool that allows for the exploration of duration as another dimension of space. The subject is approached through a design-led project From Naples to Capri, a video installation that explores movement as another practice of architecture, and through theoretical investigations around issues of spatial performativity and Bergson’s understanding of duration. Filming is explored as a spatial practice that can potentially shift the role of the architect from a distant observer to an active participant of space, a performer who derives knowledge from the experience of place.",

    "title": "An acceptance model of digital education in intangible cultural heritage based on cultural awareness",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite the increasing application of digital education in intangible cultural heritage (ICH), user acceptance of digital technology needs further investigation. In this study, a mobile AR system for ICH education was developed to understand user acceptance of digital technology. This study developed a conceptual model and hypotheses based on cultural awareness, generic learning outcomes (GLOs), and the technology acceptance model, aiming to construct an appropriate digital learning model for ICH. The results of the study indicated that the reliability and validity of the measurement model were satisfactory. In addition, the importance of external variables was confirmed. Cultural awareness and GLOs affected users’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, perceived usefulness and ease of use had a positive effect on attitudes toward the use, which in turn had a positive effect on behavioural intention to use.",

    "abstract": "An emerging concept of a Digital Bauhaus is described, based around interdisciplinary practices and creative and socially useful products. A short history of the relevant aspects of the original Bauhaus is provided. Three ideas are developed with reference to both this history and contemporary issues. The first concerns a digital aesthetics or style and particularly how we can transcend the simple geometry typical of Bauhaus products. The second concerns the difficulties of genuine collaboration between the creative arts and technology. The third concerns the ethical and political responsibility of design in creating an environment that shapes the lives of others. In this, there is a need to go beyond the materialism of the Bauhaus period and to replace it with the idea of sustainability. The virtuality inherent in digital technologies makes this a distinct possibility.",

During the lockdowns, all movement were situated in the rhythms of the domestic and its infinite regresses of 'presence bleed' (Gregg [2011]. Work’s Intimacy. London: Polity.) – informal care of older parents and young children, the gendered nature of care work and its often invisible role as it convergences with uneven expectations around working from home (WFH) and home schooling. In June 2020 we developed an open call for responses to the Work, Care and Creativity Study (WCCS). The study sought to explore the lived experiences of primary carers who are also creative professionals working and caring from home (WCFH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Deploying creative practice techniques which use prompts (such as photos, drawing and creative writing responses) to elicit participant’s experiences and emotions, this study sought to render visible some of the overlooked experiences, perceptions and practices emerging over the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Verbal protocol methodologies have been used in a variety of research settings, and have, to some extent been used in music composition cognition studies. However, there has been little evaluation of such a research methodology. This paper discusses outcomes from a longitudinal single-case-study where immediately retrospective verbal reporting was combined with real-time digital data collection procedures. By triangulating data from computer ‘save-as’ files, transcription of the verbal protocol, semistructured interviews and verification sessions with the composer, it was possible to examine aspects of creative problem-solving and moments of insight in such activity. Mapping of the emerging structure was also possible and this, combined with analysis of procedures and strategies outlines in the verbal protocol, allowed a view into the compositional ‘flow’, and a resultant hypothetical model of composition process to be presented. Practical issues around the use of verbal protocol methodology are discussed.",

The primary objective of ID-Online was to deliver enhanced design instruction via asynchronous access to design resources and enhance network-based communication between instructors and students. This paper provides an historical overview of the development of ID-Online. It discusses two years of development, use and evaluations. It then leads into the authors' recent initiatives to advance the concept of a developing design community in the digital realm. The paper concludes with reflections on the benefit, and pedagogical pros and cons, of the use of asynchronous learning technologies in design education.",

Ekkomaten is an affectively engaging listening machine that lets people probe the narrative potential of Store Torv, in Aarhus, Denmark. Through its physical manifestation and conceptual framing, Ekkomaten offers an auditory and situated experience of the 18th century through six site-specific echoes that engage its users as protagonists in the exploration of an imagined narrative space emerging from the intersection of fact and fiction and the infra- and extraordinary. As an electronic design object, Ekkomaten points both back and forward in time, questioning our current understanding of the 18th century, science fiction's previous visions of the future, and current ideas about possible post-digital futures.",

    "title": "Narrative logic of enactive cinema:<i>Obsession</i>",
    "abstract": "Abstract The cinematic montage installation Obsession is unique with respect to its interaction method: how the story is told is not directed by any kind of conscious activity of the spectators, such as clicking interface elements with the mouse. Introducing the notion of enactive cinema the work emphasizes unconscious interaction between the cinema and the spectators as participants, referring to the idea of acting with and within an environment. In this solution the narrative flow is driven tacitly by the participants' heart rate and skin conductivity evolving in response to the events on the screen, and a detector of orientation in the installation space. The invitation to enact this way is very gentle. In the middle of the space there are five chairs to sit down. On the arm of each chair a red-lit shape of a hand attracts the spectator to place her hand on the built-in biosensors. Each participant's heart rate is continuously measured from her fingertip, and the emotionalarousalis captured from her palmin terms of skin conductance. The spectators' common contribution is collected for the input to the software in charge of the narrative flow. This article concentrates on the explication of the narrative logic of this installation inspired by the Eisensteinian ‘montage machine’, and leaves aside a number of details of its complete setup.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n Cities have long become interspaces, entangled in materialities and virtual worlds. However, as urban automation advances in cities increasingly made ‘smarter’, everyday processes are often controlled by oppressive standards hardcoded into technologies. Publicly neutralized as ‘objective’, corporately owned algorithmic architectures now function as urban gatekeepers. They determine social participation, possibilities of space appropriation on- and offline, and access to (social) infrastructures. Following five months of qualitative research on hacking and other tech-practices by German-speaking cyberfeminist collectives in 2021, my paper portrays their refusal of black-boxed, profitable, and biased technologies of classification. I argue that feminist hackspaces are important urban co-creators in digitized cities to come. They offer infrastructures to increase access to interfaces, (cyber-)spaces, and decision-making processes by sharing their tech-knowledge and tools. Their activism demonstrates how (urban) hacking is a crucial practice to break with non-democratically controlled digitalization processes: in favour of a city for all.",

    "title": "Form data as a resource in architectural analysis: an architectural distant reading of wooden churches from the Carpathian Mountain regions of Eastern Europe",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent research into architectural form analysis using deep learning (DL) methods has shown potential to identify features from large collections of building data, shedding new light into formal aspects of our built environment. As these methods begin to enter architectural, urban, and policy design contexts, it becomes important to develop critical approaches to employing them. In this paper, we document and reflect upon our efforts to create a custom dataset of 3-D models of 331 wooden churches located within the Carpathian Mountains of Eastern Europe, and to use DL methods to explore this dataset with the goal of revealing unexpected formal traits and advancing architectural scholarship on this subject. While existing scholarship groups them into four distinct stylistic categories, our analysis reveals stylistic overlaps, previously undetected micro styles, and shared architectural features. We posit the resulting analyses as an example of an ‘architectural distant reading’ that enriches our understanding of this architectural typology through an unprecedentedly detailed portrait of its formal characteristics based on a large architectural dataset. Crucially, drawing on recent developments in critical data and algorithm studies, we show how the dataset construction and subsequent analyses, and their results, were shaped by slow, manual data curation processes, methodological constraints, subjective decisions, and engagements with archives, domain experts. We thus illustrate how DL techniques might be contextualized for architectural studies in relation to other modes of knowledge and labour, and offer a detailed case study of state-of-the-art computational methods enriching established approaches to architectural form and historical analysis.",

With computational technology and sensors infiltrating many aspects of our lives and urban surroundings, interaction designers' ability to visualise and generate designs are important in order to understand and explore such design spaces. I propose three concepts—accessibility, immediacy and generation—as means for analysing movement as a design material for interaction design. Drawing on a social semiotics approach, contemporary choreographic research is studied where digital tools are used to generate, explicate and communicate interactive movement. I argue that by drawing on the particularities and potentials of the moving body as interface such as those explored through choreographic practice, we may avoid imitating existing exchanges with technology and create novel interactions.",

    "title": "Designs for learning and ludic engagement",
    "abstract": "Theories of learning and theories of play have to a large extent been separate fields in academic research. However, new communicative conditions make learners become not only consumers of information but also producers of information, active members of learning communities and for example players of online games. With new resources for communication, new demands and new possibilities are raised for learning. This article argues that there is a need for a new articulation of how we understand learning and in further discusses processes of engagement, meaning making and transformation of signs. The article will also present a design theoretic perspective on learning, related to the question of play and ludic engagement. The concluding remark is that borders between the fields of learning and play are no longer meaningful to uphold.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) and the automation of creative work have received little attention in craft education. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service craft teachers’ and teacher educators’ (N = 15) insights into the potential benefits and challenges of AI, particularly text-to-image generative AI. This study implemented a hands-on workshop on creative making with text-to-image generative AI in order to stimulate discourses and capture imaginaries concerning generative AI. The results revealed that making with AI inspired teachers to consider the unique nature of crafts as well as the tensions and tradeoffs of adopting generative AI in craft practices. The teachers identified concerns in data-driven design, including algorithmic bias, copyright violations and black-boxing creativity, as well as in power relationships, hybrid influencing and behaviour engineering. The article concludes with a discussion of the complicated relationships the results uncovered between creative making and generative AI.",

Datascape is a geographic storytelling and visualisation platform that supports the telling of locative narratives by artists, researchers, educators and community groups. In this paper, the guiding principles of the project are discussed in relation to the theme of the conference, ‘After Media’.1 The suggestion is that we think of this term not as a time beyond the demise of some particular media, but instead consider the term after-media as an approach where the goals of a new medium are made explicit in relation to its historical foundations and practices. The goals and trajectories of the Datascape project are discussed within the scope of mobile and locative media.",

Three works are discussed here: After Image, a series of digitally manipulated photographs which visualise phantoms described by people who have had limbs amputated. This was my first formal collaboration with scientists. ‘I’, a subsequent series of digitally manipulated photographs, made in collaboration with people with congenital disabilities, is concerned with dissolution of the perceived distinction between the ‘normal’, and the ‘other’ (disabled or deformed), body. Lastly, Face Value is an interactive computer installation, made in collaboration with scientist Dr. Alf Linney, and designed to invite its audience to consider the automatic and unconscious judgements each of us makes about character based on (facial) appearance. Despite its dependence on digital technologies, my work remains adamantly physical.",

Inspired by the playful collaboration between arts and sciences embodied by the experimental creations of the French literary group OuLiPo, we borrow from physics and mathematics the concept of self-avoiding random walk to create original poems. This model is adapted here to generate random poems through potentially infinite combinations of a finite set of verses distributed on a virtual two-dimensional grid. The highly versatile algorithm we designed allows to randomly generate unexpected poems and provide, for each, a unique path with the graphical representation of a random walk.",

Concepts of interactivity in art and music are explored, and then an overview of different types of Internet-based art is presented. A number of different ways in which Internet search have the potential to underpin artistic and musical activity are then discussed, with ideas such as the idea of a collective readymade and aesthetics of mass and unexpected connections are used to give this discussion a theoretical basis. Finally, a case study is given, in which the author discusses one of his own multimedia artworks that makes substantial use of Internet search.",

    "title": "The uncertainty of the mass image: logistics and behaviours",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The question of uncertainty raised in this special issue raises issues for the image as truthful, the truth that viewers can claim to find in images and the ethical dimensions of truth. By tracing some key changes in the history of photography, this paper demonstrates that the mass production and especially mass storage and distribution of images create a new condition for the image. This condition asserts that the purpose of the totality of the mass image as it now exists in databases is a mode of truth which alters earlier ontological, epistemological and ethical claims for certainty. Rather than propose a return to the humanistic privilege of the individual image, the paper suggests that a new politics of truth is demanded by the new condition of the mass image.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper describes a case study in the form of The Batwa, 1905, an electronic ‘chapter’ of the From Silver to Silicon CD‐ROM, and examines some of the theoretical issues arising from the re‐use of archive photographs and the representation of marginalised cultural groups in the multimedia context. The project stems from a photograph, taken by Sir Benjamin Stone, of the Batwa pygmies who visited London in 1905. Not only were the Batwa examined in the framework of scientific anthropological study, but they were also put on the stage of the London Hippodrome as a form of public entertainment. In this context, as well as in the framework of multimedia production, the blends of objectivity and popularism, anthropology and entertainment are considered in the paper.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have seen a rapid increase in the number and variety of technologies embedded in and passing through home environments. Researchers increasingly recognize the distinct nature of the home as a site of research. The past four decades have seen a significant shift in the technology environment from the ‘media home’ (Spigel 2001) to the ‘smart home’ (Woods 2021). We have seen significant additions to the abundant digital ecology of the home, increasing the number of digital access-points and available services, and intensifying the data-circulation in connected homes. The home is a site of mundane, private, usually hidden but highly significant everyday practices (Pink et al. 2017). Yet it is also increasingly becoming a part of national healthcare infrastructures through the deployment of welfare technologies, and energy policy through smart meters. During the ‘global lockdown’ caused by the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, technologies took a prominent role as the home transformed itself into a site in which activities such as learning, parenting, work, entertainment, and remote medical care intermingled. The increasing complexity of the digital infrastructures and the experiences, spaces, visions of the home in a current era of connected homes and connected living pose particular challenges for conducting research in such an environment. This also calls for methodological innovations that shape how we see the home as a research site and how we engage with it. For this special issue, we invite contributions that make a strong methodological contribution by highlighting the innovations and challenges of conducting research on technology in home environments. Papers could, for example:",

    "title": "An internet of old things",
    "abstract": "This paper reflects upon the temporal characteristics of the emerging phenomenon known as the ‘Internet of Things’. As objects become individually tagged with unique identities through the addition of small electronic chips or bar codes, their history is recorded and made available to others across a network. The advent of this ever-growing catalogue of histories means that every object will be ‘in touch’ with its current and previous owner at all times and suggests that while we as owners might like to ‘forget’ about an object, we will never truly be detached from them. However the author suggests that there exists a social and cultural inertia that is tied to a teleological perception of time and that the weight of this is hampering opportunities for the Internet of Things to embrace old things. The paper uses a series of cultural coordinates to explore our relationship with personal and social histories including the use of cosmetic surgery to correct hereditary characteristics and films from the last five years that demonstrate a more creative approach to understanding the past. Ultimately the author uses a research project that he is involved in to explore the potential for digital technology to network the past and develop an ‘Internet of Old Things’.",

    "abstract": "Traditional forms of art making practice have become more complex in this culture that increasingly relies on, and is fascinated by, computer technology and the Internet. The web has facilitated an incredible, often overwhelming amount of information that is multidimensional and multi-contextual, offering artists global connections. A new dialectic however, is emerging as artists approach their work from positions of both manual creators and digital selves. The dialectic raises issues and questions such as: How does the hands-on engagement with artists’ materials interchange with digital manipulation capabilities facilitated by a computer mouse? What do the artists have to say about an art practice that straddles real and virtual contexts? Using conversations with six visual artists of varying age and career levels, this paper begins to explore how digital technologies and cyberspace are affecting hand-made art processes, while highlighting the artists’ perceptions of how these new contexts are enveloping their practices. Issues of researching ideas on the web, integrating digital processes with hand drawn images and the seduction of digital manipulation programs and computer capabilities frame the artists’ conversations.",

    "abstract": "Is computation altering how humans conceive of themselves and their relations to others? In Talan Memmott's literary hypertext Lexia to perplexia, subjectivity is the product of recursive cycles between humans and intelligent machines. To develop this vision, Memmott uses a variety of techniques, including an idiosyncratic pseudo-language comprised of coding expressions combined with English words, classical myths rewritten using technological terms and images, and screen designs that invite the reader to understand herself as a permeable membrane through which information flows. A prominent feature of screen design is occluded text–words and symbols overwritten with other text so that they are only partially visible. This strategy serves to remind the reader that she is not the only parser of this text; the machine also parses it. In contrast to the partial reading available to the human reader, for the machine all the layers of code are operationally coherent and functionally clear. In this context reading becomes a cyborg activity, a practice that involves both human and non-human cognisers.",

    "title": "Practice as research in performance: from epistemology to evaluation",
    "abstract": "Questions about the values of practice as research have steadily risen up the research agenda of the creative arts in British universities since the early 1990s. As American practitioner-scholar Richard Schechner writes: the relationship between studying performance and doing performance is integral (Schechner 2002 1). Yet, where are the differences between thinking and doing, interpreting and making, conceptualisation and creativity located? Are there special conceptual spaces for practice as research per se or do we need rather to consider more broadly the terms ‘writing’ and ‘research’? What kind of academy do we wish to create? This paper focuses on the work of PARIP during the past two years. It introduces the project and contextualises it with a number of observations on the intellectual directions the project is taking, in consultation and collaboration with the range of artist-scholars in the UK and selected EU institutions. Jointly prepared by PARIP Director Baz Kershaw and postdoctoral Research Associate Angela Piccini this paper is characterised by dialectical interventions that we hope point to the range of thinking both within the project itself and beyond to the various PARIP communities in dance, film, television and drama.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the history of modern society several grand projects have been launched in an attempt to unite the two sides of the Enlightenment project: the hard (technology and natural sciences) with the soft (values, democracy, art and ethics). One remarkable such project was the Bauhaus. It was a great modern success story, but also a failure. Today, in the digital age we can witness new more post‐modern attempts to meetings between ‘art’ and ‘technology’. This emerging ‘third culture’ of nerds and digerati is promising, but still most immature. With this background, the paper is formed as a general manifesto for a digital Bauhaus for the twenty‐first century, and at the same time an introduction to the attempts to implement this vision of creative and socially useful digital design at the School of Art and Communication at Malmo University in Sweden.",

Marina’s Garden is a multilayered narrative space following an associative poetic structure representing the inner landscape of an emigrant poet, Marina. The garden of memories also challenges the participant viewer to become a subject of dreaming, remembering and responsibility in an intimate relationship with the poet. Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of dialogue, Sigmund Freud’s early psychoanalytic metaphors of mind and Friedrich Hölderlin’s notions of the concept ‘caesura’ are presented in this short artist’s point-of-view as the conceptual tools creating the conditions for the narrative experience.",

By dialogue between Lee and researcher Niki Pollard who observed the making of Passage, the paper reflects on a choreographic specificity to Lee's seeing, and speculates on processes of ‘delving’ in her choreography that spill-over into the making of the website.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article outlines and demonstrates the practice of troubleshooting as a method. We argue that as an interdisciplinary, collaborative, digital-hybridized and adaptable approach, troubleshooting provides an ethical opportunity to explore the experiences and outcomes of (older) people living with connected home technologies in ways that deliver novel and meaningful research insights. Our discussion draws on the experience of a project that worked with ageing people (70+) to tailor and explore their experiences with smart home devices to support their independence and wellbeing. A personalized suite of digital voice assistants (DVAs), robotic vacuum cleaners, smart lights, kettles and switches were installed into the domestic spaces and routines of 23 households and 33 participants living in rural Australia. The project team developed a methodological framework, which took an unplanned and innovative turn in response to the physical distancing challenges brought by COVID-19 lockdowns, with the social connectivity offered by the devices trialled, and the creative digital living skills between the project team and its participants. We conclude by identifying future areas of research at the intersection of smart technologies, aged care services and the home as a site of research and of ongoing methodological design.",

    "title": "Practical approaches towards interactivity in soundscape composition",
    "abstract": "Abstract The article discusses the role of technology in integrating acoustic instruments within soundscape composition in a live and interactive context, thus encouraging an engagement with the sonic environment. The approaches to two compositions that combine instruments with live electronics and pre-composed soundscapes – Cold Wood (bass trombone) and Arcando (alto saxophone) – are considered. These pieces create unique live performance scenarios in order to investigate how acoustic instruments might be positioned within, and reframed by, soundscape composition practice. Potential pitfalls inherent in mixed media works are explored, proposing technological solutions through sound processing and use of microphones, whilst ensuring that 'liveness' remains more aesthetic than procedural. Aspects of field recording practice influence the behaviour of the instruments, and improvisation is encouraged in both pieces to ensure unpredictability. Consequently, it is also proposed that the process of listening to, capturing, and processing the sound of the instrument in a live performance scenario is analogous to the practice of field recording, in which there is little control over the sound events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents an approach to teaching interactive digital design that fuses traditional cinematic techniques in the treatment of screen space with the programming capabilities of Macromedia Flash to create web-based narrative systems that allow the user to create a unique and emotionally rewarding experience from a set of provided data ingredients. In this context designers are more like architects than authors, constructing a database of narrative possibilities that exist within the framework of a conceptual environment. By linking the elements of this database, the user can discover and co-author the narrative, generating a unique work that subverts the passive, voyeuristic role in which audiences experience traditional time-based narrative media and reshaping the relationship between the designer and user. In forming this relationship designers must link narrative and spatial considerations with design functionality that is grounded in the subjective elements of the user experience rather than simple usability goals.",

Initial experiments have been done with some terracotta masks from the Lipari collection held at Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow. These have been digitised and output using Apple QuickTime VR object movies. 3D modelling can help focus research on the theatrical properties of the artefacts, and has informed our reconstruction of the masks and their performance context. The ongoing aims of the project are to construct a 3D archive of the most theatrically informative of the ancient artefacts and to present performance extracts in digital formats.",

The articles describe a range of approaches to the theme of evaluation in creative work, focused on the changes brought about by digital interactive technologies. They deal with specific innovative techniques and new applications of techniques taken from other disciplines, and discuss key issues which arise in relation to monitoring, describing, measuring, analysing and evaluating the use and reception of creative work. They include accounts of complex multi-disciplinary team works, individual personal projects, and reflections on extensive periods of engagement with the issues.",

    "abstract": "The transposition from painting to architecture from two-dimensional entity to a spatial structure, became the core idea of a project designed for the students of architecture to encourage them to examine the possibilities of abstract expression in the conceptualisation of architectural ideas and strategies. A series of tasks were created to enable them to identify full expression and physical presence of movement in an abstract painting as transferable into architecture. There were then other tasks oriented towards discovering, investigating and recording various types of spatial conditions as potentially architectural. Fundamental issues related to Jackson Pollock's philosophy of painting are now finding a new dimension in the digital domain of 3D modelling techniques, supplying them with the tool capable of not only projecting the release of pure energy in virtual space but also of recording endless sequences of free gestures in time and space. These can then be rewritten in the form of a computer program as well as being controlled on a higher level of architectural design.",

    "abstract": "Computer graphics are used by architects mainly for presentation purposes. However, the rapid pace of the development of computer technology enables more creative applications. This research proposes the use of dynamically simulated computer graphics as an evaluation tool for architectural design. Since buildings are living entities, whole life cycles of buildings should be dynamically simulated in highly visualised virtual environments to evaluate the future performance of prospective designs. Two areas that seem especially promising for near future (evaluation of user-building interaction and visualisation of environmental factors) are mentioned and some proposals are presented for the future use of dynamic simulations in virtual environments.",

    "abstract": "Drawing is central to all that is produced within the broadest spectrum of art and design. It is the core around which the conceptual and intellectual development of our student’s learning takes place. SeeingDrawing, a three-year project funded by the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) in the UK, aims to develop the student’s awareness of the significance of drawing. The outcome is a set of interactive multi-media DVDs which aim to enrich and enhance the student's experience of learning in art and design. The package includes images to stimulate thought, basic training guides for computer applications such as 3D graphics, and projects which students can use to practice and develop their drawing abilities. Though it encourages the use of the computer for drawing, the focus of the materials remains on traditional drawing tools. However it promotes the new approaches to drawing which are made possible by the use of technology, through the ability to utilise software applications for three-dimensional modelling and to enhance the teaching of formal drawing systems such as projection and perspective. Considerable use has been made on the DVD of video, to show research and demonstrate how practitioners work.

Using a range of theoretical writers including Margaret Morse, Nell Tenhaaf, Simon Penny, Brenda Laurel and Sue-Ellen Case, the article traces contemporary thought on femininity, technology and voice. Gilson-Ellis uses her own choreographic / poetic practice as examples in these discussions. Through an adaptation of Sue-Ellen Case's proposal of the voudou vever and the loa, the article suggests that the voice in relation to writing and new technologies has a radical potential to open up alternative kinds of spaces in digital art practice.",

    "title": "The software word: digital poetry as new media-based language art",
    "abstract": "Drawing particularly on kinetic digital poetry as a kind of software language art, this essay suggests that such a scripting-and-programming-language based textuality is not a continuation of the poetry-as-we-know-it by other means, but a new medium with its own specificity set at the intersection of the literary avant garde, net art, software art, browser art and text-based electronic installations. It is of importance that this programmable medium applies an expanded concept of textuality based on the application of netspeak and the symbols of programming languages, meaning also that the language of the code is involved in new poetic dynamic structures with striking visual, animated and tactile features. Kinetic digital poetry runs in loops, the loop being the medium adjusted to the demand of organising text components in time-based sequences, which seems to be the mode best suited to the perception of contemporary individuals and to the demands of mainstream visual culture. One of the crucial tasks of this essay is to demonstrate a shift from traditional hyperfiction and hyperpoetry to more sophisticated forms and to the specificity of software language art devoted to a new audience. The institutions in which such a textual practice exists are the rooms of club-, DJ-, and VJ- culture, mailing lists, newsletters, digital arts conferences and digital art exhibitions, rather than university classrooms and libraries.",

It begins by exploring the well-documented interactive elements of horror cinema, and goes on to explore how strategies such as the sadistic/masochistic gaze and narrative perspective have been further developed in video games. It then explores work to date on the manipulation of interactivity in video games before closely analysing how agency and control are managed in the survival horror franchise Dead Space. It concludes with reflections on further research in the nexus between film and games, and further possibilities for game design through the explicit management of agency mechanics.",

    "title": "Introduction: Fulldome",
    "abstract": "This special section of Digital Creativity focuses on the area of fulldome projection as an art medium, as it is gaining more attention in the second decade of the twenty-first century. This is mainly due to the rapid development of digital fulldome projectors and the increasing availability of both fixed and portable dome structures that are being used outside their traditional homes in astronomy and science centres. Fulldome has coalesced over the past decade due to the convergence of technologies within the planetarium, as well as growing numbers of nomadic audio-visual installations for the festival and concert scene. The prevailing format of much digital media art, and our digital culture in general, is the flat screen in all its various sizes. From the surface of the iPhone to projections as large as entire buildings, we are most familiar with the metaphor of the screen-as-window: a flat plane that opens into the digital dimension. Despite the rise of IMAX (especially the curved Omnimax format) and ongoing experiments with virtual environments, digital holography and various volumetric displays, the world of screens is emphatically flat. Now that the cathode-ray tube has been all but banished, the increasing thinness of display technologies such as OLED (organic light-emitting display) points towards the future dominance of viewing panels that intersect our physical reality with slivers of imagery taken from our ubiquitous digital cameras or constructed entirely by CGI. The technology for turning actual windows into displays with varying degrees of transparency, mixing the real and virtual view, is not far away from commercialisation. Despite this ubiquity, there are other ways of experiencing the digital world that engage our vision in a more holistic sense than merely emulating the planar perspective of the Renaissance. One of most widespread, and growing, technologies is fulldome which uses structural or inflatable domes as a projection surface and maps images onto part or all of the hemisphere. First developed for a planetarium setting, the fulldome offers a very different kind of image that encourages the viewer to look around their space. Many dome installations encourage the audience to sit on the floor or stand up and walk about; others use tilted seating with moveable headrests to enable more headturning. The dome envelops the audience in a way that no flat screen, no matter how large, can achieve even in stereoscopic 3-D. A complaint levelled by many cinema-goers at contemporary 3-D films is that the effect adds little to the story, often serving as a gimmick to boost otherwise mediocre storylines. The need for specialist eyewear and the effects of convergence and physical location within the cinema are all problematic for stereoscopic imagery. The central issue, though, is that a stereo 3-D film is not fundamentally more involving than traditional cinema because it uses the same narrative techniques and conventions: it merely invests them with a little added depth. On the other hand, the best dome films and animations make full use of the huge canvas offered by the dome interior. They deploy multiple viewing points that locate action to the sides or directly above the viewer, and take advantage of the height at the apex of the dome. This sensation of height, distance and scale is essential to the dome experience and perhaps its most unique feature. Although some dome productions are straightforward translations of standard films into Digital Creativity 2012, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 1–4",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present this special issue on experience and design methods. This issue has its origins in a workshop organised by Ron Wakkary, Thecla Schiphorst and Jim Budd (2004), titled ‘Cross-dressing and border crossing: exploring experience methods across disciplines’, held as part of the ACM SIGCHI 2004 conference in Vienna, Austria. The workshop was to all appearances among the strangest gatherings at SIGCHI 2004. Blindfolded researchers were spied wandering the fluorescent-lit lower concourse of the Austria Center in Vienna, or dashing from table to food-court table in a tag-like game whose rules remained obscure. But the playful, seemingly aimless movement of the participants belied a serious purpose. The practice of designing interactive objects, environments and systems has outgrown its roots in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with its residual load of cognitive science. We engage in interactive experiences out of choice, in search of the pleasures of the mind and senses we have hitherto found in performance, art or our experience of architectural spaces. For the workshop organisers and participants, a provocation is required: hence, cross-dressing, the opportunity to try on new roles and experience design methods coming from art and design— disciplines often marginalised by the research community. The workshop received an overwhelming response and unfortunately only about fifteen percent of the position papers submitted were accepted.

Being part of long-term research the iMuseproject explores the effect of additional visual feedback for this specific client group. Throughinterviews and video-based behavioural observation an account is given of the change in experienced control during iMusesessions with and without visual feedback. The effects in terms of experience and observed behaviour are evaluated in relation to specific impairments as well as individual aesthetic preferences.",

    "abstract": "Computers can be very helpful to us by performing tasks on our behalf. For example, they are very good at performing calculations, storing information and producing visualisations of objects that do not yet exist as a made artifact. Increasingly, however, a different role is being found for the computer. It is the role of a catalyst, or a stimulant, to our own creative thinking. In such cases the computer is not primarily performing a task for us and generating an answer within itself, rather it is helping us to generate answers within ourselves. The computer helps us think creatively. This role for the computer can be illustrated in the context of computer support to creative design. In order to design computer systems that support the creative process, it is important to understand that process well enough to predict what might help, rather than hinder. Given such research, we may begin to define the characteristics of what the computer must do in order to augment creative thinking. The paper explores a particular application of intelligent user interfaces – the augmentation of creative thought in artists.",

This paper presents early two-dimensional visualisations of the performer tracking data and discusses their influence on systems development. A few possible extensions to the visualisation techniques given here are also discussed.",

    "title": "Technological latency : from autoplastic to alloplastic",
    "abstract": "Digital technologies can bring about a paradigm shift in architecture that reflects the ongoing cultural adaptation of society to an electronic environment. To achieve this we must consider current technical developments in psychological as much as technical terms. The concept of 'trauma' is important: it refers not to a strategic dis/re-orientation, but to a suspension of the possibility of orientation. The paper speculates on the relations of trauma to the patterns of creativity propagated by digital technology, in order to counter the re-incorporation of electronic technologies within traditional ideological frameworks. One might characterise this as a shift from an autoplastic (a self-determinate operative strategy) to an alloplastic (a reciprocal environmental modification) mode of operation. Three projects are described. The Pallas House project hints at new possibilities of numeric craft and decoration. In Aegis the surface deforms according to stimuli captured from the environment, which may be selectively deployed as active or passive sensors. The Paramorph is imagined as a series of tessellated aluminium surfaces which act as host to interactive sound sculpture, sound deployed in response to the passage of people moving through the form.",

The project comprised the following stages: (1) a review and compilation of DFs thematising and/or problematising female corporeality; (2) a series of cooperative inquiries with 3 groups of young women (aged 16–19 years) over a period of 5 weeks, examining participants’ responses to a selection of the previously compiled DFs, as well as the challenges these young women face in relation to body image and (3) an interventionist summer school in which participants aged 16–19 explored body image issues via writing DFs. This article reports on the main observations and findings of each stage, and draws conclusions for future research needs in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper contextualises the themes of interactivity and associational narrativity within a wider historicaltrajectory, by examining projects conducted at the Bauhaus during the 1920s. Bauhaus artists such as László Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Schlemmer developed models and theories for cinema, theatre and installation art, which sought to surrender authorial control and engage the audience as a creative force. As contemporary artists continue to debate how to transform interactivity into an aesthetically compelling rather than participatory activity, Bauhaus projects, with their focus on associational narratives and awareness of embodied cognition, offer inspiration for current practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The layout of pages which carry information is the bread and butter of the graphic design profession. The rationale of what elements are chosen and where they are placed is based on tacit knowledge gained over a number of years of experience. The aesthetics associated with the overall finished design are often based on a style. Important elements of style are complexity and aesthetic value. In this paper I explore how various mathematical aesthetic functions can use complexity as an arousal enhancing or limiting mechanism in the application of layout designs.",

    "title": "Renegade Monkeys",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article focuses on a series of selfies taken by a Celebes Crested Macaque monkey who seized a camera from a human photographer and absconded with it. The monkey's smiling self-portraits appeared in the international press, sparking legal and public controversy around issues of copyright, royalties and fair use of the images. Arguably, the very fact of the debate is indicative of the breakdown of the traditional dichotomies that separate the human from the animal, the natural from the technological. It further calls for a reassessment of photography as a unique act that combines all these aspects and yields surprising definitions of agency and creativity. To this end, the article draws on the Vilém Flusser’s philosophy (particularly the concepts of ‘apparatus’ and ‘program’) and develops these to examine the ways in which the automation of photography has changed our perceptions of intention, memory and agency to the point that we are all ‘monkey photographers.’",

    "abstract": "Abstract The article analyses the creativity in a particular category of interactive products—personal portfolio websites. Most of the designers embraced the advantages of a digital portfolio which include the ability to make an unlimited number of copies at a very low price, availability through email and presence on the global job market. In trying to impress possible employers, designers often got more concerned with following advices offered by web design agencies on the web today rather than focusing on the quality of user experience. The question is can the rules of good web portfolio design be defined and/or can they be perceived as a process of creating new choices out of a prevailing set of options? The goal of this article is to provide an overview of work in this area and analyses it to speculate on what makes web portfolio creative as a narrative interactive product.",

    "abstract": "Interactive drama has been discussed for a number of years as a new AI-based interactive experience. While there has been substantial technical progress in building believable agents and some technical progress in interactive plot, no work has yet been completed that combines plot and character into a full-fledged dramatic experience. Part of the difficulty in achieving interactive drama is due to the lack of a theoretical framework guiding the exploration of the technological and design issues surrounding it. This paper proposes a theory of interactive drama integrating Laurel's Aristotelian structural model with Murray's concept of agency. The resulting theory illuminates the general conditions under which a user will experience agency in any interactive experience and provides design and technology guidance for the particular case of building interactive dramatic worlds.",

    "abstract": "Remembering Bogle Chandler is a digital narrative that incorporates photos, line drawings, text and sound playable using a graphical user interface (GUI). The work describes the characters and events surrounding the mysterious deaths of Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler in Sydney on New Year's Day 1963. Users can retrieve and play 104 movie clips (photographic images, animations, text and sound) from the project's digital library. The GUI is both an image illustrating connections between movie clips and an instrument for controlling them. Remembering Bogle Chandler tells an old story in a new way. In order to explore the novel qualities of the work, this article employs terminology and concepts from three essentialist theories of digital media that define the ways in which digital media differ from old or legacy media. To assess the impact of these properties on storytelling, the article also explores audience responses to the work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From a media studies perspective MRx is a form of writing, and specifically a form of inscription, a writing in space or on places. A key quality that distinguishes MRx from MR is an attention to the aesthetics of the experience. To examine the aesthetic dimension of writing is to ask: what it “feels like” to read and write according to an accepted set of practices. MR applications are tactile and proprioceptive, and MRx experiences further explore and make us aware of this multi-sensory engagement. MRx experiences are in this sense polyaesthetic, and as such they exhibit the qualities: seriality, weakened narrative and altered trace. The polyaesthetics of MRx experiences is explored in a series of example of digital art and public display, such as Blast Theory's Rider Spoke and the projection on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark the finish of the 2013 Tour de France.",

    "abstract": "For his JPEGs series started in 2002, German artist Thomas Ruff used digital photographs taken by himself and from the web, compressed using the maximum rate, and then decompressed into large-scale prints. This method of hypercompression and enlargement exposes the mathematical infrastructure of the JPEG image, i.e. the pixel blocks into which the image is split during the compression process. In so doing, Ruff turns a digital artefact (pixilation) into a default aesthetic, thereby exposing the JPEG as today's default mode of viewing images: online and on-screen. Based on a thorough study of JPEG compression and its artistic use by Ruff, we show that with this shift from geometric projection to algorithmic processing, ‘photographic’ no longer denotes a specific mode of image creation, but rather a specific mode of image processing and that the new ‘architectural order’ of the image is the mathematical matrix used during compression.",

    "abstract": "This research project seeks to identify the points in the new materials/pedagogic production and application at which a student's perception and expectation of pedagogic interface design, navigation and learning activities are judged/mapped against their real-world experience. It asks whether, on the basis of this observation, new approaches to teaching and learning material design should be adopted, and what these new approaches should be if the materials produced are to satisfy expectations while enhancing the students' generic and transferable skills base. This paper describes the author's involvement as a developer with the Higher Education Funding Councils' initiative into computers and learning. It outlines some of our attempts to investigate a genuinely student-centred approach to the production of an exemplar for computer-assisted musical courseware in the HEI. It asks two main questions: 1. what range of approaches to music-based courseware design might be employed; 2. how do we chart student perceptions, expectations and evaluation of instructional courseware and the computer as an interface? The paper provides a brief overview of the project in practical terms, it considers pedagogic and cultural implications, and it outlines the methodological enquiry and application, including examples of visual data and commentary. It concludes with an interpretation of the interim findings, and identifies directions for further research.",

In response to the question of using digital printing as an artistic tool, a 21st century paintbrush, the marks and imagery of paintings and drawings of the author's own work produced over the past few years were analysed. The digitally printed fabric outcomes, large scale painterly prints, will be presented as examples of how digitisation becomes a powerfultoolto the textile artist with the creative textile maker manipulating technology and not being controlled by it. The conclusion will show how digitisation and new technologies should not be seen as creating isolation but can be integrated into the textile artist's tool box to inspire and enhance creativity.",

This article examines the apparent flourishing of community-focused digital practices over the subsequent ‘post-conflict’ decade, galvanised by Northern Irish and EU policy initiatives armed with consolidating the peace process. Numerous digital heritage and storytelling projects have been catalysed within programmes aiming to foster social processes, community cohesion and cross-community exchange. The article outlines two projects—‘digital memory boxes’ and ‘interactive galleon’—developed during 2007–2008 within practice-led PhD enquiry conducted in collaboration with the Nerve Centre, a third-sector media education organisation. The article goes on to critically examine the processes involved in practically realising, and creatively and theoretically reconciling, community-engaged digital production in a particular socio-political context of academic-community collaboration.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research project reported here was to investigate the potential use of multimedia systems in teaching primary mathematics to pupils with learning difficulties. A multimedia interactive calculator (MIC), that combines learning materials with a calculator interface, has been designed as a result of classroom-based studies together with iterative prototype evaluation. The visual styling and operation of the MIC is the consequence of design decisions made in response to a user-need analysis carried out as part of this research. The MIC mediates between the concrete stage of learning number and the manipulations of symbolic arithmetical representations, particularly as they are used in the standard calculator, a transition which is difficult for many pupils to make. The work shows that multimedia systems can be helpful to children in making this transition. However, the authors agree that the careful use of an information design approach is needed to produce successful software. The MIC has been shown to be useful in teaching the concepts of number and the routines of addition and subtraction.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper focuses on two areas of enquiry, the phenomenon of interactivity and how ideas from outside of interaction design can expand our understanding of interactivity. Although generally seen as the user's ability to access information, interactivity's capacity can extend to the shaping of content and meaning. The paper proposes that visualities produced by diasporic individuals reveal the potential of users for reflexivity and intervention. It draws on theories of postcolonial identity and the mixing of cultural meanings of diasporic people to highlight the importance of allowing users to experience autonomy, agency and self-determination in digital media.",

    "abstract": "Children and youth have become an important stakeholder group in urban/city planning and tourism. While there are many practices of youth participation in planning in various countries, a policy of involving pupils and students as so-called ‘volunteer (tourist) guides’ is promoted in recent years in Japan. Previous studies have shown that there are many positive effects created from children being tourist guides. We developed this idea and conducted a project called ‘C my city!’ in Finland in order to facilitate children and youth to introduce their home city through digital storytelling. In the pilot project, 38 digital stories were made by the participants and the stories were embedded on a web-based map. Through analysis of the articulated words in the stories, we investigated how they introduced their home city. Furthermore, we discussed possibilities of applying this method in cross-curricular settings in school.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This contribution offers an evocative conceptual framework to inspire thinking about game design in an alternative way. If proceduralism focuses on crafting game systems, we advocate recovering the relevance of players' interactions by pulling digitally mediated games out from the screen into the physical world where gameplay and players can intersect and interact. We draw on certain performance strategies to illuminate some currently under-explored game design resources. We use several case studies that help us describe what we call ‘human-to-human interaction’ (H2HI) in game design in three different levels: first, having designers improvise according to players' actions real time; second, substituting computer game characters for human actors who perform according to players' suggestions; and third, looking outside the traditional computer game environment for a computer-mediated human playground. These cases help us raise some conjectures about the possibilities of recovering the physical and social essence of performance for digital-mediated games.",

Through this digital space, we successfully organized an online event under the COVID-19 circumstance, including a graduation ceremony and a student art exhibition. Our user study analyzes the Planet Anima experience with a focus on collaborative engagement and creative expression. Furthermore, we explore the impact of platform choice (headset VR vs. desktop VR) on metaverse user experience. Our findings demonstrate that Planet Anima can facilitate the co-experiences that foster creativity. Notably, the results indicate that headset VR outperforms desktop VR in terms of presence, social presence, and emotional involvement. This study also highlights the gaps between virtual and physical experiences, identifying the challenge of cybersickness associated with headset VR. These insights contribute to enhancing the user experience within the metaverse.",

    "abstract": "In this article we argue that a framework for the description, analysis and comparison of generative artworks is needed. Existing ideas from kinetic art and other domains in which process description is prominent are shown to be inadequate. Therefore, we propose a new framework that meets this need and facilitates the long-term aim of constructing a comprehensive taxonomy of generative art. Our framework is divided into four major components: a description of a work's entities; its processes and their environmental interactions; and the outcomes experienced by the work's audience. We describe a set of diverse generative artworks in terms of our framework, demonstrating how it can be applied in practice to compare and contrast them.",

    "title": "Becoming materials: material forms and forms of practice",
    "abstract": "As a result of development toward ‘smart’ materials, materials now enable an expanding range of aesthetic expressions and user experiences. These materials are fundamentally temporal in their capacity to assume multiple, discrete states of expression that can be repeatedly and minutely controlled. These materials come to be, or become, only over time and in context—they are becoming materials. Thus, in the development and application of such materials, we must engage more extensively with the experience of materials in practices of design and of use. This paper introduces and discusses the concept of becoming materials—as well as the implications for practice—through a series of examples from our own practice-led research within art, design and architecture. Coming to terms with the implications for material practices of design and of use, we suggest, requires the development of new concepts and methods for doing and studying the design of becoming materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anthony McCall's solid light film Line Describing a Cone (1973) is about the emergence of dimensionality in space. This paper uses Line Describing a Cone to discuss emergence as a material algorithmic process occurring across the media of informatic systems and installation art. Evolutionary models of emergence trace patterns, whether behavioural, spatial or genetic. Line Describing a Cone suggests the emergence of a new kind of mobilized viewer within gallery spaces who does not necessarily ‘evolve’ but who (through interruption and noise) becomes an interactive emergent part of the material processes of the work. Noise travels and generates the excess dimensionality within which an emergent material process can occur. It is contested here that emergence can only occur within noisy environments. Emergence then, introduces a process within which viewers interact with and experience art installations.",

    "title": "Beyond destinations: exploring tourist technology design spaces through local–tourist interactions",
    "abstract": "The design of digital tourist technologies is traditionally situated in an understanding of tourism as an information consumption practice. In contrast, this article takes a ‘performative’ view of tourism as its starting point. The research presented is part of a larger goal, which is to propose a shift in the socio-technical environment in which the design of engaging technologies for tourists takes place. By drawing on recent approaches for understanding the lived social and material conditions of tourist places, we first show how contemporary tourism can be usefully understood as a form of networking. The article then draws on early research about the roles of locals and tourists in the making of place during the course of their networking activities, and suggests how an understanding of the social environment of tourists might be used as a grounded resource for design. Our analysis of a staged encounter between a single tourist and four locals generates insights used to shape a design space, a first step in the development of appropriate, engaging design interventions in the domain of tourism.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Living media interfaces (LMIs) have emerged as a new way to interact with digital systems by incorporating actual living organisms in user interfaces. There is increasing interest in utilizing living media in the context of interaction design influenced by recent advancements in biological sciences that make new forms of responsive living media possible. We establish a definition of LMIs appropriate for HCI’s interdisciplinary domain. We provide an overview of the current design space and identify open research questions from four different perspectives: Biological, Ethical, Artistic, and HCI. For each perspective, we use a series of LMI exemplars to illustrate and ground themes and arguments. We conclude with a series of implications for design, including a discussion of LMIs’ ability to engage human users through being alive, their potential to symbolize and embody dynamic information, and the practical and ethical questions that designers need to consider when working with them.",

    "abstract": "A small country was ruled by a dictator from a strong fortress, situated in the middle of the country and surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads let to the fortress. The general knew that an attack by her entire army would capture the fortress and gathered her army at the head of one road, ready to launch a full-scale direct attack. However, she then learned that the dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. Since this would not only blow up the road, but also destroy neighbouring villages, capturing the fortress seemed impossible. However, the general devised a simple plan. She divided her army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of one road. When all was ready she gave the signal and each group marched down a different road so that the entire army arrived together at the fortress simultaneously. In this way, the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator. 1",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper attempts to describe some of the cognitive aspects of a fashion design activity and associate them with a general technological workplace. Within this, a fashion designer is seen as a creative individual who will acquire and utilise knowledge by using her intelligence to form concepts. The research was prompted by the fact that little is published about fashion garment designing; in this it may be paralleled with architectural practice research conducted over 25 years ago. Therefore a theoretical view of fashion designing is described based primarily on other activity models. A practical CAD experiment carried out with BA Honours Fashion Design students revealed some interesting facts about aiding the creative fashion design process with a computer. This involved simply comparing traditional designing with popular clothing pattern manipulation software used on a personal computer. A set of general principles for interfaces is derived from a linking of design theories with the experiment.",

    "abstract": "The articles in this collection of Digital Creativity raise questions to the value of focusing on creativity to change museums and cultural institutions from curiosity cabinets into critical institutions that scaffold peoples‘ capacity and reflections. Museums are under pressure from new visitor groups expecting to be involved in participative experiences and engagements. These new visitor groups expect museums to be places that present many answers and that give insights into how people arrived at answers that constitute the knowledge we have today. Parallel to this, the interpretative paradigm in museums (HooperGreenhill 2006) has pointed to visitors as active performers of meaning-making and argued that this fits poorly with expert-driven communication. These expectations of communication and learning in museums can no longer be met with practices focusing solely on conservation, preservation and presentation of objects. For this a new vocabulary has been requested that embraces the interconnected linkage between design, digital media, space and the social context of museum relations (Macdonald 2007). Throughout the last few years, the ‘participatory museum’ (Simon 2010) has been heatedly debated as a new paradigm. Many documents across policy and research relate participation and involvement as key concepts in notions of museums as democratic institutions and as sites for public discourses promoting dialogue and inclusion (Sandell 2002; Black 2010; Barrett 2011). Digital technologies and social media are obvious ingredients for many museums to promote these participatory activities. Former understandings of interactivity as purely handson interactions are doomed (vom Lehn et al. 2005; Adams, Luke, and Moussouri 2004). And there is a re-thinking of interaction and participation related to people developing new forms and practices of memorising, building identities and sense of belonging with social media (Giaccardi 2012). New scales of visitors‘ interactions arise extending from the fixed, physical and material encounters in the museum exhibition space to mobile and social media-based engagement in digital spaces (Bautista and Balsamo 2011). The social, personal and physical context (Falk and Dierking 2000) of the physical museum visit is emergently added with a digital layer. This has led museum studies, interaction design, media studies and learning research to seek new ways to rethink interactions, engagement, meaning-making and the way cultural and social values may be encountered in cultural institutions. However, we know little about the different shapes this participation, engagement and involvement may take (Runnel et al. 2013). There is also still need for a critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss what these key concepts entail, and for whom. The initiative for this special issue of Digital Creativity originates from two Nordic networks, Culture Kick and NordLAC, which connect several larger Nordic projects in the multidisciplinary field focusing on design aspects of museums and archive communication and learning. However, the issue shows a broad, interdisciplinary and international interest from design-related research that currently discusses creativity as relevant to achieve new understanding of both interpretation and participation. Nanna Holdgaard and Lisbeth Klastrup bring the concept of creativity under close scrutiny and argue that several creative projects in the sector miss a specific conceptualisation and understanding of creation.

    "title": "Creating Sounding Underground",
    "abstract": "Sounding Underground is an online interactive sonic environment that links sound excerpts from the metros of London, Paris and Mexico City, as selected by commuters, as meaningful moments of sound from their commuting routine. Designed as a navigation structure, the environment draws on identifiable architectonic spaces such as entrances and corridors, but also incorporates more abstract ‘spaces’ based on memorable sounds that passengers had in common. The creation of the environment focused on the perception of social, political and symbolic experiences, and was derived from an iterative ethnographic and artistic practice which involved self-reflection, interviews, recordings of and listening to the journeys, and commuters' selections of sounds. This article describes the process of creation through the abstraction of a physical space, as well as the responses the work has evoked in the users and the academic community. It exemplifies the transdisciplinary nature of practice-based research involving the creative use of digital technologies.",

    "title": "After the Anthropocene: the photographic for earthly survival?",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This essay explores the relation between photography and future environments in the context of the Anthropocene. It is particularly concerned with the way in which Anthropocene debates highlight the following: climate change as a matter of human extinction and survival; agency as anthropos or Man and technology as problem and solution, cause and consequence of climate change (noting of course Heidegger’s critical reading of technology as the tool of man; its reduction to instrumental and anthropological uses). The essay contends that the Anthropocene, as the performatively named era of Man and his tools, is humanistic (with all of the normativity that this implies) and also that it frames the relation between photography and future environments in predictable cycles of extinction and survival, ends and beginnings that limit its potential for imagination and intervention. To what extent then, might a critical engagement with the Anthropocene help to liberate this potential and begin to outline a photographics for earthly survival?",

Drawing on the experience of developing and running the Masters in Creative Technologies (MA/MSc) at the Institute of Creative Technologies at De Montfort University, Leicester, we explore a number of areas relating to transdisciplinary teaching and learning in higher education, including: how digital technologies enable students to work in a transdisciplinary manner; how working creatively with technology enables transdisciplinary modes of working; and the ways in which transdisciplinarity, enabled by digital technologies, has affected the creative practice of learners. The article discusses how the programme has developed a climate for creativity, and outlines how the knowledge and skills gained during a creative technologies-related transdisciplinary programme meet the needs of a changing workplace.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on the topological approach Jacques Lacan developed late in his career, this paper explores the relation between a user and an avatar interpreted as prosthetic, so that an avatar is seen as a prosthetic consciousness and unconscious, a user's virtual ‘Self’. Lacan's topological concept of ‘extimacy’ that subverts the opposition between the inside and outside is used in support of such an interpretation. The 3-D virtual world of Second Life is taken as an example to illustrate the digital projection of a user's gender identity. The paper suggests that Second Life is application of attachable genitals in addition to basic male and female avatar patterns makes the virtual process of taking a gender identity similar to real life sexuation. This interpretation leads to a conclusion about the fixity of the ego in the imaginary realm (a typical human feature, according to Lacan) and challenges the main postulates of posthumanism.",

    "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter discusses animation and modeling of the Xian terra-cotta soldiers. Excavation of the grave complex of the Ch’in emperor Shi Huang Ti in Xian in the 1970s has revealed a vast field of life-size terra-cotta statues depicting soldiers, servants, and horses, estimated to total 6000 pieces. A sense of great realism is conveyed in the figures with remarkable simplicity. The figures were modeled after the emperor's real army, and each face is different. They were supposed to guard the crypt and protect their ruler on his afterlife journey. The figures were carefully fashioned to resemble one of his real infantries, with well-outfitted officers, charioteers and archers, as well as youthful foot soldiers. This chapter discusses about the Xian project that is intended to recreate and restore life to this army using computer-generated techniques. The goal of the Xian project is first to make a pilot to be able to show and to test the feasibility of a 90 min film. For the present time, the pilot includes the modeling and the animation of the soldiers.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article focuses on Facebook communities about nostalgic photos of Turkey to explore how citizenship is enacted through the participatory and collaborative use of social media to remember and represent the past. By sharing their personal photos, knowledge, testimonies, narratives and life stories, members of these communities actively and creatively use social media to generate new ways of remembering and representing the past, as well as improving its accessibility and visibility. Furthermore, through exchanging affectively and politically charged photos and conversations about the past, participants fashion nostalgia as a public feeling that becomes a source for affective political criticism of the present. This article addresses the participatory and collaborative creation of knowledge and memory of the past to discuss everyday creative citizenship practices facilitated by social media.",

For instance, it's said that computers don't have emotions; that any work of art is a human communication rooted in human experience; that computer art isn't unique, because a program could churn out its products indefinitely; and that programs can't generate fundamental creative changes. This attitude prevents people from engaging seriously with the products of computer art. In addition, it threatens to devalue the artistry of the human being behind the computer, and to undermine their status as an artist.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flashlight torches are cheap, robust, familiar and fun and so make interesting devices upon which to base interaction technologies. Computer vision software has been developed that can recognise and distinguish between different flashlight beams and these can be used to activate digital media including audio, video or special effects. The technology appears to ’magically bring to life’ objects and areas of the environment merely by shining a torch on them and has been used successfully to enhance visitor attractions such as museum exhibits and displays. This paper considers the potential for using this technology in special needs education, providing a means for children to explore their immediate environment and discover something new. Potential applications for supporting learning are proposed and a feasibility study is presented. Three case examples were conducted to assess the practicalities of configuring interactive learning experiences within the schoolenvironment and pupil’s responses to the technology.",

Following the gift to the mother of a video recording that depicted the young adult's progress as a result of the sessions it was found that upon viewing he was able to recognize himself and associate with his activities. Further, when watching alongside his mother, the recorded material became as a mediating reference for his communication. Conclusions consider contextual parallel activities from earlier research where digital paintings that were printed from screen shots of interactive sessions and recorded auditory achievements were presented to helpers and family of similarly severe disabled users.",

The three games described here were developed for the Swedish Library of Talking Books and Braille (TPB), to be published on the TPB Internet site (TPB 2002). These games, Towers of Hanoi, Memory and Tag, can be played without the aid of graphics, although they do also feature animations of a style designed for partially sighted players. The games are fairly simple Macromedia Flash™ applications, suitable for web publishing, and while not so complex as some other titles, they still emphasise some crucial design issues of creating sound-based interactive media.",

    "title": "The fashion blog as genre—between user-driven bricolage design and the reproduction of established fashion system",
    "abstract": "Abstract Fashion as a phenomenon cannot be understood independently of the visual images and designed presentations that convey the content and forms of fashion. With the breakthrough of the digital media in the 2000s we were introduced to new ways of communicating and staging fashion where the blog in particular has established a new media culture for the distribution and exchange of potential fashion-based self-presentation forms and resulted in new design strategies. In this article, the fashion blog is presented as a specific genre that is characterised by remediating existing genre forms and combining them into new formats, where amateur bricolage approaches are combined with the reproduction of familiar features from the established fashion media. The article presents four types of fashion blogs, each representing a specific design strategy for presenting and interacting with fashion content. In closing, it is argued that the fashion blog as a phenomenon, on the one hand, has placed the ordinary fashion consumer centre stage as a producer of fashion content while also, on the other hand, helping to consolidate established hierarchical and communicative structures in the fashion system.",

    "title": "Reflections on interdisciplinary team development for the design of a platform for computer supported collaborative play",
    "abstract": "The Constructed Narratives project has been designed for use in public spaces where there is the opportunity for individuals and groups of people, who are not acquainted with each other, to encounter the game and subsequently each other. The goal is to provide a platform that supports discourse in environments where ‘keeping comfortable distance’ between oneself and others is the norm. The system framework developed for this project can be applied for use in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL), and collaborative design activities in the tradition of computer supported collaborative work (CSCW). The current domain explored in the Constructed Narratives project is computer systems designed to enable shared experience through play, or computer supported collaborative play (CSCP). This paper examines the learner-centred design methodologies used for the development of the physical artifacts and underlying software and hardware system architecture for the Constructed Narratives project. The design methodology demonstrates how an interdisciplinary team of artists, designers, and technologists can exploit the opportunities inherent in this ‘symmetry of ignorance’ to find solutions for multiple wicked design problems that can arise during the development of an integrated software and hardware system.",

By way of illustration I explore interactive artworks from Ken Rinaldo, Wolfgang Müench and Kiyoshi Furukawa, and Paul Sermon, which emphasise the intersection of a layer of technology in our sensory and physical experiences of the world. In order to develop an object-oriented exploration of these works, and our day-to-day interactions with technology in a broader sense, I explore digital interaction as a process that involves the transductive relationships set up between objects and the milieu in which these objects find themselves. Central to this argument is setting all objects, including human users, technology and artifacts, on the same ontological footing.",

This paper addresses how co-creation and experimental methods may be applied in a situated, natural environment, exploring how these technologies may be shaped to support museum visitor relations. The concept ‘experimental zone’ is suggested as a format for a collaborative design space where digital media-based dialogues are explored in line with professional practices. This concept is discussed in relation to two design experiments undertaken in collaboration with the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The concept of emotion-driven media integrates affective computing into developing new types of digital media by including the human spectator as an essential part of the whole system. Enactive media, as a landmark in this direction, provides a theoretical basis that is rooted in the enactivist approach in cognitive science. Based on this thesis, it is required to establish a practical procedure for developing the media content through integrating psychological approaches. We demonstrate a systematic approach for developing the content for emotion-driven media. The theory of archetypes, one of the psychoanalytical approaches, was applied for editing movie clips as the media content, and coupled the content with emotional responses by using experimental psychological methodologies. The results showed that it is promising to utilise archetypal movie clips as the content of emotion-driven media and archetypal symbolism can be a useful resource for developing the content of media systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The question “What is consciousness for?” is considered with particular relevance to objects created using interactive technologies. It is argued that an understanding of artificial life with it attendant notion of robotic consciousness is not separable from an understanding of human consciousness. The positions of Daniel Dennett and John Searle are compared. Dennett believes that by understanding the process of evolutionary design we can work towards an understanding of consciousness. Searle's view is that in most cases mental attributes such as consciousness are either dispositional or are observer relative. This opposition is taken as the basis for a discussion of the purposes of consciousness in general and how these might be manifest in human and robotic forms of life.",

    "abstract": "Avatar gender is a basic element of an MMORPG user's identity. Gender customisation in a virtual space is an expansion of identity, an attempt to express oneself in more diverse ways. A survey showed that numerous users manage gender-swapped avatars, and men in particular prefer using female avatars. This study analysed user attitudes toward gender using a Q methodology. In the process, it confirmed the generalisations and motivating factors of gender swapping. The advanced graphic technology and high degree of freedom available in recent MMORPGs has led to an increased demand for avatar physical qualities, and the motives that underlie gender selection have become more diverse and complex. In particular, the notion of experimental and playful creation through customisation has been illuminated and treated as the core consideration of game design.",

Nevertheless, in the Global South, this approach is not directly applicable due to authoritarian educational systems founded on colonialist ideologies. This research reports on an attempt to appropriate the design studio and fundamental interaction design concepts in Brazil. Following the anthropophagy tradition of hybridization, the foreign concepts were not rejected but devoured and digested together with Global South concepts, such as radical alterity, mediation, and oppression to form what we call the anthropophagic studio. The process gradually revealed to students and researchers the role of interaction design in reproducing other historical oppressions beyond colonialism. This finding points to the need for a critical pedagogy that can aptly tackle technology-mediated oppression.",

    "title": "Compositional interaction design—changes in design practice and its implications for teaching and research",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, we focus on compositional interaction design as an emergent professional practice in interaction design. We propose that compositional interaction design practice can be defined as a practice of knowing, mapping configuring, customizing and connecting elements to form larger compositional wholes. We demonstrate how this practice demands new compositional skills, new methods and a changed division of labours. We suggest that this contemporary practice can be understood in terms of how different computational components are integrated to form interactive products and services. We illustrate this new practice with two concrete examples. Our first example illustrates compositional interaction design at a small scale, whereas our second example illustrates compositional design at a larger scale. We also discuss how this emergent practice relates to other streams of development (e.g. craft-oriented HCI and human-centred design) and we discuss what implications this shift may have to interaction design educational programs aimed at preparing students for this emerging professional practice.",

    "title": "The art of interaction",
    "abstract": "Interactive art has become much more common as a result of the many ways in which the computer and the Internet have facilitated it. Issues relating to human–computer interaction (HCI) are as important to interactive art making as issues relating to the colours of paint are to painting. It is not that HCI and art necessarily share goals. It is just that much of the knowledge of HCI and its methods can contribute to interactive art making. This paper reviews recent work that looks at these issues in the art context. In interactive digital art, the artist is concerned with how the artwork behaves, how the audience interacts with it and, ultimately, in participant experience and their degree of engagement. The paper looks at these issues and brings together a collection of research results and art practice experiences that together help to illuminate this significant new and expanding area. In particular, it is suggested that this work points towards a much needed critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss interactive digital art.",

    "title": "Digital tufting bee: expanding computational design boundaries through collective material practice and social play",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper questions design priorities in computational systems and proposes that social aspects of material practice are overlooked in existing computational design practices. An interactive fabrication system designed for this project: Digital Tufting Bee centres on machine tufting, an adaptation of the handcrafting technique for making voluminous folds of yarn. The word ‘Bee’ refers to a quilting tradition in which a group comes together to quilt; I use this term to emphasize communal effort, shared decision-making and collective meaning-making in computational design processes. Building on literature in Science and Technology Studies, I argue that collective material practice and social play deepen human engagement in making processes and further challenge existing orders of computational design processes. By collecting and analysing qualitative data from three tufting workshops, I observed that uncertainties of yarn, conversation during making, tendencies to leave space for others, and exchange of crafting skills brought valuable meaning to interactive tufting. This paper concludes that as long as researchers involve communal aspects of making to connect makers, tools, materials and their communities, computational making could challenge the dominant design paradigm. Based on these findings, promising areas of further study include rituals of gift giving and collective textile repair in material practices.",

This study proposed a framework of design activities and cognitive needs in the conceptual design stage based on the design information cycle model. The technical characteristics are analysed and role of VR in each phase of conceptual design is discussed. Then the principle and application value in developments of VR technology for conceptual design are analysed. Finally, the research directions and application scheme of VR in conceptual design in the future are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Digital fabrication laboratories (such as Fab Labs) are a global initiative of workshops that offer open access to technologies to produce objects from beginning idea to final production. Fab Labs encourage open and free knowledge-sharing among ‘experts’ and the general public. Claims are being made about community-based digital fabrication workshops transforming practices of design, innovation, production and consumption, while describing positive impacts on the environment and social goals. Research that examines such claims is sparse. This paper explores realities of using digital fabrication technologies within a Fab Lab. It draws on a case study that describes practical outcomes of a design workshop in which a multidisciplinary team engaged in issues of sustainable design and processes of co-creation to design and fabricate a prototype. This experience provides insight into the impact of digital fabrication technologies within a sustainable and co-creational design context and critical reflections are presented.",

Virtual space during the pandemic has enabled a range of creative events, such as streaming performances, cyber tours, and online activities. Within confined spaces, performing artists have quickly become digital experts in pushing boundaries. This paper examines how tertiary dance teachers and students have coped with the sudden change caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 120+ university/college dance teachers and students from different continents participated in this study. The study finds that some technologies work better than others, virtual platforms are congruent with current students’ learning preferences, and restrictions in space boost creativity and empathy. This paper shares timely lessons and insights on tools, pedagogies, and strategies for online teaching and learning. It aims to foster further discussions and interrogations of how far we can push practice-based subjects in education by creatively engaging digital technology.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Why should we commune with the environment surrounding us? It's because communing is the most ecological strategy for human beings, who coexist with other humans and even other creatures, whereas there is no way of knowing the experience of other creatures. ‘Qualia' are none other than relational properties in a complex system of human beings in nature. This article explores how to perceive others' perception through a BirdMan experiment. The BirdMan, a half-man and half-beast creature, born in a subconsciousness, attempts to share its mind with others. As a venue for new experiences transforming and recreating human perceiving experiences, the work becomes a meta-methodology exploring the meaning of other beings' experience. While encountering in between different perceptions with hybrid perspectives, ecological narratives and empathy can be realised. It suggests to us that the way we perceive and understand this world is not the only way.",

The project first collected data on audience attention (eye-tracking), arousal (skin conductance level) and emotion (using facial expression). This data was then used in pedagogical materials delivered to two student cohorts in both lecture format and as an e-learning package. Self-reported survey data on the student experience indicates significant increase in Learning Interest toward the concepts of the DDCP, as well as strong ratings of the material’s Useability and Application to Knowledge. We also report on focus group discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of the DDCP. We show that the DDCP offers an innovative and novel intervention into contemporary screen creativity pedagogy, forging a valuable teaching-research nexus between the findings of the research field of cognitive media theory and their application in the field of student production.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper discusses the use of human-scale immersive virtual environments as a platform for developing technologies for embodied digital interaction. We propose a three-body framework of spatial typologies in the realm of collaborative room-centered immersive systems that governs the relationship between the immersants, the hardware system of the environment, and the presented virtual environment. Through the lens of this framework, we present several use cases in the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Through the narratives of these use cases, it is argued that the proposed framework not only affords the design of interaction systems in room-centered virtual environments with spatial awareness, but also engenders new approaches to envision system design and its integration to the built environment. This framework intends to emphasize the significance of spatial thinking in expanding the creative potentials of body-driven interactive immersive systems.",

    "title": "Heritage values, digital storytelling, and heritage communication: the exploration of cultural heritage sites in virtual environments",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cultural heritage communication (CHCom) refers to the transfer of values that underlie heritage attributes and settings to intended audiences. Emerging digital storytelling approaches combined with advanced technologies can advance the dissemination and interpretation of information on heritage sites, particularly the intangible values essential to conveying the multifaceted complexity of sites in virtual environments. However, the holistic integration of layered heritage values into digital storytelling in heritage experience design for virtual environments remains underexplored. The present study therefore examined value-based digital storytelling as an effective CHCom method and the improvement of visitors’ recognition and contextualization of heritage values. To this end, the research addressed the communication of the diverse sociocultural significance of Seonamsa Temple of Korea as the venue of interest. The findings suggest that value-based digital storytelling helps reveal interconnected sociocultural values beyond built environments and supports the formulation of strategies for deepening visitors’ heritage interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract massMobile is a client–server system for mass audience participation in live musical performances using existing wireless network infrastructure, audience members' own mobile computing devices (such as smartphones) and a cloud-based server to enable rapid prototyping, iterative design, and plug and play deployment of participatory systems under constraints common to live events and venues. In this paper, we specifically focus on technical and design issues related to large-scale participatory performances, exploring (a) what technical designs provide robust support; (b) what interfaces and mappings can be effective and (c) what strategies can effectively focus and guide participation. We first briefly address previous work in audience participation in live performance, then describe massMobile's system design and implementation with a focus on new functionality to support robust use at scale. Finally, we discuss two sets of events using massMobile in large-scale performance contexts: with an athletic band at sporting events and with a jazz combo in traditional concert venues.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article explores and proposes new ways of performing in a technology-mediated environment. We present a case study that examines feedback loop relationships between a dancer and a pianist. Rather than using data from sensor technologies to directly control and affect musical parameters, we captured data from a dancer’s arm movements and mapped them onto a bespoke device that stimulates the pianist’s tactile sense through vibrations. The pianist identifies and interprets the tactile sensory experience, with his improvised performance responding to the changes in haptic information received. Our system presents a new way of technology-mediated performer interaction through tactile feedback channels, enabling the user to establish new creative pathways. We present a classification of vibrotactile interaction as means of communication, and we conclude how users experience multi-point vibrotactile feedback as one holistic experience rather than a collection of discrete feedback points.",

    "title": "The uncertainty of the uncertain image",
    "abstract": "The uncertainty of the uncertain image: that is the question! If it is correct to claim, as the body of contributions to this special issue does, that this question is a key challenge in today’s global network societies, the query posed is not least interesting because it flies in the face of a good deal of received wisdom and popular notions of images that take them to be certain objects. For the assumed certainty of the image grounds the recent so-called visual turn in research—across the humanities, the social sciences and a range of technical fields. Arguably, the image appears to be the certain hinge on which turns the broad institutionalization during this period of visual culture studies as a discipline in its own right, from the Anglo-American studies of vision and visuality in the late 1980s (Foster 1988) through the German efforts to establish a science of the image (Belting 2007; Bredekamp 2010) to contemporary postcolonial (Appadurai 1996; Bhabha 2004; Rajagopal and Rao 2016; Spivak 1999), feminist (Jones 2010; Nochlin 1999; Pollock 1988) and queer (Butler 1993; Halberstam 2005; Muñoz 1999; Sedgwick 1997) articulations of what differences that make a difference are made by various images and gazes. The image has never appeared more certain, one might say, seeing that it has found its way into an incredible spectrum of everyday sociocultural practices. The image seems so certain that it is often a taken for granted constituent of everyday culture; for instance, in screens and graphical user interface developments, and in innumerable productions, disseminations and receptions in social and mobile media. Moreover, citizens of today’s network societies are increasingly accompanied by entire ecologies of images, incessantly and wherever they go in information-intensive mixed-reality environments. Such image ecologies form the ways in which the truth of the current co-development of contemporary culture and ubiquitous or pervasive computing presents itself. Within the emerging Big Data regime of knowledge, the image is also becoming a dominant vehicle through which the rhetorical objectivity of data is construed (Gregg 2014; Halpern 2014). The image is becoming a site where the promise of certainty, predictability and intelligibility offered by Big Data is made. Not least, discursive and practical employments of images today can very often be seen as affirming and reaffirming certainty via marked returns to emphasizing high resolution, sharpness, clarity and realistic representation. Yet, whether images appear still or moving, their emergence in the visual turn, in the rise of the sociocultural use of digital images, and in the unfolding of such ecologies of images increasingly present us with the paradox of uncertainties emerging with certainties. As this special issue shows, while images do appear more certain as the information technological capacities that render them clearly visible increase, they are nevertheless also inherently circumscribed or touched by more uncertainty as their numbers, contingencies, ephemeralities and manipulabilities increase. Internal to contemporary emphases on realism, clarity, sharpness and high resolution, the uncertainty of images is continuously underscored by renewed encounters with fallibility, noise, grain, glitch, irreducible blur, unsharpness, indistinctness, vagueness and representational undecidability. To make matters more complex, it is not just the certain image that becomes an issue—it is also increasingly the case that even visuality and the",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The idea of connecting with the sensory realities of others can help us to build empathic ties and to think outside the boundaries of our preconceived ideas. Envisioning these opportunities, this paper introduces a framework with a set of embodied modalities derived from communicating embodied experiences through a prototype for storytelling called SOUL. This prototype was built to transmit some experiential qualities based on a first-person narrative truthfully. Three ways of bodily connecting with the experience of others are here identified as (1) assertion, (2) negotiation or (3) dissension, and described as different ways of generating embodied connections with the prototype. This approach is intended to enrich the value of alterity in HCI, including disagreement and tension in times where the design of one size fits all artefacts appear as the general rule. We conclude that this sensory way of transmitting meaning can be useful for communicating assertive messages.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Two main types of human perception are seeing and hearing. They play a central role in everyday life, scientific research, and also fine arts. Especially in the visual arts, linking the auditory and the visual realms is not uncommon. However, when it comes to linking the visual domain with the audio domain, the possibilities there are less addressed. Therefore, in this paper, we conceptualize the so-called cruxes for sonification of the visual domain. These are hierarchically structured transformations of the main elements in both domains, starting at the physics level, then extending to the physiological level, and finally to the artistic level. They offer a strong basis for creative sonification efforts and are intended for computer-based (generative) art production. In brief, this paper shows that sonification has a strong potential for artistic sonic creations, where scientific basis can play an important role, when linking the visual, acoustic, and physiological domains.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study presents the design of a multimodal ubiquitous learning application (MULA) with different augmenting effects for enhancing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) academic writing instruction. In a pilot project, 17 undergraduates engaged in ubiquitous learning and writing at a green building and provided survey responses and interview feedback about their ubiquitous writing experience. The survey results were categorized into perceptions about (a) the ubiquitous learning mode, (b) effective writing facilitation, (c) motivation, self-efficacy, and attitude, (d) self-regulation, and (e) system usability. Interview results further illustrated how using MULA led to positive and negative experiences during ubiquitous writing. A final synthesis on the findings led to the identification of seven affordances that made MULA a potential tool for enhancing writing instruction in EFL settings. The seven affordances were considered effective design elements for multimodal context-aware ubiquitous learning that served the purpose of enriching English academic writing instruction. Implications about creating multimodal ubiquitous learning applications in higher education are also provided.",

Our research is based on empirical findings arising from the use of Inspiration Card Workshops, which are collaborative design events in which domain and technology insight are combined to create design concepts. In addition to the systematically introduced sources of inspiration that form part of the workshop format, a number of spontaneous sources of inspiration emerged during these workshops.",

    "title": "From concept to space: a new perspective on AIGC-involved attribute translation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Drawn inspiration from phenomenal attributes and translating them into heuristic model tools is one of the effective means to promote architectural form innovation. However, over-reliance on perception indicates greater risks in decision-making. Nowadays, AI-generated Content (AIGC) technology combines the advantages of information comprehensiveness and modelling efficiency, providing new possibilities for the translation of architectural attributes. Based on attribute study, this paper proposes a new approach to spatial translation that uses the Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN + CLIP) to realize the visualization of abstract concepts and then adds multi-dimensional influence through the Keyframe Style Transfer technology. The eclectic attribute is used as an example for the 2D and virtual 3D translation feasibility experiments. The article aims to improve the scientificity and influence of spatial translation through a technical organization from the perspective of architects. While providing an innovative, democratic and efficient aided-design tool also highlights a new angle for AIGC-involved pre-design.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to make transparent the new and complex field of practice-based research within the context of architecture and the moving image. Following some general considerations derived from the wider context, it concentrates on a case study of a particular example: the architectural promenade as moving image narrative device. The paper cites the case historically and theoretically, and covers pertinent issues of narrativity and space within moving-image practice. It then describes the central experiment, analysis, testing and trials, and formulates conclusions regarding the use of plan and section in moving image architectural exploration and representation and the importance of the human eye. It also emphasises the key role of the human body in composing the storyline.",

By attempting to historicise the idea of the deployment of representations of space into real space I hope to contribute to a discourse which emphasises the experience of images rather than technologies and techniques of representation. Examples of seemingly antique and forgotten media that synthesised aesthetic and scientific ways of investigating the world are examined for their relevance and utility in twenty-first-century design education.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study investigates digital prototyping in undergraduate industrial education through a case study of two pilot projects and a new elective and project-based course. It explores the literature on digital prototyping, open design, and sustainability, analyses student projects through the case study, and discusses the findings in relation to the literature review. In the study, two frameworks are suggested that aim to guide digital prototyping education in the industrial design field. The first framework aims to frame the content, and the second seeks to frame the context for the student projects. The first framework focuses on the relationship between the completeness of the products when they meet the users, the level of users’ design skills, and possible user-intervention types to the product. The second framework focuses on environmental and economic sustainability, considering the benefits and risks of four possible scenarios according to the user-engagement type.",

    "abstract": "This paper relates current uses of digital technologies within architecture to historical attempts at integrating technology and architecture. In doing this a number of historical and current projects are presented. Different themes and practices are distinguished: 'presenting large-scale technical objects', 'making technical elements and processes visible', 'intensifying the effects and qualities of an object', 'space as mise-en-scène of technology', 'from replacing the object to de-materialising architecture'. At the heart of the analysis is the thesis that the digital has intensified the theatrical element within architecture, with technology mutating from a functional and representational object to a space for creating and exhibiting representations. Digital light and imaging techniques as part of architectural projects, their potential for mobilising built structures and for multiplying modes of perception and use are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Creating facial expressions manually needs to be enhanced through a set of easy operating rules, which involves adjectives and the manipulating combinations of facial design elements. This article tries to analyse viewers' cognition of artificial facial expressions in an objective and scientific way. We chose four adjectives – ‘satisfied’, ‘sarcastic’, ‘disdainful’, and ‘nervous’ – as the experimental subjects. The manipulative key factors of facial expressions (eyebrows, eyes, pupils, mouth and head rotation) were used to create permutations and combinations and to make 81 stimuli of different facial expressions with a 3-D face model in order to conduct a survey. Next, we used Quantification Theory Type I to find the best combinations that participants agreed on as representing these adjectives. The conclusions of this research are that: (1) there are differences in adopting facial features between creating artificial characters' expressions and recognising real humans' expressions; (2) using survey and statistics can scientifically analyse viewers' cognition of facial expressions with form changing; and (3) the results of this research can promote designers' efficiency in working with subtler facial expressions.",

At this moment, an emergency medical technician in the United States is triaging an injured patient, deciding whether or not a patient requires care at a trauma center. This is a life or death decision. The profound importance of field triage has been reinforced by recent evidence that care at a trauma center lowers the risk of death by 25% for injured patients compared with treatment received at non-trauma centers.1",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article outlines the design of a system for dynamic real-time editing of online music video sequences, utilising probabilistic parameters and algorithmic decision-making for progression. It will explain how this system enables videos to be different every time they are accessed, thus providing users with an enhanced viewing experience and creators with a new tool for video composition. As the advancement of online technology influences habits of media consumers, user uptake of new technologies suggests that a transition away from video's prevalent mode of presentation, as a linear sequence of shots, is entirely possible. Factors such as viewer engagement and usability drive the need for ongoing exploration in the use of video for entertainment, information and advertisement. The production of a music video with generative methods is described in this article as a semi-automated process. Human tasks are not replaced by computational execution, but are shifted to become increasingly conceptual.",

Two works involving full body video portraits exhibited through large plasma screens in a variety of public settings are covered. Machinic mediations of video realism are considered in terms of embodied interaction in which viewer-participants contribute to the ‘disquiet’ of gendered figuring. Processural, proximal and personal aspects of responsive engagement are discussed. This is extended to performativity that may lead us to critical reflection of our own actions and responses in mixed reality arts.",

In this article we adopt a blend of rhetorical devices to present and discuss design fictions. We do this by referring to current discourses around drone technologies. We resituate these in the context of the networked city and the projection of a hybrid rogue drone. She is dissatisfied with her given functions and begins to question her deployment in urban policing. The article is based in the conceptual end of designing such a future city space. It refers to practical, popular and academic materials and citations to argue for the need for openness and clarity at the ideational end of developing design fictions. The text is part of a wider developmental and reflexive design–research process that takes up the speculative in design fictions and related hermeneutic design research.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Taking the Atlas Group (1989–2004) as a case study, this paper examines the aesthetic, political and technological possibilities of the digital archive. The Atlas Group is a fabricated digital archive founded by the Lebanese-American media artist Walid Raad, and it deals with the illusive history of the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1991). The digital takes an important role in Raad’s fictional archive, as it creates a tangible indexical fantasy that I would call the para-index. The para-index (an indexical sign without a referent) works to bring back Lebanon’s forgotten past by simulating / prefiguring its sensible form. Critic Rosalind Krauss calls this prefiguration of an aesthetic form within medium’s inherent technical property ‘the reinvention of the medium’ in this post-medium era. This paper aims to articulate how the Atlas Group reinvents the archive in this age of digital reproduction, and how this reinvention illuminate Lebanon’s unknown history.",

After achieving world fame at the Expo'67 in Montreal, this pioneering work of interactive narrative quickly disappeared from memory. Inspired by my own long-standing personal interest in interactive film, I set out to discover as much as possible about the Kinoautomat, with the ultimate aim of making an interactive DVD from the original materials. Although the process has involved considerable archaeology it has proved ultimately successful, and has had the additional result of fuelling a new dimension to my own personal work – the ‘live’ performance of an interactive film show called Cause and Effect in which the audience are encouraged to interact in various ways with the different films presented.",

    "abstract": "User-created content and social networking have proved to be the most fundamental elements that shape how and why people use the Internet today. One concept that stems from and combines these two motives is ‘metaverse’, 3-D user-created virtual worlds. During the last few years, we have witnessed the rise of several metaverse attempts, and a growing art community within them, due to the possibilities they offer for building creative content. This paper develops from the historical evolution of metaverse, and the dynamic and transformative relationship between art and information and communication technologies (ICT), which has so far transformed the spectator into participator, user, and even creator of both the artwork and content in the web. It discusses and further proposes a form of ‘meta-art’, the native art form of a future metaverse, which inherits this transformative interplay between art and ICT and already existing art expressions in the current metaversal worlds.",

    "title": "A Gadamerian approach to interpreting pain: model-making metaphors through embodied cognitive theory",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper will discuss how the conceptualization of embodied, abstract notions such as pain, which is multi-modal, non-visual and subjective, has the potential to be communicated visually using model making, as it is traditionally understood in the fields of architecture and design. We propose a new methodological approach to research where Gadamer’s [2004. Truth and Method. Continuum International Publishing Group] understanding of intersubjective interpretation used in conjunction with Simulation theory [Gallese, V., and A. Goldman. 1998. “Mirror Neurons and the Simulation Theory of Mind-Reading.” Trends in Cognitive Sciences 2 (12): 493–501] in embodied cognitive science, provides a strong framework in which to formulate a palette of materials and forms to visualize subjective experience. This novel approach to design research is currently being undertaken within the field of Health Sciences to produce metaphorically provocative, descriptive models of the lived experience of people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) to help bridge the gap in understanding between the sufferer and the public. This paper seeks to engage briefly with two questions integral to the research being undertaken: how does one understand another’s pain, and how can one conceptualize and communicate abstract notions such as pain visually using material and form as language?",

    "abstract": "Mika ‘Lumi’ Tuomola, director, dramaturge, concept-developer, researcher (and occasional performer) – Participatory Drama and Generative/ Procedural Interactive Storytelling for Digital Media. Mika ‘Lumi’ Tuomola, advisory board member of Digital Creativity since 1998, died on 5 June 2016 in Milan, where he took up his post as Associate Professor in the School of Design, Politecnico di Milano, in 2015. No simple list of work or publications can adequately memorialise Mika, who had a unique talent for grasping the potential of ideas and bringing together people to develop and implement them. His insistence on the highest aesthetic and artistic standards, supportive tenacity in realising projects and visionary contributions to ongoing debate, left a significant mark in the domain of ‘Participatory Drama and Generative/Procedural Interactive Storytelling for Digital Media’. Mika’s proactive stance on co-creation seemed to make fitting an ‘In Memoriam’ portrait which embodies and pays tribute to his own approach, by bringing together the thoughts of some of the many he inspired, helped and influenced over two decades. Mika Tuomola told me he identified his Finnish cyber-name ‘Lumi’ (‘Snow’) with the snow leopard – ‘lumileopardi’: ‘rare and beautiful’ (National Geographic Online 2016), able to ‘leap six times the length of its body’, while ‘a long tail provides balance and agility and also wraps around the resting snow leopard as protection from the cold’ (World Wildlife Fund Online 2016). Mika was a leaper, in ideas and art, seemingly unaware of boundaries. The limitless regions of cyberspace suited him, while in the real world he was balanced and warmed by collaborators, students and colleagues of all ages and backgrounds. Mika saw every person as an individual, fostering talent and developing potential.",

    "title": "The development of computer‐based tools to support ergonomics in design education and practice",
    "abstract": "Abstract Ergonomics is not always used effectively by practising designers, and is still seen as limiting their creativity. Reasons for this include: ergonomics information is not presented in a readily assimilated form to designers during their design education and later design activities; design decisions relating to ergonomics issues are not addressed and discussed systematically by all members of the design team during concept design; the user centred approach that ergonomics encourages in design is not always included as part of the education of future designers. With computers being used more widely in design and design education, they could be used to deliver ergonomics information and help structure discussion of ergonomics issues amongst the design team from the earliest stages of design. This paper describes findings relating to the use of ergonomics in automotive design, and proposes two tools which could enhance the use of ergonomics in design education and in current and future design practice.",

    "abstract": "Young teenagers are as concerned as ever about changing society and their own situation, even though they turn their backs on organised politics in favour of one-issue organisations and other vehicles for action. The role of public service broadcast media in these processes is not well understood, particularly in relation to the rapid development of digital media and their intrinsic qualities. Based on a sociological and media-cultural analysis, we propose a conceptual design for Avatopia, a virtual community intended to provide the means for non-violent societal action among young teenagers. Avatopia is based on four cornerstones: cross-media presence (including public service broadcast TV), a strategy for seeding the community, collective narration as a vehicle for action, and a custom-designed avatar world (a 3D-graphical 'place' on the Internet where participants are represented visually and can communicate verbally) providing necessary tools and structures. A qualitative assessment of our design concept yields a set of expected benefits, anticipated risks and success criteria informing our further development.",

    "title": "Designing infrastructures for creative engagement",
    "abstract": "Abstract As museums extend their scope beyond traditional exhibition spaces and into everyday practices and institutions, it is necessary to develop suitable conceptualisations of how technology can be understood and designed. To this end, I propose the concept of infrastructures, as both social and material, as a useful frame for discussing important challenges and opportunities in terms of designing for audience engagement. I further argue that when designing infrastructures, an important challenge is to develop the social aspects of infrastructures in terms of creating, maintaining and developing relationships between organisations and communities. I argue that this is as much an object of design as technical interactive systems and discuss the relational work undertaken in this activity. The ideas of infrastructure and relational work is illustrated through a case describing the design of a system for cultural heritage engagement for Danevirke museum covering issues relating to the Danish minority in northern Germany.",

    "title": "Performances of the self",
    "abstract": "This article is an eclectic presentation of the self-portrait in its different forms and functions throughout the history of art with an emphasis on the performances of the self. The term self-portrait first appeared alongside the birth of Humanism in Western Europe and was a result of the artists ‘recognising themselves’ as individuals. The function of the self-portrait as affirmation of professional status for the artist was first employed by Renaissance painters but is also the case for photojournalists of the 1930s. Self-portrait as autobiography was used in connection with visibility politics to explore identities socially and culturally stereotyped. In digital photography artists acted as ‘masters of disguise’ in a campaign of collage mastering. Finally, the self-portrait in the case of the anew-constructed subjectivity wandered off visual representation, towards networked constitution. In the networked self-portrait, the textual manifestation of the self is based on process rather than final product and the ‘true’ self loses relevance.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the collaborative evolution of a digital system to provide support for landscape architects and other design professionals in storing, encountering and retrieving large bodies of 'inspirational objects', mostly in the form of images. The system combines visual 'weak indexing' of objects through placing them in a visual environment, with easy-to-use methods for allocating keywords to objects on a variety of dimensions. The system design is informed by ethnographic observations of landscape architects' work, and by experience gained with earlier prototypes. The features of the system are described, and illustrated with a scenario of use in landscape architectural work.",

Through CloudPad users are able to view a documentation, edit a version of it, and record their own comments in response to it. Whether users may have created and/or experienced a particular work, or whether they may simply wish to consult a work's documentation, their journey through these records and annotations are subsumed into the work's documentation, thus augmenting the ‘original’ artwork's field of social engagement. Before discussing CloudPad in detail, we proceed to explain how recent debates in performance documentation influenced our methodology and development, and the general challenges of mixed reality documentation that CloudPad aims to address.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Kahden vaiheilla is an experimental interactive television programme developed and produced in early 2006 at the Media Lab of the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The 15-minute drama, controlled by a computational engine under the influence of multi-channel input from the viewers, was demonstrated to audiences who were able to change the show in real-time by sending SMS messages, sending emails, or writing ‘chat’ comments on the program's website. These communication channels have been fully integrated into the visual narrative, selected messages from the audience being ‘embedded’ into the actual visual scenes that are broadcast, avoiding clumsy text overlays and making the interactivity more believable. This paper examines the project in depth, and places it in the context of other related works. Audience feedback from the ‘live’ presentation will be discussed, followed by a critical appraisal of the results and a discussion of the future development of the project.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article introduces Pulse Project (2011–), a doctoral performance research project that engages in critical discourse between art and science through the creation of digital soundscapes that weave together artistic, medical, technological, ancient and modern methodologies. Pulse ‘reading’, case histories, notations of pulses and programming soundscape compositions are all used together as methods for exploring the cultural encounter between artist, participants and diverse medical practices. Pulse Project seeks to provide an examination of the means with which the temporal materiality of touch can be used together with audio programming to form a translation and synthesis of different ecologies and disciplines, e.g. medicine and art, Eastern and Western practices, touch and digitality, etc. Drawing upon my experience as a clinical acupuncturist (with training in biomedicine), I use Chinese pulse diagnostics together with SuperCollider (an audio synthesis programming language) to inform the composition process of each soundscape. In this way, Pulse Project interrogates the aesthetic and philosophical axioms underpinning contemporary medicine, technology and cognitive embodiment through the exploration of their corollary ‘others’—traditional Chinese medicine and music theory—in order to generate a fresh approach to embodiment and soundscape composition.",

This article discusses findings from a recent promenade initiative, commissioned for a UK arts festival, along with a review of literature, to critically engage with growing evidence of the diverse ways in which technology is integrated at direct user level. Concepts of ‘hybrid spaces’ and ‘user agency’ are discussed, along with the ‘performativity’ of spaces. Central to the discussion is the function of narrative in engaging the participant to construct new perspectives, which are facilitated by the mediating role of personal media devices between subject, narrative, space and community.",

    "abstract": "One consequence of current technological advances is that we can imbue everyday objects such as our fridges, ovens, fires, doors, thermostats, tvs and stereos with processing power. Not only will this enable them to make decisions based on their current state and model of the world about their current behaviour (the oven may automatically turn itself off when there is an excess of smoke) it will also allow communication with others to make decisions (the fridge may choose to defrost some vegetables when the phone communicates that there is a recent message from a friend who is, unexpectedly, intending to show for some dinner). This leads to the notion of ambient intelligence where intelligent computational entities are interwoven into the very fabric of our lives. We envisage a scenario where music devices cannot only make intelligent, sympathetic decisions about sound generation in order to satiate the particular sound requirements of a user, but would also interact with other devices both musical and otherwise in a massively dynamic and unpredictable environment. We also envisage that there will be a massive shift in the pattern of behaviour relating to music consumption; a move from the passive consumer to the active creator. The emerging field of computer science which is concerned with building systems which are inherently distributed, dynamic, open and social in this sense is known as intelligent agents. Whilst we are quite clear that we are in the very early tentative stages of this work, we nevertheless set out some realistic medium-term achievable functionalities for what we call intelligent embedded music, where intelligent, interactive music generation could continually and dynamically surround and sustain our day to day existence. We call this the intelligent HiFi (iHiFi).",

Similarly, a renewed sense of complicity in our socio-technical environments has encouraged scholars from a range of design, humanities, and social science disciplines to engage more directly in public-facing work, often through prototyping, exhibitions, and hands-on educational activities. This special issue on hybrid pedagogies contributes to this developing and ongoing conversation in a resolutely interdisciplinary way.",

    "title": "Storytelling by computer",
    "abstract": "Abstract In common with designing programs to pass the Turing Test, story generation is an aspect of artificial intelligence that has popular appeal but has never been regarded as a core research activity. But storytelling is an activity that characterises human intelligence, and computational story writing offers new perspectives on human and digital creativity. This paper reviews work at the University of Sussex and elsewhere on story generation. It describes the main approaches, based on story grammars and character plans, and discusses their limitations. Although the results so far are unimpressive, the process of designing such programs is worthwhile. The modest successes indicate facets of creativity that can be described in computational terms. The failures reveal aspects of creative writing, such as tellability, that have previously received little attention, in a form that can be examined and systematically manipulated. The computational techniques developed for story generation could form the ba...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flying Cities is an artistic installation which generates imaginary cities from the speech of its visitors. Thanks to an original interactive process analysing people's vocal input to create 3D graphics, a tangible correspondence between speech and visuals opens new possibilities of interaction. This cross-modal interaction not only supports our artistic messages, but also aims at providing anyone with a pleasant and stimulating feedback from her/his speech activity. As the feedback we have received when presenting Flying Cities was very positive, our objective is now to cross the bridge between art and a potential application. We believe that it could become a new medium for creativity and a way to visually perceive a vocal performance in the context of the rehabilitation of people with reduced mobility or language impairments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Very young non- or hardly-speaking children with severe disabilities need active guidance to stimulate interaction with their environment in order to develop their communicative and linguistic skills. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems can help this process, provided that they are tuned to this specific user group. LinguaBytes is a research programme, which aims at developing an interactive and adaptive educational toy that stimulates the language and communicative skills of multiple-handicapped children with a developmental age of 1–4 years. In this article we show which guidelines we consider essential for developing this tool. We have developed several concepts based on these guidelines, of which we elucidate Explorascope (E-scope). E-scope consists of a tangible toy-like interface that is adaptable to an individual child with respect to his or her cognitive, linguistic, emotional and perceptual-motor skills. A first user test shows that E-scope is promising and useful for this user group.",

    "title": "Doing thinking: revisiting computing with artistic research and technofeminism",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper, we explore how artistic research and its methodologies can create new modes of thinking and research on computational issues. We draw on experiences with the research project ‘Reconfiguring Computing Through Cyberfeminism and New Materialism’ (CF+), during which we collaboratively investigated modes and methods of knowledge production in computing. Cyberfeminist legacies and new materialism provided a historically informed and theoretically rigorous set of concerns around which artistic research and computing were brought together. We discuss collaborative experiments and three hybrid methodologies – creating situations for intra-action, diffractive reading/making and material speculation – that we employed and suggest that what emerged is a kind of ‘doing thinking’ as a material-speculative practice that re-positions research as a critical open-ended space for non-standard ways of knowing. The paper explores implications of this for ethics and responsibility in computing, materiality of knowledge production and modes of interdisciplinary collaborations.",

This paper presents some of the findings and issues arising from the research project, including the negative attitudes of students who felt their creativity was constrained by working to design guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper concerns certain aspects of writing in the computer era, aspects that are relevant to linguists but should also be of interest to people working with computer graphics and the human‐computer interface. Technology changes patterns of communication by introducing new means of communication, but it also changes our notion of human communication. This can be noted from the history of writing: different writing systems seem to have inspired different conceptions of human language. Here, notions of what constitutes writing and written signs will be focussed on. The paper discusses how the material properties of writing affect the pattern of communication particularly at the ‘low’ level where signs are recognised and processed. Special attention is given to colour and animation in texts: the possibilities provided by a computerised writing surface are contrasted with a recently proposed theory of writing where spatiality (but not visuality) and stability are seen as the primary physical facto...",

    "abstract": "NURBS (non-uniform rational b-spline) modelling has become a ubiquitous tool within architectural design praxis. In this article I examine three projects that utilise NURBS modelling as a means for which a musical system's inherent spatiality is visualised. There are numerous precedents for which architectural form is a derivation of a musical system, or a musical system is proportionally informed by architectonic gesture. I propose in this article three NURBS modelling methodologies: for the spatial analysis of Karlheinz Stockhausen's sound projection geometries in Pole für 2; for a spatial realisation of John Cage's indeterminate work Variations III; and for the generation of a surface manifold informed by musically derived soundscape data from the Japanese garden Kyu Furukawa Teien. Rather than seeking to translate music into inhabitable architecture, or architectonic form into music, I highlight an approach that produces an interstitial territory between discourses on architecture and music analysis.",

    "abstract": "Welcome to the special issue on Ludic Engagement Designs for All – LEDA 2007. The papers selected for this special issue of Digital Creativity are all based on presentations made at the inaugural international symposium LEDA, which was hosted at Esbjerg Institute of Technology, Aalborg University, Denmark in November 2007. All papers have added new material in the light of discussions, editors and referees’ comments, and further work. The symposium had a focus on users’ interactive play and learning experiences when engaged in playing with toys. The concept ‘toy’ was broadly defined and the papers dealt with a variety of physical and virtual artefacts, such as outdoor digital toys, interactive, adaptive, educational toys, video games, computergenerated environments, interactive installations. The symposium was a cross-disciplinary event and as such it represented a diversity of voices, which indeed created a mutual, refreshing and thought-provoking atmosphere. This was possible only due to the knowledgeable, passionate and playful contributions from the symposium delegates (presenters and audience – including curious and enthusiastic students). These circumstances shaped exciting discussions and new understandings, but it also brought challenging questions regarding traditional definitions, theories and methods in relation to the design of toys and play situations – some of those will be presented in this special issue with the intention to provide a framework within which designers, technology specialists, and play specialists can work together. This is crucial as all are necessary threads and mutual contributors in order to understand the diversity of users, how they play and learn with and through toys in specific situations and contexts, and hence how the toys can be designed to make the play and learning most beneficial for all users; all in all, this signifies dynamic relationships and multi-faceted problems that requires multiand interdisciplinary teams in the further development of this field. Consequently, ‘ludic engagement designs for all’ not only concerns giving form to existing ideas or toys already imagined. ‘Ludic engagement designs for all’ is a concept where ludic engagement and design converge and thereby direct the focus towards the design of playful processes and social relations, rather than merely products. This is in line with Kress and van Leeuwen’s (2001) social semiotic perspective where design is a way to configure communicative resources and social interaction. The choice of converging ludic engagement and design can be seen as an intention to give way to new understandings of design as well as of ludic engagement; both aspects can be considered as resources for learning. Thus, design is a necessity for designers and engineers who develop toys, for play specialists who design environments and processes for play and learning, and for users who designs their own play and learning paths. The theme of the symposium does not only articulate the connection between ludic engagement and design, but also highlights the term ‘for all’ (designs for all). Why? This is mainly to address an interest which emphasises a wider cultural respect for the individual and the inherent human diversity. This means, when discussing issues about toys, design, play and learning for the future also implies a decision on what kind of life and society we want these products and processes to support. Crucial to this is the question of encouraging an active dialogue between industry, stakeholders and the research community. Economic, business and legal factors are all important when it comes to their implications on the cultural respect for the individual. This divergence and idiosyncratic focus can be seen as reflecting changes within the field of Digital Creativity 2008, Vol. 19, No. 3, pp. 141–144",

    "title": "Mime-based creative drama implementations for exploring gestural interaction",
    "abstract": "We observed that students are used to employ the graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as icons and texts in gestural interaction designs, depending on their prior experiences. However, prior knowledge of GUI design often leads the students to create cliché and impractical designs for gestural interaction. To solve the problem, our study aims to explore feedback as an alternative education method, enhanced by an exercise we call ‘gestural shadow mapping’, which is based on the art of mime, within the concept of creative drama. Using a basic setup for shadow representation, a group of design students practised expressing prepared visual compositions as gestural shadow maps for an audience of their peers. After several observations, feedback showed that the method based on gestural shadow mapping does afford students a better understanding of gestural interaction, free from the inhibitions of their prior experiences of GUIs and the limitations of current commercial examples.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Using ethnographic vignettes from the development of simulations for architectural design and spatial planning in university contexts, this article discusses how the material, embodied, and tacit dimensions of developing and doing research with simulations can be opened up to analysis. We ask how (in)visibility comes to matter in simulations and how it is made and unmade in different situations. In particular, we explore how specific enactments of the things that are simulated and the practices involved in producing and handling them are rendered (in)visible through the simulation process. We argue that focusing on the politics of (in)visibility in making simulations can render power relations underpinning architectural and spatial planning practices more apparent.",

    "title": "Introduction to Mobile ubiquity in public and private spaces",
    "abstract": "It has been more than fifteen years since Mark Weiser’s and his Xerox Parc colleagues’ seminal and trans-disciplinary work on a vision for a ‘calm’ and human-centred kind of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) for the twenty-first century. Although its ongoing realisation is in a number of respects quite different from the original vision, that vision is now considerably more of an actual fact. Its very realisation, as well as the differences, are due in part to interim economic and technical advances, such as affordable, multifaceted microscale sensors and actuators and an expansion of decentralised networking capacities via new Internet protocol practices for the billions of computational entities worldwide, thus paving the way for an adequate ubicomp infrastructure and an actual Internet of Things. Partly, ubicomp has become real in new and different ways because a miniaturisation of components and a global cultural acceptance in practice have permitted mobile wireless devices (such as mobile phones, iPods and other MP3 players (Bull 2007), PDAs and Blackberrys, iPads, notebooks) to achieve an unprecedented distributed pervasiveness—outnumbering humans globally, perhaps only superseded technically by embedded computational units. Ubicomp infrastructures, stationary units and mobile devices continue to form new hybrid platforms, converging in ever-extending cultures of connective systems available through wireless networks as well as landline broadband networks—as in current cloud computing initiatives. In its cultural practices the resulting third wave of computing continues to permeate and break down traditional modern boundaries of space and time, not least any clear-cut distinctions of the near and the far, the now and the past, the private and the public sense of space and time (Augé 1995, Bogard 2007, Colebrook 2004, Crang and Thrift 2000, De Landa 2007, Dourish 2006, Featherstone 2008, Habermas et al. 2004, Lefebvre 2004, Lefebvre and Goonewardena 2008, Manovich 2006, Massumi 1995, Thrift 2008, Willams et al. 2005). Insofar as ubicomp leads to a growing inherence or an immanence of our life form, its technological platforms sink deeper into the skin of human agency—often, if not always, receding from conscious perception and sensation into a peripheral background . . . Since its early inception as part of the technologies being deployed through digital media, ubicomp has led to remarkable alterations of our ways of being in the world (Morley 2004). Combining with social and personalised mobile media, as well as with physical tangible interfaces, ubicomp, pervasive computing or ambient intelligence has generated a flow of innovative technocultural developments saturating even the most innocuous activities of our everyday life: the time keeping of daily routines; our communications with family, friends, and colleagues; our performance in work-related Digital Creativity 2011, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 127–133",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper will review electronic music and sonic art applications of Cellular automata (CA) in a historical and technical context. Algorithmic and computational processes have been of interest to artists for many years, creating an emerging culture of generative electronic art. Creating patterns and sequences is necessary for the creative artist working spatially and temporally within a chosen medium. CA are capable of a wide variety of emergent behaviours and represent an important generative tool for the artist. The sonic artist and musician must be prepared to investigate the theoretical background of CA in order to successfully employ their vast behaviour space within compositional strategy. There is an extensive amount of mathematical and scientific literature relating to CA, however much of this is esoteric or difficult to understand. Important and accessible CA concepts are presented concisely in a non mathematical context to give sufficient background for the review. There have been several approaches at applying CA in the production of electronic music and sonic art. Examples exist in the fields of overall structural composition, MIDI sequencing and sound synthesis/modification techniques. Applications from academic, independent and commercial sectors will be critically reviewed in an artistic, historical and technical context. This will provide the artist and scientist with a balanced view of this emerging field.",

    "abstract": "As video games increasingly become an important frame of reference and as they are more and more taken seriously in education and research, there is a growing need for a methodological tool for video game analysis. In this paper, rhetorical theory in general and pentadic analysis in particular are introduced as useful means to stimulate a critical approach to video games. A case study is presented in which a popular video game (Bioshock) is analysed using this rhetorical approach. It is argued that pentadic analysis can overcome a number of binary discussions within the contemporary field of video game criticism, thus offering interesting perspectives for research and education (e.g. as a reflection tool).",

    "abstract": "The dome form has long embodied literal and metaphorical interpretations of the cosmic order. In cultures throughout the world, its symbolic significance has been intimately related to processes of observing, mapping and visualising patterns on the celestial screen. Though the notion of a solid celestial sphere was shattered in the Western imagination over the course of the Scientific Revolution, the dome continued to be associated with interpretations of the heavens. As dome theaters incorporated projection technologies in the twentieth century, they were used to simulate the apparent motions of the stars across the night sky as well as visualise cosmic journeys through artistic representations of the cosmos. In recent years, the introduction of digital technologies have enabled dome theatres to visualise virtual tours through the Digital Universe Atlas, claimed to be the ‘most complete and accurate 3-D atlas of the Universe’. However, instead presenting this as a purely objective view of astronomical data, I describe how interactive examinations of this new cosmic model can reveal the inherently situated nature of all observations. I propose a transdisciplinary approach to interpreting this new cosmic model within immersive domed environments to phenomenologically demonstrate the complex interplay of factors that invariably shape humanity's perspectives on the cosmos.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the idea of a new kind of web search tool that uses the literary and philosophical idea of pataphysics as a conceptual framework in order to return creative results. Pataphysics, the science of exceptions and imaginary solutions, can be directly linked to creativity and is therefore very suitable to guide the transformation from relevant into creative search results. To enable pataphysical algorithms within our system we propose the need for a new type of system architecture. We discuss a component-based software architecture that would allow the flexible integration of the new algorithms at any stage or location and the need for an index suitable to handle patadata, data which have been transformed pataphysically. This tool aims to generate surprising, novel and provocative search results rather than relevant ones, in order to inspire a more creative interaction that has applications in both creative work and learning contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reflects on issues regarding the uses of computers in augmenting musical improvisation. It engages questions regarding the nature of the computer and its potential for creativity. Social constructions get reflected in creative tools and approaches. Of significance are attitudes to mind/body dualism. In the light of computers seen as instruments, Artificial Life is suggested as reflecting a useful approach, particularly in light of a methodology which stresses a view of life as embodied and situated in an environment. The paper concludes with a discussion of Mark Trayle's (1991) work as an example of computers in augmenting improvisation in this context.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines the thematic scope and media-specific characteristics of media art by analysing it through one of this art exhibitions practices: the annual specialized media art exhibitions–festivals–conferences. An overview of media art terminology and a study of the evolution of technological art festivals provide a framework for exploring the themes of the three major festivals, Ars Electronica, SIGGRAPH, and the RIXC Art Science Festival. Comparative and contrastive analysis of the data has revealed that in many cases the festivals address specific themes in their calls for submissions of papers and artworks. This allows for a better assessment of the place of technology-oriented media art in the overall mainstream contemporary art and opens up a space for discussions about the pending recognition of media art that can broaden the thematic range of the entire art field.",

    "abstract": "(Interactive) cinema is introduced as a model system for describing mind, inspired by Antonio Damasio’s approach (1999, 2002) to emotions and the conscious self. Damasio harnesses ‘movie’ as a metaphor for the integrated, unified composite of sensory images—visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory; the multimedia-show he calls mind. Assuming emotion to be the foundation of any cognitive act, cinema is discussed as a metaphoric externalisation of embodied mind. This discussion creates a novel dialogue between the contemporary philosophy of embodied mind by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (1999), and the practice-based cinematic thinking of Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein (from the first half of the 20th century). The work Eisenstein did in order to construct an organic unity of cinematic form serves as the point of departure for an attempt to model the (interactive) film research project Obsession.",

The paper portrays the different approaches that were taken to address these goals over a period of seven years, as well as the educational activities, compositions and performances that were conducted with the controller. The description follows three chronological development phases titled ‘Fireflies’, ‘Nerve’ and ‘iltur’ and addresses the improvements in hardware and software that were made in each phase based on observations and user feedback. The paper concludes with a comparative summary of the three development phases and a final note regarding the controller's future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Writing practices that integrate dynamic and interactive strategies into the making and reading of digital texts are proliferating as more of our reading experiences are mediated through the screen. We argue that rarely do current approaches to creating digital texts operate at the basic textual level of the letterform itself, and that this neglect is partially due to the fact that current font technology is based on print paradigms that make it difficult to work programmatically at the level of individual letters. Work produced in our lab suggests the creative possibilities in being able to easily specify behaviours at such a level, and leads us to propose that writers, typographers and programmers start thinking beyond Postscript-like formats such as OpenType or TrueType to collaboratively develop a new ComplexType format (or formats) that is designed for the twenty-first century as opposed to a simulation of the fifteenth.",

    "title": "Understanding performative behaviour within content-rich Digital Live Art",
    "abstract": "Abstract Research into human–computer interaction (HCI) has traditionally been concerned with users' abilities to complete tasks at desk-bound computers. However, recent research into Digital Live Art (Sheridan 2006) and audiences' engagement with interactive art focuses on ‘non task-based uses of computing’ (Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007, 13), such as the user experience. As computing becomes more mobile, wireless and tangible, there is a shift to understand the needs of ‘users as performers’ (ibid.). As a result, research has begun to draw on the methods and theories in the performing arts to better understand these needs. However, much of this research into interactive art focuses on playful or physical experiences of users, and fails to address work with social content and themes to be communicated. This is a critical analysis of Sheridan's framework for understanding performative behaviour with technologically mediated interactive art (Sheridan 2006; Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007). By applying the framework to works with rich thematic content, our findings indicate that the framework needs refining in order to better understand the ways in which users engage with interactive artworks of this kind.",

For an empirical study to analyse the cognitive influence of VR sketching, we conducted a pilot study for empirical research based on the protocol analysis of designers’ cognitive activities in VR sketching and compared the results with those of traditional sketching. Spatial inspection was a key behavioural factor of VR sketching when considering its high-frequency repetitive and continuous interactions with a designer's representation activities throughout the concept generation process. The cognitive impact of VR sketching revealed the following decisive features: extension of solution space, enhancement of idea transformation and inducement to a holistic design approach for concept generation. These findings provide insight for understanding the cognitive role of advanced digital design tools for future design research.",

    "title": "Designing digital and creative scaffolds to strengthen Indigenous nations: being Wiradjuri by practising sovereignty",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The proliferation of digitally mediated DIY practices constitutes new modalities of political expression and participation, shaping how citizenship is enacted and performed. However, our paper begins by problematizing concepts of citizenship in media and communication contexts that only speaks to identity-formation. For Indigenous Australians, citizenship does not need to be asserted or constructed—they are sovereign and they have never ceded their land, rights or identity. Pursuing this argument, we share insights of various digital and creative scaffolds that are being designed with Wiradjuri people as continuous ‘infrastructuring’ to express and practice Wiradjuri sovereignty. This exploration is enabling a political identity to form and creating multiple places to be Wiradjuri together. We also discuss how designing digital and creative scaffolds can be considered as a meeting place of sovereigns, to attend to a consciousness that non-Indigenous people are also practising their own sovereignty in relation to respecting Indigenous sovereignty/ies.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Scholars and activists have studied social movement media for its potential to challenge dominant narratives, build community relationships and create social change. This paper presents a case study of two short-form documentary projects with Black Lives Matter 5280 and the Service Employees International Union, Local 105 in Denver, Colorado to explore how collaborative media-making projects assist in building local grassroots campaigns of racial and economic justice. The communication strategies as well as the distribution efforts via online social networks and community screenings are discussed in order to analyse how documentaries rely upon personal narratives to animate members and allies’ feelings and then connect them with traditional forms of organizing like community meetings and public demonstrations. The participatory aspects of filmmaking are viewed through democratic theory, which emphasizes the social relations of citizenship and shared communal values over material and cultural resources, rather than visual aesthetics or technical processes.",

    "title": "<i>ReActivities</i> <sup>©</sup>: autism and play",
    "abstract": "Abstract ReActivities © are digital play sequences which encourage the integration of social, emotional and cognitive development in children on the autistic spectrum. High levels of anxiety in autistic children can inhibit playful experiences and increase the rigid, stereotypical and challenging behaviours which have a negative effect in social situations. Interactions with objects that offer repetition, pattern and similarity combined with colour and rhythm are regularly used by autistic children as methods to reduce anxiety. However little has been done to interpret these sensations in digital environments. The aim of ReActivities © has been to offer a rich physical and cognitive experience which simulates the perceptible characteristics of phenomena such as elasticity, velocity, gravity and inertia. This is an advanced form of cause and effect that promises a unique form of expression in response to exploration with computer technology. There are numerous thoughtful and engaging websites designed and maintained by autistic people which are testimony to the theory that computers, and particularly electronic networks, offer enormous possibilities for creativity, communication and fun. The project is utilising open source technology to enable autistic users, many of whom are already conversant with programming languages, to adapt and re-generate the software. Fostering a community approach to development affords further opportunities to explore an innovative, inclusive design method that, should it prove successful, could provide a model for other marginalised groups.",

    "title": "A proposal of virtual museum metaverse content for the MZ generation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents a marketing study of the metaverse's potential audience, particularly focusing on museums' use of cyberspace and how some of their physical functions can be replicated online. Among digital transformations, the metaverse has become one of the most significant alternatives to offline events, with museum exhibitions highly representative of it. However, existing virtual museums fail to attract the MZ generation despite the opportunities arising from their contactless lifestyle. Therefore, this study aims to create new content suggestions that the MZ generation positively reacts to and becomes involved in. This research was conducted through five methods: a literature review, case studies, survey, persona creation, and in-depth interviews. According to the market segmentation and strategy (MS&S) technique, two types of responses were used to create and target two types of personas of potential users—‘explorative persona' and ‘entertaining persona’. This study thus suggests three future directions and content for metaverse virtual museums to better target the MZ generation: technical development for users of both personas, user creation content to enhance user participation for the users of explorative persona, and more active marketing through various community for the users of entertaining persona.",

    "abstract": "Asperger's Syndrome (AS) is an autistic spectrum disorder characterised by normal to high IQ but with marked impairment in social skills. Successful social skills training appears to be best achieved either in situ or in role-play situations where users can explore different outcomes resulting from their social behaviour. Single user virtual environments (SVEs) provide an opportunity for users with AS to learn social interaction skills in a safe environment which they can visit as many times as they like.The use of game-like tasks can provide an incentive and can also be used to guide the user through progressive learning stages. Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) allow several users to interact simultaneously within the virtual environment, each taking different perspectives or role-play characters. Within the AS interactive project a series of SVEs and CVEs have been developed in collaboration with users and professional groups with an overall aim of supporting social skills learning. Initial evaluation studies have been carried out which have been used to both inform and refine the design of these virtual environments (VEs) as well as giving an insight into the understanding and interpretation of these technologies by users with AS.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The goal of this article is to discuss and analyse viewer-sensing artworks and the reversed situation that occurs in the exhibition space when artworks ‘look’ at the viewers or sense them by other means. This helps answer the following questions: do we have here a new spectator paradigm in which the artwork is active and no longer simply an object under observation? Can we talk about the ‘gaze’ of the artwork? To answer these questions I firstly examine the topics of machine vision, computer vision, biovision and the evolution of vision. Dividing interactive artworks into four categories (distant, contact, bio-based/symbiotic and chance-based interaction) enables me to illustrate the developments in feedback systems which became evident in recent decades. These categories exemplify how the artwork’s ‘gaze’ approaches the body of the viewer until it penetrates its surface and reaches ‘under the skin’.",

Defining design museums as sites of meaning-making through diverse interactions and co-creative experiences, we examine dialogue as a means of encouraging visitors' active participation and creative engagement in design exhibitions. This article presents a theoretical framework based on Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of dialogism and carnival theory. Four kinds of dialogic engagement are identified to illustrate different ways of engagement and co-creation in design museums through the analysis of example exhibitions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article documents and reflects upon a pedagogical project aimed at fostering critical engagements with technology in the context of a graduate research and learning laboratory at the nexus of computer science, design, engineering, and architecture. With the notions of critical technical practice and reflective practice as touchstones, the project links a specific tradition of twentieth century design pedagogy to critical sensibilities drawn from the field of science and technology studies (STS) in a space we call the ‘research studio.’ The methods and examples presented illustrate how this hybrid pedagogical model can cultivate the critical imagination of learners – their ability to place critical and sociohistorical reflection at the centre of creative technology design – and show that the fields of design and STS offer distinct but mutually enriching traditions of learning and research. The article offers insight to educators and researchers across STEM and humanities fields interested in engaging with technologies not merely as subjects but also as vehicles of scholarly and creative inquiry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the observation that highly limiting, creative decisions of voluntary self-binding that radically prune the design solution space may in fact fuel and accelerate the process toward an innovative final design. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints’ based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two definitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two definitional conditions to three media façade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative domains and disciplines.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Light Harvest is an interactive sculptural installation that explores a protein called Light-Harvesting Complex II (LHCII) in the realm of materials, digital fabrication, projection mapping and interaction design. This article gives an account of the making of Light Harvest, a collaboration between an artist/designer, a structural biologist, and an interaction design technologist. The artistic concepts in material construction and digital techniques are drawn from protein folding, sophisticated mapping processes in protein X-ray crystallography, and the remarkable abilities of LHCI proteins to convert full-spectrum visible sunlight to useful energy for life. Through its interactive installation, Light Harvest engages us in an appreciation and understanding of the biological processes studied and the scientific techniques used to study them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In an increasingly digital world, art is transferred from a physical to a virtual space. This essay examines three effects of this digitisation (conversion of physical into virtual content) and digitalisation (processing of digitised content) on the consumption of art. In particular, it analyses to what extent digital art space democratises, educates and socialises the way in which art is consumed. These three effects are critically assessed by a review of literature, studies and projects. As a result, digitisation democratises by making art collections accessible without time, money or location barriers. This, however, excludes audiences from underdeveloped areas. The implementation of digital technology in museums enhances an active engagement with art, thereby fostering art education, which yet increases the importance and difficulty of content management. And whilst finally the communication of museums with their audiences through social media potentially enlarges their sphere of activity, this socialising trend is still in their infancy within the art world.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research focuses on the social-spatial relationship between device and subject and identifies the possibilities that digital technology lets listeners perform as listening modalities, such as individual listening, mobility, and multimedia listening. Analyzing the most relevant specialized literature, this work explores the socio-technological origins of current possibilities of listening to classify them as ‘innovative change’ or ‘substantial improvement’. A sound reproduction device timeline and their contributions determine what the enrichment of the digital era to the act of listening is and what reasonable future trends are to be expected. The digital era does not add any new possibility to the social-spatial act of listening itself. Nevertheless, the digital era has prepared the technological basis for a new leap that would tend toward hyperpersonalization and the maximization of operative easiness. This research shows how digital has made great progress ‘inside’ devices functioning, but not so much ‘outside’ them.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper, I explore the politics of engagement in environmental games from a political theatre theory perspective. Specifically, I focus on digital environmental games developed with classrooms in mind, and examine player interaction as politicized through the lens of Boalian theatre. To this end, I overview gaming as an intervention tool in the form of serious, environmental games. Next, I introduce the poetics of Boal’s TO, and connect its aim to restore theatre as a popular form of conversation and discussion to the aspiration of digital environmental games to develop an eco-friendly outlook. I build upon a rule-based approach to computer game rhetoric, and analyze how environmental games use rules as a rhetorical tool to create a pro-environmental statement. Lastly, I suggest that players in environmental games are not mere game players but rather ‘spect-actors’.",

An interface was designed to simultaneously present audio and visual feedback stimuli. The child had low mobility of upper limbs, was in a wheelchair and had a short attention span. Sessions took place over a six month period. The first thirteen sessions were analysed. Quality of movement control improved across sessions as well as the quality of the sound produced, revealing growing intentionality on music production. Independent assessments made by the multidisciplinary team of therapists who were delivering rehabilitation services to the child revealed gains in most behavioural skills.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, most video-game characters did not reflect our everyday life for the simple reason that most of them were trolls, aliens, and monsters. However, this has changed since the introduction of The Sims (Wright 2000), the people simulator. Nevertheless, characters in this game are still flat since The Sims simulates life in a Disneyland-like way, avoiding ideological conflicts. Encouraged by authors like Brenda Laurel and Janet Murray, video-game designers have been taking for granted that a high level of agency and immersion are desirable effects. However, I will show that alternative, non-Aristotelian techniques could be used to develop character-driven video games that enhance critical thinking about ideological issues and social conflicts while keeping the experience enjoyable. I will do this by borrowing some concepts from Bertolt Brecht's and Augusto Boal's ideas on non-Aristotelian theatre and applying them to video-game design. In this paper, I propose that a modified version of The Sims would allow players to create behavioural rules for their characters that reflect their personal opinions. Like in Boal's Forum Theatre, this game would foster critical discussion about social and personal problems.",

The author defines a new understanding of the role of complexity in design. The paper reviews theories in design and HCI related to reflective practice, context, and embodied interaction. A case story of practice in interaction design and museums is presented as a practice-based investigation of the complex. The paper calls for the framing of larger research agendas in this area with the need to further work on issues of context, reflective practice, embodiment and human activity in order to provide a more comprehensive and integral view of design activity. The paper concludes with the need to reframe concerns in design in order to emphasise situated participation, non-rational design strategies, in situ design and a re-orientation in focus from tasks to experience.",

We demonstrate how the amount of relative attention paid to key subjects of narrativeimportance may guide the outcome of a narrative branching. An experiment was conducted to test the operation of gaze guided film. The experiment involved 11 subjects influencing a two-minute film clip by gaze in two scenarios. In the first case subjects were aware that gaze could be used to control the narrative, and in the second case the subjects were unaware of this control. The outcome was found to be quite uniform across subjects, and it was not influenced by repetitions or by knowledge about the controloption. Comments from the aware users indicated that they were looking for confirmation of gaze selections from the system. Thus, non-intrusive feedback seems to be fundamental for a successful gaze-interactive media. We suggest a range of discrete audio and visual effects that may serve this purpose and present some narrative control principles.",

Personalised audiovisual environments are created with a targeted goal to encourage interaction, creativity and artistic expression from the teenagers. The feedback stimuli is directly linked to the child's gesticulations for a sense of associated control to be available for recognition. Non-intrusive sourcing of gesture is through camera data mapped to computer vision algorithms. Intervention strategies from staff and helpers within such user-centred environments are questioned. Results point to the positive benefits for these children such as increased eye-to-hand coordination, concentration duration, andimproved communication.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite technologic improvements in home video systems, minimal research has been carried out on the potential to enhance the audience's reflective state and content appreciation. We explored the value of video systems that leave digital traces to support the movie-watching experience. By developing video-watching systems involving the application of a digital trace, we investigate how the movie-watching experience changed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants after they had experienced the systems. Our findings revealed that the digital trace became a source of deeper reflection on the storyline. Active trace logging was useful for revisiting impressive scenes and for encouraging audiences to express their thoughts. The passively generated digital trace acted as a catalyst for interpreting the storyline from a self-oriented viewpoint. We found that the digital trace might support content appreciation as a developmental process. We then discussed issues related to designing video systems with a digital trace mechanism included.",

In this study, researchers conducted an exploratory experiment that positioned AI as a relational artifact to students in a series of drawing activities and examined the potential impact of affective relations with machines in socio-cultural creative learning. The resulting artifacts, observations, and interview transcripts were analyzed using the Consensual Assessment Technique and a grounded theory approach. The study's results indicate that the design professors reliably evaluated the student drawings as more creative than the AI drawings, but neither demonstrated a consistent increase in creativity. However, the presence of AI engaged the students to explore different approaches to artistic prompts. We theorize that AI can be mediated as a learning artifact for transformative creativity if the students perceive their relationship with AI as empathetic and collaborative.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We examine the emergence of aesthetic emotions in an exploratory study on a mixed reality (MR) gastrosonic experience. Participants in an art-science event completed the AESTHEMOS questionnaire on aesthetic emotions and the Multimodal Presence Scale, reporting a wide spectrum of prototypical, pleasant and epistemic emotions. Food enjoyment was correlated with the prototypical aesthetic emotions of fascination and enchantment and feelings of self-presence were correlated with the prototypical emotions of being moved/in awe. Crossmodally matched food was highly congruent with music and visuals. Our findings suggest the relevance of studying environmental aesthetics in the context of these novel eating situations.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The colour of a photo helps to visually communicate with us at an emotional level and remember the mood of the moment. We designed LightPalette to reinstate the direct reflex toward colour in personal photos through a tangible lighting artifact within the users’ everyday environment. LightPalette works by retrieving major colours from a photo in smartphones and expresses them into the light on the acrylic shade enabling tangible adjustment of colours. We deployed LightPalette in 10 participants’ homes for a week to investigate how they interpret the mood of a photo by expressing its colours through a lamp. Findings showed that LightPalette supported users in visualizing the invisible atmosphere of each moment and discovered its potential to be used as a colour diary for reflecting on the day. Our findings imply possibilities for future lighting that provides self-perception by portraying personal visual records stored in digital space into the lighting.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article observes two objects of natural form through an electron microscope. The first object is an old paper; its beautiful texture is hardly visible on its surface and it resembles the nature that we commonly see. The second object is nanoflowers. Although it is a natural form, it is also an artificial chemical that is invisible to the human eye. This paper aims to present a new perspective on the action of seeing by collectively expressing two microworlds and elements of nature that are seen in everyday life, which are similar to the environment but utterly different from each other. Surrealist painter René Magritte's technique of dépaysement creates a stranger scene by removing a specific object from the context of common sense and placing it in a complicated situation, giving the observer a new shock. I intend to present a unique technique of artistic expression that has been grafted and evolved into the microscopic world.",

Issues of fidelity, realism and authenticity are considered, examining the use of Minecraft to create visual representations loosely coupled with reality that generate affective responses. We discuss the build of our virtual sculpture park outlining our approach to creating a facsimile of the sculpture park through adopting practices from the Minecraft community and refining and improving the artworks and experience informed by a class of 9–10 year old children. Using the real and virtual sculpture parks we explore the impact of engaging with the real before the virtual Jupiter Artland and vice versa, with the results from a three class study outlined in this paper.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper develops ideas around cycling as art practice. The questions at the heart of it revolve around how new data technologies enable us to represent such experiences as artworks. Recent research in neuroscience has begun to establish the ways in which modes of perception are processed in the brain. Related research suggests that Synaesthesia may be caused by a genetic mutation that results in a ‘cross wiring’ of these modes of perception. Within the arts there is a long history of exploration around synaesthesia, ideas that are becoming relevant again particularly in relation to the growth in personal data. Representing sensations and transferring them from one mode to another offers a way to handle some of this data and potentially say new things about our experiences. The author explores these ideas through artworks made using data from cycling to investigate the visualization of this experience.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The article describes the making of an art piece combining stone sculpture and virtual water. The motivation for this art piece was to enrich the usual static format of a stone sculpture with a dynamic dimension. The dynamic dimension is attained with virtual water droplets running over the stone surface which behave as real water droplets. The 3-D surface of a specially carved stone sculpture is during an exhibition continuously captured by the Kinect sensor. Each water drop out of many thousands, which are introduced into the installation as evenly distributed rain drops, falling over the sculpture, are simulated individually to run over the stone surface following the largest slope. These simulated water drops are projected with a video projector as light points on the surface of the sculpture. An observer can enjoy simultaneously the haptic experience of touching the stone and observing a digitally generated but physically grounded animation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite the emergence of advanced technologies, the behavioural complexities remain underexplored, especially from the viewpoint of their potential in interactive installations. This study aims to explore the future interactivity of an agent’s behaviour by envisioning speculative future human operations using a human-controlled interactive installation called LumiLand. This empirical study reveals that an agent can craft a user experience by (1) controlling the plot, (2) cocreating content with a user in a social manner, and (3) promptly adjusting undefined behaviours and situations. Based on Janlert and Stolterman’s interaction model, we present an interaction flow with four primary classifications: Leading, Responding, Poking, and Linking. We believe that a human-centered approach for understanding agent interactivity could help create entertaining human–computer interactions (HCI) by improving the agent design and exploring the challenges that will be faced during such interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Seeking to model the flight paths of birds as solid objects, this artistic research and development project makes use of digital data collection, computer modelling software and 3-D printing. The project tests notions of objectivity in observation. Eschewing imaginative interpretations of flight, I aspire to allow birds to transcribe their own movements with minimal human intervention. The enquiry began with a drawing process whereby flights were traced by hand on window panes, as they occurred. Subsequent work with the Structure & Motion Lab of the Royal Veterinary College has drawn on high-resolution data from free-flying birds carrying lightweight data loggers. The resulting digital models and 3-D printed models describe short bursts of flight with considerable accuracy. At the same time, the process highlights the impossibility of absolute knowledge and leads to consideration of the need to acknowledge subjectivity – and embrace reciprocity – in observing and recording the natural world.",

Such digital sculpting applications are more commonly applied within the video games and TV/motion picture industries, the intention of this paper is to show how such tools and methodologies together with existing scanned data and some historical knowledge can remediate and re-imagine lost sculptural form. The intended research will focus on an examination and partial re-construction of the tomb of Sir John Neville, 3rd Baron Raby located at Durham Cathedral, County Durham UK.",

The explorations draw upon the philosophy of the ‘Walking Artists’ and the concept of ‘the dematerialization of the art object’ as counterpoints to the Quantified Self Community, which aims to visualize previously invisible aspects of our daily lives for the purposes of positive self-monitoring. In doing so, it begins to draw attention aesthetically, and philosophically, to the way in which representations of our experiences, particularly of landscape, can be formed through the use of such technologies for generative art purposes.",

    "title": "The role of digital technologies in recording values of human settlements: testing a practical Historic Urban Landscape approach in China and India",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT UNESCO’s 2011 recommendation on Historic Urban Landscapes (HUL) advocated for an integrated, holistic approach to heritage places, in terms of how they are conceptualised and how they are recorded and managed in practical terms. Digital technologies offer increased capacity for recording places of all kinds, especially in terms of the physical environment and increasingly within heritage settings. Diverse case studies from China and India representing challenges in historic environments aim to test how a combination of the latest technologies and their current deployment better work toward goals within the HUL imperative. Further, we investigate where HUL approaches cannot be met by current technologies or analysis of digital data, providing a clear set of goals for future technologies or data interpretation that can work towards a more holistic capturing of place. This study analyses the interpretation of digital data in two different cultural settings between 2017 and 2018 – a historic water town in China and an informal settlement in India. Both cases employed digital technologies, including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, digital photography, video and audio recording to capture both the physical attributes of human settlements and how those places were used, reflecting residents’ values and cultural practices. Findings suggest that digital technologies are useful tools to illustrate layers of value beyond the built environment by connecting physical, social and cultural landscapes and associated place attachment. The combined use of various digital technologies helps to reveal interconnected place values and support better solutions for more sustainable and equitable development.",

    "abstract": "Technological development takes place at a rapid pace, and in recent years it has led to a growing output of artefacts and services with digital content, where availability and low price seem to be the main parameters for success. This trend has been labelled the ‘good enough’ revolution and has highlighted contemporary parameters for technological development. The present article presents this trend as a design movement that is characterised by introducing a new functionalism and challenging common perceptions that have emerged as a result of the twentieth-century design story about ‘high quality’ and ‘added value’ in product development. In addition, the article introduces the concept of aesthetics as the basis for a discussion about user experiences in contemporary digital artefacts, and argues that the good enough movement calls for a new understanding of aesthetics that springs from the role of digital artefacts in the user's social life and plays a role in relation to technologically oriented design development.",

    "abstract": "While there have been many studies of navigation design guidelines for integrating maps in mobile devices, we argue that the research focus should turn more towards the design of multimodal navigation aids, which would reflect the impact of typical human wayfinding behaviour. Therefore, we suggest an interdisciplinary design approach, i.e. building on urban design practice that focuses on supporting the navigation of pedestrians in urban areas. The design implications are explored in this study with the subjects being pedestrians accomplishing wayfinding tasks in an unfamiliar, urban area. The main areas that this paper contributes to are: investigating the design implications of multimodal navigation aids; evaluating these in the context of mobile wayfinding tasks; and reflecting the results according to the user's wayfinding strategies and spatial anxiety. It is concluded that through designing multimodal tracks into mobile navigation applications we can help users to find their way in unfamiliar, urban environments.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Heritage Interpretation’ has always been considered as an effective learning, communication and management tool that increases visitors’ awareness of and empathy to heritage sites or artefacts. Yet the definition of ‘digital heritage interpretation’ is still wide and so far, no significant method and objective are evident within the domain of ‘digital heritage’ theory and discourse. Considering ‘digital heritage interpretation’ as a process rather than as a tool to present or communicate with end-users, this paper presents a critical application of a theoretical construct ascertained from multiple disciplines and explicates four objectives for a comprehensive interpretive process. A conceptual model is proposed and further developed into a conceptual framework with fifteen considerations. This framework is then implemented and tested on an online platform to assess its impact on end-users’ interpretation level. We believe the presented interpretive framework (PrEDiC) will help heritage professionals and media designers to develop interpretive heritage project.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing trend even in the field of creativity. This paper examines which quantitative metrics can be used to comparatively analyse human-computer co-creativity with children. To study this question, 24 schoolchildren of age 10–11 wrote a poem with three co-creative poetry writing processes: a human-computer, a human-human, and a human-human-computer process. The computational participant in the processes was an AI-based application called the Poetry Machine. The children were asked to evaluate their user experience with a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire after each writing process and a comparative questionnaire after finishing all processes. The metrics used in the evaluation were immediate fun, long-term enjoyment, creativity, self-expression, outcome satisfaction, ease of starting and finishing writing, quality of ideas and support from others, and ownership. Significant differences were found in fun, long-term enjoyment, quality of ideas, support, and ownership. The high number of statistically relevant results was enabled by exposing all participants to all writing processes, and the comparative questionnaire. The human-human-computer process was evaluated the best in long-term enjoyment and the human-computer process the weakest in support and idea quality. Creativity and ease of finishing writing turned out to be outlining metrics for the co-creative processes.",

This body of knowledge is utilised for the development of ludic objects and environments in the context of leisure, learning and therapy. Where adults are concerned, play is almost exclusively studied in therapeutic contexts. This paper explores the far broader contributions psychology could make to the understanding of ludic engagement in adulthood. Using primarily Burghardt's (2004) conceptual analysis of animal play behaviour and Sutton-Smith's (1997) rhetorics of play, a number of research questions will be proposed. Finally, the contribution such research could make to the design of ludic objects and environments, as well as the need for an interdisciplinary approach will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article looks at the digital portrait used in the form of avatars in various online worlds and communication networks. It describes an ongoing modal shift from an ontological understanding of the portrait towards the portrait as performative acting. In accordance with the Western semiotic divide between representational fiction and material reality proper, the avatar-portrait is often still described as a representation that depicts the subject on the basis of a conceptual segregation between the living subject and the portrait. But the avatar-portrait functions as embodiment, thereby fulfilling a mainly performative purpose that triggers the participant's belief in the other's avatar. The paper looks at Eastern iconology, where the iconic portrait is an energetic transmitter in which the depiction and the depicted converge in the belief in the realness of the picture. Key concepts such as prototype, archetype and inverse perspective are discussed and applied to the art piece Can You See Me Now? by Blast Theory.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes algorithms that can musically augment the realtime performance of electronic dance music by generating new musical material by morphing. Note sequence morphing involves the algorithmic generation of music that smoothly transitions between two existing musical segments. The potential of musical morphing in electronic dance music is outlined and previous research is summarised; including discussions of relevant music theoretic and algorithmic concepts. An outline and explanation is provided of a novel Markov morphing process that uses similarity measures to construct transition matrices. The paper reports on a ‘focus-concert’ study used to evaluate this morphing algorithm and to compare its output with performances from a professional DJ. Discussions of this trial include reflections on some of the aesthetic characteristics of note sequence morphing. The research suggests that the proposed morphing technique could be effectively used in some electronic dance music contexts.",

    "abstract": "The architectural nature of the art piece presented in this article, a ‘pillar’ in the middle of the space, invites participants to enter an ‘enlightened’ space and to circulate around the centre. Quantity of movement is associated with sound volume and the captured image of the bodies on one side of the mirrored surface produces a correspondent video projection on the opposite side. The algorithm running in the computer is based on frame differentiation and background subtraction. The images resulting from this process are digitally filtered and coloured randomly in a range of warm colours (red to orange) and optically distorted by the mirrored surface. Sound volume of a looping sound varies according to the amount of calculated difference. The material used in this specific installation was metal structure, mirrored paper, video projector, camera, computer and loudspeakers. This piece is part of A Series of Audiovisual Studies for Bodies in a Sensory Space which was a research project utilising a camera-based interface for audiovisual expression. It aimed to gather knowledge on two main areas: computer vision employing a camera-based sensory system, and the issues related to the simultaneous expression and perception of sound and light. The main function of this system is to determine the position of a body or bodies in space and reveal their influence on that same space using the projection of sound and light. One of its main purposes was to enhance audience engagement by providing an immersive aesthetic experience. The research project referred to above was part of my Master of Arts course in Design and Digital Media at the Coventry School of Art and Design and had its first iteration at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation, in New York City, in the context of the Bolsa Ernesto de Sousa fellowship. The art piece presented in this paper, Audiovisual Study for Bodies in a Sensory Space – III, was created for a specific exhibition, Abertura, in Lisbon, Portugal. Spacial circumstances of the venue did not allow me to use the system as I had previously defined. Bearing in mind that apparently difficult experiences, if carefully analysed and understood, are extremely useful and important for the creation of novelty, I was determined to meet the challenges. In fact, I think that experiments that do not reveal the expected results often are the ones that point towards new directions of thought. Here lies the core of the importance of art as a scientific research method. Traditional scientific experimental practice has hypotheses as premises to be proved or refuted. The pre-conception of a hypothesis can be based on previously acquired knowledge and/or on pure intuition. In both cases there is an imaginary target to be reached. One of the profound characteristics of art may be its speculative nature. The use of an adaptive experimental method can lead to inconceivable or apparently impossible conclusions; a method that reformulates itself during the course of the experiment. In the creative process for this installation I applied a similar method. Particularly, I was ‘adapting’ to the physical circumstances of the room and ‘listening’ to the material I was using.

    "abstract": "New digital recording technologies pose new creative dilemmas for documentary videographers. The new type high-resolution video camera with 35 mm sized sensors and mounts for real film lenses generate a type of imagery that does not look typically ‘observational’. By testing this imagery's capacity as the guarantor of documentary authenticity and interrelating this with visualisation theories, this paper aims to explain the ontology of the new digital documentary image, its lure for the documentary filmmaker and its ramifications on reception in order to leverage technological production awareness of the documentary videographer and production members. The empirical data presented in this article is based on an explorative reception study in which five different types of moving image sequences were tested on an audience in order to be able to define the level of indexical appeal in shallow depth of field, high resolution, High Production Value, documentary moving images.",

    "title": "Performance art and digital media",
    "abstract": "Interaction depends on some form of activity and it is important to realise that the procedural power is not limited to the computational side in this activity. It is shared between human and bit machine. That is why interactive text has been described as the result of the continuous operation of a ‘textual machine’ which depends on the engagement of both (Aarseth 1997). We can look at the pre-conditions for these processes—the design for a digital piece or its interface; we can look at the effects—the emergence of social networks and digital products; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This dependency on the process formed the initial motivation for this collection. Much like interaction, performance is about doing. Performing cannot be reduced to an artistic interpretation of a given text but it has constitutive powers. We can study the pre-conditions—the structure of an underlying dramatic text like a play or an event score; we can look at the effects—the historical frame, response and social impact; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This core parallel was part of the formation of this special issue of Digital Creativity on performance art and digital media. But from this shared core, the themes rapidly fanned out into related but distinct questions from the role of the body in the activity to that of the technological counterpart. Thankfully, these debates can connect to respected scholars with established work in the field. This collection aims to support already existing work such as Dixon (2007), Benford and Giannachi (2011), or Jacucci (2004), but it uses the format of the journal to allow a more open assembly and meeting place for differing perspectives. While Dixon provides a much needed historical view and Benford and Giannachi and Jacucci offer more HCI-based positions, the contributions in this collection enter the discussion from multiple directions while standing next to each other. Their respective domains include performance studies, video games, HCI and digital arts, among others. Such a wide net of disciplines poses a challenge. If performance studies is already defying disciplinary boundaries and interaction design reaches the last corners of human activity in ubiquitous computing, then an interrogation of one through the other is bound to be messy. And, indeed, the contributions collected here overlap, and at times conflict with each other. But it never was the intention to solve this conundrum or to provide a single theory. It would be a disservice to both disciplines to attempt such a unified theory across so many domains. It might be precisely because of the diversity of the connections that performance is ‘trending’ in interaction. Notable work has been done in related fields such as theatre and interaction design (Laurel 1991) that investigated structural connections between the performing arts and the computational ones, but both fields have evolved over the past decades and have grown more complex.

    "title": "Creativity and the Computer Nerd: An exploration of attitudes",
    "abstract": "This study arises from our concern that many of our best art and design students are failing to make the most of the opportunities provided by IT because of their fear or dislike of computers. This not only deprives them of useful skills, but, even more importantly, deprives many IT based developments of their input. In this paper we investigate the relationship between attitudes to creativity and to computers among students. We quickly discard an approach based on theories of personality types as philosophically and educationally problematic. An approach based on the self-concept of artists and designers, in relation to their own creativity and to their feelings about computers, offers more hope of progress. This means that we do not try to define the attributes of \"creative people\". Rather, we ask what creativity means to students of art and design and relate these responses to their attitudes to computers. Self-concept depends on how the subjects see themselves within society and culture, and is liable to change as culture changes. One major instrument of cultural change at the present time is the growth of IT itself. We then describe a first attempt at using a psychological method - Kelly's Repertory Grids - to investigate the self-concept of artists and designers. It is hoped to continue with this approach in further studies over the next few years.",

    "title": "The construction of locative situations: locative media and the Situationist International, recuperation or redux?",
    "abstract": "A trend exists within locative media art of invoking the practices of the Situationist International (SI) as an art historical and theoretical background to contemporary practices. It is claimed that locative media seeks to re-enchant urban space though the application of locative technologies to develop novel and experimental methods for navigating, exploring and experiencing the city. To this end, SI concepts such as psychogeography and the techniques of detournement and the dérive (drift) have exerted considerable influence on locative media practices, but questions arise as to whether this constitutes a valid contemporary appropriation or a recuperative co-option, serving to neutralise their inherent oppositional qualities. The paper will argue that there is an identifiable strand of locative art works which through their contingent re-appropriation of situationist techniques can be thought of as being involved in the ‘construction of locative situations’, and that these (re)applications of situationist practices point to future directions for locative media's artistic engagement with the accelerating ubiquity of locative technologies.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, people are faced with having to deal with vast amount of digital content. But in some situations, having to choose from such large digital libraries can be unpleasant and even paralysing, especially when people have no strong preference for a particular choice. Digital music listening is an example of such a dilemma. Focusing on Shuffle listening on the iPod, whereby listeners abdicate choice to a system to present content to them randomly, we observe that this mode of abdicating choice not only alleviates the pains of choice but also leads to better user-experience in some circumstances. Randomness is highlighted as a versatile resource. Acting as a device that ‘defamiliarises’ the digital music tracks, it refreshes and engages listeners' attention as well as shapes their perceptions. In some cases, the use of randomness enriches their listening experience and even encourages encounters with serendipity.",

    "title": "Visualizing style differences through 3D animation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Style is a ubiquitous aspect of the design of both graphical and physical objects, usually more readily demonstrated by presenting an example of the style than by describing the style in words. What constitutes a specific style is often implicit and indicated by a reference example. The explicit description of such styles, e.g., to define a given style, usually involves static illustrations of exemplars and a written guide to the interpretation of its salient stylistic features. The formal comparison of styles conventionally involves presentation of exemplars, and a comparative description of their stylistic differences, often using a specialized vocabulary. Rather than words and labels to direct attention to stylistic features, one can take advantage of an innate property of the human visual system to detect differences through motion. By modeling sculptures of different styles as variations on a common shape, blend animation allows one style to change smoothly into another by interpolation. The viewer can now appreciate style differences, not by shifting gaze from one to another, but by watching one become another, wherein their differences attract visual attention. The dynamic visualization of stylistic change can thus help illustrate styles change, and in general, offers new animation tools.",

    "abstract": "Assisted by the rapid growth of digital technology, which has enhanced its ambitions, performance is an increasingly popular area of artistic practice. This article seeks to contextualise this within two methodologically divergent yet complimentary intellectual tendencies. The first is the work of the philosopher Merleau-Ponty, who recognised that our experience of the world has an inescapably ‘embodied’ quality, not reducible to mental accounts, which can be vicariously extended through specific instrumentation. The second is the developing field of neuroaesthetics; that is, neurological research directed towards the analysis, in brain-functional terms, of our experiences of objects and events which are culturally deemed to be of artistic significance. I will argue that both these contexts offer promising approaches to interpreting developments in contemporary performance, which has achieved critical recognition without much antecedent theoretical support.",

The aim was to provide a catalyst for research at the intersection of science and technology, and the arts and humanities. The IOCT was situated outside the faculty structure of the university with a mission to pull together high-quality research from all areas and to present a public face to the most creative and innovative research at De Montfort University (DMU). The IOCT rapidly formed a network of partners across the university and established a large collection national and international links. These are detailed on its website at http://www.ioct.dmu.ac.uk. Since its inception, it has housed over 100 projects, conducted by over 100 researchers, and funded from a range of sources including research councils, charities and other agencies. All IOCT projects are either interdisciplinary (applying the methods from one discipline to another), multidisciplinary (teams from various disciplines combining to investigate a research question) or transdisciplinary (across and beyond all disciplines) (Nicolescu 2002; Nowotny et al. 2001; Thompson Klein 1990). The emphasis on collaboration and networking has led to some notable successes in areas such as: computational intelligence; digital writing; sonic art; pervasive media; digital heritage; interactivity in health; cultural visualisation; semantic web; and many more. Current research in the IOCT is clustered into three main areas:",

The visuomotor strategy adopted by DrawBot is based on computational models of eye movements in human beings,and one xperimental findings on eye-hand coordination in expert draughtsmen. In this paper we present a behavioural model of the visuomotor coordination adopted by a draughtsman, designed in terms of visual routines.Eventually we outline the implementation of the basic routines.",

    "abstract": "Smartphones are a central element of mobile ubiquity, with mobile applications (‘apps’) becoming especially important. This article discusses the concept of iPhone apps, and other apps, as cultural platforms. Apps are highly significant for emerging cultures of mobile ubiquity, yet these platforms are constituted and controlled by major transnational global mobile media corporations. The article looks at the characteristics, constraints and limits of apps as they have emerged from 2008–2011, arguing that we need to carefully examine the terms of openness as they are constituted at the intersection of such mobile hardware, software and content. Finally, it offers a critique of apps, suggesting it is time to reconceive our ideas about apps and mobile Internet generally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Situated in the domain of research into mobile, wireless, networked and wearable computing, this exploratory paperintroduces the embodied imagination method and explains how it can contribute to the design process by creating an elastic space of performance that incorporates daily life and personal imagination into the design process. It is based on a study called Placebo Sleeves which was an experiential design phase of a larger project in wearable computing called whisper[s]. The innovation offered by this research is twofold: an integration of previously distinct methodologies, and an interdisciplinary theoretical framework relevant to the design of devices for affective, networked communication. The methodologies are shaped both by user experience models and by performance practices. We also articulate a domain of public dreaming, located at the conjunction of the private, public and secret within human existence, and suggest that shared use of mobile technologies has the potential to be situated there.",

This paper gives an overview of the ways in which technology can influence theatre and theatre research practices, dealing both with those technologies which are currently in use and those which the future might hold. The fundamental conclusion is that any move towards reducing the spontaneity of what takes place on stage and the sense of community which takes place in the theatre, thereby creating a more rigid, universalised or solitary experience, seriously threatens the integrity, and also the point, of the live theatre experience.",

According to particular views in anthropology, experience can be studied analyzing its expressions. We provide examples of this, from two projects: the configuration of open prototypes in a co-development project to create a mixed media environment to learn architecture design; and an evaluation technique for mobile and context aware services in a city centre that puts participants in the condition to express and record comments. In the discussion we propose resources for experience and its expression in ‘design happenings’: performance space, props, and interactional creativity.",

Our approach to designing the Wunderkammer space is grounded in the need for imprecise, fluent forms of categorising inspirational objects as observed in our fieldwork of architectural practice. The paper looks at the Wunderkammer as both a result and object of architect-users' imaginations, and as an attempt at supporting their practices of collecting, archiving and searching inspirational material and using it for communicating the design concept.

    "abstract": "Abstract Three-dimensional projection installations are particular kinds of augmented spaces in which a digital 3-D model is projected onto a physical three-dimensional object, thereby fusing the digital content and the physical object. Based on interaction design research and media studies, this article contributes to the understanding of the distinctive characteristics of such a new medium, and identifies three strategies for designing 3-D projection installations: establishing space; interplay between the digital and the physical; and transformation of materiality. The principal empirical case, From Fingerplan to Loop City, is a 3-D projection installation presenting the history and future of city planning for the Copenhagen area in Denmark. The installation was presented as part of the 12th Architecture Biennale in Venice in 2010.",

    "title": "Computational and spatially-organised narrativity",
    "abstract": "In the first quarter of the 21 century, there is no sign of conventional linear storytelling disappearing or losing its expressive power; but at the same time, new genres of non-linear games, television, music, drama and cinema, supported by the computer, have become a reality—rather than a theoretical possibility. On the one hand, these rely on the heritage of conventional storytelling genres; on the other, they draw on—and sometimes generate—new, contemporary, interactive-media technologies and approaches. In these emerging art-forms, developed in what Murray terms a ‘processcentred medium’ (Murray 1997, p.182), linear narrative thinking is expanded to include—or inhabit—the space of narrative potentials. The spatial organisation of narrative has become a shared ground for many kinds of creativity, enabling a range of conceptualisations and interaction-frameworks, designed to activate these potentials as new kinds of narrative experience that are engaging and immersive. “Of the three types of immersion”, claims Ryan, “the spatial variety has the most to gain from the built-in spatiality of pictures” (Ryan 2001, p.263)—and visualising storyspace is as important as structuring the story itself. With the inclusion of the computer, the borders between screen-space and participatory space, action and participation, shift and re-form to compelling dramatic effect. At the symposium Computational and Spatially Organised Narrative held at Media Centre LUME, Helsinki, April 26–29 2006, a representative sample of practical and theoretical work in the field was brought together for discussion; and from that process emerged all the articles in this special issue of Digital Creativity. In this context, computational narrative and spatial organisation appear as already well-established phenomena, of which the historical roots deserve attention. The light of historical discovery is shed by Alifragkis and Penz, who revisit, for example, Vertov’s work and Kuleshov’s ‘artificial landscapes’, mining them for metadata categories to create new portraits of the city using interactive digital media. Prager, who reviews the work of Moholy-Nagy, Schlemmer and other Bauhaus artists, finds models for the computational treatment of visual cinematic narrativity today, while Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen revive Eisenstein’s ‘montage machine’ for the algorithmic generation of narrative flow. Spatial organisation is discussed in two senses in this issue: the ontological space of content, and the physical space of installation—which interact and relate to each other in various fertile ways. Artopoulos and Condorcet elaborate an idea for parametrically generative physical viewing-space as the matrix for generative video narrative, which embodies the practice of gamelike ‘what if? ...’ storytelling. In a similar spirit, Sussner, Thomas and Richens formulate the topography of cinematic narrative as architectural construction, refashioning Kevin Lynch’s urban categories (Lynch 1960, p.6) and Christian Norberg-Schulz’s concept of place (Norberg-Schulz 1986, p.29) as design ontology for both 3D-environment and cinematic narrative structure. This approach has strong similarities with the work of Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen, who propose a formal definition of virtual narrative space in terms of ontological dimensions—that is, multidimensional characterisations of the content which constitutes the nature and existence of a particular storyworld, and carry meaning when associated with storylines that cross its space. In these conceptualisations, ontological dimensions constitute the co-ordinate system in which the building-blocks of the story reside, and which allows the fixing of waypoints for navigating the space, and generating narrative sequences algorithmically. The narrative spaces of several works presented in the current issue can, in principle, be analysed as such ontological space—Obsession (Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen), Gormenghast Explore (Sussner and Thomas), House of Affects e d it o ri a l",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of designing icons for the Graphical User Interface by exploring what design rules have evolved from established graphic design principles and, of these, which can be successfully adapted for the Graphical User Interface. By going towards a design criterion for computer icons it must be recognised that any change from one medium to another will alter the design possibilities. In order to establish what those design possibilities are, computer icons can be gauged against how other elements of design are used and their design criteria. Magazines direct the reader around the page by creating a positive reading order. Conflict, contrast or harmony can alter the relationship between design elements without altering their size, also optical and not mathematical centres decide the balance of elements used in any design. Computer icons are rarely designed as individuals, but as families. These families of icons are compared against other systems to establish what their requirements ...",

The other books are over there ...

This culture could be as broad as the whole Internet or it could be linked to a much smaller community.

The system will be open in that it will be up to its users to construct their own meanings in negotiation with those they want to communicate with.

This area of research is positioned at the intersection of sound and music computing, auditory displays and interaction design. The key issue the designer is asked to tackle is to create meaningful sound for objects and interactions that are often new. To date, there are no set design methodologies, but a variety of approaches available to the designer. Knowledge and understanding of how humans listen and interpret sound is the first step toward being able to create such sounds. This article discusses two original approaches that borrow techniques from film sound and theatre. Cinematic sound highlights how our interpretation of sound depends on listening modes and context, while theatre settings allow us to explore sonic interactions from the different perspectives of the interacting subject, the observer and the designer.",

    "abstract": "From Spring 2002 to Summer 2003 the Flexible media project and prototype experiment ran at Cambridge University Moving Image Studio (CUMIS) and BTexact Technologies, Adastral Park UK. This pilot project aimed to explore and formulate new storyforms using reconfigurable digital media, and to develop new methods and best practice for producing and publishing them, focusing on digital video, both documentary and fiction. Original material was produced in student workshops at CUMIS (MPhil) and the Norwegian Film School, where the Flexible media toolkit was tested and developed to incorporate the needs of creative content production. This paper describes the project and experiment in some detail, identifying the restrictions within traditional media production processes, and the opportunities offered by a more flexible approach. It then presents a case study of the experimentation undertaken to develop new flexible media forms. The paper concludes that collaborative practice-based research is successfully providing creative professionals with new modes of expression and engagement with their audience.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in German media theory, both in AngloAmerican academic media studies and within media art institutions. Whereas translations from German to English have been more or less limited to works by Friedrich Kittler and Niklas Luhmann, there are new names coming up. Of course, Siegfried Zielinski, Founding Director of the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, is already a well known scholar of media theory, and his now translated Deep time of the media: toward an archaeology of hearing and seeing by technical means hopefully arouses more interest in the German way of media analysis which, of course, instead of being a homogenous school, in general combines philosophy, historical analysis and a keen interest in the continuous exchange between art, science and cultural theory. Zielinski became known in the 1990s with his Audiovisions: cinema and television as entr’actes in history (1999) even though he had published in 1985 his history of the video recorder, engaging already at that time with the analysis of time-based media. At least since the early 1990s, he has been coined as one of the pioneers in the so-called field of media archaeology (in addition to for example Erkki Huhtamo). Deep time of the media is also marked by Zielinski’s peculiar way of doing media history as an-archaeology. As the concept hints, we are not dealing with a strict way of analysing histories of apparatuses, events and inventions but engaging on an expedition or a quest, as Zielinski writes. Instead of a linear history of progress and a tree-like model of thought haunting historical analysis, Zielinski’s (an)archaeology of media proposes to look for variations, fractures and turning points at neglected corners of media history. For Zielinski, [m]edia are spaces of action for constructed attempts to connect what is separated. (p.7) All this, of course, sounds very Foucauldian, and Foucault’s ideas of genealogy as a writing of a counter-memory are constantly present, as well as a Deleuzian ethos of experimentality, minor science and nomadic thought. Zielinski himself does not present a clear-cut methodological backgrounding, but these ideas can be read between the lines. More specifically, Zielinski engages with a group of historical individuals who are perhaps not (merely) exemplary but have acted as his own heroes. If we neglect this, perhaps odd choice of words and justification for the book, the examples are interesting. They range from the search for “the perfect interface” in the philosophy of Empedocles, to the experimental scientists Giovanni Battista Della Porta and Athanius Kircher, onto the nineteenth century experimentalists of vision and sound such as Johann Wilhelm Ritter and Joseph Chudy. Via these persons Zielinski excavates themes from the archaeology of media and art, looking for example at how the Jesuit priest Kircher from re v ie w s",

    "title": "Making the connection: Lev Manovich's<i>Texas</i>and the challenges of interactive new media narrative",
    "abstract": "This article proposes the Poetics of Mosaic Narrative as a tool for telling dramatically compelling interactive new media stories. In doing so it validates the crucial elements of cinematic storytelling in the digital medium, which due to its fragmentary, variable and re-combinatory nature, affords the opportunity for audience interaction. In particular it focuses on the theory and practice of the prominent new media theorist, Lev Manovich, as a means of investigating and creating a practical poetics. The key element of the Poetics of Mosaic Narrative is the expansion of the previously forgotten and undeveloped Russian formalist concept of cinematurgy. This concept, as originally proposed but not elaborated by Kazansky, encompasses the notion of the creation of cinematic new media narrative as a mosaic—integrally driven by the narrative systems of plot, as well as the cinematic systems of visual style created by the techniques of cinema—montage, cinematography and mise-en-scene.",

    "title": "Music, dimensions and play: composing for autonomous laptop musicians and improvising humans",
    "abstract": "Abstract This article discusses three compositions for autonomous laptops performing with improvising musicians. The laptops were programmed with software environments that make narrow-band ‘decisions’ regarding performative soundscapes. They also made ‘decisions’ about visual materials that were presented as onscreen scores for the human improviser to consider. The unfolding aural and visual streams were both functional and creative, and highlighted the here-and-now of indeterminate composition, whilst carefully embedding the aesthetics of the composer within the core of the programming. As such, these laptops were considered as collaborating performers and collaborating composers. The opening section highlights the connecting principles within this collection of works, before discussing each in isolation. This is placed within the context of late twentieth-century and early twenty-first- century composition, whilst offering a framework, for the reading of these, based on Deleuze and Guattari's rhizome philosophy. Three Last Letters is then used as a case study of the concept of wholeness within the computer-generated soundscapes and the algorithmic programming. Section 3 draws together several theories surrounding the mental seeing evoked by sound into dimensionality: a playground for inventive HCI-music improvisation. The values and principles with which the humans and computers interact is developed using creative play theory, followed by some personal responses of the musicians. Finally, an evaluation is offered on the effect on the audience and their perceptual modes when experiencing live and fluid compositions of this nature. The article is concluded with a poetics of experience from the composer's perspective.",

With the physiology of the retina providing inconsistent quality of information across our field of view, the project set out to reveal the disparity between the visual information gathered by our eyes and the conscious picture of ‘reality’ formed in our minds. The paper will map out the psychological, physiological and philosophical basis for the research, as well as presenting images produced by the project. In essence, each time someone contemplates a work of art, the work of art is re-constructed ‘internally’. This project set out, in part at least, to make ‘visible’ this hitherto internal, idiosyncratic, unique and unshared neurological event.",

This article examines the apparent flourishing of community-focused digital practices over the subsequent ‘post-conflict’ decade, galvanised by Northern Irish and EU policy initiatives armed with consolidating the peace process. Numerous digital heritage and storytelling projects have been catalysed within programmes aiming to foster social processes, community cohesion and cross-community exchange. The article outlines two projects—‘digital memory boxes’ and ‘interactive galleon’—developed during 2007–2008 within practice-led PhD enquiry conducted in collaboration with the Nerve Centre, a third-sector media education organisation. The article goes on to critically examine the processes involved in practically realising, and creatively and theoretically reconciling, community-engaged digital production in a particular socio-political context of academic-community collaboration.",

    "abstract": "In today's interactive media design it is difficult for a designer to create aesthetic innovations and to break free from ordinariness. The most important factor limiting interactive media design aesthetics is that education seems to be more focused on following traditional rules of interaction design rather than innovative approaches. These rules limit creativity and often relegate design students to producing ordinary interface solutions. This is especially burdensome for us as teachers. In order to address this problem, we developed an education model inspired by Lars von Trier's film Five Obstructions. We call this model ‘breaking the rules’. In the ‘breaking the rules’ approach students produce, within a range of probabilities, design problem solutions in cases of total or partial visual/auditory/tactile obstructions. The most important outputs of the model are (1) to make design student think/look outside of the ordinary, (2) to produce unusual solutions, (3) to maximise design solutions with sound.",

A distinctive mark of this pedagogic approach has been to look upon computer technology as an opportunity to rethink the methods, contents and goals of architecturaleducation,in thelight of contemporary culture. The course is structured in six themes, each one standing for a ‘system of representation’: ‘text’, ‘figure’, ‘object’, ‘image’, ‘space’ and ‘light’. Within every system, a variety of issues dealing with the concept of ‘representation’ are addressed in an interdisciplinary manner. It is a compulsory course lasting three semesters, in the second and third year of a five-year architectural program. It has been offered since the academic year 1999/2000.",

Exercising a sometimes perverse and sometimes anxious fascination, technological possibilities for the extension, replacement, or enhancement of the perceptual, functional, sexual, and/or psychological aspects of human subjectivity have found expression in a variety of modes of contemporary art making. These explorations touch on the representation of the body as machine, as well as technological metaphors and modes, to produce works which emphasise hybridity, meta‐organisms, and prosthetic devices which simulate psychic functions as well as taking on organic, conceptual, and cognitive features of human existence.",

    "abstract": "This article takes into consideration social videogames, such as The Sims and Second Life, starting from the assumption that videogames can have influence outside of cyberspace. How are game characters and genres informed by and at the same time inform female players and their performance of gender. The main question addressed here is: What gendered forms does playing take in such games? Who plays with what assumptions on gender? The cases examined here show that recent female-targeted games encourage roles and activities (shopping, flirting) typically hegemonic when not stereotypical for women. In the light of these considerations, I argue that there are contradictory ways in which gender is deterritorialised and then reterritorialised in the latest games genres. These forms of socialisation games offer creative possibilities to players, even though in practice participation is often reduced to female consumer citizenship that reinforces hegemonic gender assumptions.",

    "title": "Welcome to virtuality",
    "abstract": "Abstract The paper contains a philosophical discussion of the concept of ‘virtuality’. It primarily argues that ‘virtuality’ is not the opposite of ‘reality’ but rather of ‘actuality’. Using the concept of ‘virtualisation’ it describes a number of problem solving scenarios dividing them into specific actualisations on the one hand, and generalised solutions to a general class of problem on the other. This latter group is considered to be a ‘virtual problem’ with ‘virtualisation’ providing the general solution. Within this framework, technology is seen as an agent for the materialisation of a solution to such a virtual problem. It is argued that virtuality is the very dynamic of our real world and is what makes the world common and shared. Arguing for a new aesthetics, rather than concern for the mere techniques of making art with computer, the role of art is described in terms of the play of the virtual against the possible. Far from being a recent trend linked only to digital technology, virtualisation b...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Representation of ideas so that others may understand them is vital, and particularly so in the early stages of the design process; designers use many different techniques to make these representations. Recent work at the Visualisation and Information Design Centre (VIDe) at the Coventry School of Art and Design has concentrated on supporting styling design. The previously‐developed technique of mapping 2D images over 3D computer models of vehicles has been extended: now, 2D facial photographs are mapped onto generic 3D head‐models to enhance a new technique for spectacle design. A summary of work in progress for computer assisted spectacle design, and for rapid car styling, is described here, along with details for improvements in sketch modelling, including texture mapping. Photographs and reference CAD models are used in an attempt to verify the basic process; also ‘depth mapping’, ‘lines in space’ and other rapid modelling methods are discussed.

    "abstract": "This article presents an account of the authors’ practice-based research, which is an investigation of the ‘alternative picture spaces’ definable by plane anamorphosis. The account begins with a discussion of the nature of conventional picture space and its separation from real-world space, and the roles of the picture frame or boundary in maintaining that separation. Perceptual depth cues implicated in the viewing of both types of spaces are briefly examined, leading to a consideration of the ‘hybrid’ perceptual spaces that can emerge when cues are integrated and the frame nullified. The authors describe computer-aided methods for creating anamorphic imagery and displaying it in studio/gallery contexts, and consider the properties and nature of the unconventional pictures and viewing experiences thus defined. They argue that anamorphic perspectives are effectively frameless and are rich in potential for development by fine artists and other image-makers in a variety of applications and situations.",

    "abstract": "Images that clearly present a constructed physical truth, like digital images, remind us to question the reality factor of any image. Because many digital images appear to be photographic, or photographic-like, the medium forces artists to revisit what a photograph, and consequently a digital image, represents. In turn, this rethinking influences how students in computer art see reality and truth when they create digital imagery. Embracing this question, some digital artists have constructed visual narratives that appear photographic, yet lack the physical world referent that their images imply. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, when this kind of construction became popular, many digital artists have grappled with how to identify the truth in their images. This study describes how some advanced digital art students resolved this conflict by defining their own artistic truths.",

It features excerpts from key informant interviews with six prominent machinima artists: it is the first time they have been brought together to consider the role of machinima as a learning tool from their different perspectives. The article begins with a review of machinima as an example of digital creative practice, akin to mashup and remix genres. The nature of machinima is presented through interviews, providing an overview of its authenticity, roles of networks and communities of practice, transdisciplinary creative practice, transliteracy, transferability and accessibility as a learning tool in developing competency in digital creativity. It is suggested that machinima is ‘digital clay’ that has the potential to add value to practice-based learning in a connected world. The article concludes with a summary of the unique contributions that machinima gives the creative learning process.",

These distinctions stem from the nature of the broadcast environment. Each has its benefits-portability and extreme durability for books (running into thousands of years), interlinking and expandability for electronic design-and its distinct drawbacks.What if we could merge the best of these two worlds into one elegant whole? We could have a document with all that that entails; portable, durable, and cheap, but with web like features, such as search functions, linking and the ability to access other media? In principle, the technology is already here, but is it everything that the developers claim, and what should the designers' response be to such a media. In this paper, both questions are examined, and some surprising conclusions are drawn.",

The Conference was held in Hotel Lord in Warsaw on 15–16 October 2013. The aim of the Conference was to create a platform for exchange of experience and knowledge in regarding to the processes of commercialization of research results, technology transfer and innovation support. The Conference was addressed to the representatives of the three groups most involved in the activities on the border of R&D and business: the scientists (as potential creators of new business solutions), the innovative entrepreneurs (as potential recipients of these solutions) and staff of institutions supporting the commercialization of research results, who through their work, try to remove the many barriers which still separate the world of science from the world of business. The Conference was opened by the speech of Adam Struzik, Marshal of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, who stressed the need for cooperation in the “knowledge triangle”, especially between science and business. The first day of the Conference was devoted to issues related to the effective commercialization and transfer of research results to the business world. In the plenary session “Supporting science and innovation” were discussed both past experience related to the management and implementation of programs aimed at supporting innovation in R&D sector, as well as the opportunities for researchers in new programming period. The plenary session was performed by representatives of various institutions oriented to support innovative projects in R&D sector in Poland. Dr. Andrzej Kurkiewicz (representative of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education) presented the achievements in reform of sector of science and higher education in Poland, as well as guidelines for policy on supporting this sector in the next perspective 2014–2020.

Second, firm-level shocks play an important role in explaining the export collapse. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the slump of exports is due to a reduction at the intensive margin, whereas the biggest share of the decline is traceable to very large firms.",

In contrast immersive technology nearly became the subject of the design review ‘due to the undesirable usability problems of the ImmersaDesk’. In retrospect the attempt to make the virtual act as a substitute for the physical was bound to raise issues. But in pushing beyond the hype of new technology Bucolo and Brereton developed an understanding of the role that the virtual object could play as a vehicle for abstract thought. In contrast Sundholm, Ramberg, and Artman’s Learning conceptual design followed ‘students during the conceptual design phase’ within a technologically mediated ‘co-located collaborative workspace’. However by dwelling on the reticence of users to ‘publicly’ expose aspects of their work, primarily their ability to draw, the success of this work was understated. In marked contrast to the problems that Bucolo and Brereton encountered, the problems discovered here were due to the fact communication was facilitated. In fact students solved this problem through the fl exibility of the system, appropriating images from the web and creating their own symbols to represent what they would have drawn. As a part of the system the Tipple service allowed students to use their own laptops as a part of the workspace.

Particularly rare are design projects that integrate the space and existing artifacts as a resource. We report on the development of an interactive learning environment in support of students of architecture and interaction design. Based on ethnographic fieldwork we specified a set of qualities of the learning environment, which guided the development of physical interfaces (using tags, sensors, video tracking, physical and digital infrastructures). To investigate how students would integrate technologies in their work settings we have organized field trials with open prototypes. These showed the value and some means of mixing evolving artifacts with digital media. In interactive installations students used the space as a stage to experience and explore aspects of places and situations.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the limitations of contemporary interface design and offers the potential of more profound forms of interaction by drawing on the rich and much older heritage of interactive art. Whilst HCI design is preoccupied with making the computer more simple to use, installation work, kinetic sculpture, and interactive multimedia art forms have generally been more concerned with the predicament of human/technological negotiation, whilst remaining a salient form of human communication. HCI activity sets out to make the complex systems of computing easy to understand and use, whilst interactive art often uses simple technology to make complex, inspiring and esoteric statements and experiences. In many ways the more simple and 'low resolution' the technology the more immersive, acute and intimate the experience. 'Low resolution' examples such as telephone-sex-lines are explored alongside more immersive systems, such as biofeedback interfaces, and other interactive experiments drawn from the 'technic' strand of art history.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a heuristic approach for analysing computer-based interactive art by the extent to which it produces an interaction, and by whether participants are able to gain a meaningful experience from the interaction. Interactive installations responding to participants' physical input have been increasingly displayed in public spaces outside conventional art domains. Nevertheless, people in such public spaces are often unaccustomed to engaging with art intellectually. Thus, although the interactive artwork with responsive multimedia effects are, to some extent, more capable of prompting physical engagements, it is not always clear whether participants are able to develop meaningful experiences from such interactive encounters. Here, an analytical framework for reviewing such experiences has been developed from examinations of interactive experiences on site, along with interviews with advisors, professionals in the field and the originating artists. Examples of the frameworks' application to three interactive artworks are demonstrated in this article.",

    "title": "Cooperation Game",
    "abstract": "Cooperation Game is a computer-mediated social environment. This discreet audiovisual interactive installation aims to promote the sense of self, of other, and of the subtle interaction between these entities and their surroundings. This interactive audiovisual system was created by me in September 2007, in the context of my MA project at the Coventry School of Art and Design, Coventry University, UK. It is part of a sequence of experiments that were done in order to test several applications of a camera-based system and to study audiovisual communication. The material used in this specific installation was video camera, computer, video projector and loudspeakers. The main characteristic of the game is that it is an anti-game. The objective of the players is not to compete and win, but to understand their influence on the group of players and to cooperate in order to achieve a common result. In this case, the common result is to create a balanced audiovisualscape. The players are expected to slow down from the normal state of activity and by doing so, to increase their awareness of others. Two mains ‘states’ of movement may be characterized. When moving in the sensory space the player creates ripples on a ‘liquid’ surface. The distortion of this surface is translated into sound via generation and filtering of pink noise. When stopped, the player emits a repeated sonar-like sound that is represented visually by a synchronised ripple. The frequency of this sound is mapped onto a specific area in space and the tempo of repetition each player emits varies as a function of their distance from the other players. For example, the closer two players are, the faster is the repetition of the sound assigned to the area in which they find themselves. These principles are a development of the concept of Musical Topologies invented by Rolf Gehlhaar in his electronic musical instrument for multiple players, SOUND 1⁄4 SPACE. Cooperation Game is based on the Ripples open-source algorithm, by flight404. This algorithm, in its original version, allows the user to interact with a 3D surface. By clicking the mouse on the screen, the user produces ripples on the surface, like dropping water onto a water surface. I altered the algorithm in order to produce no reflections on the extremes of the surface. Then, I joined it with other algorithms that I wrote in order to attribute a ripple ‘maker’ to every user that enters the sensory space. Above all, Cooperation Game is a metaphor of social organizational principles based in collaboration and cooperation strategies. It aims to emphasize the need of the development of digital technologies for multiple users: the computer as a tool for social and physical interaction. One of the background ideas of this piece is the utopia of transforming the well known PC – Personal Computer, into a CC – Community Computer. John Conway’s Game of Life proposes a model that underlines the dependency of others and their surroundings as the principle of life. Cooperation Game reiterates this concept and extends it by implementing a principle that is present in Rolf Gehlhaar’s Sound 1⁄4 Space: participants are conscious of the relevance of their presence in the ‘world’. Cooperation Game emphasises the apparent invisible links. In a world where individualism is the key of development, it is congratulatory to realise that participants when interacting in Cooperation Game became aware of themselves as something else than their bodies. This happens because they control an avatar in the projected virtual space. By the same process they also Digital Creativity 2008, Vol. 19, No. 3, pp. 214–215",

    "abstract": "Abstract The project, Daisy's Amazing Discoveries, which Mika Tuomola scripted and directed, is an interactive drama series on the Internet. In Part 1 the work was described and its narrative premises outlined. There followed a brief description of the production process and the reception of the work. Part 2 of the paper concerns what was learned about interactive narrative, including ideas about how space and time should be organised in an interactive work, the effect of such ideas on the plot, characters and genre of the series, and the role of the user. From the viewpoint of dramatic structure, the most important element in an interactive work is the space (or world) which is presented to the viewer. The importance of context in works of Virtual World narrative is discussed. An analysis of the reasons why only some of the reality allusions worked in Daisy is presented. Finally, the themes around which the series was built are described. There is a discussion of whether a non‐linear interactive work, wh...",

Carrying out this research in a socially and technologically diverse range of family households poses further challenges, common to ethnographic media research in general. In this paper, we describe a method for generating richly detailed views of 6–8 year old children’s digital play with the game Minecraft, on a range of devices and in a range of household configurations. We explain the process undertaken in our own research, highlighting the need for flexibility and a collaborative approach between participants and researchers. We argue that collecting multi-perspectival recordings of digital play provides data that has the potential to greatly aid understanding of digital playworlds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In an era of major technological strides in computer interaction, it is a disappointment industrial designers continue to report that current CAD packages are too rooted in engineering design to be effective in supporting their own creative practices. This paper examines the nature of their dissatisfaction and proposes solutions. A comprehensive observational study of industrial designers' existing CAD and physical modelling activities is reported, from which an evidence base for the specification of improved digital industrial design tools is derived. Theories on design modelling, sketching, human cognitive development and CAD evolution are used to underpin the major conclusion that a conceptual shift in digital design tools must take place if industrial design is to be properly supported. The shift is discussed and illustrated through the presentation of plausible new HCI systems classed as ‘virtual workshops’ and ‘intelligent environments’.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the rapid penetration of digital interfaces into all aspects of everyday life, the need for understanding the aesthetic aspects of interaction between humans and computers has come into focus. Various positions suggest that aesthetics offers IT design and research an enhanced analytical foundation going beyond the traditional use-oriented principles of HCI and usability. However, this new body ofliterature employs different notions of aesthetics, resultingin a blurred picture. This article reviews the contributions of aesthetics to IT design and research, which we refer to as the aesthetic turn. Based on a thorough literature review, we propose a division of the field into four overall approaches: the cultural, the functionalistic, the experience-based and the techno-futuristic. Finally we discuss the prospects and pitfalls of approaching research and design of digital interfaces from aesthetic stances.",

    "title": "The possibilities of illness narratives in virtual reality for bodies at the margins",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Through decades of scholarly analysis and application, the practice of illness narratives has been established as an effective therapeutic intervention for dealing with illness-related emotional well-being (Couser; Frank; Irvine and Charon). Scholars of illness narratives argue that the medium works to bring agency back to the body following the neoliberal relinquishing of one’s life story in the patient-physician encounter. Contemporary scholarly work is mapping the growth of illness narrative forms from the traditional book to emerging digital-born narratives; however, there is limited research on the medium’s intersection with virtual reality (VR) technologies. Working with Marie-Laure Ryan’s theoretical framework of possible worlds theory, this paper explores the transformative potential of VR illness narratives for pathologized identities found when VR resists the call to fall into one of two categories: pure transhumanism where VR reality is emancipated from actual reality or an artificial experience that has no lasting effect on the self.",

    "abstract": "The paper examines and evaluates the transposition of live theatre performance into a digital multimedia environment utilising QuickTime (or equivalent) movie software for use on standard PCs. Writers such as Brenda Laurel have discussed the close correspondences between theatre and computers, and CD-ROM authoring software such as Director clearly adopts theatrical paradigms and terminology. The differences between attending a performance in a theatre and viewing a recording on a computer screen are outlined, and how these two experiences differ in what is expected from the audience/user. The distortions inherent in any video recording of a theatre event are explored, with particular reference to differentials in performance scale. The flickering, low-r esolution picture typifying video playback on CD-ROMs is then argued to be a positive virtue in the remediation of theatrical footage, and far preferable to full-screen video recordings. A number of reasons are proposed which explore ideas around documenta...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Facilitating and supporting various modes of social interaction has been part of Mixed Reality (MRx)1 design experiments and discourse over the past twenty years. But what vision of social interaction is sought and advanced through Mixed Reality environments? In this paper, I identify two dominant ways that social interaction is envisioned in MRx designs, broadly construed as material and political, and illustrated through a series of examples. I further draw on them to highlight the potentials, boundaries, and limitations of each with regards to the kinds of social interactions that are sought and cultivated through the integration of digital media on physical space. I suggest that as MR becomes mainstream, it is important to go beyond these visions to consider whether and how MRx environments might connect with the economic, social, and cultural specificity of local sites to meaningfully serve the always evolving social needs and purposes of their communities.",

    "title": "Bird in the wire: creativity, resistance, networked citizenships",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper contemplates the extent to which online music-making and sharing practices can be understood as acts of creative citizenship. While the digital is often lauded as a mechanism by which citizens may engage creatively with local or national communities, this paper contends that it may equally represent a means for disengagement with those groups, by instead facilitating participation in the transnational, diasporic communities that have long prospered on the Internet. Possible motivations for this are multifarious and context-dependent, but often signify an act of resistance: against artistic and commercial institutions, against creatively oppressive states, against the cultural isolation of an immediate environment. This paper holds that this type of digitally mediated creative engagement—that which arises as a specific reaction to a perceived inadequacy in one’s civic life—might be best understood through the lens of creative citizenship. In order to assess the relationship between online creative communities and their offline counterparts, it employs Wellman and Castells' notion of ‘networked individualism’, and contextualizes its ideas by referring to recent studies in online amateur music-making in Iran, where the digital is often regarded as a way of circumnavigating the creative oppression of the state.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of new media, interactive film projects have mainly struggled to resolve the contradiction between dramatic structures and interaction. Dramatic film presents identification with the main character, where the viewer is constantly oppressed by the narrative, and therefore lost in illusion. In this context, when we bring on the scene interaction, the drama apparently starts to lose its power. In this article, a new interactive film model based on Brechtian film theory is proposed. This model presents a new way of spatiotemporal construction where different audiovisual combinations can be viewed successively, and this way the viewer can actively construct his/her own story. Theoretical framework of the Brechtian interactive film model is supported by an interactive film application, named Academia. The main feature of the model is that, while interaction is very simple, the continuity of the narrative is preserved and the film requiring an intellectual level of interpretation.",

DAC09 was the eighth Digital Art and Culture conference series, the first being in 1998. The DAC conference series is recognised for its progressive interdisciplinarity, its intellectual rigour and its responsiveness to emerging practices and trends. As director of DAC09, it was these qualities that I aimed to foster at the conference. The collection of papers in this volume is indicative of the diversity and the vigour of the community which came together for the conference. They exhibit a breadth of concerns in the field and they capture some key contemporary issues and have in common a well-informed theoretical and historical base.",

    "abstract": "This article brings together the disparate worlds of dance practice, motion capture and statistical analysis. Digital technologies such as motion capture offer dance artists new processes for recording and studying dance movement. Statistical analysis of these data can reveal hidden patterns in movement in ways that are semantically ‘blind’, and are hence able to challenge accepted culturo-physical ‘grammars’ of dance creation. The potential benefit to dance artists is to open up new ways of understanding choreographic movement. However, quantitative analysis does not allow for the uncertainty inherent in emergent, artistic practices such as dance. This article uses motion capture and principal component analysis (PCA), a common statistical technique in human movement recognition studies, to examine contemporary dance movement, and explores how this analysis might be interpreted in an artistic context to generate a new way of looking at the nature and role of movement patterning in dance creation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interactive media art is an art form that ‘transforms digital information and translates it into aesthetics of participative processes.’ In their artistic investigations, the artists and architects Fleischmann and Strauss focus on the concept of the ‘thinking space’ [Denkraum]. Following Aby Warburg's ‘space of thought’ (1929), they define the thinking space of interactive media art as a ‘space filled with data’ (Strauss, W., and M. Fleischmann. 2001. The artists’ thinking space is the artistic exploration of an architecture of interactivity that ‘evokes’ communication ‘in a culture of simulation’ (Turkle, S. 2004). by involving people in a performative way. This article presents three of their projects, all based on the metaphor of the thinking space: ‘Semantic Map’, ‘Media Flow’ and ‘Energy Passages’ illustrate strategies of interactivity using artificial intelligence to ‘reinforce human intelligence’. The question is not whether machines can think, but whether people can still think when everything is automated.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores the possibility of constructing an unreal environment through sound, particularly through the use of contemporary digital tools. The idea of the unreal is approached as a not being-in-the-world experience. That is, an experience which expands the natural embodied physicality. And yet, sound propagation through a physical space, which led to the study of reverberation and spatialization as the main subjects of interest. Consequently, reverb became the main tool to explore the subject in practice. Due to the project’s multidisciplinarity, the subject had different approaches: from the possibility of reverb as a tool for fiction-making, to listener's comprehensibility and readability of the events; exploring spatialization techniques and multichannel reproduction systems to finally conclude with the idea that, in the end, sound relies on the listener’s actual physical experience of the space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An audience's direct physical intervention is widely believed to be instrumental in the field of interactive art. However, this long established expectation faces new challenges through the increasing accessibility of a growing diversity of interactive technologies and ubiquitous smart media. Such innovations are often fully integrated components of interactive public artworks, many of which do not directly involve audiences or individuals as key agents in the functional or aesthetic realisation of the work. Based on three case studies of interactive artworks in public places, this article identifies an important characteristic of interactivity in interactive art, through the largely unexplored concept of “Ambient Interaction” in which artworks are embodied and enacted through environmental conditions and situational influences rather than exclusively through people's intentional and direct physical engagement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article introduces a case study undertaken in the indigenous Penan community of Long Lamai, Upper Baram, Sarawak, Malaysia. In this community, there is concern about the negative image other cultural groups hold of the Penan. This case study explores co-design as a means to invite community members, together with a designer, to explore the identity that they would like to present to people outside the community. In preparing for an exhibition to challenge perceptions, it turned out to be important to embrace the culture of the community to facilitate self-expression, introducing new concepts such as technological interventions and design probes to stimulate reflection and creativity. However, it was indigenous material culture, when actively and encouragingly supported by the designer, that had a key role in developing the co-design and, with it, empathic understanding between designer and community.",

    "title": "Post-anthropocentric creativity",
    "abstract": "As described in the call for submissions, this special issue aimed to audit existing conceptions of creativity in the light of non-anthropocentric interpretations of agency, autonomy, subjectivity, social practices and technologies. A review and update of these conceptions is prudent in an age when human creativity is credited as the dominant, yet hugely destructive, influence on the planetary environment. The conceptual componentry of creativity is in redesign on many shop floors, including those of new materialism (Barrett and Bolt 2013; Coole and Frost 2010), speculative realism and object-oriented philosophy (Bryant, Srnicek, and Harman 2011), posthumanism (Callus and Herbrechter 2012), ontological designing (Fry 2012), biology (Turner 2000), science and technology studies (Knorr-Cetina 1999), multispecies ethnography (Kirksey and Helmreich 2010), deep ecology (Sessions 1995), post-environmentalism (Shellenberger and Nordhaus 2011) and ecosystem approaches (Waltner-Toews, Kay, and Lister 2008), to name but a few. In response, the editors proposed two lines of enquiry, aiming to engage and connect the relevant work that already exists in a variety of disciplines: The first line of enquiry considered the agents, recipients and processes of creativity. With current developments emphasising the interdependence between human and biophysical systems, nonhuman entities can be seen as creative agents. How do such agents differ from the recipients of their creativity? Posthumanism questioned understandings of humanity but largely continued the focus on human invention, human freedom and human selfconstruction through technology. Can matter, things, nonhuman organisms, technologies, tools and machines, biota or institutions be seen as creative? Turning from agents to relationships and processes; are the concepts of embodied or autonomous agency necessary for thinking about creativity? How can existing notions of creativity be extended or challenged through the developing understandings of complexity, emergence, supervenience, evolution and ecosystems? With the notion of creative agency made more inclusive, the second line of enquiry would consider the purpose, value, ethics and politics of creativity. The concept of creativity implies production of desirable novelty. But is production of novelty always of value? In a finite world, the creation of the new often comes with the destruction of the old. Should creativity be judged by the equity of its goals",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article addresses the challenges and limitations of co-creation processes in museums based on an exemplary case of the design of a Danish museum-related campaign on Facebook. The article adds to the ongoing discussion on the paradigm shift in the museum by analysing potential problematical issues of including multiple agents in creative processes in museums. It concludes that it is arduous to establish a truly creative co-creative process, when the design team needs to accommodate to a well-established artistic vision as well as to the limited resources of the museum and the other participants. We argue that one cannot in advance predict or ascertain that social media users will find a campaign compelling and want to participate and engage with the content, even if substantial resources have gone into its creation. Furthermore, the complexity of many art projects is likely to make their dissemination on social media difficult.",

    "title": "Programming the beautiful",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The term generative art is mostly reserved for practices in which artists construct systems containing various degrees of autonomy. This is designed to generate results that would otherwise be unlikely. In contrast, photography is understood as a situation wherein an agent, the photographer, uses a pre-existing system constructed by other agents with the sole purpose of yielding results that must always be predictable. One strand of photography wherein such conceptions of the medium prove inadequate is generative photography. This unique exploration is characterized by three qualities: (1) Extensive use of self-constructed apparatuses for harnessing technologies explicitly dedicated to the creation of photographs; (2) Uncompromising insistence the seriality principle in producing photographs; and (3) The integration of chance or randomicity as an important creative factor. This paper traces the history of generative photography from its origins in the near-forgotten philosophical movement of information aesthetics. It argues that generative photographs elucidate a concept of artistic constructivism onto which may be grafted the numerical programming of apparative art systems. Thus, generative photography, with its precision of production and concise visual expression, can be understood as the final phase of photography, or, through Max Bense’s concept of ‘programming the beautiful’, as a precursor of generative computer art.",

    "title": "How to design for exploration through emergent narratives",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents emergent narratives from theory on game design as a model for designing cultural heritage exhibitions and discusses how criteria of emergent narratives can support exploratory user behaviour. We propose that emergent narratives can be transferred to the design of interactive digital exhibitions, thereby removing constraints and allow for more personalized and potentially structure-breaking user experiences. Whereas exhibition design often either focuses on form or content, we propose that by designing for exploration through criteria of emergent narratives, a balance can be found between content and form that encourages explorative behaviour in the exhibition. This adds to the discourse of design principles for using principles from closed digital environments, such as games, in open physical spaces of exhibitions. This paper answers the research question of how theory of emergent narratives can be used to design for exploration.",

Yet, the anthropocentrism prevails and conceptions of radically different civilisations and cultures are defined by current human thought that shapes and limits the understanding of what a genuinely alternative cultural production might entail. This article uses the Kardashev scale of civilisations, classified according to energy consumption at the planetary, stellar and galactic scales to consider culture beyond the current limits of an inherently anthropocentric perspective. In considering microdimensional, informational and universal extensions of Kardashev's scale, critical reflections on the anthropocentric limits of cultural epistemology create an opportunity to posit a universal framework of creativity.",

It is a critical design approach introducing alternative design proposals in three steps. In the first step we define myths and delusions of digital products restricting interaction and awareness. In the second step we introduce critical myth exposures reading, exposing, reviewing and demystifying the myths. In the third step we design ‘transformers to explore design alternatives, i.e. we transform the myths by changing the design and the way the product is being presented in use. The aim is to question what counts as normal and intuitive with respect to all those everyday computational products we are getting more and more used to. Defining and questioning digital myths is here seen as one form of design critique.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Where is the body of the gamer in game art? While game art explores the materiality of digital games through examinations of the glitch, and in-game performances, it is less successful in revealing or examining the materiality of the body of the gamer. This presents an interesting problem for game art because, since motion sensing technologies have been incorporated into gaming technology following the introduction of the Wii, the body has reached an unprecedented visibility in popular culture, and increasingly depictions of gaming make the body part of play by celebrating gestural excess. Game art is crucial for documenting the fleeting styles of gestural excess, styles that are both amplified by the proliferation of motion sensing technologies and the integration of gesture into gaming, and constrained by the ongoing processes of being absorbed into official practices of popular gaming culture and design.",

    "title": "Telepresence and its transparent infrastructures",
    "abstract": "This article critically examines Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's concept of remediation, specifically as it pertains to their conceptualisation of transparency, through a detailed analysis of a series of telematic artworks. Their problematic definition of remediation leads to an understanding of telepresence as a medium that denies transparency and aggressively insists for the social and physical reality of media, yet such a definition does not provide the analytical tools required to determine how these conditions are produced in the first place. Remediation, it will be argued, falls short for studying the relations of power that enable and constrain representation, particularly in the case of media such as telepresence. A solution is found in Leah Lievrouw's ‘reconfiguration’ as a complement to remediation. Based on findings from a recent case study, the article will show how this dual approach can be employed to study how artists appropriate information infrastructure.",

    "title": "Beyond the icon: the role of the image in human computer interface (HCI) design",
    "abstract": "If we examine communication we see the origins of some of the most fundamental systems of reconciling experience. Primarily, it is our systems of classification and categorisation that allow us to objectify the world and assign names to ‘collections’ of experience. Such ordering has resulted in the isolation and establishment of a basic unit of communication, the sign. However, the sign can never be the original, as communication inherently involves taking aspects of experience and converting them into a different form that merely re-presents the original. Pierce describes the different association of a sign to ‘its object’ as either an icon, index or symbol (Figure 1). An icon refers to a sign that resembles its object in some way, such as a picture of a fire. An index is related to its object by an existential connection, in the way smoke is associated with a fire and finally the word ‘fire’ itself is a symbol, as we have learned to understand it through convention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a world that is not predictable, improvisation and evolution are more than a luxury: they are a necessity. The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent, but rather of making it an opportunity for more creative and more sustainable solutions. User-centered and participatory design approaches have focused primarily on activities taking place at design time. These approaches have not given enough emphasis and they have provided few mechanisms to support systems as living entities that can evolve over time. Metadesign is a unique design approach concerned with opening up solution spaces rather than complete solutions (hence the prefix meta-), and aimed at creating social and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. This approach extends the traditional notion of design beyond the original development of a system to include co-adaptive processes between users and systems that enable the users to act as designers in personally meaningful activities and be creative.",

Understanding the object as composed of both spatial and temporal form, we can use materials to design a ‘surface’ for experience that extends beyond the three-dimensional object. Presenting both theoretical considerations and design examples, we discuss the potentials of a new perspective on form as a basis for design research and education.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The field of Virtual Reality has been developing at a steady pace, and VR is finding new uses as a support for creative tasks. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model describing the links between user experience and creativity. Pre-existing theoretical links have been identified in relevant scientific literature. Two experiments were then conducted in order to identify new links and replicate results. These experiments involved respectively 76 and 42 participants who individually performed a task requiring divergent creativity using virtual reality drawing tools. The results indicate that cybersickness leads to a decrease in fluency, i.e. the number of ideas generated, but also shades the links between flow and the relevance of the ideas generated. On the basis of this result, we propose the CRUX model to lead to recommendations for the design of tools and simulations to support divergent creativity.",

    "abstract": "It is relatively stress-free to write about computer games as nothing too much has been said yet, and almost anything goes. The situation is pretty much the same when it comes to writing about games and gaming in general. The sad fact with alarming cumulative consequences is that they are under-theorized; there are Huizinga, Caillois and Ehrmann of course, and libraries full of board game studies,in addition to game theory and bits and pieces of philosophy – most notably those of Wittgenstein – but they won't get us very far with computer games. So if there already is or soon will be a legitimate field for computer game studies, this field is also very open to intrusions and colonisations from the already organized scholarly tribes. Resisting and beating them is the goal of our first survival game in this paper, as what these emerging studies need is independence, or at least relative independence.",

The observations will trace some characteristics of the community's vision of itself, how vulnerable that vision can be and how it can be maintained or revised after some unexpected occurrence shatters it. I argue that even though the rhetorical vision of virtual community can be imagined, it has to stay in touch with the 'real world' in order to have real influence on constructed online culture.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The scope of visual design is expanding to promote products and services across digital communication platforms, but support for coherent design with style guides seems limited. Based on the literature on style, coherence and design support tools with different levels of intelligence, we describe coherence in visual design and propose to integrate preset style guidelines and constraints into feedback interactions to support achieving visual coherence. After formative research with expert designers, we prototype a pseudo-AI design support tool to simulate attribute-specific feedback and conduct user research to probe how participants engage with feedback provided by a human wizard acting as an intelligent agent. We analyze patterns of feedback and types of reactions observed in participants’ design processes and outcomes. We then discuss the implications of attribute-specific feedback to describe visual coherence as a meta-property of design, and intelligent agents that guide situational judgements about visual coherence through feedback interactions.",

    "abstract": "Presently, designers of interactive narratives and video games have only a slender understanding of the aesthetic experiences their audiences and users seek. Using schema theory, this study articulates the two varieties of aesthetic pleasures that users of interactive works enjoy: immersion and engagement. It uses schema theory to define the characteristics of immersion and engagement in both conventional and new media. After examining how readers' experiences of these two different aesthetics may be enhanced or diminished by interface design, options for navigation, and other features, the essay concludes by looking beyond immersion and engagement to 'flow', a state in which readers are both immersed and engaged.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article sets out the notion of a Field Broadcast from the dual perspective of Rebecca Birch, one of the developers of a bespoke version of Flash Media Live Encoder and Bram Thomas Arnold, an artist who uses a case study from Sideways Festival, Belgium, 2012. Field Broadcast enables an artist to be in a field, suitably equipped, and stream live footage to an audience. It is an experiment in place, site and the notion of a field. It is a new method of making work in the space between site-specific performance and the digital realm: a way of working that enables artists to generate new artworks within the non-place of the Internet. Birch introduces the technology from a number of perspectives before it is fleshed out with evidence and experience from a live project that took place in Belgium in 2012. Sideways was a festival that traversed Belgium over four weeks and 400 km, with artists walking and generating work en route. The possibilities offered by Field Broadcast are explored in relation to the expanded field of ecology amidst Bourriaud's The Radicant (2009), Guatarri's The Three Ecologies (2005) and Morton's Ecology Without Nature (2007).",

    "title": "What design education tells us about design theory: a pedagogical genealogy",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In design theory, we often come across scholarly efforts that seek to define design as a unique discipline and to characterize it as a distinct category of practice, with its own epistemology in that it differs from sciences, arts and humanities (Cross, N. 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Oxford: Berg.; Dorst, K. 2015. Frame innovation: Create New Thinking by Design. Cambridge: The MIT Press. Nelson, H. G., and E. Stolterman. 2012. The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World. The MIT Press.; Redström, J. 2017. Making Design Theory. MIT Press.). Although such efforts are helpful in teasing forward the nature of design epistemologies and practices, we question them by critically engaging with epistemic paradigms informing design education, its structural forms, origins and purposes, historically, while suggesting the time has come to reevaluate design’s relationships with other epistemological traditions, including the sciences and humanities. We unpack history of design education, in order to problematize what we have come to view as overly schematized epistemological distinctions, most notably the asserted opposition between (what Schön calls) technical rationality and an alternative epistemology broadly linked to pragmatism and/or phenomenology. We do so by offering a genealogy of design education showing that since the nineteenth century, design programmes have continuously, if diversely, taught novice designers, methods, crafts, and attitudes that reflect diverse epistemological traditions. Theorists and educators of design have a shared interest in balancing the needs to appreciate and help develop that which is distinctive of design and also to build upon design’s rich epistemological connections to the sciences and humanities. Whereas the former helps the field improve its abilities to contribute to society, the latter provides many of the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical resources that make such contributions possible.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Self-expression is central to mental well-being and mental health therapy. Art therapy offers a wide range of expressive mechanisms, allowing individuals to process their emotions when traditional therapies prove unsuccessful. However, a lack of expertise or comfort with artistic expression, along with cost and waiting times, may hinder one's ability to receive needed mental health support. Creative machines can offer novel therapeutic approaches enabling the bereaved to engage in creative expression as and when needed. In this paper, we apply a co-creative songwriting system, ALYSIA, as a new form of therapy for those who had recently suffered the loss of a loved one. We evaluate the utility of this creative system in aiding bereaved individuals through user testing. The utility of collaborative creative systems for adaptation to bereavement is discussed and may have implications for other therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT How do we design for intersubjective, digitally-mediated encounters in the museum? We report on the process of designing a digital interactive installation called Sit with Me for a permanent museum exhibition on migration in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Focussing on this case-study, the article aims to unpick the tensions, challenges and opportunities arising from designing for intersubjectivity in the context of migration exhibitions. It particularly explores how perspectives from the past may be brought into a relation with contemporary visitor perspectives through the design of interaction spaces that enable dialogicality and other-oriented perspective taking. Our aim is to enrich current museological discourse on exhibiting and experiencing migration in museums, contributing much needed understandings on the use and role of digital interactive technologies in these contexts; we further contribute methodological insight about a research-through-design practice that critically addressed the museum’s desire to foster intersubjectivity in the encounters between Self and Other.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper considers the influence of 3D printers on the temporality and subjectivity of making by looking at current 3D printing processes through the concept of ‘duration’ that was theorized by the philosopher Henri Bergson. The discussion is contextualized within technological developments at the turn of the twentieth century—specifically, European railways—that changed our perception of time. The foundational ideas of duration are introduced as a response to these developments. The contemporary technological concept of ‘real-time computing’ is presented to contrast with duration and set up an in-depth explanation of the delays inherent to the 3D printing process. These delays are discussed within the discourse of 3D printing and technological innovation, in general. Current maker-3D printer interactions are then critiqued. Finally, an alternative method of 3D printing concrete that is founded on working with its inherent delays is introduced, along with its implications for digital making and the act of making time.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The home has been the subject of investigation in the social sciences and interaction design communities for decades. This has been driven not least by a wish to understand technology, energy demand, and how it might be understood in terms of social practices. In this paper, we reflect on several studies that have sought to capture this relationship. We introduce an evolving methodological approach we term ‘Resource Trace Interviewing’ that extends interview practice using visualizations of fine-grained quantitative data from sensors and software deployed in the home. By facilitating fuller accounts and joint sense-making between participants and researchers, this method better reveals the patterns of technology and energy use in the digitally connected home, and how this in turn relates to domestic practices. We reflect, for the first time, on the strengths and limitations of this approach as a guide to others studying similar socio-technical settings.",

As such the field is diverse, fragmented and lacks a coherent framework. Through analysis of examples in the field, we identify key areas of concern in the design of new systems, which we use as categories in the construction of a taxonomy. From our broad overview of the field, we select significant examples to analyse in greater depth. This analysis serves to derive principles that may aid designers scaffold their work on existing innovation. We explore successful evaluation techniques from other fields and describe how they may be applied to iterative design processes for improvisational systems. We hope that by developing a more coherent design and evaluation process, we can support the next generation of improvisational music systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research proposes value correspondence, which posits that the value shared in correspondence between stakeholders is essential for the development of placemaking in rural areas. By investigating location-based media; particularly mobile augmented reality (MAR) apps aimed at both reviving local tourism in rural townships and soliciting opinions from major stakeholders, the author has determined that local residents play a vital role in the placemaking process. However, research in this field has often ignored local residents and instead focused on tourists’ perceptions and augmented reality technology. Various MAR apps have been designed as forms of self-service technology that benefits tourists but, to some extent, also hinders dialog between tourists and locals; this results in value noncorrespondence, which may lead to the failure of placemaking. Thus, the author advocates that more attention should be paid to how locals can generate value in correspondence with other stakeholders via the use of MAR.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interwoven Sound Spaces is an interdisciplinary project which brought together telematic music performance, interactive textiles, interaction design, and artistic research. A team of researchers collaborated with two professional contemporary music ensembles based in Berlin, Germany, and Piteå, Sweden, and four composers, with the aim of creating a telematic distributed concert taking place simultaneously in two concert halls and online. Central to the project was the development of interactive textiles capable of sensing the musicians’ movements while playing acoustic instruments, and generating data the composers used in their works. Musicians, instruments, textiles, sounds, halls, and data formed a network of entities and agencies that was reconfigured for each piece, showing how networked music practice enables distinctive musicking techniques. We describe each part of the project and report on a research interview conducted with one of the composers for the purpose of analysing the creative approaches she adopted for composing her piece.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In a New Interface for Musical Expression (NIME), the design of the relationship between a musician’s actions and the instrument’s sound response is critical in creating instruments that facilitate expressive music performance. A growing body of NIMEs expose this design task to the end performer themselves, leading to the possibility of new insights into NIME mapping design: what can be learned from the mapping design strategies of practicing musicians? This research contributes a qualitative study of four highly experienced users of an end-user mapping instrument to examine their mapping practice. The study reveals that the musicians focus on designing simple, robust mappings that minimize errors, embellishing these control gestures with theatrical ancillary gestures that express metaphors. However, musical expression is hindered by the unintentional triggering of musical events. From these findings, a series of heuristics are presented that can be applied in the future development of NIMEs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper I will peruse a specific cinematic example of an uncertain-image, i.e. that of the film Creative Control (Dickinson B, dir. 2015. USA: Ghost Robot | Greencard Pictures | Mathematic | Magnolia Pictures | Amazon Studios). My interest in this film lies not, or at least not per se, or not solely, in its representationalism, but rather in its capturing of various kinds of uncertainty, to which I will here attend by situating the film against the backdrop of three different, yet interrelated, problematics related to the ubiquitous presence of digital imaging technologies: i.e., first, the concerns over digital or immaterial labour and the loss of eros; second, the use of contemporary cinematics (and the superimposition effect in particular) to address these and other issues related to living in ‘information-intensive mixed-reality environments;’ and third, the film's own suggestive counter-image, which is that of the characters’ partly defection, and, arguably, that of the image's own withdrawal from the world.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article explores code as part of a reading strategy, focusing on a case study of works produced as part of a programming challenge entitled National Novel Generation Month (NaNoGenMo). For the challenge, participants needed to develop a programme that produces an output, most often a creative text, and make both the output and its source code available to readers. I approach the NaNoGenMo texts as works involving multiple audiences with different capabilities. I argue that examining the code alongside the produced text is a reading strategy that offers a different reading experience than that of reading the work without the code and that the source code can provide insights into the work’s authorial intention. As computer-generated texts are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, discussion of their authorship is as relevant as ever. This article offers one perspective on this discussion and on the significance of authorial intention in computer-generated works.",

    "title": "Improvisational creativity",
    "abstract": "As we enter a seemingly new age of technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI), a growing number of researchers have begun exploring how to design and interact with creative machines. With systems now able to achieve impressive degrees of agency and autonomy, any such interactions require new thinking about how to design interfaces between artists and creative computational systems. How does one improvise with a creative partner that is not human, yet outwardly displays a degree of agency, intention and autonomy? This special issue on improvisational creativity advances the dialogue on how we design, develop, conceptualise and create with computer systems in an improvisational context. The call for submissions for this issue asked for an examination of both the challenges and opportunities for creative improvisation between people and computer systems. It emphasized themany possible dimensions and settings in which improvisation can take place—including in performance, art-making or scientific research—along with the multi-disciplinary nature of any potential contribution to this growing field of enquiry. Improvisation is one of the most demanding yet rewarding creative acts. It has been well studied in situations where individuals interact with tools, or in human groups (Sawyer 2006). Recently, however, the idea of computer systems being valuable co-creative partners in improvisational settings has gained acceptance and is now an active research area in (for example) the AI and Computational Creativity communities. Being largely in its infancy, there are many important questions and open problems for this new field of enquiry. For example, how do we effectively improvise with ‘intelligent’ or ‘creative’ machines, particularly when they are conceptualised neither as tools nor human partners? What are the creative and artistic challenges in building computational improvisational partners? How does the psychology of improvisation change when machines become part of an improvisational group? How can digital technologies and AI support and enhance human creativity in an improvisational context? This special issue grew out of a similarlythemed workshop on improvisational creativity held inPrato, Italy in July 2017 (McCormack,Gifford, and Knotts 2017). Some of papers in this special issue arose from discussions and collaborations formed at the workshop. Additionally, the workshop fleshed out a number of topics that became the basis for this special issue, including those that have yet to be adequately explored in published research. They include generalisable design principles for computational improvisors and the evaluation of their efficacy. Many current systems are characterised by their bespoke, artistdrivennature—reflecting the individual aesthetic, functional or performative concerns of their creators. As such they are ad hoc: the systems themselves may even be improvised, and evaluation beyond personal aesthetic or functional judgments are rarely performed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Automated detection and recognition of faces have been implemented in a broad range of media environments. Following that development, what concerns us in this article is the analysis of emotions from facial expressions using computer-based systems, in relation to which we critically investigate the use of theories of basic emotions. We explore in depth the company Affectiva’s attempts to translate, represent and schematize human emotions, as they raise a variety of problems and issues of uncertainty. We analyse the uncertainties concerning the processing of the human face ‘as image’ due to issues concerning temporality and static images as well as polyphony and modulations of the spectrum of expressions. One of our key arguments concerns the temporal character of human emotions, and we address how algorithmically regulated protocols of discretization may be said to prompt specific patterns of emotional responses and expressions based on an ideal of eliminating uncertainty. Through discussions via art pieces by Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald, we question what happens when the protocols of computer systems start to perform aspects of emotional labour for us, making judgments by predicting adequate emotional responses based on the use of the strict metrics criticized in the article.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In a computer game narrative, a user influences the ordering of events. To model this behaviour, game designers and writers need to use some kind of programming primitives. A computer game script will hence differ from, for instance, a movie screenplay in that traditional dialogue text is complemented with some textual or visual logic formalism. Not all groups involved in production of a game have a programming background and may therefore be unable to easily comprehend such formalisms. This paper presents a novel approach to game dialogue writing where traces from play-throughs are used as the core of the script. Alternative branches are identified and presented in relation to the main trace. The approach has been implemented in a tool that has been used successfully by three professional writers in mobile game production. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to enable non-programmers to work with interactive narratives.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Not infrequently, smart home imaginaries and installations are envisaged for nuclear families dwelling in detached houses fitted with the latest Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. In our article, we follow one approach to escape this powerful but inadequate projection that entails inviting people to imagine alternative forms of domestic IoT use. Surveying the setup of these nascent endeavours, in particular attempts that pivot on narrative accounts and forward-oriented fictions on the design of new habitats, we show how these seek to evoke visions of technologically supported cohabitation and everyday life. Due to their inclusive ambitions, such approaches face participatory predicaments that arise from the sought-after spontaneity and creativity within a purposive process. In response, all of them resort to methodological scaffolding that helps their designers to reconcile the tension between the idiosyncrasies embraced by the procedures and the overarching requirements of a particular exercise.",

    "title": "Speculative design: crafting the speculation",
    "abstract": "The article positions the author's work as speculative design but—like the term design fictions—is open to several interpretations. How is the fictional character of such work conceptualised and produced? What kinds of speculation are involved? The article considers the value of one particular approach and argues that speculative design serves two distinct purposes: first, to enable us to think about the future; second, to critique current practice. Methods are described through case studies, either of the author's own projects or projects completed by graduates of the design interactions course at the Royal College of Art. A key concept is the ‘perceptual bridge’—the means by which designs engage their audience. The article argues that a vital factor in the success of a Speculative Design proposal is the careful management of the speculation, specifically what informs the use of technology, aesthetics, behaviour, interaction and function of the designed artefact.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article discusses methodological considerations of user-centred design for non-human animals. These considerations are illustrated through a design research project that aims to apply digital technology to build games for orangutans’ enrichment. The article argues that design for other species reveals limitations of designers’ knowledge of prospected users. The article explores how to approach participants who cannot express themselves verbally and how to recognise play that may not look familiar to the designer. The article finally presents a participatory design method that allows for non-human contributions in design. This method applies play as an interspecies co-creative act and can be used as a starting point for addressing questions of difference in play and designing games that allow for ambiguous play.",

    "title": "Epistemologies of prototyping: knowing in artistic research",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Increasingly material artefacts are attributed a key role in research in the arts and design. Issues of dissemination and legitimacy of knowledge are however heavily disputed, often through redefinitions of the concept of knowledge itself. This article contributes to these debates by focusing on artistic prototypes, identified here as one of the prevailing outcomes in technologically engaged art research projects. In contrast with a common conceptualisation of knowledge emerging from inside the world of artistic research as subjective, ineffable and emotional, I discuss four examples to highlight how artistic prototypes can support transferable and generative contributions to knowledge, grounded in ad hoc but innovative methodologies. Furthermore, the examples offer insightful considerations that help to identify artistic research when conducted outside official institutions, as opposed to simply process-oriented art practices.",

    "abstract": "Networks, spaces, objects: ‘a thing is a thing in as much as it things’ Guest Editor Derek Hales, Digital Research Unit, UK In this special issue of Digital Creativity we will focus on the ways in which networks have diffused into physical spaces and material artefacts, thereby augmenting reality. Through GSM, GPS, GIS, WIFI, CCTV, RFID, NFC, WSN and other systems and networks, is the internet mobilised or atomised? Physical space, the space of matter, now intersects with the space of media, electronics, information processing and surveillance networks. Alongside the objectification of events as ‘things’ and ‘locations’ this represents, does the physical a particular ‘locale’, a network of artefacts, or material surfaces – also become augmented and malleable in new hybrid ways? Are these ways that depend on fluidity, transversality, temporality, and virtuality as network cultures collide with spatial practices? Papers are invited from any discipline or community that illustrate and critique spatially localised, yet networked practices or devices. The special issue also welcomes reviews of projects exhibitions and workshops involving tangible, material objects and networks of sensor systems and other ‘things’ in other locations. This special issue invites contributions from researchers and practitioners operating after ‘locative media’ toward, for, or even against, an ‘internet of things’ exploring: augmented reality, ambient intelligence, tangible media and networked devices, physical computing, hardware hacking, mobile computing, location based services, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, interactive architecture. Interdisciplinary papers at the intersection of interactive media, network culture, spatial practices, and the spatial imaginary are particularly welcome. We therefore also invite readings on space and culture, place and location, alternate realities, parallel worlds, place and literature, geofiction, LARPs, topoanalysis, psychogeography, the cultural history of electronic objects, ethics, urban geography and urban informatics, social architectures and participatory practices, relational aesthetics, science and technology studies of the spatial sciences, the ontologies and epistemologies of ‘things’ and locations.

    "title": "Dialogic weaving: a favorable tension between design and craft",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Focusing on a process where a designer embeds herself in craftspeople’s workshops with the intention of ‘learning from inside’ and ‘making together’; this paper proposes pathways for considering collaboration between designers and craftspeople via digital fabrication and weaving. The tension of forces that make weaving possible, act as an analogy for this collaboration as well as providing the title of the project as ‘One Over, One Under’. The project proposes a mode of working and a spectrum of outcomes where the designer has a first-hand experience of production techniques, engages in a serious and continuous dialogue through making, and develops an intervention that also brings forth her own skill set (introducing digital fabrication and structural variations), thus transforming the conventions and boundaries between established roles and manufacturing techniques. An experiment that resulted in a series of objects considering both the technologies of production and the input of the designer, this process not only increases the potentials that crafts hold for the field of design, but it also offers possibilities of collaboration and a further articulation of the design act.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a simple and easy to use framework for web jamming using the OpenSound Control (OSC) protocol (2002) and SuperCollider (2002) by James McCartney. The word ‘web jamming’ refers to playing music together over the Internet. This kind of musical collaboration over networks has been around for a while and has already been implemented in a number of applications. Even though much of the recent development in this field is very impressive and provides the players with all sorts of customisation for sound and graphics, I still feel some very important things are lacking. Most of all I would like to see personality reflected throughout the system, and by providing a framework suitable for connecting musicians together rather than a fixed set of musical instruments for them to use, I think this can be achieved. So, by handing over the complete design of the virtual instruments, what parameters to control, how they will sound, what they will look like etc., to the players themselves, I wish to open up web jamming for individual and creative use to all kinds of musicians. If the players can express their ‘sound’ more freely, this can compensate somewhat for delayed reactions, lack of eye contact, gestures and atmospheres lost due to physical displacement and technological limitations.",

The article argues that a user’s experience of the rhythms within a design will play a significant role in its affective impact.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores the limits technology places upon space; specifically, it looks at building and asset management systems, which are employed to manage and construct the built environment. Building management systems (BMS) are critical in operating any modern commercial building, deconstructing space and reconstructing it out of manageable assets. I will demonstrate through a case study how this process of de/reconstruction can render the intention of a space uncertain. Deleuze’s ‘assemblage’ theory is used as a potential model of how space is conceived as a conglomeration of things. I draw from a number of theorists, including Lefebvre and Coyne to explore the problematic of how space is quantified, constructed and interpreted, analysing the effect of BMS on spatial production. Ultimately, I offer a methodology developed through original research that sheds light on how space might be reclaimed from these systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The lack of diversity in engineering and perpetuation of inequities through engineering designs have motivated the rise of new curricula centred on the integration of traditional technical content with social aspects of technology. However, the ‘revolutionizing’ of curricula has primarily been spearheaded by junior faculty, women and faculty of colour. This article uses an autoethnographic approach to explore the development of social justice-oriented curricula within engineering from the perspectives of junior women and faculty of colour. Drawing on feminist and critical race theory, we discuss how power dynamics within the school, university and engineering more broadly have shaped the development and teaching of justice-oriented engineering. Through the lens of our experiences, we show that, despite the support from some institutional allies and administrators, stereotypes, hegemonic norms and microaggressions can undermine efforts for social and structural change in engineering education, even as such changes are supported and promoted by the institution.",

    "title": "Additive race: colorblind discourses of realism in performance capture technologies",
    "abstract": "Abstract This contribution interrogates the sites in which performance capture simultaneously fetishizes and hides the performer's flesh-and-blood body, asking how technologies preoccupied with ‘realism’ inscribe race in a moment obsessed with the myth of post-raciality. The link between the tradition of minstrelsy and the multicultural celebration of difference as additive, rather than embodied, exposes how whiteness must animate itself against a fictitious ‘Other’ imagined as embodying culture. At the same time, discourses of colorblindness assume that race no longer constitutes a significant category of analysis—a move that negates the daily lived realities and material manifestations of power operating on bodies in order to foreclose conversations about ongoing racial injustice. Our term ‘additive race’ draws out how performance practices, particularly in a digital context, participate in post-racial ideologies of a world in which the goals of the civil rights movement have supposedly been realized by reducing race to a matter of style.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This contribution identifies theories and practices specific to performance art for the purpose of describing a potentially fruitful area of exchange between non-representational performance and human–computer interaction (HCI). We identify three strands of current HCI research that are already working in this area of overlap, which we have termed ‘performative experience design’. We then single out one of these strands, digitally augmented autobiographical performance, for further examination. Digitally augmented autobiographical performance draws on both autobiographical performance, which we see as rooted in performance and performance art, and media sharing, a field of research within HCI. Drawing on our experiences of designing a digital system for autobiographical performance, we offer a series of proposals for HCI research and applications of performative experience design.",

    "abstract": "This paper engages with the recent computer-mediated video installations of Australian media artist Tina Gonsalves. Gonsalves' interactive video Chameleon (2008–2010) explores the scientific notion of ‘emotional contagion’, the dynamics of how emotions spread from one person to another in social contexts. An ambitious work at the interface of media art, neuroscience and advanced ‘affective computing’ being developed at the MIT Media Lab, Chameleon interprets the notion of empathy as a kind of code that can be simulated in an installation context. The work continues and expands upon the artist's interest in the intimacies and vulnerabilities of human emotions. It is a genuinely interdisciplinary work that breaks new ground in terms of the dialogue between art, science and technology.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The paper reviews abstract films and the notions of time that occur in them, contrasting them with the use of time in digital art. Developments by the author in making various generative digital abstract, or concrete, works are described and compared to film. The generation of the time element of the works described is integral with the generation of images. It is shown how different approaches to dealing with time in the digital context have emerged. In particular, an integrated constructivist approach has built from concepts in abstract film to go beyond cinema in a way that makes significant use of digital media. It has been possible to develop these works into interactive pieces by using artificial intelligent methods in various ways. True to the spirit of the early work described, these interactive works are also concrete rather than virtual. The art uses artificial intelligence to make real realities.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the recent developments in the use of digital media in the research process. It concentrates on the use of these media in practice-based PhD research in Art & Design, drawing on the experience gained at the Centre for Research in Art & Design, Gray's School of Art. The digital thesis is now a reality. The features of two examples of a digital thesis are described. The paper discusses the key considerations in developing such a document: benefits and limitations; general issues concerning planning, structure, and content; specific considerations for the design of the digital thesis, including navigation, required technology and support, different formats and development time. The paper concludes by speculating on issues for future developments.",

    "abstract": "During the late-1990s dotcom boom, experts claimed that the net was a global electronic marketplace where every piece of information would be a commodity. Yet, one of the most striking features of the net is the ubiquity of its hi-tech version of the gift economy. Information is for sharing not for selling. We contribute our time and effort to the hi-tech gift economy because it is our self-interest. However much of our own work we give away, we will always get more information back in return from all the other people who are on the network. The gift economy of the net isn’t just a method of pirating commercially-available media. It also enables us to publish our own media without needing prior approval. At the beginning of the 21 st century, the net is now inspiring novel forms of expression which reflect its own social mores and technical protocols.",

The perspective that is articulated is drawn from the work of the Interactive Cinema group at the MIT Media Laboratory. Situated at the boundary of evolving technologies and media storytelling, research of the group iterates between shaping and presenting cinematic expressions using emerging technologies and developing the required tools and platforms to support its creation and delivery. This dynamic is integral to collaborative expression on largescale projects, as well as in more individual research endeavours such as a current investigation, which conjoins new tangible display technologies with interactive stories.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Art and Technology – A New Unity.’ This was a slogan of the Bauhaus art school, but it could also be a slogan for digital artworks that have been minted as NFTs. We trace the lineage of the idea of the unity of art and technology from: the Bauhaus art school, which operated from 1919–1933; to buildings in Boca Raton that were co-designed in the late 1960s by a former Bauhaus teacher, Marcel Breuer; to an exhibit of the Lynn University NFT museum that, as of July 2023, is displayed in a building that was co-designed by Breuer and is now part of the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC). We juxtapose the Bauhaus’s approach to the unity of art and technology, understood by reflecting on Breuer’s architecture, with the unity of art and technology exemplified by NFT artworks. We argue that while audiences do not experience NFT artworks with the same ‘aura’ that audiences experienced when viewing artworks in the past, audiences can experience NFT artworks with what we call the ‘simulacrum’ of aura. Audiences can experience the simulacrum of aura because an NFT can be understood as original and authentic and cannot be identically reproduced.",

Ozlab facilitates manual simulations of the interactivity of proposed user interfaces, thereby simplifying testing and making the development of ideas during test runs possible. Even non-programmers can perform these activities. The paper reports on a pilot study within the efforts currently taking place concerning educationalists focusing on language disabilities, where the clients could benefit from graphical support in interactive teaching aids. Ozlab extends the traditional, linguistically- based Wizard-of-Oz technique for manual prototyping to graphical interaction. The pilot study indicates that a refined Ozlab could be used by inexperienced designers for testing their own ideas. The fact that requirements of interactivity thus can be visualised by laymen will have implications for the design of requirements specification for multimedia products.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to study the implications and ethical variables of User-Centered Design (UCD) methods in the design of mobile applications. We carried out a review of the literature on ethics in User-Centered Design within the field of mobile applications. We studied three disciplines that are applied in the design of mobile applications and that include UCD in their definition: Human–Computer Interaction, User Experience, and Design for Behavior Change. The analysis has allowed us, firstly, to identify different ethical approaches to applying UCD, and secondly, to propose a new tool for analyzing the ethical implications of UCD taking into account two variables: alignment with the user’s interests and will, and the type of influence the design generates. This paper shows that UCD methods are not always used for the benefit of the user, and asserts the ethical responsibility of design processes involving how users interact with mobile technologies as well as the importance of media education so that citizens become technologically responsible.",

    "abstract": "HotPlate ‘HotPlate’ was an international exhibition of printmaking held in Brighton, UK, from 3 July to 15 August 2010, in digital and traditional media. This was a project that was initiated in 2009, during the VI Novosibirsk Graphic Art Biennial, which was held at the Novosibirsk State Art Museum. Novosibirsk, Russia. As the artistic curator of the project, I invited curators from nine countries, to select printed works from some of the most innovative contemporary printmakers in the field. HotPlate focused on installation and unframed work, seeking to position prints as objects and site-specific pieces, as well as wall-based works on paper. By approaching contemporary printmaking in the widest possible way, HotPlate sparked a lively conversation about process, technique and technology within a continuously evolving area of the visual arts. Here the emphasis was on testing the perceived boundaries of the medium, breaking out of the literal and metaphorical ‘frame’ and exploring new formats which actively engage with the gallery space. It also opened up the possibilities for prints to move beyond the gallery walls and engage with modern street culture. Drawing upon a broad cultural and geographical demographic, the exhibition brought together a range of influences. The prints address a vast spectrum of conceptual, figurative and illustrative themes, touching upon current events and politics, contemporary urban landscapes, portraiture, interior worlds and abstraction. The pieces range from traditional etching, lithography, relief and screen-printing to more contemporary digital imaging, and are printed onto a variety of substrates, including cloth, synthetic paper, metal and plasterboard. Some prints appear as light projections and others arise out of experiments with heat-sensitive inks, vegetable juices and bacteria. An artist’s book, surrounded by veils of printed fabric, and relief prints on three-dimensional forms move the medium into the physical space of the viewer. HotPlate is a unique project offering visitors the opportunity to experience the vibrant and continually evolving world of contemporary printmaking first hand. The printmakers that have been selected to be included in this art space have all used computer technology to engage with their artistic process. http://www.phoenixarts.org/site-archive/123international-printmaking.html Koichi Kiyono, (Japan)—‘Cultivation’ Digital Creativity 2011, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 115–126",

    "abstract": "Abstract We propose that pretending is a cognitive faculty which enables us to create and immerse ourselves in possible worlds. These worlds range from the veridical to the fantastic and are frequently realised as stories varying from the fictional to the scientific. This same ability enables us to become immersed and engaged in such stories (which we may have created) too. Whether we are shooting “aliens” or are engaged in a passionate romance, these experiences are facilitated by our ability to pretend. While it might seem that we can imagine or make-believe anything, in practice there are limits to what we can pretend. We draw upon both theoretical perspectives and from the work practice of animators. By identifying these limits, we are, of course, also defining the nature of pretending.",

    "title": "Avatars of the tortoise: life, longevity and simulation",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the contemporary fascination with artificial life and simulation. The concept of artificial life has broadened its reach from a rarefied speculative discipline to a phenomenon in popular culture and a fertile trope within the electronic arts. From its representation in the cinema, to virtual pets and tamagotchis, to advanced digital art, the essay examines the category of “life” in the age of digital simulation. Questions to do with artificial life range from the representation or incarnation of our “real” selves as avatars in digital spaces (such as computer games), to popular, artistic and scientific attempts to simulate autonomous life forms. In the context of digital art, the essay critically engages with the work of Australian artist Troy Innocent, in particular with his most recent installation, Artefact (2001). In Artefact, Innocent actively investigates the digital investment of life in avatars as they operate in an interactive game environment. In this work, Innocent prompts an intriguing, if troubling, question, central to the overall interests of this essay: what, in the age of digital simulation, is not alive?",

    "abstract": "A brief overview of the field of Interaction Design is provided in order to contextualise the Create10 conference. The conference was held at Edinburgh Napier University in June/July 2010 and attracted over 120 delegates. The papers that comprise this special section in Digital Creativity reflect aspects of the debates that took place both within the main conference and in the work exhibited at the Student Design Exhibition. The papers by Fallman and Stolterman, and Edmonds explore the need for, and possible sources of, theoretical underpinnings in Interaction Design. While the work presented firstly by Kettley, Downes, Harrigan and Glazzard and secondly by Speed emphasise the importance of ‘learning through doing’ as a means of better understanding the process of design and the nature of user engagement.",

The pulse sequencer is a generic, language-based sequence processing engine which can be regarded as an arpeggiator, a sequencer, or anything in between. In fact, arpeggiation and sequencing are special cases of a more general control system. We conclude with some comments about the strengths and weaknesses of the system drawn from several years’ experience in performance projects.",

    "abstract": "In this article I describe and discuss the ontology of pervasive gaming, paying special attention to gameplay, rules and space. Taking rules as my starting point I initially discuss the term gameplay and divide it into two levels. One has to do with the more or less successful blend of rules and tactics, while the other hinges on the balance between free, exploration-based play and fixed, level-oriented gaming. Then I define the act of playing and being in play-mode as opposed to the act of gaming and being in game-mode in order to reflect on how these two simultaneous activities—in game-play—profoundly influence the possibility space of current and future pervasive games. The second part of the article comments on the interplay of tangible and computational spatiality in pervasive gaming, and it all concludes in a number of concrete ‘design heuristics’ aimed at pervasive gamers and entrepreneurs.",

Our article presents a case study of the installation At Hand, which was produced for the Media Facades Festival Europe 2010. In the installation touch became the interaction metaphor for an embodied encounter. The installation pilot is understood as a place in which two research projects come into contact with each other while approaching the installation from the point of view of their disciplinary framings. Together these projects enquire into how a multi-touch screen in a public outdoor location is able to function as the site for an interactive narrative, and question how to foster the transition from spectator to participant at the interface. The first part of the article describes the development of the narrative concept for At Hand. In the second part, the usability of the At Hand pilot is addressed in a field study.",

This project is based on use of resources of the global civil society emerging in global ‘transformations’ related to migration, media and ‘the social work of the imagination’. Whereas much new media debate departs from the assumption of media ubiquity affecting our notions of reality, the article will attempt a different perspective. It will ponder issues of collective imagination as exerted by way of such effects, i.e. in cultural forms that emerge out of media-roles in the ‘complex connectivity’ in globalisation processes.",

    "abstract": "Historically, repeating patterns have been a technological and commercial restraint of mass-produced printed textiles. However, we have a natural desire to find, or make, patterns and order in many aspects of our visual lives, making many repeating patterns pleasing to the eye. Now that the technology has the capability to produce lengths of fabric directly from computer to ink-jet printer, both the technological and commercial restraints are being lifted. This paper addresses the possibilities for non-repeating patterns on fabric, investigating both the practicalities and design considerations through the use of examples created in my own practical research. As the designer and programmer of the software I have been able to produce designs which look intriguingly like they may repeat, but in fact, never do.",

    "abstract": "Future typographic and graphic designers will need to be able to design for a range of media, both to secure their role and to provide the necessary design expertise in technological environments. This paper proposes an approach to teaching which introduces theoretical issues within a practical design project to encourage the development of general concepts that can be transferred to different technologies. A specific project on designing for the screen is described, which is taught as part of a BA degree in Typography & Graphic Communication. In the context of this project, reasons for introducing theory are proposed, examples of the nature of the theory are given, and the methods used to introduce material are illustrated. A detailed account of one student's implementation of this project is used to demonstrate how theoretical issues can provide direction in a design task. However, careful consideration needs to be given to how theory and practice are integrated to encourage students to look beyond the short-term benefits of specific training to the development of more general knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Building on an experimental study carried out in Dublin, Ireland, this paper discusses the potential of locative technology to mediate the communication of city inhabitants' everyday life experiences of urban space. The study was designed as a spatial-technological experiment and focused on eliciting and representing experiences embedded in everyday life practices, generated by people's daily movement through the city. The paper highlights the importance of first ‘provoking’ an enhanced awareness of one's everyday environments before such experiences can come to the surface and be expressed. Moreover, inspired by the open source movement, it illustrates possibilities for expanding the role of ordinary city inhabitants from data-generators to co-producers of knowledge for, and about, the city, through the use of locative technology. In doing so, the paper advances knowledge regarding the use of Global Position Systems technology in citizen-sensing initiatives.",

    "abstract": "This article describes issues in evaluating emotional and affective aspects of interaction. In particular it considers the relationship between experience factors and instrumental goals. The role of qualitative interaction factors varies from system to system, dependent on overall system goals and values, both for user and designer. Defining this role helps us to understand what is significant about emotional experience within interaction, in the context of user and organisational values. The utility and limitations of a range of evaluation methods is considered in relation to issues of tacitness, first-person experience and its relationship both to attitude formation and overt behaviour. In doing so it addresses key questions about the nature of enquiry in user-experience evaluation where experience factors are bound up with instrumental goals.",

    "abstract": "The foci of the research are two key conceptual elements for painting production (work process) and display (exhibition and sales): 1) the screen (taken to mean the screen as the surface, area, or space upon which the painting is produced and/ or exhibited), and, 2) the frame (taken to mean the physical boundary and the material frame of the screen, the environment or circumtextual frame, the link between viewer and image), as key conceptual elements for painting production (work process) and the consumption (exhibition and sales). The screen and the frame are analysed in relation to: • their selection and use by the practitioner; • their influence in the construction and display of the painting; • their determination as available resources; • their impact in painting practice as a whole.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce ‘hyper-twist’, a distortion technique for the production of abstract artistic forms (see Figure 1). It is developed via exploiting the theoretical feature of deforming an infinite space filled with a hyper-elastic media. Any object placed within this space can change its shape as a result of the distortion of the space. Based on this developed theoretic insight, we have produced a computer program where point sources are used to control the form and extent of distortion. These sources perform a similar function to forces exerting on a soft body. By qualifying them with a distortion tensor, they define the patterns of the resultant distortions. Linking this representation with time, temporal effects can be produced. Our work, incorporating physics into a digital creation, presents a new form of algorithmic art.",

    "title": "Editorial: ArtAbilitation",
    "abstract": "The inaugural international conference ArtAbilitation was hosted at the Utzondesigned Centre for the Performing Arts, Musikhuset Esbjerg, Denmark in September 2006. It supported the renowned International Conference for Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies (ICDVRAT) which celebrated a decade of biennial conferences. Thus a claim was made for the hosting of ‘The conference of the decade’! ‘ArtAbilitation’, as an open conceptual entity, carries—through its mission statement—manifold interpretations. The concept has emerged out of a new evolving platform for interdisciplinary research, knowledge exchange and product development entitled SoundScapes. The SoundScapes concept involves the use of sensor technologies that are not worn on the body and involve human data capture from movement within an invisible volumetric information space. This data is mapped to personalised multimedia which is experienced as a virtual environment. This capture technique and mapping strategy empowers intuitive and natural control through gesture for motivated engagement with the virtual environment. The personalisation of the interactive environment enables utility as a new therapeutic supplement for practitioners. SoundScapes was featured in an article in Digital Creativity, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 43–53 and is the subject of a book that is currently being written. Scientific reports on alternative realities such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and artificial reality are as welcome in ArtAbilitation as are the most basic of assistive devices like a single switcher. Hardware and software, digital and analogue, positivism and hermeneutic are all amongst targeted topics. Too diverse? Possibly but let me explain a little more... Some may refer to the term ‘ArtAbilitation’ from a linguistic perspective and interpret it as in ‘Art (Reh)abilitation’ and thus directed at art therapists who use art forms such as painting, music, dance, theatre and movement in practises that give benefit from within rehabilitation to the community of, for example, those with a disability or damage. There are also other groups for whom an alternative interpretation has been suggested. These are groups closely linked to therapy but differ in that they are categorised as not capable of rehabilitation but, rather, undergo abilitation. In other words, due to the severity of their dysfunction they are classified as regressive. This group is addressed so as to give whatever quality of life is possible with whatever functional ability they have and according to the human resources available. Addressing optimally requires passionate meaning and conviction, as in art. However, as Davies (2005) states, this group is often excluded from research or healthcare funding due to their inherent complexities or diverse characteristics. Despite being a rich resource from within which to explore unchartered avenues of human research, this exclusion from funding possibly brings it even closer to art! Consider for a moment when a person loses a sense and is categorized as disabled, often it is witnessed that a compensatory sense becomes strengthened. A blind man’s nuances of profile, feeling of space or auditory perception all grow into a heightened state. This arbitrary sensory nuance is fertile ground for the development of future art, artist and audience. Yet, many steer clear of the blind man tap, tap, tapping across the street, not realising his listening to the echo of his cane sounding against the targeted sidewalk or pavement is giving him distance feedback. With current predicted demographic trends the balance of people with disability versus those without is changing towards an unprecedented predicament for society. Eurostats (ec. europa.eu/eurostat) inform of an increased aged population, decreased workforce and extended life expectancies. The aged population is where disability figures predominate. e d it o ri a l",

    "abstract": "Abstract Finding creative solutions to design problems depends heavily on a fruitful exploration in early phases. Many aspects of evolutionary computation (EC) and in particular genetic algorithms (GA) make them highly suited as computational tools for discovering good solutions. This paper discusses specific aspects of the GA method which parallel traditional design methodologies described by creativity researchers including Gordon, deBono, Parnes, and Osborn among others. Because EC methods work with populations of ‘fairly good’ solutions, there is less danger that creativity will be harmed by design fixation, on one ‘best’ solution. An example application is demonstrated using the design of a small truss bridge. The solutions offered by the application are varied enough to allow the designer a choice of forms. At the same time, all of the solutions offered are ‘fairly good’. This demonstrates the aspects of EC which make it well suited for creative exploration of problems.",

    "abstract": "The Virtual gallery of contemporary jewellery CD-Rom (VGCJ) is a series of curated exhibitions, contributing to, and arising from academic papers on key themes about cutting-edge design, trends, and innovations in jewellery. This paper records the development of the conceptual design of the gallery. It tells the story, not of the design process, but of the key design decisions, and the theoretical and practical considerations behind them, that transformed the initial concept into the reality of a final product. The project looked at the potential of new technology to approximate presentation and display, and one of the driving issues in the design was the primacy and authenticity of the object. By focussing on the issues relating to museums and museum display theory the project arrived at a solution that was shaped by these issues, rather than being driven by the technology. The final design represents a synergy between the salient features of a museum and gallery visit, an academic print publication, and a museum catalogue.",

This project aims at creating a documentary and artistic experience that departs from conventional immersive journalism by presenting to its viewers a story made out of very small narrative units, and with subjects presented in the form of virtual sculptures devoid of any specific identity. The idea is that by leaving much of the making sense left open, viewers will have to fill in the gaps. The working hypothesis is that this will help create a different emotional, intellectual and political connection with the piece than that a conventional documentary would achieve, particularly to an audience unfamiliar with, or even politically alien to its specific context. Public exhibition of the work and user evaluation showed that the piece was successful in creating such connections.",

Three case studies are described which explore interaction in public space. The fictions create imaginative projections with the intention of generating reaction and responses in the public that will lead to a greater understanding of the physical and conceptual design space. The first case study explored how citizens could anonymously comment on their relationship with a city. The second study encouraged participants to reflect on their habits and rituals and to view these through fresh eyes. The final case study sought to surprise and engage gallery visitors through an interactive piece that raised issues concerning the surreptitious capture of data. The paper concludes by reflecting on the utility of design fictions and the role they can play in concept envisionment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artists’ adoption of CNC devices and related technologies is making possible novel printmaking processes and variations on techniques. Such changes suggest a need to broaden our understanding of what constitutes a print under contemporary technological conditions. This article looks at the human-machine relationship and the state of creative cognition in the act of woodblock printmaking. Connections between the printmaker’s and programmer’s notions of creating lines indicate different ways of thinking-drawing space and position the resulting 2D print not just as the transfer of ink from block to paper but also existing as lines of code and as a 3D space. By drawing parallels between the embodied yet distributed act of traditional Japanese woodblock printmaking and the experience of CNC computerized carving in the work of Mike Lyon, I explore how woodblock printmaking might facilitate a productive collaboration with digital carving technologies.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Games now inhabit a space where creativity is no longer centered around human authorship. The use of procedural content generation has been embraced by industry, academics and fans as a means for reducing labor cost, providing additional replayable content for players, investigating computational creativity in a complex and multifaceted domain and enabling new kinds of playable experiences. This incorporation of computational creative labor confuses authorship, labor politics and responsibility for rhetoric embedded in the procedures by complicating the way in which the computer is portrayed to users, researchers and other developers. We can apply feminist methodologies attentive to questions of difference and power in systemic structures in order to better understand each of these questions in turn. This article presents an analysis of the post-anthropocentric phenomenon of computer creativity within games, via a feminist analysis of procedural content generating algorithms, its role in game design and its public portrayal.",

    "abstract": "The paper describes a programme of research and practice in which the evaluation of interactive artworks in a public space is undertaken as part of the creative process. It explores the different perspectives involved in the research process of Beta_Space, a public exhibition and evaluation facility in the Powerhouse Museum Sydney. The three viewpoints presented, of artist, evaluator and curator, add up to much more than each one can offer on its own. The three roles can be taken by one, two, three or more people in any particular case but teamwork across disciplines is strongly implied by the approach that we have described. The paper reflects upon the different concerns and approaches and the ways in which they are entwined.",

    "abstract": "Based on the data from the 2006/7 multimedia exhibition, RePossessed, during which over 400 members of the public watched scenes from Hitchcock's Vertigo, this paper describes the basis of an approach to the use of eye-tracking techniques, visualisations, and metrics to measure the influence of directorial techniques on film viewers' experience. Used as part of a repertoire of tools, the visualisation and quantitative evaluation of eye movement data can provide an intuitive and accessible approach to the evaluation of moving image based media and allow the conventions, assumptions and intuitive practices of film-making to be examined.",

    "title": "Exploring the child's mind – contextmapping research with children",
    "abstract": "User involvement in design processes is applied in progressingly earlier phases. With contextmapping techniques, design researchers involve users even in the very first stage of identifying the everyday context of product use and assessing users' needs, prior to defining product types or desirable product characteristics. When applying contextmapping techniques with children, these techniques need adaptation to their understanding and skills. Lessons can be learned from related forms of children's involvement in co-design processes. A few examples from sessions with children are given in this paper and experiences are combined into a tentative set of guidelines. It is suggested that the application of these techniques with children comes with some specific challenges and asks for further development, preferably in cooperation with the field of pedagogy, ethnography and child psychology. It is also suggested that results from these studies, when aggregated and made public, can provide designers of children's products with a source of inspiration and empathy for their future users.",

    "abstract": "The article explores the spatial practices of film in order to better understand the design of digital interactive media. The criteria used in the design and selection of the film image are discussed and a novel view of film as a pragmatic and highly economical form of picture making is proposed. The difficulties are highlighted of simply transferring such imagery to an interactive context, but it is argued that the same guiding principles can be applied in the newer medium. It is suggested that the demands of visual interaction are leading to the development of new pictorial modes, but that much work remains to be done. In particular it is proposed that the mature expressivity of traditional film is a goal to which designers of pictorial interactive media should aspire.",

    "abstract": "Is digital self-portraiture a new form? This essay suggests that it is, and introduces the term ‘cybiog’ to differentiate it from both autobiography and self-portraiture. Cybiog is understood, not as the description of an original self or its chrono-teleology, but rather as the generation of mutating subjectivity/ies. This change in subjectivity, or identity-effect, is linked to the female through a brief historical look at the self-portrait, and through an analogy with fetishism. The medium and the subject/subjectivity are mutually constitutive; neither is in control. The traces of the embodied, sexed self are not absent, however, and the question of how this subsists in cyberspace is explored through the idea of ‘sexed digitalia’.",

    "title": "A certain breakthrough",
    "abstract": "From the call for papers on ‘speculative hardware’ we have selected two long articles that might begin to articulate a philosophy of the speculative for hardware and design. As part of the research I also conducted an interview with David Cuartielles (part of the founding collective initiating the Arduino platform) and held an interview and workshop with the artist Martin Howse, these will be published online as a companion to this special section of Digital Creativity. In the two selected articles, relations between matter and media (information, the digital, analogue electronics, physical computing and infrastructure) are foregrounded as a significant concern for media theory and in their proximity to new materialisms. We might extend these concerns to what Jussi Parrika names the ‘real but weird materialities’ of media (2012). Cultural concern with such weird materialities was, perhaps, prompted by the materialist methodologies of media theorist Friedrich Kittler. We used Kittler’s essay ‘There is no Software’ (1992) to structure our call for contributions. This essay was referenced explicitly in our call so that from the outset we could make clear the position that electronic media are speculative and grounded in the material (the body, the earth and in conductive substances). It is from this position that this introductory text discusses the essays included in this special section of Digital Creativity and approaches its subject of a speculative hardware. But what is a speculative hardware? In this introduction I want to explore this question by opening up a tension between the materiality and immateriality of speculative hardware by following the inclusion of work by Howse in the first article by Spencer Roberts, ‘Scratching Your Own Itch’ (Roberts 2016) and by taking a lead from the author of the second article, Jamie Brassett, in the speculative moment of thinking about design, through design and as design. When I say ‘following’ I rather mean to use these two leads as points of departure. The vector I want to trace out of these points, by way of introducing some of the themes in the articles included in this issue, begins with Howse’s (2006) translation of Kittler’s essay ‘Pynchon and Electromysticism’. Thomas Pynchon’s metafiction as well as his sense of electromysticism might be said to permeate Kittler’s own ‘speculative’ hardware—his ‘sheer hardware’. Kittler’s sheer hardware, as I feel Whitelaw (2013) correctly intuits it, is an imaginary media ‘no-software’ material computer (Whitelaw 2013). This is what might be called a thought experiment in matter, one that serves to reveal Parrika’s real but weird media. In this combination of the weird with media, there is an encounter with the strangeness of media materialities, ephemeral energetic fields and temporalities that ‘simply make you feel strange’; and a precipitous sheerness, like standing on the edge of chaos—perhaps this is the sense of the speculative that is implied in Roberts’ reference to coercive powers of the technical object and enabled in Brassett’s opening up of the speculative machine to the thought of Isabelle Stengers—the notion that there might be a new ‘normal’, that what is considered ‘normal’ now, in fact, is simply the chronoclastic and morphological material of speculative becomings—we will have further recourse to this before concluding, suffice to list for now: the powers of a shimmering and energetic field, a glamour; the Digital Creativity, 2016 Vol. 27, No. 2, 132–142, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2015.1119551",

    "abstract": "This paper advocates the future of the body as a distributed and shared embodiment; an unfolded body that doesn't end at one's skin, but emerges as intercorporeality between bodies and the technological environment. Looking at new tendencies within interaction design and ubiquitous computing to see how these are to an increasing extent focusing on sociality, context-awareness, relations, affects, connectedness and collectivity, we will examine how these new technological movements can change our perception of embodiment towards a distributed and shared one. By examining interactive textiles as part of a future rising landscape of multi-sensory networks, we will exemplify how the new technologies can shutter dichotomies and challenge traditional notions of embodiment and the subject. Finally, we show how this ‘new embodiment’ manifests Deleuze's philosophy of the body as something unstable and changing, and how his refolding of the body can be useful for future interaction designers to understand the context in which they work and the challenges they will meet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract ‘Beyond their instrumental functions', writes Rivka Oxman in an article about design, creativity and innovation (2013), ‘advanced digital and computational environments are also becoming tools for thinking design’. At the leading edge of creativity and innovation design does not only speculate the plausible, possible or potential, but pragmatically inserts such futures into the present (as Whitehead says any ‘immediate existence’ (1962) must). Using concepts mainly from Deleuze, Guattari, Spinoza and Simondon, I will position such design speculation as pragmatic, divergent, complex and emergent. That is, as manifesting the technical mentalities (Simondon) that provide the milieu in which we can show what we ‘might be capable of’ (Stengers).",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses the original artistic intentions behind the immersive virtual environment OSMOSE (1995). The strategies employed to manifest them include the use of an embodying user interface of breath and balance and a visual aesthetic based on transparency and spatial ambiguity. The paper examines the medium of immersive virtual space as a spatio‐temporal arena in which mental constructs of the world can be given three‐dimensional form and be kinaesthetically explored through full‐body immersion and interaction. Throughout, comparisons are made between OSMOSE and conventional design approaches to virtual reality. The tendency of such approaches to reinforce the West's historic devaluation of nature and the body is also discussed. It is suggested that this medium can potentially be used to counteract such tendencies. In the case of OSMOSE, an experiential context is constructed in which culturally learned perceptual/conceptual boundaries are osmotically dissolved, causing conventional assu...",

    "abstract": "In October 2002 I was selected by ACM SIGGRAPH to the voluntary position of SIGGRAPH’04 Art Gallery Chai—the fi rst European to hold this position. The annual SIGGRAPH Art Gallery has achieved worldwide recognition for excellence in showing digital and electronic art. The SIGGRAPH’04 Art Gallery exhibition was held during the 31st Annual International SIGGRAPH Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques August 8–12th 2004 at The Los Angeles Convention, USA. My goal and vision for the Art Gallery 2004 was to show all aspects of digital art in its broadest terms; from 2D/3D, screenbased work, installations, sound pieces and animations; from touch-screen technology, to simple interactive auditory pieces. This opportunity to demonstrate a rich diversity of digital art practices in one place is what makes the SIGGRAPH Art Gallery so unique. I called the exhibition Synaesthesia—digital art that stimulates the senses. Viewers would be encouraged to see, hear, and touch the art. A record number of 950 pieces were fi nally submitted to the Art Gallery in February’04 (all submitted totally online). They were divided into three categories: 2D/3D work, screen-based and papers. There were separate jury members for each of these categories. The jurors were selected from eminent international digital practitioners and included Roy Ascot (The Planetary Collegium), Paul Brown, (Fine Art Forum) Gerfried Stocker (Ars Electronica), George Fiefi eld (Boston Cyberarts Festival). Accepted pieces included: 91 2D/ SIGGRAPH 2004 Art Gallery: Synaesthesia",

    "abstract": "In this paper it is argued that the dominant approach to designing multimedia communication environments, which focuses on trying to establish what group doing what kind of task in which situation will benefit from what sorts of communication media, is unproductive. Instead it is argued that design methods are needed that enable us to deal with particular situations, i.e., that enable particular users in a particular context get the best out of the resources at their disposal. After presenting a framework for understanding user selection of communication resources, a method that yields design/redesign recommendations through interpretation of the reasons for the user’s selection of a particular communication medium for a particular purpose from among competitive communication media, is described. It is shown how such analysis results in hypothesised communication needs that serve as a basis for design/ redesign recommendations. Finally, it is argued that the hypothesised communication needs derived from particular situations should become the focus of hypothesis testing research.",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines general theoretical implications of enactive cinema for the broader framing of enactive media. The concept of enactive cinema has constituted a proposal for a novel kind of emotion-driven cinema genre, which emphasises unconscious interaction between the cinema spectator and the cinema. Instead of the spectator directly manipulating the narrative, the unfolding of the story is affected by the spectator's emotional participation. The concept of enactive media refers to a systemic approach that may be applied to even other forms of narrative media besides cinema. It suggests going beyond the conventional and implicitly dualist concept of human–computer interaction and proposes a more holistic participation within a media system. The concept of second-order spectatorship, analogous, to that of the second-order authorship will be described.",

Rather than a technical account or retrospective, the aim is to demonstrate by example how research itself is a primary process, illustrated by work carried out at the Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT) during the last few years. When creative output is appraised only from its visible results, something is lost in the telling; carefully selected public facets rarely convey the depths of the underlying lines of inquiry. The research covered is for a work that generates quantitative data, driving visualisations of human movement, proximity and orientation. The aim is to reveal how these literal data reflect our relationships to one another in social settings. To contextualise the current process, complex systems, dynamic pattern formation and other works are also mentioned. As a personal account, it seemed appropriate to supplement the usual academic passive voice with first-person narrative.",

    "title": "Growing-up with games",
    "abstract": "Growing up in the 90s in London offered a whirlwind of opportunity. Dressing as Tank Girl, exploring Mozilla and programming CDROMs and multimedia kiosks in Piccadilly filled my days. I simply did not see any barriers in my way, well not ones based on my gender any way. But then as a white woman in the West I am privileged, both in time and in place. It was not until later when motherhood came that I began to see how gender stereotypes are adopted. It was in my choices around childcare that I gave ground whilst realising my ongoing duty to my daughter to be happy and strong. For me, it was this wonderful event that made me consider the history and heritage of the feminine, to think about what women before me had done to ensure my privilege. Motherhood made me consider my responsibility to contribute, in whatever modest way, to the ongoing freedom of choice for future generations. Although part of my personal aging process, these type of life-changing circumstances affect us all at various stages and point to the changing nature of our relationship with society over the life course. Each generation binds to their particular cultural setting, ours is the rise of the digital. Digital gaming has rapidly evolved in the past thirty years to take its place alongside other more linear media as a culturally powerful and commercially successful entertainment form. The status of gaming as a 21st century uber-form can be traced to its explicit inclusion of players as active participants. A primary pleasure of gaming is located in the sensate act of play over any particular audio-visual aesthetic. Gameplay builds a co-creative space in which a player engages with a game world in order to pleasurably progress through digital experience. Digital game form consists an exemplar intersection between the creative arts and digital technologies. Although widely claimed as ‘mere’ entertainment, games provide a framework for active learning, social commentary and artistic expression. Cultural studies show us that the act of play is central to human development and is part of any creative endeavour. The rise of digital gaming holds potential to acknowledge the centrality of play in our ongoing evolution. There is cultural capital to be had in prioritizing play over any tendency to infantilise it contra work in the production of value.",

Arguing that the chess problem is a manipulation of game form guided by human aesthetic principles (e.g. Schiller's ‘beauty’ and Wimsatt's ‘human condition’), the article draws a parallel between art derived from games and art derived from nature. This parallel has important implications in circumstances where a natural world is replaced by a virtual world and nature is, in some sense, ‘lost’ to the artist. The article argues that, in such circumstances, the interactive and ‘concreative’ nature of digital media – particularly digital games – allows for unabated aesthetic production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we outline an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to problem solving that can be characterised as performative as both the goals and solutions develop over time through an open-ended process of trial-and-error. We describe two projects where this methodology has been successfully applied. We first give an overview of the CELL project where the performative approach led to a significant change in the way that scientist Neil Theise investigated stem cells. The success of this project directly led to the work which is the main focus of this paper: the design of Net Work, an interactive artwork that consists of a grid of autonomous buoys that emit different coloured light in response to the environment and the state of neighbouring buoys. We describe our performative approach to building the Net Work prototype and outline in detail its control system which is based on Ashby's homeostat model. The paper concludes with a short discussion of some of the benefits and pitfalls of an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to problem solving.",

    "abstract": "This article critically examines the mapmaking practices of locative art and explores its potential to produce alternative maps that respond to the spatial and social multiplicity of our urban fabric. Starting from a critique of traditional cartographic practice and how locative art shares its Cartesian anchorage and technological lenses, we investigate the conceptual challenges, methodological issues and technological constraints related to entangling geographic locations and social dynamics. We introduce our locative artworks Urban Fiction (2007) and Urban Fiction 2.0 (2011) that engage participants in corporeal negotiations of urban spaces to generate dynamic, fictional maps. Reflecting on these works allows us to examine the potential of locative media against a backdrop of technological advances and co-evolving social practices. Situated within post-colonial and feminist perspectives, we develop the notion of a ‘performative geography’ based on a generative mapping approach that understands maps as a dynamic process, rather than a fixed representation.",

    "abstract": "Interaction design research is a unique discipline embracing practicing professionals, design educators and academic researchers, but attracting attention from people with different backgrounds and interests has lead to the question of what constitutes ‘good research’. What is rigorous and relevant interaction design research and how do we recognise and evaluate it? Most current attempts at dealing with these issues tend to be on loan from other disciplines, and may overlook, conceal, or knowingly exclude some of what makes interaction design research such a unique field. Our primary contribution is that what may be perceived as three different design research activities—design practice, design exploration and design studies—have their own purposes, intended outcomes, and internal logic. Each approach must be examined in its own right and the notions of rigour and relevance have to be based on a firm understanding of the particular purpose of each approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new pervasive digital game is discussed, relating technical and conceptual innovation. A combination of sensor technologies enables a responsive visual and auditory environment to be overlaid on the real world. This allows processes within the player's body to be mapped to the environment through which the player passes, externalising the internal. Rather than using technology to replicate the rigid goals and structures of many conventional games, this game explores the concept of ‘open play’, a form of personal exploration. The work is an interdisciplinary collaboration between digital artists and health scientists with an agenda to alter players’attitudes to the body and health as well as to break new ground artistically.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Projection mapping is a group of techniques for projecting imagery onto physical three-dimensional objects in order to augment the object or space with digital content. Most projection mapping experiences and events are non-interactive, partly because of the many inherent design problems in designing for interaction is such situations. This article explores one approach to this tricky issue by analysing a group of four interactive mixed reality experiences that combine projection mapping with camera-based interaction techniques. The approaches used are described, and their deployment in a variety of situations is analysed using engagement and play theories. The works suggest that some projection mapping techniques can be used in the service of creating engaging interactive exhibits and installations, but that the effectiveness of the approach relies on it placing the experience and interactions clearly in our own physical world, rather than behind a screen or in an artificial image space.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Following Massimo Banzi's comment that the Arduino development board might be seen as a means of ‘scratching your own itch’, this paper explores the concept of affect in relation to physical computing, and investigates the ways in which cybernetic and networked objects could be said to enact a series of process-philosophical and object-oriented tensions. In so doing it addresses the cultural saturation of Arduino and its employment in an array of institutional, artistic and activist contexts, and brings this to bear on the conflict between the process philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and the more directly object-oriented perspectives of Graham Harman, Ian Bogost and Bruno Latour. Framing the enquiry around the at once ethico-aesthetic and speculative realist questions of what it is to ‘scratch' and what it is to ‘itch', the paper examines micro- and macro-political agency in the context of physical computing—contrasting process philosophy's pronounced notion of affective, connective, creative differentiation with the black-boxed, withdrawn objects of object-oriented philosophy, and its quasi-causal mode of aesthetic interaction.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines the field of Kinaesthetic Empathy and how it is studied in dance and film then interrogates whether this framework can be applied to the videogame avatar. I study the avatar as textually signifying, as an observed body, and as a prosthetic tool-limb using the works of Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger as theoretical support and Ian Bogost’s procedural style of videogame reading. I perform close readings of videogame-texts Metal Gear Solid 3 and Mirror’s Edge demonstrating how the former enacts a traditional kinaesthetic empathy in the same way as in dance or film and the latter complicates this observer/performer relation. My paper concludes that, though a player/reader may experience a kinaesthetic empathy that resembles the filmic mode of observer/performer kinaesthetic empathy, the videogame form engenders a deeper tool-based empathy, which is altogether different from traditional conceptions of kinaesthetic empathy.",

Fictions can entertain as much as cause social friction. This article discusses three sources of design fictions: a global information technology company; an art school in the UK; and a design institute in Brazil. By contrasting the three cases in light of the philosophical work of Álvaro Vieira Pinto, this article deconstructs the ideology of the future—futurology—and proposes acting in the present—handiness—to sketch an ideology of liberation. Instead of supporting the status quo, such ideology could inspire collective action for change. The practices from the three aforementioned sources are discussed to lay the foundations for such ideology of liberation in design fictions.",

Literacy is about the use of particular tools to satisfy well-defined tasks while fluency is a deeper form of knowledge that allows people to adapt to the uncertainties of computing and keep up with new, technological trends. Computational flexibility suggests the further capacity toinvent software when existing applications fail to solve new problems. I will suggest a need for designers to become computationally flexible to achieve goals that often begin as ideas that are difficult, if not impossible, to articulate and hand off to expert software engineers for further development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The literatures that touch on synaesthesias-scientific, art-historical, literary, phenomenological, ethnographic, psychodelic-vary widely in their definitions, their interpretations, and their degree of comfort with the first-person, subjective nature of experiential reports. The significances given to synaesthetic experiences are similarly wide-ranging. This paper explores the relationships among synaesthesias, psychedelic experience, and language, highlighting Terence McKenna's synaesthetic language experiences on DMT and magic mushrooms. We describe the complexities of creating and performing with the Synestheater, a system that provides the means to weave together, in multiple mappings, two or more complex visual, aural, and linguistic systems in live performance.",

    "title": "Infrastructures of abstraction: how computer science education produces anti-political subjects",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Abstraction, defined in Computer Science (CS) as bracketing unnecessary information from diverse components within a system, serves as a central epistemological axis in CS disciplinary and pedagogical practices. Its impressions can be seen across curricula, syllabi, classroom structures, IT systems; and other dimensions of the epistemic infrastructure of CS (Malazita [Forthcoming]. “Epistemic Infrastructures, the Instrumental Turn, and the Digital Humanities.” In Debates in the Digital Humanities: Infrastructures, Institutions at the Interstices, edited by Angel Nieves, Siobhan Senier, and Anne McGrail. University of Minnesota Press). As we will argue in this essay, abstraction in CS serves as an epistemic, cultural, and ideological wall to integrated critical-technical education, rather than as a bridge. Further, this wall is disguised as a bridge: the common language used across CS and the Humanities gives the impression that abstraction can be leveraged as a boundary object (Star [2010]. “This is Not a Boundary Object: Reflections on the Origin of a Concept.” Science, Technology, & Human Values 35 (5): 601–617), as a point of connection among conflicting or incommensurable epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina [1999]. Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge. Cambridge: MIT Press). Rather, computational knowledge practices leverage abstraction’s homographic-ness, epistemically structuring collaborative efforts in anti-political ways. To illustrate the impacts of abstraction, this essay will introduce ‘Critical CS1,’ a hybrid pedagogical approach to teaching Computer Science through feminist and critical race theory. However, other components of the epistemic infrastructures of Computer Science, from curricular structure, to IT systems, to classroom culture, to the epistemic practices of coding itself, resisted these intervention efforts, and reproduced marginalizing effects upon students within the course.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a ‘professional’ digital gaming industry has emerged in North America: this interconnected series of organisations and leagues host competitive gaming tournaments (often televised) in which young, mostly male participants compete for increasingly lucrative prize money and sponsorship contracts. Taking up Jo Bryce and Jason Rutter's (2005) challenge to confront the ways girl gamers are rendered ‘invisible’ by gamers, researchers and designers, this paper maps the various ways women participate in a set of practices around the organisation, promotion and performance of competitive gaming, framed as the exclusive domain of (young, straight, middle class) male bodies. Mothers flying their sons' teams to events all over North America, female players participating in tournaments or promotional models operating sponsorship booths, the women who participate in competitive gaming tournaments negotiate different expectations and carry out different kinds of embodied work. Each of these ‘roles’, however, is tenuously maintained within a community that most commonly reads female participation in sexualised terms: mothers at events describe themselves as ‘cheerleaders’, female players risk being labelled as ‘halo hoes’ and promotional models become ‘booth babes’.",

    "abstract": "Theory books and method books within the field of web design mainly focus on the technical and functional aspects of the construction of web design. There is a lack of a model which weighs the analysis of the visual and aesthetic aspects against the functional and technical aspects of web design. With a point of departure in Roman Jakobson's verbal communication model, the reader is introduced to a model which covers the communication aspects, the visual aspects, the aesthetic aspects and the net specific aspects of the analysis of media products. The aesthetic aspects rank low in the eyes of the media producers even though the most outstanding media products often obtained their success due to aesthetic phenomena. The formal aesthetic function and the inexpressible aesthetic function have therefore been prioritised in the model in regard to the construction and analysis of media products, including web design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a study into music analysis, motion analysis and the integration of music and motion to form creative natural human motion in a virtual environment. Motion capture data is extracted to generate a motion library, this places the digital motion model at a fixed posture. The first step in this process is to configure the motion path curve for the database and calculate the possibility that two motions were sequential through the use of a computational algorithm. Every motion is then analysed for the next possible smooth movement to connect to, and at the same time, an interpolation method is used to create the transitions between motions to enable the digital motion models to move fluently. Lastly, a searching algorithm sifts for possible successive motions from the motion path curve according to the music tempo. It was concluded that the higher ratio of rescaling a transition, the lower the degree of natural motion.",

    "abstract": "Myth is an increasingly popular matrix for game-fiction experience. In her latest console adventure, Underworld (2008), long-running character Lara Croft, ‘Tomb Raider’, has to acquire Thor's Hammer to enter a neo-Viking mythworld, to find the mother who disappeared when she was a toddler. However, despite the female-centred journey, the environment and form of her quest are arguably conceptually ‘masculine’. This article contrasts with it the interactive ‘serious’ game of chance, RuneCast, which brought together four female artists/performers who interpret the Viking mythworld through explorable 3-D art combined with video and authentic stories and songs, originally articulated (in the early middle ages) in a female voice. The material is contextualised within issues of screen language, gendered space, 3-D environment/interaction design and storytelling. Must play in 3-D worlds be based on orienteering, control, dominance and destruction? Or is it fun to chance losing—and finding—yourself in a different game?",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study focuses on the decisive role played by the digital design environment in the cognitive design process and design thinking. To analyse the cognitive role of digital design tools, we carried out a protocol analysis of conventional design sketching and a 3D sculpture tool. Cognitive evaluation was a differentiating factor when considering the contextual role of the 3D sculpture tool in subsequent evaluations, non-sequential evaluations for conversion, and passive approaches within the design process. Cognitive evaluation played the following roles: validation, extension, navigation, exploration, and confirmation. The navigation, exploration, and extension roles played by non-sequential evaluation were mainly related to inductive design thinking. Finally, the types of cognitive evaluation and their roles when using the 3D sculpture tool were different, according to the design thinking type. This study explored the multidimensional roles of cognitive evaluation using a 3D sculpture tool and its relationship with design thinking types.",

    "title": "Thumbnail images: uncertainties, infrastructures and search engines",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article argues that thumbnail images are infrastructural images that raise issues of uncertainty in two distinct, but interrelated, areas: a legal question of how to define, understand and govern visual information infrastructures, in particular image search systems in epistemological and strategic terms; and a cultural question of how human–computer interaction design works with navigational uncertainty, both as an experience to be managed and a resource to be exploited. This paper considers two copyright infringement cases that involved search engines as defendants, Kelly v. Arriba Soft (2003) and Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. and A9.com Inc. and Google Inc (2007). The cases are revealing of the issues that arise when thinking about thumbnails as infrastructural images in relation to uncertainty. Legal research on thumbnail images has focused on fitting them into the framework of copyright—which precedes digital technology. This article revolves around the infrastructuration of thumbnail images in a medial sense: as infrastructures of logistics and desire. The article draws on infrastructure studies, feminist visual and human computer interaction (HCI) theory and legal theory to examine how the thumbnail has been negotiated in legal terms, its cultural infrastructures, and the information behaviours they are designed to produce.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Augmented Reality (AR) technology has provided a new technological platform for ‘mirror worlds’, where layers of information, meaning, and functions are integrated with a digital twin of the real world. To explore mirror worlds, we designed and developed +Andscape, an interactive AR sandbox. In this conceptual and empirical case study, we observed children’s (5–6-year-old, N = 16) collaborative play and storytelling with +Andscape. The qualitative content analysis from observational video-based data allows us to infer how children’s play with the AR sandbox engaged their questioning and reflections of both the real world events and the computational mirror worlds. The use of the tool triggered children’s imagination and opened for them a story world for exploration of current media events in a unique way. We conclude that when introducing mirror worlds, the focus should be on creative play, participation and storytelling through which the children can construct their own story worlds.",

The presented curatorial approach draws on the exhibition entitled Past-forward: Stavros Economou Unarchived (2021) to reflect on the development of a multimedia-enabled reading of the architectural archive. Stavros Economou is one of the most important representatives of modern architecture in Cyprus, yet his work is underdiscussed and under-published. The architectural archive, unlike other collections, consists of representations (such as drawings, models, photographs) of artefacts (buildings) that communicate design processes and final un/built proposals. The curatorial practice focused on a twofold challenge: on one hand, it explored the role architectural representation can play in the production of the multiple and complex (hi)stories of modern buildings, and secondly, it considered ways in which an architecture exhibition can connect with the host city and its local population by addressing contemporary urgencies of spatial inquiry.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This essay presents a transdisciplinary project whose objective is to create a sensorised insole built with latex (Hevea brasiliensis) to measure physiological variations of the human body, as well as to graphically represent affective reciprocal exchanges of the human behaviour with the environment. The purpose is to improve our enactive system through the use of various physiological sensors (e.g. pressure, galvanic skin response and temperature sensors), which can be processed and visualised by revealing the affective exchanges of the body while walking in the city, pinned on a map as data visualisation. Inspired by the enaction theories, the output of sensors and devices application that models the perception as a laboratory phenomenon, as proposed by Dr Ted Krueger, the investigation directed by Dr Domingues is conceived for the expanded sensorium and for the reengineering of life. The artwork is inserted in the domain of aesthetic investigation of art as experiences related to topics on art and technoscience for innovation in health. The created prototype was tested in the city at different locations and the results demonstrated its use as a kind of personal assistant for vital signals by configuring an enactive system added of affective qualities which possibilities to reveal the ‘pathos’, or the affective narratives experienced in the emergent reciprocity with the city. The insole biomaterial, created by Dr Suelia Rodrigues (BioEngeLab), has been successfully used to measure the foot pressure and to serve as a health assistant, especially for people with diabetes. The signal-processing approaches, explored in Biomedical engineering by Dr Cristiano Miosso, were empowered by data visualisation approaches developed by Dr Ricardo Torres (University of Campinas). Finally, we consider this prototype a creative technology for mhealth, which is a disruptive innovation, by providing other forms of existence.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT With recent breakthroughs in VR devices, new potential of CAD as a design tool is anticipated. Based on the influence of design tools in ideation, we compared the problem-solving styles of WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) and VRE (Virtual Reality Environment) for an apartment flat design task. Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology analysis revealed that WIMP was problem-driven with clear divisions between problem analysis and solution building, while VRE was predominantly solution-driven with frequent modifications of solutions. Such procedural characteristics led to uneven outcomes wherein spatial efficiency was better in WIMP while arrangement was more diversified in VRE. When the key factor was high manipulability of user interface in VRE, the result suggests that higher usability does not always produce desired outcomes. Time for problem analysis and a match between the tool and given problem must be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Smartphone applications have become an essential tool for museums because of their positive impact on visitor experience. However, smartphones can potentially distract visitors from the exhibit, crippling the hands-on experience. In this study, we present SurfaceLens which is a smartphone-based peripheral device enabling near-surface spatial interaction with exhibits. SurfaceLens detects proximity, location on the surface, and orientation of the device while a visitor moves it along the surface of exhibits like using a magnifying glass. It provides an information space and audio-haptic feedback reflecting its location and orientation so that the visitor can feel like seeing-through the exhibit. We compared this near-surface spatial interaction with on-screen touch interaction to investigate their effect on visitor experience and behaviour. The results indicate that SurfaceLens provided a more intuitive and transparent understanding of the content when used as an observation tool. Moreover, narrowing down the distance between visitors and exhibits promotes exploratory behaviours.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study focuses on the use of everyday objects as new media for enriching digital storytelling experiences, especially as they pertain to viewing television narratives in living room environments. Through a design ideation workshop, we develop a strategy for augmenting television narratives using interactive home appliances. The ideas obtained through the workshop revealed that interactive home appliances connected to television systems can serve as both input and output channels capable of delivering narrative elements as additional output and can support active viewer engagement in narrative manipulation. Another strategy involved mirroring the environments of television narratives with the physical world to enable spatial immersion into such narratives. Based on the strategies, we discuss the criteria valued by the designers when it comes to designating interactions between home appliances and television narratives and the critical aspects that should be considered in further configurations and applications of such strategies.",

Moreover, we propose a framework for enhancing creativity in virtual brainstorming (VB) based on the 4Ps (person, process, product, and press) of creativity, which provides guidance on leveraging VB to enhance creativity. Furthermore, eight affordances of VB are identified to enhance creativity: anonymity, appraisal, avatars, immersion, multiple communication, recording, simulated objects, and tracing. The potential perspectives of VB to enhance creativity based on this study’s framework are also explored, which deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, we present the concept of sonic boundary objects by discussing the case of binaural sound recordings as a tool, which helps to negotiate between blind and sighted experiences of an urban soundscape. We begin with developing the theoretical underpinning of the concept of a sonic boundary object by briefly elaborating on the relevance of the concept of the boundary object in the context of disability and technology; we then explain the special properties of binaural recordings and revisit the musicological concept of the sound object, whose relationship with technology partly inspired the work in this article. After introducing these concepts and related practices we proceed by proposing the term of a sonic boundary object. We discuss the relationship of the sonic boundary object with the concept of simulation in the context of disability studies and we then elaborate on its potential impact as a complementary practice to blind ethnography and to participatory design approaches. We will demonstrate its ethnographic potential with an account of the authors’ experience using binaural recordings to exchange on what blind navigation is like in Montreal. The article concludes with a first-person reflection on this experience and possible fields of application.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Real-Time’ is one of the most frequent concepts used referring to digital media. Despite it is commonly related to immediate feedback, it is not clear when it happens and what its characteristics are, especially in current digital interfaces. Although real-time has been written about very extensively in the context of Human Computer Interaction and Computational Systems, there are few studies evaluating the key features of real-time interaction in other domains. This article attempts to address this situation by proposing a new approach to the concept of real-time interaction driving the analysis of this topic into paradigmatic cases studies in new media, video games and digital artworks. This new analysis reveals several specific facets that allow us to identify new factors in the understanding of this fuzzy concept. Finally, the article proposes a new definition of ‘real-time interaction’ based on the findings in the context of new media practices.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to describe, analyse and categorize the literature on technoscience art in general and technoscience art collaborations in particular. I argue that the literature could be characterized by three thematic traditions: pioneer stories, writing aiming at mapping and categorizing, as well as those problematizing and contextualizing the field. Given that earlier research on technoscience art collaborations primarily consists of art historical and anthropological and ethnographic studies, I further discuss the relation between these approaches and intend to provide a connection between them. Whereas art historical studies are more concerned with issues concerning art history as a discipline, ethnographic studies tend to be more concerned with challenges faced by interdisciplinarity. Finally, I discuss the role of artistic research and art practice in future studies on the topic and emphasize the diversity of the literature on technoscience art, as well as the understanding of technoscience art collaborations as an interdisciplinary effort.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The availability of robust and cheaper hardware tools in recent years has allowed the possibility of effectively integrating spatial sound as an organic component of dance and music performance projects. Inspired by these recent developments, an original body-worn sound system was designed, implemented and acoustically optimized aiming to effectively integrate performers’ movements and amplified sounds on stage. An innovative acoustic measurement method was used in connection with tests and interviews with practitioners to assess various sonic and artistic features of the implemented sound vest prototype. Audience questionnaires were employed to assess the perceived acoustic performance of the system in a medium size dance studio. Survey results showed that the perceived acoustic performance of the sound vest is highly dependent on the types of sound materials radiated by the system, as well as on the position of the performer in a room. Future work will consider the implementation and assessment of an extended hybrid spatial system consisting of several mobile sound sources synchronized with a fixed multi-channel sound reproduction system.",

Grounded in behavioural models from social psychology and embodied cognition theories, this article proposes a framework guiding the generation of animated parables wherein causality between a behaviour and its virtual outcomes is easy to understand. The guidelines include metaphorical mapping and blending the behaviour with a direct cause-effect scenario with similarities in embodied experiences. Application of the guidelines in a series of design workshops generates 47 parables. To evaluate the parables, metrics include naturalness of integrating with life routines, aesthetics of blending into environments, and ease of interpreting the causality. Evaluation results show that more embodied mapping and blending are more likely to result in understandable behaviour-outcome links. Designers can follow the guidelines and metrics to generate and compare ideas. Lastly, recommendations for crafting more embodied parables are provided.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes how a group of practitioners and researchers are working across disciplines at Nottingham Trent University in the area of Technical Textiles. It introduces strands of ongoing enquiry centred around the development and application of stretch sensors on the body, focusing on how textile and fashion knowledge are being reflexively revealed in the collaborative development of seamful wearable concepts, and on the tensions between design philosophies as revealed by definitions of purpose. We discuss the current research direction of the Aeolia project, which seeks to exploit the literal gaps found in pattern cutting for fitted stretch garments towards experiential forms and potential interactions. Normative goals of fitness for purpose and seamlessness are interrogated and the potential for more integrated design processes, which may at first appear ‘upside down’, is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Reputation systems are an important part of online production communities, for they provide both users and machine with proper metrics to assess the truthfulness and reliability of users, and their generated content. In multi-tier communities, in which users can be promoted to higher ranks, reputation systems are given a new role, which is helping the community to have a more meritocratic promotion process. This paper provides a design framework for reputation systems and promotion processes in the context of multi-tier production communities (MPCs). An apt promotion process based on a well-designed reputation system can be deemed as a valid practice to motivate users, enhance their level of trust and satisfaction, and increase the quantity and quality of contributions. We address different aspects and design elements of reputation systems and their association with and their impact on user participation in production communities, particularly those with a multi-tier structure.",

By attaching new physical inputs to things we perceive as truly virtual, we add a socio-critical dimension to the interaction of people and machine. This infiltration helps to augment our understanding of data pathways, explore virtual handicaps, regain control of how we access information, manifest metaphors as real entities, and integrate the Internet into already familiar interfaces. Combining form with function, these projects illustrate how simple interaction can lead to complex outcomes.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Digital games propagate mythical stories and revitalize medieval legends. Amplification of gothic elements in contemporary media and in digital games reflects an ideological and aesthetic transformation of cultural products in contemporary society. This essay discusses distinctiveness in game narratives by citing diverse theories, including semiotics and theories of psychoanalysis, as well as mythology and theology. Game narratives tend to deconstruct the conventional timeframes of chronological order seen in the narratives of traditional literature. Contrary to the formulaic structure of mythology described by Joseph Campbell, digital games introduce a new dimension of time in narratives akin to biblical apocalypse. Digital games deploy synchronic time, exclusively in the form of the present tense, which Tillich identifies as relating to kairos contingent on Heidegger’s notion of time. At their forefront, digital games visualize elements of literary stories as a result of deploying synchronic time in reimagined narratives. While digital games attract users via this new concept of transformative time and their visual embellishment of mysticism, innovative narratives in digital games function as a new means of ideology, resonating with the social psychology of users under the challenges of the contemporary world.",

In Part 1 the work is described and its narrative premises outlined. There follows a brief description of the production process and the reception of the work. Part 2 of the paper concerns what was learned about interactive narrative, including ideas about how space and time should be organised in an interactive work, the effect of such ideas on the plot, characters and genre of the series, and the role of the user. From the viewpoint of dramatic structure, the most important element in an interactive work is the space (or world) which is presented to the viewer. The importance of context in works of VR narrative is discussed. An analysis of the reasons why only some of the reality allusions worked in Daisy is presented. Finally, the themes around which the series was built are described. There is a discussion of whether a non‐linear inte...",

We report on our work based on obtaining inspiration from the world of theatre. In this perspective Commedia dell'Arte and Noh theatre have been the focus of our attention. We explore key features of Commedia dell'Arte, namely improvisation, exaggerated gestures and expressive postures, and investigate how their adoption in the design of avatars can be useful for collaborative virtual environments. With the same objectives we look at another theatre style, the Noh theatre. We investigate the variety of masks and the choreography. The outcome is a visual language for avatars made up of postures, gestures and appearances. We have concluded this investigation with the production of an experimental theatre play involving real and virtual actors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The space of technology design is being shaped by a drive for creating more authentic, rich experiences, taking into account the complex meaning-making activities we engage in every day. One approach toward enhancing technology design for experience is to identify aspects missing from existing computer models, such as emotion, creativity, spirituality, and add these missing components to the equation. Another approach attempts not to fit complex experiences into computer models but looks at alternate uses of technology for drawing attention to the complexity of meaning-making experiences. This second approach is introduced through the work of the Affective Presence consortium and advances the idea of design as a process of co-construction between users, systems, and designers. One project from the consortium is examined in detail: affective presence displays in museums for creative expression. We present results from initial prototype testing and findings for advancing the design and evaluation of affective presence displays.",

    "title": "Present-ing the user: constructing the persona",
    "abstract": "Abstract During the last few years personas has become an established design technique within the IT-design field. Using personas has proven itself as a valuable approach for designers to switch between a developer's perspective and a user's perspectivein the design process. The technique is claimed to help designers in keeping a clear focus and shaping a consistent user-interface by making ‘the user’ present in the design work. In this paper we report on a number of projects where we have elaborated on the persona approach for collaborative design. With the goalof creating ‘user presence’ in the design process, we have developed an approach building on a combination of ethnographic exploration, participatory inquiry, and collaborative design. This paper carries two interrelated points: the grounding of personasin existing practice; and the notion that ‘the user’ is created as an ongoing process throughout the design work.",

    "abstract": "Visualising research illustrates practice-based approaches to research for higher degrees in Art and Design. In its structured approach, clear language and style it addresses the new postgraduate student, guiding them in their development and delivery of a research project at either masters or doctoral level. This is a book that also targets educators and could form part of taught programme in research methods, drawing heavily on the reflective practitioner approaches from Schön and Kolb as well as the authors experience in largely craft-based domains. The book is dependent on the use of metaphor—being structured around notions of research as a ‘journey of exploration’ translating as chapters on ‘planning the journey’, ‘mapping the terrain’, ‘locating your position’, ‘crossing the terrain’, ‘interpreting the map’ and ‘recounting the journey’. The use of this colourful, metaphoric language— and this book is full of it, may be a useful pedagogic tool but by linking research to notions of the journey in this way the book perhaps denies some of the complexity and richness of approaches to researchers ‘wanderings’ (at the risk of extending the metaphor a step further) that might be more open, even meandering, fluid, unstructured or otherwise non-linear—the notion of the strictly sequential journey is problematic here. Although a pluralistic approach is advocated, critical thinking in this book equates it seems to creativity techniques, to brainstorms and mindmaps; to Buzan’s arboreal thinking: the arborescant rather than the rhizomatic. The more performative methodologies at work in the practice-based work of the practitioners in my experience, drawing on the post-structural, the playful or the game-like as research methodologies, or perhaps from the history of practices stemming from fluxus or the situationists, are largely absent. Readers drawn to this title expecting a critique of visual research methodologies, visual analysis or techniques for visualising complex data, will find something else— despite the authors’ clear interest in the information visualisation work of Edward Tufte there is none of that here. The use of metaphoric visualisation appears to have been the focus and what accompanying visuals are included, although useful, are sometimes disappointing in terms of their reproduction quality. The book’s website companion is also something of a let-down in this respect: colour PDFs of the books content and little by way of visual or experiential extension. The resource section on the website companion is perhaps the most useful addition, but this could have been more extensive, particularly after the wide ranging references that are included within the book itself. Given the pluralistic stance and actionbased frame of the text, it would have been far more beneficial had the authors provided an expanded links section taking the reader re v ie w s",

    "abstract": "Good public spaces are essential for a sustainable and healthy city as they not only provide a meaningful place for citizens to meet and spend their leisure time, but they also enable and support relationships between people within that place. This article discusses the prospect for location-based social networks to support placemaking, that is, to inspire and enable the use of public space to foster a strong sense of community and feelings of belonging among citizens. This discussion draws on studies of two public parks that serve as important community spaces, one for seniors in Fuxing Park in Shanghai and the other for teenagers in Yoyogi Park in Tokyo. Based on the collected data, we present valuable characteristics to be considered in the design of location-based social networks for placemaking. To support the creation of vivid and vibrant public spaces, we propose design suggestions based on a funfair metaphor.",

Obsession shows how a violent act against an individual also damages people close to this individual and his/her entire life. The case history of an obsessive girl opens up a discussion on sex and violence in film and in society in general. The current study explores participants' experiences in the interactive cinema installation Obsession in terms of comparing the author's goals to the experiences of eight visitors interviewed. The preparation of the study involved a 90-minute interview with the author. The variance between participants' experiences and actions was broad. The interaction method of the installation was often found ambiguous. Some of the participants did not experience interaction at all while others were confused about it. On the other hand, the installation was found interesting by some participants to the degree that they re-visited the installation and wanted to share the experience with friends.",

Six different aspects of work are described, focusing on process rather than finished product. The aspects are: etching with simulated halftones; autographic halftoning; linear 3D colour contouring; texture from dithering; alpha channels for colour lithography; and large-scale screenprints from 3D computer models. Current reliance on two or three commercial graphics programs restricts our view of the nature and limitations of computer-mediated prints. The paper argues, from experience, that the thoughtful and adventurous usage of existing programs can yield new results.",

    "abstract": "ArCade IV is the fourth UK Open International Exhibition of Electronic Prints that I have curated. It provides an opportunity to see a wide range of recent original, limited edition, artists’ prints, which at some stage in their production have involved the use of computers to generate and/or to manipulate their imagery. It includes work by forty one selected and invited digital artist/printmakers from all over the world; artists from six countries, from Australia to Russia and including Slovakia and India. The work in the exhibition covers a vast spectrum of styles and a whole range of new printing technologies. This exhibition was linked to the CADE’03, Computers in Art and Design Education Conference held at the Hull School of Art and Design, the focus of which was ‘(which) end of the line(s)?’ Three days of events focusing on the impact that new technologies have on our working practices and changing role within our institutions. ArCade IV has also been exhibited during 2003–4 at Sheffi eld Hallam University, the Main Gallery, Psalter Lane site, Sheffi eld (15–18 October 2003); The University of Central Lancaster, The Foyer Gallery, Preston, Lancashire (March 1–April 2 2004) and as part of CADE’04 (29 June–1 July 2004) at the Copenhagen Business School, Denmark, and Arts and Communication Malmö, Sweden. The theme of the 2004 Conference was ‘Building Bridges’—to build bridges between different cultures and approaches and to enhance dialogue, interaction and mutual learning. The following pages of Artist Space feature eight international artists who were included in the exhibition. The use of digital imaging makes this an exciting, challenging, and innovative time to be an artist/printmaker. It also encourages a major revaluation of printmaking processes in general; raising the issues of authenticity and ownership and blurring the distinction between ‘original’ and ‘reproduction’. Since I have been curating the ArCade exhibitions, questions such as the longevity and the light-fast properties of the inks have now broadly been resolved, and digital prints are now entering museum collections. In addition, the cost of high-resolution printers has been dramatically reduced, making this form of printing available to students and artists alike. Furthermore, the new generation of printers allow for a wide range of substrates to be used, from hand made paper through to plastics. I hope the Arcade IV exhibition demonstrates how digital fi ne art prints offer the possibility of generating ‘radically new’ physical; aesthetic and conceptual frameworks. ArCade IV",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper focuses on the research project, Projecting Performance, in which off-stage technical operators take on the role of performer through the live manipulation of digital ‘sprites’ in a theatrical environment. The sprites are projected onto gauzes in the stage space and operators control them with graphics tablets and pens to perform with on-stage dancers. Operators have frequently described experiences of dislocation or translocation during the experience of operating and this paper investigates the reasons for such reports. It presents the tripartite models of Zich and Castronova from the fields of theatre studies and human-computer interaction respectively, cross-referencing them to analyse the relationship between performer-operator and sprite. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theories are then employed through the writings of Crowther and Fraleigh to explore the experience of the performer-operator. The paper proposes an understanding of the digital interface in Projecting Performance as embodied and experienced both visually and kinaesthetically by the performer-operator.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper explores whether there are useful connections between rules that characterize comedy genres of cinema and television on the one hand, and software ontology that can be exploited by the design of interactive comedy on the other. In addition to storytelling rhetoric, interactive comedy has to rely on computational rules in order to build narrative from a database of media elements. As an example, the executable rules and metadata that generate narrative according to user input in the interactive television comedy Accidental Lovers are compared to conventional rules of comedy. In conclusion, it seems that at least some rules of the comedy genre resonate with the characteristics that narrative engines based on software and metadata have, and that these similarities should be exploited in the design of interactive comedy.",

This online study was conducted in Taiwan and involved 103 participants, who were given three sets of web browser icons to review, namely Microsoft Internet Explorer, Macintosh Safari and culturally specific icons created using the Culture-Centred Design methodology. The findings of the study show that all three sets have generally high recognition rates in the region of 80%, but that some icon functions (e.g. Go/Visit and Favourite) in all three sets have poor recognition rates in the region of 60% and are considered inappropriate and below the ISO threshold of success.",

Two case studies illustrate aspects of the visualisation of virtual environments: how authenticity in computer reconstructions is reduced to their visuality, and how historically-based VR environments as copies honour their original. The paper asks for more implementation of life forms into architectural settings, and also examines the impact of user expectations on the VR experience.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we elucidate a socio-culturally framed approach to supporting children's creative museum engagement. Specifically, we focus on social activities and socio-cultural resources that can act as boundary-permeating objects in mediating children's creative engagement and collaborative sense-making regarding cultural content within, across and beyond the spatio-material context of the museum. We contend that designing and organising children's creative engagement and collaborative sense-making in ways that cultivate boundary-crossing broadens opportunities for engagement and leverages children's creative potential and expansive learning. We build our argument by starting with a theoretical introduction to the design principles that constitute the Kids, Museums, and Technology Programme. We will illuminate the design principles of the programme with empirical examples and consider how the design principles and their situated construction can help us re-imagine museum exhibitions as hybrid, boundary-permeating spaces that afford novel transformative interactions, as well as new roles and identities for both children and museums.",

    "abstract": "Computer and video games are blurring the boundaries of such categories as play, narrative, space, entertainment and art. Games are, if anything, a form of popular art. They present us with a particular kind of problematic regarding narrative and aesthetics. The article discusses computer and video games in the context of the cultural history of the moving image. The focus is on one type of games in particular. This is the game genre known as 'first-person shooter' (FPS), which became hugely popular with Doom (1994) and has spawned numerous other popular games (e.g. the Quake and the Unreal series). Pre-cinematic devices and techniques, special effects, 'cinema of attraction', and theories of visuality serve as points of reflection. The differences between games and narratives are also discussed. Games are situated between the paths of two aesthetic disciplines: aesthetics of the moving image (film, television, video) and aesthetics of the environment (landscapes, architecture, space). The formulations presented in the article help us to understand the inter-dependent nature of virtual environments and their users. In this way, they light the way towards understanding new media from an aesthetic perspective.",

    "abstract": "At 8.00 am one Thursday in August I was arriving at a conference session – a two and a half hour presentation and workshop on ‘Life drawing and 3D figure modelling with Maya’ which was part of the educators program. By that time the career centre and pathfinders station were already open. About to start were: an educator session (curricular modules), an educator paper/workshop (classical animation), two parallel panel sessions (interactive entertainment and non-linear animation), two parallel paper sessions (measurement and presentation and meshes), and four parallel sketches and application sessions (deformable objects, haptics, narrative gestures and image-based rendering). In an hour’s time the three animation theatres, the art gallery, the creative applications lab and the emerging technologies studio will all open for the day. By 10.00 am 126,400 square feet of trade exhibition will be open again, allowing 303 companies to offer re v ie w another seven hours of state-of-the-art hardware and software demonstration and exploration. Unusually my session was limited to 200 delegates and this proved to be because only (sic) 200 dedicated workstations running Maya were available for our use. It was the start of the fifth day of SIGGRAPH 2001 in Los Angeles. The rest of the day would include four educator forums, two exhibitor forums, one educator workshop, ten panel sessions, five paper sessions, ten sketches and applications sessions, a number of ‘birds of a feather’ meetings and one ‘special’ session. Coaches would later take delegates to the evening’s electronics theatre at The Shrine (where this year’s Oscar ceremony was held) ending at 9.00 p.m. and for the hardy the paper and panels reception would continue until 11.00 p.m. Subjects through the day would include: ‘VIPs’ (virtually invented people), ‘The teaching of computer graphics in an art and design curricu-",

    "title": "Curious spectatorship in the age of deepfakes",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT On social media platforms, deepfakes commonly show users inserting their own faces into figures from the history of Hollywood film and visual culture while reduplicating a range of gender stereotypes to self-represent. This paper considers the resonances between deepfakes and the writing of feminist film theorist, Laura Mulvey on the male gaze and spectatorship. In particular, the paper looks at deepfake production from the framework of Mulvey’s concept of ‘curious spectatorship,’ a term that describes a process of playful spectator interaction with new technologies to remix old filmic media which leads to decipherment of the screen. Moving between the theoretical and the personal, I consider how early and late arguments in Mulvey’s writing anticipate deepfake practices. I argue that there is creative potential for deepfakes to revise patriarchal structures of looking in Hollywood film and offer a way to consider how new forms of subjectivity and self-perception are encouraged by playful interaction with figures on screen.",

    "abstract": "The Brainstorm feature introduced in Adobe After Effects CS3 (2007) allows users to automate parts of the process of generating design variations for the purposes of comparison and selection. The paper begins with a brief discussion of current discursive formations around software and software-based practice among digital design practitioners and educators. Next, the paper draws upon critical concepts drawn from multimodal discourse analysis, media theory and sociology to analyse Brainstorm in terms of the interplay of software structure and design agency. The key concepts used are modality, articulation and interpretation (Kress and van Leeuwen 1996, 2001), the database as cultural form and the logic of selection (Manovich 2001), habitus and practical logic (Bourdieu 1977) and the radius of creativity (Toynbee 2000). Throughout, the paper addresses specific structural features of the software, thus developing an overview of the affordances and constraints of Brainstorm as a creative tool.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We present a new way of dynamically growing and breeding structures in 3D space through swarming agents. Different agent types and the way they evolve over time is specified by a swarm grammar similar to Lindenmayer systems. We expand common L-system string interpretation from a single turtle to a multitude of turtles which behave like a swarm. By describing swarm agents within the framework of formal grammars, we build a bridge from symbolic production systems (rewrite systems) to three-dimensional real-time construction procedures that are executed by reactive and interacting agents which move in simulated physical 3D spaces. We introduce constructor agents, their formal representation in swarm grammars and demonstrate by examples how (1) the swarm rules, (2) the agent parameters and (3) the environ ment can influence the actual construction and growth processes that are initiated and directed by the swarms. In order to facilitate exploration of a large variety of swarm grammars, we apply interactive evolutionary design methods to create swarm grammar sculptures and 3D structures.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Aesthetic techniques are increasingly used by marketeers to create enticing digital products. In this paper, I work with the aesthetic experiences of one audience group to consider the psychological impact of living in a culture where digital devices are deliberately designed to influence behaviour. I argue that aesthetic encounters can help with understanding the impact of the interplay between visual stimulus, affect and digital culture, in ways that may support situated understandings of mental distress in a digital age. I show how audiences respond to the artist-led research project Are We All Addicts Now? arguing that they generate ideas connected to submersion and being overwhelmed as a means of reporting on their own personal experiences of living in a digital culture that seeks to influence behaviour. The findings may have value for designers, curators and artists invested in understanding the experiential impact of digital devices.",

    "title": "Dance and digital media: Troika Ranch and the art of technology",
    "abstract": "Abstract New technology has had a significant effect on developments in contemporary dance and has featured variously as tool, prop and performance partner. Despite understandable resistance from some quarters computers have come to have a valuable role in the development of work by choreographers such as Merce Cunningham. Troika Ranch is a performance group that makes extensive use of interactive computer media in their live performances to control both the dancer's body and the entire stage space. Devices used include light‐sensitive sensors that trigger sounds, ISDN video and MidiDancer which generates sounds from the performer's movement. In a work currently under development the group explores the conflict between an ‘electronic body’ and the tangibility of physical flesh. The group is part of the New York performing arts community and grows from a collaboration in the late 1980s between the artistic directors Mark Coniglio and Dawn Stopiello. Its stylistic influences come from Russian Constructivism...",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to review the exhibition of works from the Digital Bauhaus after five years of activities. This is done in the light of the originally formulated manifesto for a Digital Bauhaus and the ensuing debate with a specific discussion of the creative collaboration between art and technology. By analysing three works from the exhibition in this framework, it is demonstrated that the Digital Bauhaus vision is not only an intellectual construction expressed in a manifesto, but is actually realized in the works made by students and researchers. The paper concludes by raising the question whether the Digital Bauhaus will be able to work according to the political ideals formulated in the manifesto or if these ideals will have to be reformulated to be in accordance with the ideals of the surrounding—and funding—society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article discusses The Journey as a metaphor for design and development of the app Kunstporten (Art gate) for mobile and iPod. The goal of the project was to go beyond traditional mobile guides and support young visitors' various and contiguous experiences with art. The project involved seven Norwegian art museums over the period 2012–2013. The article focuses on the choices and challenges we as museum professionals met during the design of the app. It reports on how the dialogic concept of museum communication, integrated in the metaphor of The Journey, was shaped and adjusted in the design, planning and development of modules, multimedia content and procedural structure that may support art experience as a journey. The article describes considerations undertaken by museum practitioners in processes of creating museum communication that goes across multiple mediational platforms.",

    "abstract": "We interviewed 13 female machinima artists to investigate the appeal of machinima for women. Are there any specific qualities of this game-based production that speak to those women? The research looked at engine use, personal situation of artists and motivation, production processes and dominant themes in female produced machinima. Our findings indicate that machinima as a form of emergent play opens up promising possibilities for women to engage in game and animation production. Traditional social roles of women are present and remain relevant for machinima production but the accessibility of the tools provides a playground for these filmmakers to explore new genres and technologies and it supports the interest in meaningful engagement and artistic expression stated by participants in the study. We conclude that machinima can serve as a useful tool to explore and improve women's position in digital media development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Laser forming is a process in which metal is shaped by thermally induced stresses, and there are three bending mechanisms. The technique involves locally heating the work piece by traversing it under a laser beam. Positioning tables with a minimum of x and y axes are used as the means of moving the metal. Control of the laser path is via the table movement and requires programs written in G-Code machine language. This can present problems for the designer but complimented by today's modern computing methods, there can be some relief from arduous number crunching and it can be possible that an old programming language, comparatively new software and an understanding of three-dimensional space, thermodynamics and design, can be combined for creating designed objects.",

    "abstract": "1462-6268/05/1603-0153$16.00 Threading Time, the title of the SIGGRAPH 2005 Art Gallery, will exhibit work that uniquely traces pathways that weave through the past, present and future, thus collapsing time and along with it, space. The exhibition will showcase six invited and 52 juried artists, all presenting a small body of work consisting of three to five pieces each. This depth uncovers artistic interpretations of space and time in a cohesive and conceivably more profound way. Perhaps it is this depth that, according to the exhibition curator Linda Lauro-Lazin, helps the work “trace threads through time and space”. If the art reveals the thread, then time and space are the weave and weft created by the thread. The resulting fabric is the exhibition. In fact, the revelations that the unified and interrelated fibres uncover are reminiscent of the way Einstein’s notion of spacetime helped us rethink the meaning of both space and time. His theory of special relativity showed that some things are relative, such as distances in space, velocities and durations of time (Green 2004), but spacetime is absolute. The work in Threading Time examines time and inadvertently or directly, space along with it, but embodies the absolute end result of expression by each artist. Much like Einstein’s theory of special relativity, the work challenges the viewer’s awareness of time and space. The digital medium works like Einstein’s equations, it helps us see the ubiquitous realities of our universe and in the case of this exhibition, the bending of artistic spacetime. This work is not about digital tools, rather, it is the digital medium that makes visible the warping and in some Spacetime in Threading Time: The SIGGRAPH 2005 Art Gallery",

    "abstract": "Abstract The shifting participation paradigm for libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) has caused some frictions within institutional contexts. In particular, this article looks at institutional reluctance to the increasing focus on openness and open data in the context of the large-scale portal Europeana as well as wider EU policy. We look at the case study of the fictional archive IICADOM, constructed by the artist and filmmaker Jasper Rigole, as a potential source of inspiration for traditional institutional contexts. We argue that lessons can be learned from the fictional example's digital engagement practice for creative approaches to open (G)LAMs (including galleries), with a focus on the level of openness in terms of licence, attitudes to risk, the strategic choice of interacting with external platforms and fostering creative reuse.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on a study of a group of designers constructing a three-dimensional graphical virtual world. By focusing on the human experience of their encounter with new technology we arrive at new concepts for understanding our relationship to information technology. By conceptualising information technology as the organising structure for social interaction and regarding it as an influential mediator of human experiences, our perspective reaches beyond the traditional dichotomy of use and design. In our analysis we attempt to show how being in virtual worlds is formed by the participants' understanding of the system and their inherent desires. Our description of the habitation of virtual worlds suggests the importance of technological inscriptions, shows an ongoing interchange between individual ideas and a mutually constructed reality, and a procedural quality of the worlds that by necessity remain unfinished.",

Cultural and social demographic data inform of decreasing numbers of children and shortage of playgrounds around urban areas. Technological advancements such as television and computer games have influenced children's recreational activities so that they prefer to play indoors rather than outdoors. In order to motivate children to play outside we propose a technologically supported play tool titled ‘SoundTag’. This is a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based wearable system that uses interactive sound feedback. ‘SoundTag’ is designed especially for preschool children. In this paper, we detail the concept of the system and related design theory. A pilot experiment is reported where we observed the system in use. Evaluation was of playfulness of the system as well as its impact on improving children's physical activity.",

    "title": "Creative engagement in interactive immersive environments",
    "abstract": "This paper presents two independent case studies selected from n = 11, an 11-year-old male with Down's Syndrome and another 12-year-old male with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An audiovisual immersive interactive environment was developed to encourage creative interaction and expression from the participants. The feedback was via a microphone attached to a sound processor to capture any vocal utterances or speech, additionally the child's gestures were captured through a digital camera and mapped to computer vision algorithms to create a ‘moving painting’, and then further to a MIDI sound source that responded to the movements of the child. Results indicated increased engagement spans whilst in the environment, atypical communicative responses in the case of the ASD child; highly expressive gestural movements that vividly illustrated aspects of the theory of movement as postulated by Laban (1963) and Laban and Lawrence (1974); and increased vocal utterances.",

    "title": "‘Digital sonosphere’. Diagnosis of its current analytical applications and terminological meanings",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recently, in the academic and artistic field, the term ‘digital sonosphere’—or sometimes simply ‘sonosphere’—has started to be widely disseminated and used. Confronting this relatively new term from a scientific perspective has generated a lot of pertinent doubts related to its connotations, functional ambit, definition and the reality it describes. Through a review of the scientific literature, this research proposes a revision and evaluation of the term ‘digital sonosphere’. This work aims to identify the functional application of the concept studied, its added value compared to existing concepts and, at the same time, to highlight its deficiencies related to scientific use in the study of sound perception nowadays. The conclusions of this research present the term ‘digital sonosphere’ as ambiguous, context-dependent and redundant in relation to existing terms. Nevertheless, the term’s application is considered useful in some specific types of analysis.",

The comparison between sites also gives information on the different structures that are being used to present information. The characteristics analysed were the graphic organisation of the page, the elements to support navigation and the structure of information. The analysis identified graphic patterns (e.g. the use of specific text settings), navigation patterns (e.g. specific methods for manipulating documents) and information structures of sites that suggests that some conventions are beginning to emerge.",

    "title": "Algorithms and allegories",
    "abstract": "Much of contemporary art practice is both produced and can be read with the notion of the algorithmic as its predominate trope. Similarly one can read older art practices as working under the aegis of allegory. Of course these registers and metaphors can be used to parse a distribution of artistic and cultural production across time in multiple directions. We often think of the algorithmic as that which concerns procedure, and don’t see it as its own meaning. In this text I am interested in exploring the algorithmic as a gesture, individualized and particular, something that can reveal an interiority of a work. In this way it is perhaps akin to the allegoric, where the work proper, comprised on the surface, simultaneously holds beneath and within it something else. The algorithmic as an author|composer’s signature, might be thought of as that secret storehouse of invention. With the advent of computation and the network, more and more contemporary art and sound work turns its attention to sequencing, loops, replication, modulation, mutation, generative systems, database and interface as instruction sets or grammars, both as ways to conceptualize and to produce work. The paper looks at a wide range of stratagems in works of sound, architecture, visual arts, and film to illustrate a correspondence between the allegoric and the algorithmic. Its aim is to encourage both practitioners and theorists to engage these two notions, the allegoric and the algorithmic, as a way to consider and produce work.",

This paper introduces a new sound synthesis method exploring the non-linear behaviour of two iterative cross-coupled digital oscillators. It begins with a brief introduction to iterative systems followed by background information on previous attempts at using them for synthesizing sounds (e.g. feedback frequency and amplitude modulations). Next, it introduces our synthesis method and briefly explains how it has been implemented in a system for real-time composition and performance. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the system has been put into practice to compose and perform a number of works.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study aimed to propose a framework that promotes immersion, artistic experience, and artistic value in the production of cultural heritage-based interactive artwork. Previous cultural heritage-based artworks failed to adopt symbolic narratives. This study adopts a framework based on a narrative structure to apply symbolism to interactive artwork effectively. It proposed the following five narrative structures to create the abovementioned framework: symbol, mission, activity, change, and artistic embodiment. Two prototypes were created for experimental evaluation to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework in immersion, artistic experience, and artistic value. A comparative experiment of the two prototypes with 80 audience members revealed the framework’s significant effect in terms of artistic value. This study has implications for artists and researchers, as applying the proposed framework will improve the artistic value of their artwork.",

    "abstract": "Architectural design involves a process of iteration and testing which is closely akin to practice-based research and lends itself naturally to this approach in the University environment. Academic research into the relationship between mnemonics and spatial theory reveals the significant part architecture can play in developing the design of memorable virtual environments. The art of memory, which has largely been forgotten in the 21st century, may provide a theoretical context for this research. As we increasingly rely on mechanised forms of memory storage and recall on computer screens, these synthetic memories become ever more complex, and the creation of new methods of representing them becomes pressing. To this end traditional ‘Memory Arts’, based in physical architecture and spatial orientation, are a fruitful source of inspiration. The concept of ‘architectural mnemonics’, which grows from the memory arts, requires a multidisciplinary approach for it to be fully understood. The virtual environments produced using such a theory also require input from different disciplines to allow them to be fully analysed and tested. The interdisciplinary nature of the work reflects the many sided approaches of architecture, which always include both scientific and artistic elements. Through carrying out such practice-based experimental work, both the practice and theory of architecture are advanced and extended.",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the experience of British artist Ernest Edmonds and the influences that have informed his art practice in the past forty years. How are these influences connected? The article has an historical focus. It develops the themes within Edmonds's art and shows his connections with the ‘Systems’ artists and their forebears. In particular, the article concentrates on the encounter of Edmonds with artistic thinking about systems and process in the broad sense, as well as digital and interactive work developed from the early 1980s. As the article will demonstrate, a passion for colour, time and structure, the encounter with a number of artists inspired by Constructivism in the early 1980s, and the educational context in which Edmonds has worked from the late 1960s until the present, have offered great opportunities of interdisciplinary exchanges and ideas that had a profound impact upon the nature of his art. These influences have enabled Edmonds to explore new constructs in art through the use of technology that are a constant stimulus in his creative research, both as an artist and as an academic.",

Relative motions can be regarded as waltz dances, and thus generate varieties of complex and fascinated patterns. We create an applet with Macromedia Director to generate a recursive waltz, and define a specific palette to implement the coloured trajectories. It has always been a pleasure to observe various unseen forms gradually unfurling their mysterious charms. The possibilities are endless, and they call for further and deeper exploration.",

    "abstract": "This project looks at virtual reality (VR) as a mode of displaying history in museums. It focuses on CAVE technology, a form of immersive VR, and examines how current CAVE presentations based on digital reconstructions of buildings and landscapes mediate the historic past. The project is partly based on observations from the use of the CAVE at the Foundation of the Hellenic World (FHW) in Athens, Greece. A special emphasis is placed on the digital reconstruction of ancient cities now in ruins. Miletus, an Athenian and later a Roman colony on the coast of Asia Minor, is the first created so far and constitutes the focus of my investigation. The empirical material I have collected consists of data (video/audio tapes) recording group visits to the CAVE (both school and adult groups) in April 2000. The virtual tourists are ‘shown round’ a digital version of Roman Miletus of the 1st century AD by a museum educator. My analysis concentrates on: • the structure of the CAVE experience (the way information is verbally and visually communicated); • the patterns of producing and communicating knowledge (historical/archaeological discourses practiced within the general pedagogic framework of FHW).",

    "title": "‘Eternal Recurrence’: development of a 3D water curtain system and real-time projection mapping for a large-scale systems artwork installation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Eternal Recurrence’ is a large-scale installation work consisting of a 3D water curtain and projection mapping systems. A 3D water curtain, water drop generation and control program, fog screen and computer program for recognizing visitors were developed for this work. The water curtain, implemented using an array of solenoid valves, creates ephemeral sculptures in real time; the continuous evolution of shapes and images is used as a metaphor of Eternal Recurrence. We developed a method of controlling the solenoid valves that avoids problematic vertical shape distortion caused by gravity and noisy satellite water droplets around the main water drops. The motion of the falling water drops at the centre of the installation is mirrored by the motion of baby-like shapes projected on to the floor and ceiling of the space in which this work is installed. This gives the impression of a full or completed circle. Visitors enter the exhibition through a fog screen, which acts as an entrance port to this immersive experience. ‘Eternal Recurrence’ is a convergence of digital images (3D shape projections) with natural phenomena (falling water drops), which are carefully blended and controlled. As an example of systems art, the installation embodies a process in which all of the separate elements are seamlessly blended through a mechanical–electrical–computer system. The creation and experience of this harmonious system help us to reconsider our existence and networked relations in contemporary society.",

    "abstract": "User needs are a fundamental element of design. If the design process does not properly reflect user needs, the design will be severely compromised. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate how the user is, and user needs are, understood in the design process. In this article, three accepted linear process models for web site and interactive media design are reviewed in terms of the designer and user participation. The article then proposes a user-evolving collaborative design process which is built on co-creation activities between designer and user. Co-creation activities across the entire design process structurally and ontologically reposition the users, and user needs, centrally, which allows the designers to holistically approach to the user needs through building a partnership with the users. Co-creation creates an equal evolving participatory process between user and designer towards sharing values and knowledge and creating new domains of collective creativity.",

The systems discussed are linked by a thematic approach to process and perception - a poetic and romantic attachment to the sublime, and the biological. These topics are examined within a polemic on the conscious subject's ability to perceive and realise processes found in the natural world and their interpretation in a computer. These themes are placed in context of the phenomenology of being and the contemporary interpretation of subject and object distinctions found in the process-based sciences of cybernetics, systems theory and artificial life.",

    "abstract": "We are investigating the potential of artificial life (Alife) models for musical creativity. This paper begins with a brief introduction to our research scenario and then revisits two cellular automata-based generative music systems of our own design: one for synthesising sounds (Chaosynth) and another for generating musical passages (CAMUS). Then, it presents the preliminary results of ongoing research aimed at the design of models to study the origins and evolution of music. Here we introduce a model where a society of distributed and autonomous but co-operative agents evolves repertoires of short melodies from scratch, by interacting with one another. Instead of mapping the behaviour of specific Alife algorithms onto sound or music, as in Chaosynth and CAMUS, this new research addresses the possibility of implementing collective generative music systems, using virtual musicians who learn how to compose and play by themselves and with people interacting with them. We demonstrate by means of a concrete example the important role of mimetic interactions for creativity in a society of software agents furnished with a vocal synthesiser, a hearing apparatus and a simple brain capable of making association between motor and perceptual parameters.",

    "abstract": "Can matter, things, nonhuman organisms, technologies, tools and machines, biota or institutions be seen as creative? How does such creativity reposition the visionary activities of humans? This article is an elaboration of such questions as well as an attempt at a partial response. It was written as an editorial for the special issue of the Digital Creativity journal that interrogates the conception of Post-Anthropocentric Creativity. However, the text below is a rather unconventional editorial. It does not attempt to provide an overview of the issue’s theme but, instead, samples it via a particular example. The idea of the issue was to think about post-anthropocentricism by considering (1) agents, recipients and processes of creativity alongside with its (2) purpose, value, ethics and politics. This article addresses the first subtheme by puzzling at the paradoxes of “field learning” and picks at the second by considering the texture of “automated beauty”. Both of these parts use chess for an example. The narrative on chess is intermitted by a section “on creativity” that attempts to contextualize the case-based discussion in the wider context and to consider motivations and implications.",

Whilst many of the practical opportunities of locative media are biased toward space and place, the author introduces the importance of time. The article explores the loss of time from space that was compounded during the age of Enlightenment, and how many locative media platforms rely heavily upon the traditional articulation of space without time. However, as a form of recovery, the author suggests that since maps have become handheld and are able to locate us ‘upon’ them in ‘real-time’, time has once again began to feature as a characteristic of experience. The author compares our temporal consciousness with the development of representation of space to describe how time and space were once intimately linked, became separated through the Enlightenment project and modernity, but are recently showing signs of a renewed connection in locative media.",

    "title": "Atmospheres of digital technology: wireless spectres and ghosts outside the machine",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines the atmospheres of invisible technologies in the built environment. Starting with the, often cited, notion of technologies of disappearance, this paper suggest that, in the absence of physically tangible infrastructure, we understand and frame technologies through myths and historic forms of interpretation. Using the specific example of Wi-Fi networks the paper draws parallels between the operation and interpretation of modern wireless infrastructure and the spiritualism of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, it shows how through creative exploration, using a visualisation device and a photographic method developed by the authors, perceptions of these invisible infrastructures and the spaces they occupy can be played with. The work acts as an extension and critique of the way wireless infrastructure is currently described and perceived and through playful exploration may lead to new types of technology and spatial design.",

    "title": "Labyrinth 3D. Cultural archetypes for exploring media archives",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the advent of the World Wide Web, online media archives have changed their audience from a restricted number of professionals and amateurs to the general public. This shift is not without consequences: if, on the one side, it represents an important opportunity for archives to engage in a dialogue with a larger audience, on the other side, it advocates novel forms of access that go beyond the highly specialized models underlying traditional access tools. In this paper, we propose to use 3-D graphics for designing novel tools of exploratory search in cultural heritage archives. Our approach has been deployed as an online virtual environment where the user can navigate the meaning relations over the items in the archive. Targeted at cultural heritage, the application, called Labyrinth 3D, relies on the use of cultural archetypes to inform the conceptualization of the archive and the creation of the virtual environment, with the goal of engaging the user in the exploration of the archive through the creation of personal paths.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, we discuss the vocaloid pop star Hatsune Miku as an uncertain image, which embodies networks of fans functioning as cultural producers, making it unclear whether creative statements are affectively dialogical or function as entrepreneurial campaigning. Here we describe Hatsune Miku as an image that is not only desired by fans, but that itself desires. We critically debate the affective investments and distributed ownership in the attention economy in relation to the cultural phenomenon of Hatsune Miku, and consider the pop star to be continuously animated, produced, circulated and consumed by fans, while profit is channeled back to the company behind the image: Crypton Future Media. We further argue that this channeling has been enabled by new digital infrastructures, creating a risk that networks of fans’ affections and desires may be transformed and mutated into feelings that are entangled with commercial interests, thus producing uncertain images of desire such as Hatsune Miku.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT ‘Live minting’ is an emerging trend in exhibition design which offers visitors the opportunity to mint an NFT memento in the exhibition. This paper examines three examples of this current trend in museums which include Play Record Mint (PRM), at Kunsthalle, Zurich, Life After Bob at Light Art Space (LAS) Foundation, Berlin, and Unsupervised at Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York. Using theories on the ‘museum experience’ drawn from scholars such as John Falk and Lynn Dierking (2011; 1992; 2008), this paper examines to what extent the NFTs in these examples contribute or challenge this idea. In doing so, this paper investigates the intersecting values associated with NFTs and argues that NFTs are a form of digital hybrid, a token that exists in a constant state of becoming a commodity, which has both potential benefits and implications for museum exhibition design.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Innovation is made of different tasks from strategic positioning to the first phases of production. One of the main activities is the generation of ideas through different creativity phases. These creativity activities are carried out in numerous conditions and with different tools having more or less context and interactions. This study focuses on the influence of different non-relevant stimuli composing our environment on cognitive load and creativity. This experiment consists of two creativity tasks which consisted in providing answers to a given question using the visuo-spatial and audio-verbal area, with three stimulus appearance conditions: without, continuous, discontinuous. For the visuo-spatial task, participants have to illustrate their answers using an immersive drawing software. For the audio-verbal task, participants have to answer a question with a simple text editor software. Regarding the drawing task, results indicate that the discontinuous stimulus had decreased the number of ideas per participant. For the writing task, the stimulus had increased the intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. This study reveals our creativity is under the influence of the different elements of our environment, the tool used and the task.",

In its inherently ergodic nature, that discourse exists as particular instances which may never be shared. In its inevitable narrativity, in its construction of meaning through fleeting fragments juxtaposed in time, and in its unique instance determined by selection and selection histories, this discourse is unlike that of other media and represents a distinct and different way of storying the world. Reference is made to several contemporary interactive artworks and the text concludes with a short but detailed critique using the ideas mapped out in the preceding text.",

However, so far few attempts have been made to develop analytic and reflective approaches to web design as an aesthetic phenomenon. The aim of this article is from an art historical perspective to focus on WWW as a graphic-aesthetic medium that can be examined as an object or work, and whose development can be described within the framework of design history. The main goal is to show how the study of the graphic design development of the Internet may benefit by employing a central concept from art and design theory, the concept of style. This is used as a dynamic principle for structuring, both in the description and analysis of web design and as a point of departure for a discussion of visual aesthetics and the context-dependent experiences of looking at web design.",

As defined in the introductory article for this series, MRx experiences are conceptualised as site-specific; hybrid; and aesthetic, performative and/or social. This article develops a performance studies and theatre history perspective on MRx. By outlining historical examples relevant to contemporary MRx practice, a set of best practices are derived. These strategies are conceptualised as central questions, which are then applied in the analysis of four examples of recent MRx works, along with suggestions for how these strategies may be used during the design process.",

    "title": "Avatar Body Collision: enactments in distributed performance practices",
    "abstract": "This article is an account and analysis of the work of Avatar Body Collision, a globally distributed, collaborative performance group who use free Internet chat room technologies to perform live across multiple stages and screens. The company’s organising metaphors refer to the distributed performance practices of cyberformance, a form of virtual theatre, in an attempt to encapsulate a phenomenon whose ontological, aesthetic and epistemological condition is contentious, and the hybrid offspring of at least two disciplines: the performing arts and computer technology. The author—a member of the company—locates this undisciplined subject within what Roland Barthes has termed an ‘epistemological slide’, as an emergent performance form. Attention focuses on the process and outcomes of the cyberscript, Screen save her, performed in May 2002 at the 12-12 Time Based Festival, Cardiff School of Arts, and at Riverside Studios, London. Comparison is made between avatar, cyborg and character enactments within the context of distributed performance practices. The primary conceptual framework for this production draws on the work of Murray Gell-Mann and complex adaptive theory. Analysis of spectator feedback from Screen save her ascribes key areas where spectator competencies were misjudged and where spectator expectations remediated the performance event. Additionally, the author speculates about the necessary conditions for developing new performance languages and wonders if a theatre stage is a malleable enough context for such endeavours.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Singing, like dance, emerges directly from the body. The voice, in combination with whole body movement, constitutes a potent form of self-expression. Gestural systems offer a specialized context in which to explore the intersection between voice and movement. The practice-based investigation presented in this article charts the development of an original musical work, Intangible Spaces, which gives form to the invisible aspects of voice and movement through gestural control, physical modelling synthesis and visual feedback. I draw on embodied and performative autoethnographic methods to capture the felt sensations and sound-movement associations that arise during the composition process. I also explore the performance approaches of key practitioners in the area to gain a broader understanding of the ways in which musicians leverage existing performance skills to uncover novel connections between movement and voice in gestural performance.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the way audiences respond to screen-based (virtual) and embodied (robotic) entities in the mixed reality terrain of the gallery space. While it would seem that physical three-dimensional objects in a gallery space, especially self-moving objects such as robots, have a distinct advantage in the reality stakes over screen images, the author suggests that there is no hard and fast distinction between how audiences respond to robotic entities and to screen-based virtual characters. It is the ability of an artwork to respond to and ‘dialogue’ with its audience—to ‘look back’ and ‘talk back’—that is the key factor in making it an engaging and believable social partner. Artists discussed include Mari Velonaki, Stelarc, Ruairi Glynn, Karolina Sobecka and Golan Levin.",

The method consists of two phases: in the first phase, the design team develops and encodes the essential and identifiable character of the designs to be generated and evolved; in the second phase, the design team uses an evolutionary system to generate and evolve designs that incorporate this character. This method is based on a previous generative evolutionary design method, developed by John Frazer from the late 1960s onwards, called the ‘concept seeding method’.",

    "abstract": "Audience participation is essential for successful interactive art. Accordingly, it is very important to study the immersion that encourages the participation of the audience. In this paper, we analyse the expressive characteristics of material-focused Modernist paintings as immersive elements for which the characteristics of the material itself are highlighted. This includes how behavioural elements are introduced to paintings, how such a seemingly consequential abstract visual exists in the context of Formalism, and how these characteristics are shown in the combined action of physical phenomena of nature. That is, the expressive characteristics that occur as the result of interaction between behaviour of artist, gravity and materials are analysed as the sense of presence, the facilitation of immediate feedback, and the immersive elements of visual beauty. Accordingly, it is suggested this type of analysis can be utilized in interactive art.",

    "title": "Advancing interactivity: graphic designers’ practice-based contribution to developing the Web",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines how graphic designers’ innovations in web design revealed the potential and capabilities of interactivity as a communication experience tool. During the early World Wide Web (1995–2008), graphic designers’ practice-based contribution to interactivity enhanced how people experienced this new technological domain. Few designers contributed to the scholarly discussion of interactivity. The main academic fields that did—Human–Computer Interaction, Interaction Design and Communication Theory—disregarded graphic design's contribution, slowing knowledge production around the nature and potential of interactivity. The article compares the three fields’ main ideas about interactivity to an analysis of 47 websites from 2008. It argues that although the idea of interactivity emerged as a transdisciplinary phenomenon, graphic designers’ practical implementation of interactivity in web design through the development of qualities of intuitiveness, enablement, responsiveness, connectivity, intentionality and experience extended its conceptualization beyond technical standards, functionality and theorization.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT While the work realm moves toward digital environments, the antecedents of knowledge worker digital creativity remain poorly understood. This study investigated the digital work environment as a sociotechnical environment and contextual enhancer of knowledge worker digital creativity. We proposed a research model that links perceived organizational support, sense of virtual community and digital creativity. Furthermore, we proposed an indirect moderation model suggesting that the relationship between organizational support and digital creativity is moderated by the sense of virtual community that, in turn, is facilitated by technology ease of use. We tested the model with data collected from platform knowledge workers (N = 159) using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that organizational support positively relates to digital creativity, and that the sense of virtual community moderates the effect of organizational support for digital creativity, whereas technology ease of use facilitates a sense of virtual community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Today our cultural events are dominated by visual information based on sight and sound, but hardly at all on the combined senses of touch and sound. Very little theatre, dance or art events exist in which visually impaired people can participate. While compensated audio-description or talking books are standard products that these people can buy to imagine feature film stories or decide what is happening on the stage, computer interfaces are not often designed which promote communication between impaired actors. Nor are they designed to allow them to navigate and control audio-visual information on the digital stage or present cultural events to sighted audiences. Our research group is interested to address these problems by constructing ergonomic human computer interfaces (HCI) that can explore the above problems including research into orientation, cognitive mapping and external audio-visual device control. Furthermore, the unique cross-modal potentials of human sensory perception could be augmented by electronic devices, which in turn might communicate with sighted audiences. Consequently, we are implementing our discoveries in artificial systems that can interact intelligently with people on the real digitally mediated stage.",

In this paper we discuss an affective computing architecture for the dynamic modification of music with a view to predictablyaffectinginducedmusicalemotions. Extending previous work on the modification of perceived emotions in music, our system architecture aims to provide reliable control of both perceived and induced musical emotions: its emotionality. A rule-based system is used to modify a subset of musical features at two processing levels, namely score and performance. The interactive model leverages sensed listener affect by adapting the emotionality of the music modifications in real-time to assist the listener in reaching a desired emotional state.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Online gaming has become a recent leisure time activity in India, especially among the younger generation. Hence, more and more youngsters, specifically Generation Z are engaged in this virtual gaming world. In response to this scenario, our paper analyzes the role of generation Z customers’ engagement in increasing online game sales. We found that satisfaction from the game, game personalization, and social interaction increases customer engagement, thereby increasing the sale of online games. A research model was developed, and the results were tested using 266 valid questionnaires. The results from the conceptual model testing suggests that the construct of engagement is significant in influencing the purchase decisions of Generation Z customers.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines an approach to ensemble performance, guided by a form of improvised conducting that functions both as communication with musicians and an embodied interface for transforming the ensemble sound. The framework for analysis draws upon the concepts of distributed creativity, its intersection with a listening-centric approach to meaning creation and an embodied cognitive stance on the development of semantic identifiers in music/movement practice. In the described project, tensions are negotiated between acoustic and electronic sources, and between bottom-up structured improvisation and top-down guidance via Soundpainting conducting. These continuums are amplified and explored through another layer of shared articulation, as machine learning has been applied to recognition of the composer/conductors gestures as well as to continuous mapping of conductor movement to sound transformations. These techniques allow for an intersubjective engagement between all members of the ensemble, wherein sound and movement gestures are co-constructed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Robots in traditional fabrication applications act as passive participants in the process of creation—simply performing a set of predetermined actions to materialize a completed design. We propose a novel bottom-up design framework in which robots are instead given the opportunity to participate centrally within a creative design process. This paper describes how two 6-axis industrial robotic arms were used to cooperatively aggregate a collection of solid spherical units. The branching spatial structure being constructed is unplanned at the outset of this process, and is instead designed in pseudo-realtime during construction. This ‘design-as-you-build’ approach relies on robotic input, in the form of path-planning constraints, in tandem with human evaluation and decision-making. The resulting structure emerges from a human–robot design collaboration operating within the specified physical domain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cave paintings bear witness that, early in human cultural development, art and the means to create it (technology) became a method of expression and translation of human interconnectedness with nature defined as the non-human-made world. Contemporary new media artists interacting with nature through the medium of digital technologies in situ continue this exploration within the genre referred to as “digital eco-art”. LocoMotoArt, an independently powered creative field system, was used as a vehicle for conducting media arts practice in natural settings during a three-year qualitative field research project. Findings indicate that human–technology–nature interconnectedness is a possible conduit for establishing a role for digital technology beyond social networking, computing, information gathering and gaming to engage with nature. We argue that digital eco-artists are at the vanguard of creating a new sense of aesthetic and environmental engagement, proportions of which emerge as transformative possibilities. The art experience of digital eco-art can change from being a contemplative one to a living experience.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper describes the design process for The Mind at Work, a light and sound art installation using networked devices, as a case study in working creatively with complex and unknown technological systems. The art installation evoked the development of a reusable framework for making scalable, re-configurable, audiovisual systems, while creating a specific artwork for a gallery exhibition. The development process was observed systematically to understand how creative coders navigate the challenge of integrating the technical and aesthetic considerations simultaneously. Building on existing design literature, the research is centred on an activity we call space shaping: setting up an environment to create tools for exploration. We consider critical points in the design process which affect how space shaping takes place.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The capabilities of humans and AI systems to be creative and perform alongside one another have given rise to new practices of ‘artificial creativity’. In this article, I argue that artificial creativity demonstrates the potential to empower individuals to interface and critically dialogue with computational systems. Reframed as artificial ‘everyday’ creativity, I focus on the curious, joyful and adjacent modes of everyday creativity by including hybrid materials that embrace alternative pedagogies of code and computation. Through the interdisciplinary design approach of ‘critical making’, I craft two unconventionally-coded artefacts that dialogue with AI systems, namely CryptoCrochet-Key and Internet of Towels. Both artefacts are analysed using a four-pronged creativity framework to understand the material translation processes in the artificial everyday creativity practice. With rising concerns about AI's role in misinformation, bias and discrimination, the discussion explores the generative value and limitations of artificial everyday creativity towards the broader goals of civic data literacy and user empowerment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper is an account of research collaborations and an interdisciplinary community that is being forged among experts who have few traditions in common, but who bring diverse expertise to the seemingly unreachable ‘moonshot’1 problem that is chronic pain. It provides analyses of how such collaborations among outliers—from health research, pain medicine, art, design, music, computer science and engineering—arose, and how these collaborators found support in usual and unlikely places, and created a small but vibrant and growing community of researchers. Specifically, this account focuses on artists and designers in this collaborative context; what was required of them, their roles in changing the very conditions of research, how their relationships to their originating (or ‘legacy’) discipline changed, and how their commitments profoundly redefined their very notions of what art can mean.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper uses the example of software and electronic devices used in musical improvisation to develop a critique of the dominant view of technology, specified by function and input–output behaviour, and optimized so that it is as domesticated as a faithful dog. The optimization in question attempts to avoid discontinuity and, more generally, unforeseen responses from a system, assuming a human being’s need for an interface is purely functional. Against this, we argue that some devices are, by their nature, complex and chaotic, and also that, because of this complexity, we can form deep attachments to them. These interspecies forms of affection are rooted in the sense of incompleteness of the human, its uncertainty in relation to an other and the reasons why, while a synthetic companion can be desirable because more predictable, in the case of improvisational interaction we desire our machinic counterparts to surprise us.",

Focus extends from the showing of art to its creation, and the empowerment and agency of communities through enactive learning. In this model the arts organisation acts as a catalyst for collaborative action and enquiry involving academia and a wider ecosystem of communities and stakeholders including the public, artists, digital creative industry, maker spaces and local government. The new model entails embedding of research, innovation and arts practice within the arts organisation itself. We illustrate the approach with examples of projects spanning mental health, physical disability, young people, veterans, children and parents, which have had a real impact on health and well-being of our communities.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cinematic virtual reality (CVR) experiences are increasingly expanding their use of additional media outside the VR headset, including scenography, spatial sound, and live performance, to successfully transition their audience into the experience. As such, they promote a heightened interest in transition design to secure experience continuity. In this paper, the authors argue that returning to the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concept of trajectories provides a fruitful starting point for considering transition design in CVR installations. However, explicit explorations of transitions and their design in HCI literature are limited. This contrasts with a strong design focus ‘in the wild’ across immersive genres including performance art, theme parks, video games, and live-action roleplay. Therefore, this paper advances the trajectory framework by returning to existing case studies with a transition design focus in order to discuss two existing design strategies and to mark future directions for research in the context of CVR.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT What role does deviation from realism play in the potential for generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a creative tool? A deep case-study was performed to explore interactions with AI-generated dance sequences as an inspiration source in dance composition and improvization. We present a simple interface created in collaboration with an experienced dancer for browsing AI-generated dance. By including glitches, the physics-breaking mistakes often encountered in AI-generated artefacts, we examine their affordances and possible use cases through sessions with the dancer. Through a process of reflexive thematic analysis, we identified that generative AI can engage a dancer through surprise, inspiring a transformation from abstract to physical movements. Our work challenges existing notions of the importance of realism in dance generation models, exemplifies the importance of close collaboration with practitioners in evaluating AI-generated artefacts and proposes glitch as a potential use case for dance ideation as it encourages dancers to embody unfamiliar movement qualities and break from ingrained patterns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wicked environmental problems are complex, ill-defined and constantly shifting. Analytical methods alone are typically under-equipped to address these problems. High–low tech is a craftmaking and design practice that encourages makers to merge high- and low-tech materials, processes and cultures. We explore how high–low tech practices can create new ways of understanding wicked environmental problems and lead practitioners towards new ways of approaching them. Through five examples of high–low tech practices, we explore the qualities of these practices—an embrace of complexity, a transdisciplinary approach to work and a maker ethos—that make high–low tech practices particularly well suited to addressing wicked environmental problems.",

    "title": "‘You can dance your prototype if you like’: independent filmmakers adapting the hackathon",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hackathon-style events are increasingly used to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning and innovation in the media industries. Based on an observational study of a hackathon organized as part of the film festival Nordic Panorama (NP) we analyse the challenges in using the hackathon format to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning and innovation for filmmakers, developers and designers. We find that many participants experienced frustrations resulting from a lack of programming skills and their expectation that the hackathon should result in ‘something digital’. Additionally, ideals for authorship embedded in the working cultures of film and TV professionals impeded the team’s ability to involve all participants on an equal footing. As implications for future hackathons we suggest organizers should consider using tools for end-user development and generative toolkits to facilitate digital making and collaborative learning. We also suggest similar events should avoid including project owners if the group work is based on existing projects.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT I know that all contemporary artists need a written introduction to their work, something that provides it with a bit of context. At best a narrative that portrays my work as the logical culmination of a personal journey, full of struggle and heroism. I sit here in front of my screen, trying to make a diverse artistic practice involving installations, video, performance, sculpture and online work out to be a single cohesive body of work. But below almost each of the words that I slowly type on the keyboard, a squiggly red line appears. It is as if the spell checker is determined to undermine the carefully constructed artistic persona that I am putting together from shows in and outside of institutions and other arts spaces. It is as if the computer is suggesting a potential drift through my own biography that opens the possibility that I could be writing a far more interesting text about my work than I am right now: a less regulated and smooth narrative of who I am as an artist, led by the associative structure of my spell checker’s software, rather than my own preconceived notions of who I am and what I do.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of culture on understanding metaphors in GUIs and aims to generate guidelines for choosing appropriate metaphors for users from different cultures. Considering the dual-coded structure of compound metaphorical icons – composed of two major units: image and label – this study evaluates the main hypothesis that understanding of graphical and textual elements of the metaphors differs due to real world and language experiences of the users. A study on a French e-learning site – based on a spatial ‘Campus’ metaphor – was conducted with sixty-eight Turkish and French students. The qualitative study applied a multi-method approach including data collection instruments like background and icon recognition questionnaires and interview. Findings suggest differences in understanding across the two cultural groups and provide an in-depth analysis on the process of cross-cultural understanding of metaphors by focusing on the metaphorical inconsistencies. Through this analysis, guidelines are proposed for choosing metaphors in GUIs.",
