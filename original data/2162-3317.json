    "title": "CANCER ON TIKTOK–EVALUATING POSITIVE CULTURE AND ONLINE SELF-DISCLOSURE USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The presented paper characterizes TikTok practices of users with cancer and uses notions of social media as positive culture (presenting oneself without undesirable traits) and online self-disclosure understood as providing intimate, private information about oneself. The research continues the work on self-disclosure of women with breast cancer using Instagram. However, this previous research revolved around posts, and thus was limited. The current study on TikTok asks the following questions: 1) are TikTok videos disclosing information in the manner the previous research on Instagram shows? 2) What are the creators’ motivations and what meanings do they give to disclosing cancer and how do the users position themselves considering the positive culture? The study uses categories from previous work and combines qualitative directed content analysis (DCA; 862 videos are analyzed) with in-depth interviews (n=8), and these go beyond DCA to a more nuanced understanding of the users’ lived experience. Similar to Instagram, TikTok is a tool for negative (e.g., fears, anxiety, pain) and positive self-disclosure (e.g., joyful life events, self-acceptance, self-afﬁrmation) with the prevalence of positive and educational videos (e.g. prevention, debunking stereotypes and normalizing the disease). The respondents feel especially competent to educate others because of their experiences. The research undermines the traditional understanding of online self-disclosure, as for users seeking support is not that important, compared to informing and warning others. Also, the study debunks positive culture as a too-general category, as the interviewees constitute a particular niche and seem not to care how they are perceived while disclosing cancer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital technologies now mediate most, if not all, aspects of children’s lives from learning to lunching, playing, staying connected and building relationships with friends and family. However, the same cannot be said about children’s best interests in the design and operation of today’s digital environment. This paper analyses 52 products and services children use, including consoles, mobile games, wearables, smart toys, EdTech and digital health services, for their features and stated compliance with existing standards and regulations. The analysis reveals that each of these products states compliance with just 5.5 standards and regulations on average. This paper then contributes a framework for digital providers to design children’s rights into their products and services, based on interviews with experts, ranging from designers to lawyers and human rights experts, and workshops with designers from large to start-up companies. It argues that if a digital world is made child-rights-respecting by design, children can explore and reap full benefits of what digital technologies can offer alongside their older counterparts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The mediation of mobile and social media technologies has reshaped how people imagine, understand, and, in turn, calibrate the visibility of their self-expression, information sharing, and relationship-building. This paper presents a case study of how promoters and attendees in underground electronic/dance music culture (EDMC) maintained the boundaries of the “underground” by co-constructing norms of mobile and social media use. Drawing upon 20 nights of field observations at live music events and 27 semi-structured interviews with promoters and attendees, I highlighted two scenarios in which promoters and attendees leveraged the spatial and temporal affordances of mobile and social media to calibrate their visibility. First, the last-minute and indirect sharing of event location afforded the community to bar outsiders from entering while allowing insiders to authenticate themselves by navigating to their gatherings. Second, the dialectical shaping between promoters’ venue policies and attendees’ folk theories of phone etiquette maintained a reduced level of mobile media use at such gatherings. These practices brought to light how mobile and social media afford new spatial-temporal conditions of visibility and bring forth new possibilities for people to not only manage – but play with visibility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a critique to the limitation of decoloniality discourses which take a unilateral approach in which hegemony is seen as originating from the Global North and resistance as located in the Global South. The article therefore aims to “voice” out the silent ways in which internet users in the Global South could be enhancing coloniality and thwarting attempts at decolonisation. Consequently, it seeks to contribute to the theorization of coloniality by privileging the concept of hybridity not as a logic of resistance but as a hegemonic site in which power inequalities and othering is perpetuated. To support the arguments made in this article, two political WhatsApp communities (East Asembo Development Forum and Kabula Forward) in Kenya imagined around the rural physical communities from which members originate, were purposively selected. The goal of both communities is to hold their political leaders accountable and agitate for development. Adapting netnography as a method which allows for researcher immersion in online spaces, data was collected through background listening, interviews and Focus Group Discussions. Data was analysed through a Discursive Material Analysis in which both the WhatsApp technology affordances/constraints and human actors’ actions, were read as text. Findings show that despite the plurality (hybridity) of the composition of the WhatsApp communities, participation is defined through hegemonic capitalism discourse, through which political participation is metaphorically substituted by materialism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data policy aims to understand how governments, industry, academia, and civil society understand data availability and use. Data policy studies are broad in scope and include theory and practice of open sources of data from traditional sources (e.g., statistics and public health government agencies); representation and interpretation of data; investigations of the social relations and impacts of open public data; and attitudes surrounding data stewardship and public data availability and use.\n\nThis study’s empirical research is based on two case studies of the Australian and New Zealand Open Data programs between 2010 and 2020. Based on current scholarship, some factors affecting open data supply were confirmed, and new insights were generated. Social psychology theorising concerning identity leadership was confirmed. When leaders promoted a sense of ‘us’ and ‘who we are’, data stewards were more likely to advance a shared vision for making data available for reuse. The concepts of _collateral peers_ and _collateral peer networks_ were introduced to data policy scholarship. Collateral peer networks engage in multistakeholder governance with no apparent leader-follower relationship. Instead, peers (in function but not necessary title) collaborate across the public service, at various levels of government, and with experts in research institutions (e.g., publicly funded scientific and applied research organisations).\n\nFuture areas for public interest technology, specifically data policy research, include how researchers and practitioners can prioritise data stewardship, open data communities, and multistakeholder governance, especially during prolonged and compounding crises.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper offers a new way of conceptualizing conservatives’ approach to truth and knowledge, based on over two years of online fieldwork (2019-2021) into reactionary YouTube channels and their audiences. I use qualitative content analysis to examine over 100 hours of YouTube videos, 1050 YouTube comments, and online interviews with 15 current and former fans of these channels. Drawing on these data sources, I argue that the reactionary right’s emphasis on “rugged individualism” forms the basis not just of their political project but also of their imagined epistemology.\n\nI find that reactionary YouTubers and their viewers describe arriving at their political beliefs as a highly idiosyncratic process of personal research and rational deliberation. I call this narrative of political formation \"bootstraps epistemology.\" Just as the bootstraps narrative in politics argues that individuals have the duty to reject government “handouts” and improve their circumstances through hard work and thrift, bootstraps epistemology encourages people to reject dogma and instead pursue knowledge through solitary study and intellectual combat with opponents. I propose that the bootstraps narrative of personal responsibility and bootstraps epistemology are mutually-enforcing discourses that advance individualistic solutions to social problems. I find that the latter has gained currency in recent years, with the widespread loss of trust in mainstream media and the proliferation of “alternative” sources of onli news and information.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper uses a novel combination of computational and qualitative methods called ‘critical simulation’ to explore the interplay between everyday image-making practices and the algorithmic architecture of Instagram. The paper aims to understand the capacity of machine vision systems to recognise and reproduce the diverse vernacular aesthetics and affects associated with particular scenes on Instagram - in this case, drawing on a case study of Instagram’s ‘-cores’ hashtags. We used our purpose-built machine vision system to undertake unsupervised clusterings of a sample of the 359,150 images associated with a curated set of 60 ‘-cores’ hashtags, which we collected following a period of immersive qualitative investigation of the -cores phenomenon on the platform itself during 2021. We assess the extent to which the system's clusters align with the different -cores hashtags under which the images were originally posted, and then undertake a close cultural analysis of the clusters, reading them through the lens of our existing knowledge of the -core hashtags. This enables us to speculate on how the platforms’ machine vision logics might play a role in shaping Instagram’s platform aesthetics, and on internet culture more broadly. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Disinformation, inaccurate information spread intentionally for profit, ideology, or harm is a major public issue and a significant object of study across disciplines However, much scholarship treats “disinformation” as an irritant without recognizing that it often harnesses metanarratives about inequality and identity, and disproportionately impacts marginalized communities. For example, counting how many “sockpuppet” accounts contribute to a Twitter hashtag reveals that they do not represent genuine opinions of unique individuals, but does not capture whether they advance cultural narratives about race and gender. Disinformation campaigns are also often mischaracterized as “information warfare” or “psychological operations” and reduced to military-style masculinized logics of conflict and dominance in which “threat” is framed as a matter of “cybersecurity.\" This leaves out complex dynamics of identity, intersectionality, affect, labor, and material infrastructures. Feminist theory, methods, and perspectives are particularly well suited to exploring such issues. This panel brings together scholars working at different edges of this nascent discipline to explore what disinformation studies can learn from feminist scholars in rhetoric, communication, and science and technology studies.</jats:p>",

We found out that different levels of influencers tend to spread different information within and between the #All/Black/BlueLivesMatter, and we offer some explanations through the lens of curation logics. We suggest that different levels of influencers may be exposed to different incentives, and be facing different social norms, which leads to different information behaviors.

It seeks to develop a more multifaceted understanding of women’s gaming ‘lifeworlds’ and their struggles to participate and ‘stay in’ the male-dominant public. Specifically, this study observes how relationship dynamics and romantic ties between couples can play an important role in shaping women’s gaming practices. In doing so, this argument challenges the assumption that women’s play can be given as simply ‘a free choice’. Exploring conflicts between couples relative to their gaming habits, as I examine, demonstrates how the accounts of women’s evolving (dis)engagement to gaming cannot sufficiently be captured within a scope that is often limited to discussions about women’s barriers to entry.</jats:p>",

    "title": "QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE ON CHILLING EFFECTS—HOW USERS’ IMAGINARIES OF DATAVEILLANCE LEAD TO INHIBITED DIGITAL BEHAVIOR",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Our everyday life has become highly digitized, and all our online actions leave digital data traces that are automatically collected, aggregated, and analyzed. Emerging research shows that this dataveillance can lead to chilling effects on mundane and legitimate information and communication behaviors. However, the extent to which a sense of dataveillance deters individuals from freely engaging in legitimate digital behaviors remains empirically understudied. Therefore, we ask: How do internet users imagine dataveillance? And how does this perception lead to people limiting their digital behavior?\n\nTo address these questions, we conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with 15 individuals. Our results contribute to a better understanding of people’s imaginaries of dataveillance, as well as sources for these perceptions and reactions towards them in terms of chilled digital behaviors. We show how imagined sources of dataveillance can range from states to corporate actors and how knowledge about dataveillance can originate in news coverage on data scandals or own experiences. Also, we identify further legitimate, mundane behaviors in other life domains like participating in online dating and buying things online that are affected by a sense of dataveillance and have so far been neglected in research on chilling effects.\n\nThese results contribute to an empirically founded understanding of the nature of a sense of dataveillance and resulting chilling effects on digital behavior. They provide the basis for a representative survey and a mobile experience sampling study as part of a mixed-methods research design investigating chilling effects on a population level.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The panorama of editorial automation is moving at a fast clip in many organisations around the world. However, the transition towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies as supporting processes go at their own pace in other contexts beyond the US and Europe and cast doubts about their implementation. This article examines perceived ideas and problems about automation in Australian newsrooms. It investigates to what extent news professionals have undertaken the adoption of different automated tools in their work and the limits of using these technologies. This study stems from a broader research question focused on studying the evolution of automated decision-making systems (ADMS) in journalism in Australia and beyond. Preliminary findings suggest there is no singular approach to automation and there are contrasting views between those who believe ADMS will have a greater impact on the work and others who argue \"AI will not replace human journalists in the near future\". The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated interest in alternative automation processes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Search engines play a gatekeeper role in current high-choice information environments. Considered a form of new media, users are still more likely to find and trust news found through search than social media sites. Indeed, search engines are one of the most utilised technologies to find political information, despite audits uncovering biases in their results, for example, towards national outlets over local ones. It is therefore important to keep in mind the potential of search results to affect public opinion. With this study, we investigate how Google search news headlines and snippets differ when varying migrant search terms (e.g., immigrant, refugee, expat). We employ computational text analysis methods as well as qualitative content analysis. Specifically, we employ an automated framework for detecting media frames, originally trained on Twitter data, and attempt to transfer it to news data; this framework allows for a categorization of data to frames of a generic-issue (economy, safety, health) and specific (hero:diversity, threat:jobs) nature. We evaluate its applicability for this novel data source and find that it performs well for frames related economy and security. Our next steps include analysing the results of other computational measures, namely, sentiment, agency and political outlet of the news item. We expect that sentiment and agency will complement the initial results we see based on media frames.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Personal portraits on social media are value-laden constructs. Whether documenting graduation or flexing in the gym, users express what they care about and present it for others to evaluate. Since “global” portrait genres are produced and consumed in different locales, their interpretation and evaluation may vary. We thus ask: What values do people identify in different types of social media portraits? Which evaluative criteria do they use when judging them? An analysis of 100 interviews with users from Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United States reveals that people consistently recognize genre-specific values in portraits and evaluate them through a narrow set of communication-related criteria. Such evaluations vary somewhat cross-culturally in ways that only occasionally match established comparative literature on values. We reflect on the relational character of the criteria adopted for the evaluation of portraits worldwide, highlighting its association with new modes of sociability in digital spheres.</jats:p>",

In the video, Bradesco bank presents less subservient responses to verbal attacks and harassment frequently sent to the brand's virtual assistant, BIA. However, the comments in the video suggest a negative reception of the campaign by the audience, which can help illuminate broader discussions on social and symbolic asymmetries in feminized work rendered invisible by technology. The comments help us to reflect on understandings of what constitutes the human in artificial intelligence and how does the harassment of this virtual chatbot relates to the harassment suffered by women in virtual settings. To critically analyze these texts, we have taken a semiotic analysis of the audiovisual campaign based on Peircean semiotics of extraction and conducted a qualitative content analysis on 200 comments with the highest number of likes on the official Youtube video of the campaign, collected through Youtube Data Tools. Grounding our article in feminist technology studies and critical algorithmic research, we show how the audience reflects on the contradictory understandings of the humans rendered invisible in technology and that changing the materiality/code of technology is not enough to affect systems of gendered oppression.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>_u/dadbot_3000_ is one of many from a collective of DadBots that claim to bring ‘dad jokes’ and bad puns to Reddit. In practice, DadBots are better known for simply commenting ‘Hi, I’m Dad’ and together they have fostered a well-known presence and identity on the Reddit platform. The presence of bots such as _u/dadbot_3000_ demonstrate how online communities engage with semi-autonomous entities in a creative, ‘playful’ (Massanari, 2016) and sometime humorous way. Bots are frequently examined as problematic on account of their potential to distort social interaction, spread misinformation, and disrupt political process (Dubois &amp; McKelvey, 2019; Albadi, et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2018). However bots such as _u/dadbot_3000_ can also be entertaining, engage in humour or contribute to the cultural landscape where they operate. This paper will present a cultural biography of _u/dadbot_3000_, examining its interactions with other bots and human users. A time series of events will highlight patterns across the bot’s lifespan, depicting controversies, connections, and how attitudes and interactions with the bot evolve over time. By tracing the life stories of _u/dadbot_3000_, this research will add insight into how bots, and people’s perception of them reflect, and contribute to the culture and architecture of online platform environments. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In November 2020, a video surfaced on Twitter showing the earth moving underneath the feet of a local hillwalker. The video documented a massive peat landslide at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, caused by the construction of the Meenbog Wind Farm. The landslide destroyed a swathe of active peat bog and polluted a watershed which spanned both sides of the border, prompting governmental and legal action from agencies and organizations in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and UK.\n\nA key piece of the puzzle, however, was that the Meenbog Wind Farm had in 2019 sold its future energy to global logistics and cloud giant Amazon to power its data centre operations in Dublin, over 200km away from this wind farm site in rural Donegal. The data infrastructure company’s decarbonization efforts were following fault lines and toxic legacies of colonial expansion, the imagined perpetual growth of data systems having unintended consequences at Ireland's contested internal border. By analyzing data centre and energy policy, public discourse around these infrastructural systems, and drawing upon site-specific fieldwork, this paper will confront the re-organization of political and environmental relations at the border with regards to emerging renewable energy and data entanglements. Engaging with vibrant discourses of “green extractivism” during the transition to renewable energy, the paper will approach bordering mechanisms cutting through Ireland as sites of contestation about what present and future extractive energy and data supply chains will look like, who will bear their burdens, and who will have a voice in shaping them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The case of Joss Whedon, who has been subject to calls for “cancelling” in light of allegations around misconduct and abuse, is at the heart of a major cultural debate. The term ‘cancel culture’ that entered the public sphere alongside the #MeToo movement has quickly earned a contested status. The Whedon fan community has been a key site within this broader controversy, as withdrawal of support for the prominent creator began gradually in 2017 and intensified in 2021, after several allegations of harassment and abuse have been made public. This study will examine how fans perceive these allegations, how they see the status of creators and their contents in light of them, and how they navigate the ambivalences inherent in “cancelling” a previously-valued creator. This case is particularly enlightening given the fact that Whedon was celebrated for advancing feminist agendas in popular culture. In order to understand how Whedon fans perceive, evaluate and employ “cancelling,” this study will employ qualitative analysis of 20 in-depth interviews with Whedon fans and former fans, sampled from the fan community on Twitter. Through an in-depth examination of how fans understand Whedon and his works in light of the recent allegations, this study will shed light on “cancelling” as a political-ideological tool and the ways in which popular culture serves as a key arena in today’s “culture wars.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The spread of digital media and devices in public spaces, so-called self-service technology (SST), is reaching more and more areas, so that it is now possible to interact with them for example when shopping, ordering or sending parcels. The use of SST is mostly supposed to be self-explanatory and intuitive, nevertheless it implicitly presupposes a certain degree of technical literacy. If this is not the case, digital stress can be triggered. But how do people deal with these devices, what role does the presence of others, the device itself and how it works, and the situational context plays? What influence do the measures to deal with the Covid-19 virus and the pandemic-related constraints have on the nexus of device, users and situation? This was investigated qualitatively in the present study by conducting participant observations. The advantage of this methodological approach is the consideration of contextual factors of the different practices and the direct observation of subjective evaluation processes on the use or even non-use of SST. This shows that characteristics of the devices – e.g. functionality, initiation and optionality – , situational contextual conditions – e.g. time and social pressure and spatial conditions –, and the subject themselves – e.g. age, routinisation and carried along baggage– play a role in dealing with SST and moderate the emergence of digital stress.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As social media platforms have become a key source of news for younger generations of users (Newman et al., 2021), media plurality and news visibility have become focal areas for scholars concerned about the future of local content in an era of information globalisation (see esp. Dwyer et al., 2020) and algorithmic gatekeeping (Martin, 2021). Consequently, it is crucial to understand how young adults curate their social media feeds to access socially significant information and the impact that their curatorial design has on their news exposure and consumption. This paper presents the findings from a 12 month digital ethnographic study involving 13 young adult Australians and their use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to highlight the role of individual agency in user experience of news and information.\n\nThe findings in this paper examine what users categorise as news on social media, and explores how topics discussed in the media are able to break through onto social media feeds without presentation as formal news reporting. It argues that ‘cultural commentary’ content such as memes, casual discussions between friends, and hot takes from influencers and public figures have the potential to keep users up to date with what is happening in the world, hyper-locally and globally. The analysis of the research data demonstrates that a variety of platform users interact with cultural commentary content, including those who describe themselves as ‘news avoidant’.\n\n</jats:p>",

How do platforms and their algorithms afford (in)visibility to marginalized and stigmatized creators? How do these groups resist top-down (in)visibility regimes? Finally, how do such (in)visibility regimes challenge or reaffirm other forms of social marginalization? Primarily drawing on interviews with creators on a variety of social media and webcam sex platforms, the panelists examine the complex dynamic between visibility and invisibility. The first paper studies the role of algorithmic labor and capital in the wider hierarchies that structure the contemporary creator economy. In turn, the second paper further develops this inquiry, studying how people of size grapple with their datafied presence and develop strategies for safely navigating algorithmically mediated hyper(in)visibility. The third paper focuses on performers on webcam sex platforms, showing how these performers engage with visibility beyond that provided by platform algorithms, while simultaneously seeking invisibility, where possible. Finally, the fourth paper—drawing on an interface analysis of 50 high-traffic webcam sex platforms—analyzes the information and affordances available to performers. Taken together, the panelists show how platforms shape the kinds of (in)visibility afforded to precarious laborers, while also showing how they seek to resist this erasure and challenge the vulnerabilities of being “seen.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media provides a critical space for people at the margins to document, publish, and share content that publicizes instances of human rights violations, conflict, and dispossession. This presentation explores how asymmetrical content moderation processes, opaque platform policies, and alternative enforcement systems that are brokered through backdoor corporate-government agreements lead to the removal of this content and re-obscure life and death struggles. It introduces the notion of _platform necropolitics_ (Lewis, 2023, forthcoming) and demonstrates its theoretical resourcefulness through an examination of platform censorship of pro-Palestinian content during the May 2021 Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Platform necropolitics manifests through the sovereign logics of platforms that violently police the boundaries of speech and space–determining who has the right to speak and who has the right to appear as a legitimate digital citizen, and who does not–and that take as their object the articulations of digital subjects and enact their ‘right to kill or let live’. This framework draws together scholarship from platform studies, political theorizing, and decolonial critique to reorientate critical theorizing of platforms as technologies of necropolitical power to rethink and imagine the implications of their discursive, material, and geospatial interventions. Exploring the tensions of digital media technologies as spaces that we live _with_, _in_, and _through_, considering platforms as _political_ and _material_ actors that determine and condition the social, political, and material (in)existence of digital subjects, I examine how platforms enact forms of necropolitical governance though corporate and machinic logics that simultaneously extend and reproduce the necropolitical power of the Israeli state.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Advertising shapes our larger public culture but the typical experience of advertising is now confined to our private and algorithmically-customised social media feeds. In this project, with our partner VicHealth, we used a participatory digital method to work with 204 young Australians aged 18 to 25 to collect 5169 examples of alcohol, gambling and fast food advertising from their social media feeds. We analyse the collections of advertisements each participant sent us. The patterns across participants’ collections illustrate how social media platforms’ advertising models ‘learn’ to reflect and reproduce the identities and subject positions of participants. The collections of ads we see on social media are an important object of study because they reveal not just the symbolic content and targeting patterns of particular ads, but also because they illustrate how advertising on social media algorithmically-curates an immersive cultural experience. Our study demonstrates how social media continues the larger social role advertising plays in the construction and maintenance of consumer subjectivities. The algorithmic flow of advertising on social media is now the basis of our everyday engagement with advertising. We need to conceptualise advertising on social media not only using concepts of ‘targeting’ that imply the precise identification of our characteristics, but instead as a complex feedback loop between the refinement of ad content and themes, the data-driven optimization of audiences, and our reflexive and fluid identities, interests and aesthetic sensibilities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper stems from a chapter of my Doctoral dissertation. It borrows from the work of boyd (2014) on the experiences of teenagers in social media. In this paper I will present the different usages of the internet and social media by teenagers that live in a context of exclusion. I will focus on teenagers that are placed in care institutions in Brazil, and their struggle with everyday forms of stigma and oppression.\n\nTo live in a care institution, a.k.a shelters, is a unique experience that is the consequence of rights violations against children and teenagers (Brazilian Statute of the Child and of the Adolescent, 1990). The placement in a shelter is an extreme measure that remove children from their families and communities. To legitimate the state intervention and highlighting the exceptionality and temporality of that measure, the law prioritises family and community conviviality. This is not the case for most of teenagers, as it is unlikely they will be adopted or return, and they will spent most of their teen years there.\n\nI will present the narratives of institution and especially teenagers, with which I highlight the link between their experiences of exclusion, the formation of identity and their digital personas. For such, I will use the concept of reflexive identity (Giddens, 1991) and the script approach (Akrich, 1992) to portray how their actions show some kind accomodation and appropriation of the affordances of social media to seek stability in a context of high uncertainty.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the immediate aftermath of the 2014 murder of 18-year Michael Brown in Missouri, hashtags like #ferguson, #justiceformikebrown, and #handsupdontshoot begin trending on Twitter. At the same time, Marcia Chatelain, Georgetown University Professor of History and American Studies, began crowdsourcing materials for educators trying to address what happened in their classrooms using the hashtag #fergusonsyllabus. What resulted was a list of highly interdisciplinary and multimedia sources including scholarly texts, news stories, songs, poems, films, public addresses, and children’s books. Chatelain’s call spoke both to the present crisis, the murder of a Black teenager by police, and to the historical and cultural context in which this shooting happened. The efforts of Chatelain and the community that came together around this hashtag expanded our understanding of information production and curation and the function of a syllabus beyond the college classroom. In introducing our undergraduate classes to the idea of the hashtag syllabus, we attempt to engage our students in practices of information literacy with the hope of providing them tools to look critically at the inequities that permeate academic and non-academic spaces. Here, we explore the ways in which this format operates in interdisciplinary social science programs and the ways in which it supports unique learning objectives in both introductory and upper-level courses. In doing so, we hope to engage in pedagogical praxis that connects our fields and our students with questions of social justice and to do so in a way that prepares them for meaningful civic engagement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel combines four papers which focus in different ways on the question of children’s data and privacy in the Australian context. All four are framed with children’s right to privacy as a core concern, consistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as updated via the General Comment 25 on Child Rights in the Digital Environment. We examine four arenas where children’s data is either extracted or occluded in ways that make it more difficult, if not impossible, for parents, carers and others to make informed choices about the data of very young children. As children begin to articulate their own ideas and privacy preferences, these studies highlight different understandings of privacy, and of trust in both people and technologies. The panel papers are titled: ‘Where Does Children’s Data Go? Mapping the Data Broker Industry’; ‘Data and Privacy as a Social Relation’; ‘Developing a Holistic Framework for Analysing Privacy Policies – A Child’s Rights and Data Justice Perspective’ and ‘Unboxing Data and Privacy Via Young Children’s Wearables’. Collectively, these papers can be read as arguing that we need nothing less than a revolution in the way children and responsible adults are informed about the way children’s data is generated, captured, stored, and owned, as well as explicitly regulating who can profit from children’s data, in which circumstances, and how transparent these processes must be.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate anxiety—the feeling of dread and distress associated with worrying about the future of the planet—has been posited as a defining feature of Gen Z. This study examines youth communication around climate anxiety on YouTube, through a qualitative content analysis of 146 youth-created videos about climate anxiety, as well as the over 20,000 comments posted on them. Illustrating an emphasis on content rather than form, the videos in our corpus showed an in-depth engagement with the topic at hand, coupled with a simple, low-key aesthetic. The vast majority of videos assumed an imagined audience of young people who are concerned about the climate; thus, the goal was to provide information and advice rather than persuade about climate change. Our analysis illustrates the significance of insider conversations among youth, and the centrality of YouTube’s expressivity and connectivity affordances in allowing young people to engage with these topics on a personal and intimate level. At the same time, our research illuminates the mental toll of political expression for young people, and further highlights this connection between the affective and the political drive. On a theoretical level, our research offers and tests a broadly applicable model that explains how different social media platforms (in this case, YouTube) enable—as well as constrain—certain forms of political expression, through the interaction between their affordances, norms, and contents.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>From greenscreens in the bedroom to webcams on refrigerators, household surfaces underlie the broadcast of personality on Twitch.tv, Amazon’s $15 billion platform for live video entertainment. This paper examines how homemaking and visibility are co-conceptualized in the labour of gendered and racialized game live streamers. Drawing from a virtual ethnography of Twitch creators’ domestic spaces in North America (n=12), I document the staging of household visibility in relation to Twitch’s affordances of on-demand broadcast and play. Extending feminist and social reproduction theorizations of housework, I discuss how this convergence of house- and sight-making reifies the gaming industry’s historic reliance upon unremunerated spousal support.\n\nHow such marginalised Twitch streamers calibrate opacity between their broadcasts and their homes reveals the affinities between platform aggregation and domestic privatisation on local and global scales. The converging geographies of labour, leisure, and living demanded by Twitch represent more than ancillary sites where gameplay(ers) are visually recomposed as “web-ready” for live platform(ization). Rather, the management of a domestic timespace on Twitch represents a struggle for autonomy over the means of cultural production by workers across social media entertainment. This paper reframes “Bleed Purple” as more than Twitch’s company slogan, branded by emojis. Rather, it proffers Twitch as a vital case study on why social reproduction and feminist theories are integral to deepening our understanding of platform work, in and beyond the home.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, we chart the multiple conflicts between stakeholders in the pursuit of a common standard for fact-checking outside Western Industrialized Educated Rich and Educated (WEIRD) countries, a problem that sits at the center of the institutional mission of fact-checkers as watchdogs of politicians and enforcers of content moderation. We apply reflexive thematic analysis to a set of interviews with 37 fact-checking experts from 35 organizations in 27 countries to catalogue the methods employed by fact-checkers and the pressures they contend with in non-WEIRD countries. In contrast to the one-size-fits-all approach to community guidelines implemented by social platforms worldwide, our results show that the asymmetric relationship with platform companies compels fact-checkers to adjust their methods and strategies to account for the political and cultural dimensions driving mis- and disinformation in their local contexts. Our findings detail three ways through which social platforms impinge on the scope, values, and institutional mission of non-WEIRD fact-checking organizations. As we argue, the platformization of non-WEIRD fact-checkers entails a convoluted process in which social media platforms gradually nudge fact-checkers into becoming part of the content moderation industry, a shift that runs counter to the democracy-building values underpinning the fact-checking movement. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and recommendations for content moderation both in WEIRD and non-WEIRD contexts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While social media platforms continue to dominate the ways in which people connect using computational devices and digital media, a transition towards more immersive platforms and experiences is underway. Extended reality (XR) is the umbrella term for media that enable experiences in augmented, mixed, and virtual reality. Through XR technologies, new digital spaces are being developed that combine features of existing digital platforms with elements of the immersiveness of gaming, sometimes referred to informally as ‘the metaverse’. Notably, many of the corporations behind the dominant social media platforms are active in the XR economy. Meta has garnered much attention in this regard, but Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Sony have all either entered the market or have been reported as having XR/metaverse ambitions. Through a multiple-case study of three companies—Meta, Epic Games/Unity Engine and ROBLOX—this paper maps out key dimensions of the emerging metaverse economy and shows how the platform characteristics of XR providers, similar to the current social media economy, can enable the concentration of social and economic power around a few actors. We propose that in the transition to a more immersive digital era, to enable a competitive, vibrant and fair XR economy, policymaking and governance must proactively address the issue of concentrated platform power. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential policy and regulatory pathways for taking up this challenge.</jats:p>",

Yet, non-formal and informal educational arrangements are increasingly considered relevant to tackle those inequalities, specifically when it comes digitalised societies (Jeong et al. 2018). Non-formal educational providers increasingly target marginalised youth to reduce educational inequalities.\n\nHowever, those programmes have scarcely been researched. The question emerges, whether non-formal digitialised educational arrangements succeed at enabling educational participation of marginalised youth.\n\nIn comparing two non-formal educational institutions, the research project “DILABoration” identifies conditions under which marginalised youth are able to profit off of those providers’ programmes and reconstructs them on a subjective level. In an ethnographic and reconstructive approach, a) different conditions in non-formal educational arrangements, b) learning and educational processes, specifically respective digital media use as well as c) the accessibility of participation within those arrangements are being investigated from a marginalised youths’ perspective.\n\nIn order to empirically reconstruct the mechanisms of educational participation, the participants’ and employees’ practices within those arrangements are examined through participatory observation and videography. The data is analysed through Grounded Theory Methodology (Strauss/Corbin) as well as Artefact Analysis (Lueger / Froschauer 2018). Situational Analysis (Clarke/Washburn/Friese 2018) is applied in order to visualise constellations and relations between different human and non-human entities. Additionally, group discussions with non-participants of the programmes help identifying conditions that enable or constrain participation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Unsatisfied with the black-boxing of algorithmic governance and platform governance on YouTube more generally, creators have begun to seek accountability through other means, deploying their skills, audiences, and situated knowledge to investigate the platform’s operations. This paper examines a phenomenon we term $2 , or the use of publicity via content creation to reveal failures, oversights, or harmful policies on a platform. We analyzed 250 videos featuring issues of platform accountability following a grounded theory approach. Our results revealed that most videos calling out the platform took the form of vlogs that were negative in tone towards YouTube, or a mix of negative and positive. YouTube itself was the actor most targeted for accountability, but automated systems, other creators, YouTube employees, and even former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki were all prominently cited. Most complaints were aimed at YouTube’s policies, lack of communication, or perceived bias against creators of certain demographics or who made undesirable types of content. Claims of censorship were also prominent, as were frustrations with YouTube’s appeals process and the cultural disconnect between YouTube users and YouTube corporate. Publicizing problems with the platform in a way that draws attention from audiences, news media, and fellow creators represents one of the most important ways YouTubers can participate in platform governance. Our study outlines the primary methods they use to do so and the reasons that motivate them to engage in user-generated accountability.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>User biography sections on digital social platforms (hereafter described as “user bios” or “bios”) are spaces for account holders to take narrative ownership in communicating their identities to other users and interlocutors. Online platforms, such as social media, are increasingly used as community hubs for disabled groups, and especially for autistic people (Author; Author; Sins Invalid, 2019). We focus on #Autisktok, one of many enclaves for autistic community building and cultural production on TikTok. Through a critical/cultural qualitative thematic analysis of #Autisktok user bios, we assess how the user bio mediates self-advocacy, agency, and autistic-centered knowledges on #Autisktok. To investigate how autistic TikTokers use their profile’s bio section as a space for “restorying” mainstream discourses about autism and agency, we draw upon M. Remi Yergeau’s (2018) work on autism and neuroqueer rhetorics and Arseli Dokumacı’s (2023) theory of micro-activist affordances, extending these frameworks toward the digital. We pose the following research questions: How do autistic youth use the bio section on TikTok to (re)story autism diagnosis? What is the user bio’s role in creating a supportive enclave for other autistic creators, users, and activists on the TikTok platform? Three themes emerged from our analysis: the explicit use of autism in the user bio, autism and intersecting identities, and the bio as a space for asserting agentic autistic selfhood.</jats:p>",

This panel is dedicated to bringing these two significant threads of digital memory studies research into concerted conversation by drawing on complementary case studies of the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these projects examine how networked digital media interface with experiences of temporality, playing a fundamental role in shaping how the COVID-19 crisis is remembered and researched over time. This panel incorporates four projects that examine the relationship between crisis, memory, and digital media across complementary temporal and structural considerations. In conversation, these projects present reflections spanning personal and institutional pandemic memories; crisis time scales; and visual, sonic, and infrastructural media. Ultimately, this panel underscores the interconnectedness of crisis and temporality in digital memory studies, inviting conversation on mediated memories of disruptive events constructed research participants and researchers themselves.</jats:p>",

The papers in this panel examine this claim and wrestle with its potential implications. Drawing on case studies and data from the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, we evaluate the current state of play in the online push-and-pull between feminist speech about gender-based violence and its attendant misogynistic backlashes. Using a range of different qualitative methods, these papers unpack the orientations towards visibility and transparency that urge survivors into ever-increasing degrees of exposure online; the way that digital media are reconfiguring the gender and racial politics of doubt and believability; the algorithmic pathways through which boys and men are ushered towards increasingly more radical “manosphere” content and communities; and how the problem of “believability” as it relates to testimonies of assault is being complicated and compounded online by networked misogynoir. The result is an ambivalent portrait of the afterlife of #MeToo on the internet, and some important questions for networked feminist activism going forward.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dark design (also known as deceptive design; Colin et al., 2018 and dark patterns; Mathur et al., 2019) is evidenced by “a user interface carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they might not otherwise do” (Brignull, 2022; page 1). Much dark design is constructed with monetization as the primary goal- even in spaces without ecommerce design (e.g., free-to-play apps representing &gt;95% of all mobile apps; Fitton et al. 2021). Many recent dark design strategies are also oriented towards collecting user information. Concerns about children’s vulnerability to inappropriate online marketing and economic fraud, and the impact of organisational data collection upon children’s privacy are increasing (European Commission, 2022; OECD, 2011; OFCOM, 2022). Regulators have begun to recognize, challenge, and fine deceptive design practices aimed at children (e.g., $245 million Epic Games settlement; FTC 2022), however, the scope and extent of dark design practices is such that regulators alone cannot safeguard children from such practices. Parents, who are widely understood to be primarily responsible for children’s online experiences, and children themselves, need to be mindful of and resistant to dark design practices in online spaces. With this in mind, this paper explores the following questions:\n\n(a) What is the influence of dark design (1) across mediums (e.g., apps, video games, social media platforms, websites) and (2) across differently-aged children?\n\n(b) To what extent are parents aware of their children’s exposure to dark design and the risks such exposure poses?\n\n(c) How effective are marketplace and regulatory controls?</jats:p>",

    "title": "REPARATIVE MEDIA: REVOLUTIONARY STORYTELLING AND ITS ENEMIES IN A STREAMING ERA",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>How do we challenge a streaming “golden age” characterized by the ceaseless production of expression that repeats and reinforces injustice and inequality? Our media and tech systems prioritize developing stories and platforms to target distinct audiences for profit, but our communities need to cultivate interdependence and solidarity. Healing these injustices, including racism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, classism, ableism, and other forms of hate, requires a specific method of repair: re-distributing power more equitably to the historically disempowered.\n\nIn the last decade in the U.S., what Aymar Jean Christian terms “reparative media,” responding to the social upheaval that political polarization, misinformation, and climate and racial reckoning has burgeoned. Christian writes, “[R]epairing our culture means healing how we make media, how we connect through technology, and how we generate knowledge.” This panel analyzes the concept of reparative media, examines case studies, and analyzes counterrevolutionary pushback. Grounded in U.S. experience, the panel is designed to open a conversation more widely, and create terms under which these issues can be engaged elsewhere.\n\nUnlike previous eras, this era’s reparative media work is grounded in responses to the realities of a digital culture shaped by mega-platforms and instant reaction times. In audio-visual media, streamers (building upon past example in broadcast and cable) have funded or showcased extractive and exploitative programming, such as much of true crime, reality shows, and unapologetically offensive comedy. Scandals about ethics—Yazidi women protesting invasion of privacy in the documentary Sabaya, MENASA filmmakers protesting errors and putting participants at risk in Jihad Rehab, BIPOC filmmakers protesting the all-white, male production crew for a forthcoming film about BIPOC sports star Tiger Woods--have multiplied. The reparative media movement is also informed, in the U.S., by the tide of racial reckoning since 2014. This movement has also been joined by other minoritized voices, including those of people living with disabilities, gender-nonconforming makers, and those experiencing consequences of lacking appropriate immigration status.\n\nHowever, the reparative work also builds upon efforts in previous eras in self-styled movements for alternative media, community media, public-service media, and activist media. These movements were accompanied by extensive communications research—much of it done in a collaborative way with practitioners—that allows us to understand today’s reparative media in context. These movements have shared common expectations that media produced by and for underheard members of society are essential parts of movements for social change.\n\nThe panel provides both theoretical and practice-oriented roads into the discussion, which we expect to be between a third and a half of the time allotted. Panelists also strive to provide examples and illustrations relevant to the conference venue of Philadelphia.\n\nThe first speaker will address the concepts of reparative media and reparative research and development. Reparative research is work that is not only about but with reparative media communities, using both quantitative and qualitative research. Reparative story development is about the practice of developing narratives that confront, challenge, and provide alternatives to systemically oppressive storytelling. Reparative platform development is the work of building training, distribution and showcasing alternatives to today’s digital mega-platforms. This presentation will use case studies to illustrate the three categories.\n\nThe second speaker will use a cultural-production analysis to focus upon reparative story development practices, looking closely at a two-year process to create standards for values-driven documentary production, a process triggered in part by alarm at streamer fecklessness. The process, which itself included reparative research, is analyzed for its challenges as well as its conclusions. Reception within the documentary community of the resulting document, a values-based framework for a six-part production process, is discussed, as is engagement by gatekeepers such as streamers, broadcasters and production companies. The presentation then focuses on attacks, benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy from centrist mainstream media, that leverage a conservative activists’ invocation on of “woke cancel culture,” to demonize the assertion of such values.\n\nThe third speaker will address reparative platform development. In the U.S., community media centers, based in cable systems and offering educational, governmental, and public access channels, have their origins in 1970s citizen activism. But CMCs have shown an ability not only to survive but to reinvent themselves both technologically and in terms of community reparative work. The paper focuses on one such example, in Philadelphia, where communities of color have been actively working to address systemic harms and bolster community strength with hyperlocal media. In discussing the work of creating content for such systems, the paper also reveals the infrastructural affordances and limitations mediamakers encounter. Such forces reveal the systemic forces that threaten the evolution of such media.\n\nThe discussant, with deep experience in reparative research in the Philadelphia media community and nationally, will infuse their commentary with location-specific references. Finally, panelists will provide in closing a brief, slideshow mini-tour of Philadelphia sites of reparative media work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Clubhouse has attracted roughly 10 million users to its platform since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic as an invite-only, drop-in audio social network app. Yet, few studies examine Clubhouse as a new platform for conducting social media research, and even fewer examine the early invite-only growth of social audio apps. This study theorizes Clubhouse as an emerging social media platform during the COVID pandemic, and empirically investigates its communicative capacity, networked connections, and social dynamics. The primary contribution is a social network analysis of Clubhouse’s early users, wherein segmented networked publics based on invite links emerge. While some researchers explain that the growth of invite-only social networks is often attributed to a platform’s ‘cool factor,’ the growth of the early Clubhouse network reveals a hierarchy of social exclusivity among the networked publics, which indicates an embedded capitalist social structure and connection that grants more access to those with more social and economic power. These networked relationships provide insights into how invite-based emerging viral social media platforms are formed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates how social media users advocate for women's issues in China, focusing on the activism against menstrual shaming on the social media platform Xiaohongshu, a culturally significant but understudied platform used primarily by women. With women accounting for 90.41% of active users, Xiaohongshu provides a unique social media environment that shapes the way users engage with feminist issues. However, despite the growing literature on digital feminism in China and the surging popularity and significance of Xiaohongshu in the Chinese social media ecosystem, no studies so far have examined the feminist activism on this platform.\n\nOur study contributes to this gap by exploring the discourse around menstrual shaming on Xiaohongshu, as a lens into the dynamics of activism on this female-oriented platform. Analyzing 329 posts and 10,336 comments under the hashtag #StopMenstrualShaming on Xiaohongshu, our study foregrounds the salient role of Xiaohongshu in helping women express their feminist values in an online space that they perceive as safe and intimate. In doing so, we employ the conceptual framework of hashtag activism, which refers to the development and spread of online activism with tangible results in the physical and digital worlds. Shining a spotlight on this significant but understudied platform, we illuminate the dynamics of Chinese digital feminism, especially the formation of solidarity, relatability and collective identity on a female-oriented social media platform.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines crackdowns on queer content on TikTok and creative responses of content creators to circumvent biased content moderation and cisheteronormative censorship. The first portion of the paper demonstrates TikTok’s recurrent cisheteronormative biases in content moderation decisions and examines select instances of LGBTQ+ content that has been censored on the platform. It also works to situate this within a broader trend of LGBTQ+ censorship across internet platforms. The second portion of the paper examines how LGBTQ+ TikTok users have built up folk knowledges and intuitive understandings of TikTok’s blackboxed algorithms and opaque content moderation policies, situating this discussion within theories of the ‘algorithmic imaginary’. It catalogs the myriad ways that TikTok users work to circumvent LGBTQ+ censorship on the platform (e.g. by tactically obscuring key words in both speech and text and obscuring body parts and scenes). In the final portion of the paper, I draw on the concept of ‘cruising’ and other constitutive silences of LGBTQ+ existence to show how LGBTQ+ users are particularly well suited to producing folk knowledge about blackboxed algorithms. In closing, I examine the affordances and the limitations of LGBTQ+ users’ approach to navigating platform governance – and content moderation practices more specifically – as well as call for more organized and collective action in search of more permanent changes towards LGBTQ+-friendly platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper thus aims to contribute to media, communication, and digital technology studies by proposing a more systematic conceptualization of digital resistance. While the notion of resistance in relation to technology is often connoted negatively and associated the rejection of innovation of change, our approach to digital resistance takes here a new meaning: political and critical. Indeed, the notion of digital resistance is often used in academia and public discourse to describe practices of using, subverting, and creating technologies, usually in a progressive and anti-oppressive perspective (Russell, 2005).\n\nHowever, the term is still relatively undefined, and many practices could be categorized as digital resistance if the term was better defined. We propose in this paper a preliminary but formal conceptualization of digital resistance. Our theorization takes place in the context of a research project on the cartography of digital resistance. Different data collection and analysis activities will be implemented to have a wide and panoramic empirical view of the phenomenon of digital resistance. In this project, the cartographic approach takes on a dual meaning, namely a broad and systematic description of a phenomenon, and the implementation of an original digital device allowing its visualization and potentially participatory enrichment. Our preliminary empirical mapping identified six dimensions to analyze digital resistance that we will present in this paper.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While artificial intelligence (AI) enabled systems have shown impressive accuracy in detecting harmful content online, they are still not perfect and do not take into account the perspective of children in their design. The development of AI systems heavily relies on large datasets for training, and creating such datasets involves annotating vast amounts of data. Studies that involve children in dataset development also have their challenges, such as the possibility of re-traumatisation. Therefore, ethical considerations must be taken into account, such as obtaining informed consent, conducting design sessions with children and young people, and addressing implicit and explicit biases in AI filtering, profiling, and surveillance systems. It is crucial to involve children and young people in the design of AI systems that filter content to ensure ethical considerations are met. In this article we discuss the ethical concerns in AI development with children and young people, and also possible techniques that help mitigate such concerns.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A vlog or videoblog is a series of videos that feature someone speaking to the camera to present entertainment, reflection, opinion, or education. Collaborative vlogs (CVLs) involve multiple people taking joint ownership of a vlog through asynchronous interaction, discussion, and expression. This paper explores how online video helped create communities of practice both within the classroom and beyond through developing connections with each other that extended their interactions from the classroom to the Internet. Additionally, they creatively explored new ways to express themselves, developed their identities, and discussed pertinent topics regarding music, technology, and education. To explore the sociological vectors of culture and identity, I adapted a framework of aliveness within communities of practice developed by Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder (2002) to analyze seven semesters of student reflections on CVL projects in music courses that serviced music education majors, elementary education majors, and students from a variety of majors. Through CVLs, students have explored mediated musical practices and shared their lives and experiences in ways that classmates and instructors do not get to see when limited to the classroom. Students and vloggers alike deal with issues of trust within our digital society, and by critically analyzing how the participants in this study developed relationships with each other and me as their instructor, we can better understand how to move forward in the classroom and through social media, video broadcasting sites, and blogging. While the participants in this study were music students, CVLs can be applied to any discipline.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked online discussion in unprecedented\n        volumes, as citizens use social media to share their opinions and concerns regarding the\n        prevention measures, for instance. Much of such activity takes place under real names on\n        popular platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. However, parallel to these platforms more\n        anonymous spaces remain and flourish, including completely anonymous services such as\n        Secret.ly and Ask.fm, or pseudonymized services such as Reddit. This study focuses on\n        Covid-19 related discussion on mobile social media platform Jodel, an anonymous-by-design\n        social media application that allows messaging users who are geographically close. In this\n        paper, we explore discussions about the Covid-19 pandemic on Jodel in Helsinki, Finland,\n        through the theoretical notion of affective discipline. Our data is collected during a\n        virtual, mobile ethnography that followed the discussions on the #corona channel in Jodel in\n        Helsinki during 2020-21. We argue that the anonymity of Jodel provided its users a space to\n        discuss the restrictive measures in a more relaxed manner than real-name-based social media.\n        This also endows the conversations with deeper and different affective attunement than what\n        public discussion would. While the discussions contain moral judgments, they were also rife\n        with humor, irony and distanced spectatorship of the ongoing pandemic, resonating with the\n        carnivalistic discussion cultures of other anonymous and pseudonymous platforms. We argue\n        that anonymous and ephemeral platforms like Jodel, where identities and histories are\n        nonexistent, bring out the affective dynamics of online discussions, and the related forces\n        that assemble and disassemble communities.</jats:p>",

Such global scaling and granular infiltration of algorithmic-powered management of labour and urban dynamics are achieved through efforts to datafy and visualise cities, making them intelligible under a unified vision. While workers on the ground precariously move across territories, Uber’s engineering teams invest in abstract and disembodied views of the city. Taking Uber’s knowledge production about cities as an object of inquiry, this paper explores the epistemic dimensions of platformisation, delving into platforms' technical and narrative reliance on datafication. Through the analysis of 41 publications on Uber Engineering Blog (UEB), it delves into Uber's textual and visual data stories on knowing cities, highlighting the contrast between a lively community of practitioners and industry, and the neglect in acknowledging platform workers' labour and needs.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While upending domestic and global news media’s advertising income streams via the provision of superior “commercial datafication” (Mansell, 2021) and “digital tracking and profiling” (Christl, 2017) functionalities, Multinational Platform Corporations (MNPCs) have also implemented opaque strategies to minimize their domestic and global tax liabilities. These strategies have been an important contributor to both Meta and Alphabet’s surging profits over the past decade – from US$1.5b for Meta in 2013, to $39b in 2023 and, for Google, now listed as part of parent company Alphabet, from a US$12.73b profit in 2013 to US$74b in 2023. These spectacular levels of profitability have been achieved despite a proliferation of local and some transnational ‘diverted profits tax’ laws (Colbran, E., &amp; Farhat, S, 2023; Dunne, 2016) designed to prevent companies from shifting revenue from high-tax countries to ‘low or no tax’ jurisdictions. MNPCs have been able to not just continue to transform the majority of their revenue into \"stateless” income (Kleinbard, 2016), which is not taxed in the country where the income is generated nor, often, even in the country where the corporation is headquartered, but to get better at this and other forms of tax avoidance, via improving both their ability to strategically “navigate institutional complexity” (Kornelakis, A., &amp; Hublart, P. (2022) and, as this paper argues, to shape national and transnational discourses about their strategies. In both Canada and Australia, these strategies continue to allow the deflecting of public and political pressure to support (or mitigate the disruption to) local news ecosystems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The notion of digital sovereignty has been mobilized by various stakeholders as a response to platform power. In the last decades, the concept of sovereignty has been applied mainly to State responses to exert power over other sectors and organizations. Therefore, the meanings of digital sovereignty have also been used and disputed by social movements, workers and indigenous communities. But the platform companies also entered into disputes about the meanings of this multifaceted notion. As an update of Californian Ideology, platform companies modulate their discourse to say that they are also concerned with issues of sovereignty. Thus, they are reappropriating the meanings of sovereignty through the launch of programs focused on sovereignty. We named this \"Big Tech sovereignty\", a provocation to mean how platforms have changed the meanings of sovereignty based on their own interests, such as the renewal of discourses in the context of \"Silicon Valley dystopianism\". Built on analyzes of sovereignty programs of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet/Google, this article argues that \"Big Tech sovereignty\" is a way of trying to deflate the concept politically, giving it only a commercial and/or personal framework, being more of an expression of the platform power. Through the analysis of these “digital sovereignty” programs, the article demonstrates how companies framed “sovereignty-as-a-service”, especially in terms of digital infrastructures.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ANALYSING NEWS POLARISATION: FROM PRODUCTION TO ENGAGEMENT AND BEYOND",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Political polarisation – at the level of individual issues or broader ideologies, and expressed through differences of opinion on policies, divergent affective attachments, contrary interpretations of available information, or distinct patterns of interaction with other partisans – is necessarily always closely related to the information that individuals and groups engage with as they form and reinforce their own opinions about a given issue or topic, and contest the views of others. News in all its forms, from legacy to emerging, and mainstream to fringe media, continues to play a particularly important role in such information diets, but news coverage can itself be polarised and polarising.\n\nThis panel addresses polarisation in and by the news through a series of papers that examine the various stages of the news production and engagement process. Drawing on innovative methods and novel datasets, these five papers offer new perspectives on the patterns and dynamics that affect news quality, news distribution, news engagement, and news fact-checking in digital and social media environments. In combination, they offer a new and comprehensive overview of how we might further investigate news polarisation in contemporary contexts.\n\nPaper 1 assesses polarisation in news coverage. Centred on the issue of climate change, it investigates patterns of news coverage across the media landscape in Australia – a country which has been particularly severely affected by extreme climate events in recent years. The paper highlights the challenges in accessing full-text news content at scale, and utilises a novel combination of manual and computational content coding techniques to investigate the patterns of news polarisation across four dimensions.\n\nPaper 2 investigates what sources of news are frequently recommended to users of prominent search engine Google News. Drawing on a long-term data donation project in Australia, the paper reviews the range of sources recommended for a variety of political and controversial search queries, and assesses the breadth of the political spectrum that these prominent recommendations represent. It also examines whether such patterns differ across individual queries or broader topic categories.\n\nPaper 3 shifts our attention to the sharing of news content on social media platforms. Drawing on long-term, large-scale datasets from Facebook and Twitter, it analyses the sharing of links to Australian news sources during 2022, and thereby reveals patterns of interactional and interpretive polarisation. These may be related to the political alignment of users and outlets, but also to news quality and other factors.\n\nPaper 4 takes a network approach to the study of news sharing on Twitter in Germany. Assessing the topical content of links to German news shared during one month in 2023, and the political affinities of the users sharing these links, the study finds marked differences between the sharing practices and patterns of left-leaning, conservative, and far-right users, as well as between sharing practices on different topics.\n\nFinally, Paper 5 closes the loop by examining the role perceptions of political fact-checkers, and their potential to contribute polarisation or depolarisation. Drawing on a series of interviews with staff in Australian fact-checking organisations, it provides a deep insight into their self-understanding, especially with respect to the extent and limitations of their impact on polarised debates in society.\n\nIn combination, then, these five papers address questions of news polarisation throughout the stages of the journalistic process from news production to distribution and engagement all the way to the critical scrutiny of political statements reported in the news. Overall, they make substantial new conceptual, methodological, and empirical contributions to the study of news polarisation. Extended abstracts for all five papers are included in the submission.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The algorithmic and individualised nature of advertising on social media - and the intentionally opaque and unobservable design of advertising algorithms - makes them difficult to study. We turn to participatory methods, working with 204 young Australians as 'citizen scientists' to collect 5169 screenshots of 'unhealthy' advertising on social media. Through SMS chat over a one week period, we engaged our participants in 'algorithmic gossip' to theorise why certain ads appeared on their feeds, how the algorithms serving ads worked, and what they thought about them. Some believed ‘the algorithm’ accurately targeted ads based on their interests and behaviors, while others felt these algorithms 'missed the mark'. Participants theorised the impact of search histories, friendship networks, interests, time of day/week/year, location, age, gender, and more in how advertising algorithms worked. Our study revealed complexities in participants' perceptions of ad targeting and how algorithms function. We highlight the need for greater transparency and regulation regarding advertising on social media, especially concerning unhealthy industries. Participants expressed concerns about manipulative and intrusive advertising practices, emphasising the importance of platform responsibility and centering young people's expertise in discussions on advertising regulation.</jats:p>",

    "title": "READY TO HACK: HOW BUG BOUNTY PLATFORMS CREATE THEIR WORKFORCE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Bug bounty platforms are becoming a standard solution for detecting vulnerabilities in an increasingly complex networked economy. Serving as intermediaries between organizations and ethical hackers, they crowdsource offensive information security and show significant improvements in the detection of vulnerabilities.\n\nIn some sense, they can be likened to platforms of the gig economy. However, they stand out in one major regard: they do not have a pre-existing workforce. While platforms of the gig economy can rely on unqualified, often migrant, workers eager to earn the little money it provides, bug hunting platforms require highly qualified workers in a field where formal training is often lacking. This pushes bug bounty platforms to not only serve as intermediaries, but to also actively create the workforce they need.\n\nThis paper discusses the efforts needed for the establishment of such a labor supply. Four key requirements are identified. First, the workers are required to undergo proper training. The platforms thus design educational tools aimed at ensuring a skilled workforce. Second, bug hunting must be routinised. A precise set of actions, as well as standard software is suggested that largely automate the job. This allows for efficient vulnerability detection. Third, platforms must ensure competition among bug hunters in order to secure a loyal workforce. To this end, they will design gamification schemes, made of rewards and rankings. Fourth, platforms seek to embed bug hunting into formal careers. By building alliances with the industry, higher education institutions, or the army, they make bug hunting economically appealing.</jats:p>",

Drawing from primary data collected during the lobbying campaign in April-May 2023, the study analyzes platform ads, search engine recommendations, and direct user communications.\n\nThe findings reveal systematic violations of platform policies, including unlabelled political ads and exploitation of exclusive platform affordances unavailable to competitors. Digital platforms leveraged their market dominance and technological tools, aligning with far-right disinformation narratives while mobilizing public opposition under the guise of protecting user interests. These practices highlight the misuse of economic power and self-regulation to resist oversight, emphasizing the need for stricter accountability measures.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Play-to-earn (P2E) games targeting users unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies are playing a key role within the industries known as blockchain, crypto or Web3. P2E gaming guilds (Elliott, 2021) are emerging as essential intermediaries bridging Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Drawing from social network theory’s study of brokerage motivations, this paper examines the structure and communication practices of a P2E guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG) on Twitter. Through a computational analysis of YGG’s presence on Twitter, the paper compares two mention networks corresponding to a period of optimism, and a period of crisis. We used network analysis to examine the structure of YGG communication on Twitter (Rathnayake, 2023), analysed tweets using BERTopic topic modeling (Grootendorst, 2022), and extracted links to determine what information is shared within the network (Hoyng, 2023). The results demonstrate YGG’s role as a “cultural broker” (Foster &amp; Ocejo, 2015) promoting the adoption of blockchain technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ideologies (Swartz, 2017), ascribing legitimacy and value to particular actors and products in the Web3 ecosystem. The topic lists highlight prominent communication practices related to community building, such as AMA (ask me anything) sessions and airdrops.</jats:p>",

It views digital banking apps as platforms that enable personalised interactions (Poell, Nieborg, and van Dijck, 2019), and aim to investigate the datafication (van Dijck, 2014; Sadowski, 2019) and platformisation of banking. This approach underscores the transformation of service dynamics and the challenges brought by digital banking concerning public accessibility and social inclusion (Swartz, 2020). We ask: a) What are the dominant imaginaries of payment reflected by contemporary financial services? and b) How do the design and affordances of digital payment services impact trust, responsibility, and user labour?\n\nThis paper employs a modified walkthrough method (Light, Burgess, and Duguay, 2018) including detailed content analysis of the Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs) documents required for initial access to seven digital banking apps in Ireland. The sampled banking apps include Bank of Ireland (BOI), N26, An Post Money, Revolut IE, Chase UK, Starling Bank UK, and Klarna. The modified walkthroughs highlight a significant convergence between the finance and media industries. Our analysis identified three dominant social imaginaries of payment leading to different designs for digital banking apps: a) the Institutional Imaginary, b) the Transactional Imaginary, and c) the Digital Imaginary.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research explores the tensions in the work of an Iranian diasporic feminist campaign and the techno-social affordances of social media and data-driven platforms for (lack of) recognition and (in)visibility of feminist activism. Situating this study within the sociopolitical context of diasporic feminist activism, I look at the 2017-2018 #WhiteWednesdays hashtag campaign on X, launched by a New York-based journalist and women’s rights advocate, which invited women to post photos of themselves walking unveiled or wearing White headscarves. This campaign, using the Orientalist trope of the veil and aligned with imperial feminist discourses (Ahmed, 1992), gained heightened visibility in popular media, particularly American mainstream news. The research draws upon datafied recognition and visibility (Campanella, 2022) to explore how the campaign’s practices are distributed, under which logics, and with what consequences. I employ digital ethnography and trace the campaign’s life on Twitter and in Farsi-speaking sponsored popular outlets and the American mainstream news to argue how liking, retweeting, sharing, and commenting are social media practices implicated in the platform’s dynamics of recognition, attention, and visibility. These practices imply a particular type of sociability marked by the process of datafication, heavily influenced by high demands for branding and personal visibility, commodifying the suffering of the Other women, transforming violence and injustice into spectacles that generate profit, and erasing the voices from the margins. Yet, such regimes of visibility (Campanella, 2024) are also ambivalent. They can simultaneously go either way: inclusion and exclusion, visibility and erasure, co-optation and resistance, imperialist and radical.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), often hailed as a transformative force, has become an ambivalent buzzword, simultaneously promising utopian possibilities and fueling dystopian anxieties. Social media platforms have emerged as pivotal spaces where the public narrative about AI takes shape, especially through content creators, significantly influencing our collective vision of the future with AI. Therefore, this paper inquires into the role of creators in shaping public imaginaries of AI through their AI content. The paper is based on TikTok as a site of entrance for investigating the role of creators in shaping ongoing discourses around AI through short video content. To understand the role of creators within this ongoing AI discourse, a hashtag network analysis is paired with a critical discourse analysis of creators’ AI content. The preliminary results show three dominant genres of AI content based on 1) AI tools output, especially visual content, 2) listicles on AI tools for different tasks, and 3) educational and critical AI content. Considering the creator types behind the content, a high amount of content is produced by content farms followed by tech TokTokers. Media outlets and commentary TikTokers dominate the third content section. Overall, four types of AI imaginaries are foregrounded. AI mystification envisions AI as fast-paced and inherently life-changing. Similarly, AI futuristic content makes AI out as inevitable. Contrastingly, a high AI pragmatism is prevalent in the ongoing tool discourse, while critical and educational content counteracts these imaginaries with a strong AI realism highlighting the complex and nuanced aspect of AI.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Algorithmic content moderation is becoming a common practice employed by many social media platforms to regulate ‘toxic’ language and to promote democratic public conversations. This paper provides a normative critique of politically liberal assumption of civility embedded in algorithmic moderation, illustrated by Google’s Perspective API. From a radical democratic standpoint, this paper normatively and empirically distinguishes between incivility and intolerance because they have different implications for democratic discourse. The paper recognises the potential political, expressive, and symbolic values of incivility, especially for the socially marginalised. We, therefore, argue against regulation of incivility using AI. There are, however, good reasons to regulate hate speech but it is incumbent upon the users of AI moderation to show that this can be done reliably. The paper emphasises the importance of detecting diverse forms of hate speech that convey intolerant and exclusionary ideas without using explicitly hateful or extremely emotional wording. The paper then empirically evaluates the performance of the current algorithmic moderation to see whether it can discern incivility and intolerance and whether it can detect diverse forms of intolerance. Empirical findings reveal that the current algorithmic moderation does not promote democratic discourse, but rather deters it by silencing the uncivil but pro-democratic voices of the marginalised as well as by failing to detect intolerant messages whose meanings are embedded in nuances and rhetoric. New algorithmic moderation should focus on the reliable and transparent identification of hate speech and be in line with the feminist, anti-racist, and critical theories of democratic discourse.</jats:p>",

We explain growth drivers, innovation strategies and show how they favour the buyer, which has created tensions in the operation of the platform.

Drawing on 9-month multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork, we document workers’ everyday working practices and challenges and harms under the guise of achieving extreme levels of technical precision demanded by the clients and ML practitioners. We introduce the notion of precision labor, referring to the hidden work involved in erasing the messy, ambiguous, and uncertain aspects of technology production, all in the pursuit of presenting technology as objective, truthful, and high-quality. This notion provides a lens to understand the disproportionate impact of unnecessary and unrecognized labor on digital labor communities within AI production and the emerging harms on them, such as financial precarity and machine subordination. It joins existing work on the prevailing values in ML communities, questions the legitimacy and sustainability of the pursuit of performative accuracy, and calls for enhanced reflexivity and timely intervention.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the digital age, platforms such as Twitter foster the emergence of fragmented issue-based communities online, intersecting with traditional media and broader national discourse. However, these digital public spheres often deviate from idealised concepts like those proposed by Habermas, showcasing uncivil discourse and participatory disparities. Recent research highlights a subset of hyperactive users on Twitter who monopolise discussions on contentious topics like abortion, perpetuating intolerance and incivility.\n\nDrawing on social psychological theories of social identity as discursive constructions, this study investigates how hyperactive uncivil and intolerant Twitter users present their identities. Analysing over 30,000 accounts, researchers scrutinise psycholinguistic patterns and emoji usage to answer two key questions: How do these hyperactive users describe their identities compared to non-hyperactive ones, and who are the verified, influencer accounts driving uncivil and intolerant discourse on abortion?\n\nThe findings reveal distinct identity markers among hyperactive users compared to non-hyperactive ones. Notably, hyperactive uncivil and intolerant users display varied discursive identifications, often aligning with religious, partisan, and familial affiliations rather than directly addressing abortion-related identities like pro-choice or pro-life. Furthermore, there's a notable dominance of pro-life social identity in online discourse, potentially influencing online public opinion despite being a minority in national surveys.\n\nThis research sheds light on the intricate relationship between discursive social identities and their hyperactive behaviours in Twitter issue publics. This study also contributes to our understanding of the key hyperactive actors in American Twitterspheres and beyond, driving incivility and intolerance in abortion discourse.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE PHOTOJOURNALISTIC GIF: VISUAL JOURNALISM IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA ERA",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, visual journalism has embraced a new form of storytelling alongside photographs and videos: the photographic GIF (graphics interchange format). Despite its association with humor on social media, the GIF has unexpectedly become a legitimate tool for documenting disasters and tragedies in online news. This challenges the traditional solemn tone of journalism, as the GIF's short, repetitive, and silent nature is reminiscent of humorous content rather than serious news representation.\n\nPhotojournalism traditionally utilizes still images and videos for narrative storytelling, each having distinct characteristics and narrative possibilities. In contrast, the photographic GIF emerges as a hybrid format, combining photography and film elements. Its unique attribute of the looped movement stands in overt contrast with conventional news formats but reflects the transformations in visual news production following the widespread use of smartphones and social media. These changes shifted news consumption habits and have caused news organizations to adopt new designs and forms for online news outlets.\n\nThis research focuses on the photographic GIF as a new visual form in online news, particularly in representing tragic events. It uses semiotic visual analysis and interviews with senior online news editors to explore the uses, meanings, and editorial considerations behind GIF production in newsrooms. The findings reveal the GIF's expansion beyond its initial contexts, demonstrating its legitimacy in the journalistic sphere and uncovering its means of conveying informative and traumatic content. The research underscores how the digital journalism industry adapts to the contemporary environment by integrating GIFs into storytelling practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper will scrutinise modes through which social media companies create, disseminate and deliver free digital literacy curriculums to educators, parents, caregivers and users. Following the thought of Norbert Elias, we consider these practices as part of broader attempts to $2 of human groups according to (contingent) values and beliefs, and which serve the capitalist interests of powerful global institutions seeking to inculcate them in doing so. Using Meta’s $2 digital literacy program and Instagram’s $2 as empirical case studies, we ask: What is the specific content of social media curriculums of safe, healthy and educated use? And how do these educational resources inculcate certain habits and manners, for whom, and with what implications? Our findings indicate that the type of digital literacy constructed through these resources is a distinctly responsibilized prospect, operating through self-control, and verified in relation to neoliberal behaviourist ideologies. We argue that by loading the pressure on individuals to protect themselves against the ‘toxicity’ of platforms, social media companies seek to absolve themselves from the responsibility to address the potentially harmful aspects of their services themselves. We argue that this constitutes a performance of corporate responsibility, responding to the criticisms that have been levelled at platforms in recent years, while diverting attention away from the exploitative capitalist logics motivating their operations. In highlighting the cultural, normative and political limits of social media corporate curriculums, our paper ultimately highlights the need to develop alternative critical, creative and independent digital literacies in response.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We offer in-depth theorisation of two multi-site case studies of dying and being dead in Extended Reality (XR) to investigate immersive death experiences facilitated by these media. Our observations, discussion and critique underscore an emergent and nuanced interplay between spatial technologies and death encounters, their linked phenomenological cultural constructions, and the emerging industry that channels these phenomenon. XR are media technologies that mediate digital data with the physical world in real time. Yet, this might take users ‘out' of their surroundings through VR systems that map-but-hide the physical, and replace it with what programmers desire. Or, XR might seemingly add digital artefacts that relate with the physical world via AR systems that have us peering through screens or – arguably, hearing spatial cues (Boisvert et al. 2023), that are computed to fool our senses of what is ‘in’ the real. What – and who – is able to be brought ‘in’ and ‘out’ of the perceived world has significant consequences for the growing industry of necro technologies. Our work then, focuses on two multi-site phenomenological cases within the digital necro-industry: the first, is taking users ‘out’ of the real (usually via VR) to experience death, dying or the dead; and second, bringing death ‘in’ to the physical world via mediations of the dead, death or dying. The paper concludes with a discussion that syntheses our study of industrial trends and phenomenological-technological critique to consider how stakeholders that have hitherto not been invited to compose cultures of XR death-tech might act.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The release of the video game $2 in 2017 ushered in one of the most popular ships that the Legend of Zelda series has seen, that of Sidon and Link. In Breath of the Wild Link travels to the kingdom of the Zora, a race of humanoid fish creatures, and meets their prince, Sidon. Sidon’s charm and enthusiasm for Link resulted in many fans claiming that Sidon was Link’s boyfriend. In the sequel, $2 , fans were faced with a new character, Yona, who was introduced as Sidon’s fiancée, thus contradicting their previous queer readings. However, there were also many subtextually queer moments that provided support for the queer readings of Sidon and Link. What is at stake here is understanding where these queer readings fit in relation to the heteronormative reading that the inclusion of Yona supports. To come closer to this understanding I analyzed examples of queer streamers on Twitch playing through the quest line with Sidon and the queer readings that the streamer and viewers in chat created. I argue that the co-creation of these queer readings is a form of play, allowing fans to change the game so it is satisfying and fulfilling, and thus cannot be separated from the game. Through play, these communities were able to create narratives maintaining Sidon and Link’s romantic relationship that drew on in-game elements to have a satisfying experience with the quest line thus making it a part of the game.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent widespread availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and the extensive records of human activities and behaviour in digital format present serious challenges related to how individuals construct their own identities and social relations. AI systems datafy our body and our sense of self, producing a new cartography of biopower (Foucault, 1982) and a new form of the political economy of subjectivation (Langlois &amp; Elmer, 2019) that treats individuals as objects from which raw material is extracted to produce predictive models that act as our data doubles (Haggerty &amp; Ericson, 2000). Issues such as algorithmic social biases (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), the idealized and pragmatic economic uses of AI (Srnicek, 2017), and the consequent reproduction of already existing power structures by predictive models (Crawford, 2021) have been problematized in the literature. This paper asks what kinds of data and labour mobilization occur in and around the production of predictive models: What political economy and socio-technical conditions are involved in the production of AI? How do these conditions produce predictive models that shape our sense of self and identity? Focusing on Kaggle, a platform for crowdsourcing AI development, I use digital methods and a software studies approach to examine the practices of the data science community on three high-profile machine learning projects and conclude by arguing that machine learning has been thought of and developed as a prediction of the self in order to prescribe individual behaviour to fulfill specific economic conditions.</jats:p>",

Focusing on TikTok’s affordances and cultures of online incivility, this paper studies how TikTok influencers and their audiences maneuver legal-but-harmful humour (Matamoros-Fernández et al., 2023). Specifically, we study how online incivility has become an accepted and negotiated practice in the Filipino context through the phenomenon of ‘dogshows’, where users throw jabs at individuals using derogatory humor and provocative memes. Through online observation and textual analysis of TikTok posts and their corresponding comment sections, we demonstrate how online incivility is subtly amplified through humour and play, and how Gen Z and young children became both objects and producers of these dogshows. We argue that while there is already peer surveillance on TikTok, there needs to be more deliberation between TikTok and at-risk groups to make the platform a more civil space.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The role of digital media platforms as societal actors has been increasingly brought to the fore in recent years. We have also grown to understand how platforms foster actors and media formats not motivated by liberal and democratic norms. Critical scholarship has pointed out the role of platforms in amplifying extreme content and misinformation, allowing for the manipulation of political processes and communication, and intervening in the processes of political communication more broadly. In this study, we focus on the discursive strategies adopted by the platforms to publicize and justify their actions related to electoral and political communication on their services. We ask, how do platform companies articulate elections as a context through which they discursively construct their role and legitimacy as major actors in society? Using a large dataset of corporate blogs from ten platform companies (N=27,616, n=413, years 2006-2022) we show a shift from an opportunity-focused discourse that promotes participation, digital democracy, and politician-citizen interaction to a more defensive discourse stressing companies’ responsible attitude to elections, as evidenced by their transparency efforts, advertising control, fact-checking initiatives, and strategic partnerships. Our findings demonstrate an institutionalization of discourses among the platform companies and highlight their reactive response strategies from feature development to corporate legitimation strategies. The platforms strategically mobilize the empowering participation-focused discourses typically used to describe social media to rebuild their legitimacy and position them as proactive agents in society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2020, the subreddit r/GenderCritical—one of the most active “gender critical” (GC) spaces on Reddit—was banned by the platform for promoting hateful, transphobic conduct. Following the closure of r/GenderCritical (and subsequent banning of dozens of high-profile, transphobic subreddits including r/ActualWomen, r/GenderCriticalSociety, and r/truelesbians), GC users—especially those in North America and Western Europe—migrated to more hidden, invite-only spaces. These included Discord servers as well as (much like alt-right alternative platforms Parler and Truth Social) platforms run by GCs themselves: Spinster.xyz, the short-lived Giggle app, subforums on Mumsnet, and Ovarit—an invite-only forum which imitates Reddit’s architecture launched by former moderators of r/GenderCritical. While we might celebrate the closure of openly hateful communities on major social platforms, a crucial side-effect of the GC dispersal is that their activity has become (following patterns in reactionary political movements online more broadly) increasingly shrouded and insular. In this project, we provide an overview of the current landscape of GC activity on social media as it exists in the post-r/GenderCritical era. We describe how users are “peaked” (the GC equivalent of “redpilled”) and pipelined from algorithmic media platforms into insular and extremist spaces such as Ovarit, Mumsnet, and Discord. We then examine discourse within two popular GC forums, Ovarit and Mumsnet (specifically: Mumsnet’s “Feminism: Sex &amp; gender” board), to identify how these groups circulate disinformation, perform political mythmaking, and construct and reinscribe reactionary identities in the context of GC ideology and extremism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper draws on ethnographic and historical research at two Australian libraries to explore how the platformization of the web has altered the content, character, and potential future utility of web archives. I argue that, in attempting to collect social media, these libraries face a double bind: while web crawling undertaken at the National Library of Australia allows for immediate but often incomplete or inconsistent access, the API-based approach taken by the State Library of New South Wales constrains both the data collected and how it can be made accessible due to a shifting set of rules that are established and enforced by platforms. By examining the constraints of current strategies to collect, preserve, and make available social media content, I illustrate how changes to platform design and policies significantly influence what is included in web archives and how they are made available. As the ruptures and inconsistencies of collections of social media in web archives are often opaque to both creators of web archives and those using them, I argue that web archives can be read “along the archival grain” for evidence of the platformization of the web. This approach, which draws on anthropologist Ann Stoler’s critical readings on the form and placement of colonial archives (rather than just their contents), allows an assessment of how the gaps, silences, densities, and distributions of web archives are shaped by the shifting power dynamics between different actors involved in the production, circulation, distribution, and use of information on the web.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For the past year, using large language models (LLMs) for content moderation appears to have solved some of the perennial issues of online speech governance. Developers have promised 'revolutionary' improvements (Weng, Goel and Vallone, 2023), with large language models considered capable of bypassing some of the semantic and ideological ambiguities of human language that hinder moderation at scale (Wang et al., 2023). For this purpose, LLMs are trained to generate “moderate speech” – that is, not to utter offensive language; to provide neutral, balanced and reliable prompt outputs; and to demonstrate an appreciation for complexity and relativity when asked about controversial topics. But the search for optimal content moderation obscures broader questions about what kind of speech is being generated. How does generative AI speak “moderately”? That is: under what norms, training data and larger institutions does it produce “moderate speech”? By examining the regulatory frameworks AI labs, comparing responses to moderation prompts across three LLMs and scrutinising their training datasets, this paper seeks to shed light on the norms, techniques and regulatory cultures around the generation of “moderate speech” in LLM chat completion models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary experiences of everyday feminisms often include the use of social media platforms like Instagram. The introduction of Instagram Stories created a space for emerging feminist engagements, allowing for practices of re-sharing content that serve as small acts of political engagement, accommodating the participation of otherwise reluctant users. This article explores the feminist potential of these re-sharing practices, grounding it on the analysis of 2282 Instagram Stories, produced by 52 Instagram users in Portugal. This analysis combines qualitative textual analysis, close readings, and the use of digital methods to explore overarching patterns. The article foregrounds the multiple meanings of re-sharing, its social character, its ability to engage in intertextual conversations with the original context, while simultaneously recognising some of the limitations of the Stories’ format for feminist action. In this way, this article reflects on the tensions and possibilities of these small acts of political engagement.</jats:p>",

    "title": "CONTENT CREATORS VS THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY: A CASE STUDY OF THE TECHNO-CULTURAL AUTHORITY OF ADHD TIKTOK",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>According to social media users’ comments, the recent increase in social media content detailing the symptoms and experiences of living with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has led to many users self-diagnosing with the disorder. This conference paper presents the findings of an 18-month-long digital ethnographic study in which I analyzed ADHD TikTok videos and the technological infrastructures and assemblages surrounding the TikTok app, to interrogate how TikTok has become a voice of authority in the self-diagnosis of ADHD. This paper demonstrates how ADHD TikTok content creators create videos that cultivate sentiments of trust, intimacy, and relatability. These creators also adopt visual and discursive norms from other trending TikTok content, and from more traditional visual media content. In doing so, ADHD content creators generate authority by conforming and contributing to a set of coproduced content standards that ensure their videos are deemed viewable and relevant by viewers and the algorithm. Contrary to traditional understandings of authority, I find that medical authority on TikTok is not produced by individuals or institutions, but rather by content creators’ collective and collaborative performativity of everyday lived experiences, and their engagement with the supporting technologies of the TikTok app. To account for this shift in how authority is produced in our digital mediascape, I build on theories of social, cultural, and algorithmic authority, to offer a theoretical framework of ‘techno-cultural authority’. I ultimately argue that the techno-cultural authority of ADHD TikTok challenges customary understandings of authority figures and disrupts traditional medical expertise within the American healthcare industry.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Bumble, a dating app that positions itself as feminist and safe for women in India, has failed to live up to its claims. Despite its promotion of a safety-by-design approach, users have not fully embraced the app's safety features. This suggests a lack of understanding of the cultural factors contributing to the risks associated with online dating in India. To investigate women's experiences with Bumble’s safety features and their efforts to ensure their own safety while using dating platforms, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 23 women who are Bumble users in India. The preliminary findings indicate that using Bumble requires additional “safety work” from women, who rely on support from their peer network to manage their safety. The notion of safety by design has been misleading, as power dynamics shift back to men after women make the first move. This study is important to understand how profit-driven platforms with neo-liberal agendas put women in danger within their local cultural context on the pretext of empowering them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel investigates the pedagogic dimension of digital platforms thus drawing on older theoretical traditions that use pedagogy as a way of describing and explaining the relationships between individual and society, agency and structure (paper 1). We want to explore what it means to conceive of the relationship between people and their platforms as a pedagogic relationship; and how such conceptualisations might advance study of platforms in general (paper 4). Additionally, using the term pedagogy in its more specifically educational sense the panel explores the relationship between learning, schooling and education systems across emerging platforms (papers 2 regarding 8th grade teachers in the US using apps, and paper 3 regarding Australian universities’ learning management systems).&#x0D;\nPlatforms, we argue, standardise and seek to offer a relationship of trust over time with their “citizens”. Platforms working with families, schools or in higher education feed off the authority and trust that pertains between citizens and these institutions. However, the platformisation of education (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal, 2018) may contain other kinds of risks for students and their families, thereby introducing the need for new forms of validation. By thinking about activities in and across a series of platforms in terms of pedagogic relationships, where trust is placed in authority, the panel will explore the mechanisms by which digital interactions take forms of social trust and yet expose people to forms of dataveillance beyond ways that any membership or participation suggests in its initial contract.</jats:p>",

We bring together five\n        presentations that draw on different methods—including document analysis, semi-structured\n        interviews, participant observation—to explore the frailty of platforms, their underlying\n        infrastructures, and their trace data. Together, by examining and theoretically situating\n        the histories of five different platforms (TroopTube, Fanfou, MySpace, YikYak, and\n        Couchsurfing), we consider and complicate how the concept of “platform death” as a metaphor\n        can help reveal the Web’s rhythmic temporality, digital media’s constant reinvention of\n        forms, and the collision of hegemonic and fragile infrastructures in divergent cultural\n        contexts. We ask: What are the theoretical implications of situating platforms as killable,\n        ephemeral, precarious, or transient technologies? What—and who—kills platforms, and in what\n        ways can they have uncertain digital afterlives and even resurrections?

    "title": "WHEN FACT-CHECKING IS NOT WEIRD: CHALLENGES IN FACT-CHECKING BEYOND THE WESTERN WORLD",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Fact-checking has rapidly achieved a pivotal role in regulating the public debate globally. Reports show that the fact-checking industry is becoming more diverse, operating across more cultures and languages of recent. However, literature on fact-checking beyond the West is still forthcoming, as empirical research is disproportionally focused on the US. In this paper, we seek to catalog the many different forms of organizing and implementing fact-checks beyond the de facto standard found in Western industrialized countries, where fact-checking streams from journalistic verification practices. We analyzed 37 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with fact-checkers from 35 organizations operating in 27 non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. The interviews were conducted in three different languages (English, Portuguese, and Spanish) between March and November of 2021. Interview data was transcribed and translated for downstream analyses using thematic clustering in N-Vivo. Findings show that non-WEIRD fact-checkers endure similar challenges to those reported in Western fact-checking organizations. These challenges are identified through an analysis of seven types of challenges common to non-WEIRD fact-checking organizations, which are associated with and speak to institutional, infrastructural, political, methodological, social, cultural, and linguistic dimensions. We concluded that while fact-checkers are relentless in promoting democratic values worldwide, the standards that support the industry may vary substantially around the world, particularly where truth-seeking practices evolved detached from notions of democracy, truth, and journalistic integrity.</jats:p>",

They also communicate with journalistic peers and hence participate in the ongoing production of aN interpretive community (Carlson, 2016).\r\nWhile most research has focused on journalists’ publication practices, much less work has examined their decision to delete content they have already published on social media, an action that could have a meaningful impact on Twitter as a repository of public knowledge. In in-depth interviews, American journalists reported deleting tweets frequently. They also claimed such practices were common among their peers (Ringel &amp; Davidson, 2022).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online creators need their content to be ‘seen’; visibility on platforms can provide financial, social, and representational benefits. A lot of vital research has been done on how creators try to enhance their visibility on platforms and struggle with the threat of invisibility. But, especially for marginalised creators, platformised visibility is not without risks. This paper attends to these risks and creators' tactical use of (in)visibility to manage these. Drawing on 27 interviews with creators - online sex workers, LGBTQ+ activists, sex educators - we outline the harms of hypervisibility and users’ tactics for strategic invisibility. These interviews showcase how hegemonic norms hyper- and invisibilise marginalised groups, and how these dynamics are reproduced and institutionalised on platforms. We find that marginalised creators face serious risks from their platformised hypervisibility, not just their invisibilisation. Yet within the structures of platforms these creators still find ways to manage these risks and engage with strategic invisibility. Tactics of resistance exist across groups of marginalised creators. As such, our analysis shows the need to not just gain insight into how creators maximise visibility, but also into how they seek particular types of visibility, as well as strategic invisibility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is part of an on-going study of baby accounts created by ordinary parents to reach audiences outside friends and families. More specifically, the aim is to provide insights on the growing phenomenon of commercial forms of sharenting where parents seek money–making opportunities through the lives and images of children. A qualitative exploratory approach is used to shed light on the practices used by parents to try to garner the attention of brands on Instagram. Content analysis is carried out of 308 posts and the baby accounts behind these posts. Findings reveal that accounts in our sample are predominantly used to seek financial opportunities in the fashion industry. This is observed in the post images where brands are tagged and children appear in carefully staged poses that emphasize the baby’s looks and the clothes worn. The choice of hashtags added to the posts suggest a willingness to participate in baby model contests and brand representation searches. The commercial motivations of these accounts is also evident in the profile description, where parents indicate that the child is ‘an aspiring baby model’ or that the account is open to brand collaborations. This investigation extends emerging research on the growing presence of children on digital spaces when profit is involved. We discuss privacy issues surrounding the intensely mediated lives of children who are commodified to obtain rewards such as brand partnerships and free or discounted products or services.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital book publishing platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct\n        Publishing (KDP are often lauded for enabling independent authors unconnected to established\n        publishers to enter the book industry. Despite the appellation, independent authors are not\n        completely autonomous. Book publishing on digital platforms is intensely mediated by the\n        technology companies on which authors rely to publish and disseminate their work. This paper\n        explores the ways in which Amazon KDP undermines the independence of Black authors through\n        its categorization and content moderation systems. The critical framework for this research\n        combines media and platform studies with publishing studies through the application of an\n        ecology model that analyses the technological, economic and socio-cultural contexts in which\n        books and authors circulate online. (van Dijck, 2013). This paper uses a mixed-methods\n        approach consisting of interviews with authors of color and website analysis that collected\n        metadata from Amazon’s Web API. This paper argues that Amazon perpetuates the discrimination\n        Black authors face within the traditional publishing industry through its technological\n        systems. Amazon’s categorisation system uses profile data that has a tendency to sort books\n        by Black authors into categories defined by race regardless of the categories chosen by\n        independent authors. The visibility of books is also impacted by outcomes of Amazon’s\n        content moderation system, Rekognition, which has been proven to be substantially less\n        accurate in accurately identifying darker-skinned individuals (Buolamwini &amp; Gebru,\n        2018). Amazon acts as a powerful intermediary in the governance and organisation of content\n        in its marketplace due to the increased datafication of books in this sphere.</jats:p>",

    "title": "FOLLOW THE MONEY: A LARGE-SCALE INVESTIGATION OF MONETIZATION AND\t\t\tOPTIMIZATION ON YOUTUBE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>While YouTube has become a dominant actor in the global media system, the relationship between platform, advertisers, and content creators has seen a series of conflicts around the question of monetization. Our paper draws on a critical media industries perspective to investigate the relationship between YouTube’s evolving platform strategies on the one side and content creators’ tactical adaptations on the other. This concerns the search for alternative revenue streams as well as content and referencing optimization seeking to grow audiences and algorithmic visibility. Drawing on an exhaustive sample (n=153.770) of “elite” channels (more than 100.000 subscribers) and their full video history (n=138.340.337), we parse links in video descriptions to investigate the appearance and spread of crowdfunding platforms like Patreon, but also of affiliate links, merchandise stores, or e-commerce websites like Etsy. We analyze the evolution of video length and posting frequency in response to platform policy as well as visibility tactics such as metadata and category optimization, keyword stuffing, or title phrasing. Taken together, these elements provide a broad picture of “industrialization” on YouTube, that is, of the ways creators seek to develop their channels into media businesses. While this contribution cannot replace more qualitative, in-depth research into particular channels or channel groups, we hope to provide a representative picture of YouTube’s elite channels and their quest for visibility and success from their beginnings up to early 2020.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>During the first COVID-19 wave, we conducted a Zoom and WhatsApp digital group intervention that promoted community-dwelling older individuals’ mental health. Based on the media richness theory (MRT) and affordances approach, in this study we used netnography to explore how Zoom and WhatsApp technological affordances/constraints matched intervention tasks and increased intervention performance. We identified four Zoom and WhatsApp affordances: temporality, interactivity, multimediality, and portability. Empirically, our findings indicate how an information-rich media (i.e., high levels of multimediality) can be helpful in conducting complicated intervention tasks, whereas information-lean media (i.e., ongoing communication through text messages) can support simple tasks such as remote intervention management. Theoretically, our study expands on previous MRT media characteristics with the affordances approach and examines how the match between media affordances and task characteristics contributes to intervention performance. We offer recommendations for the research and design of future digital interventions.</jats:p>",

We extend established models linking attitudes related to privacy concerns and privacy protecting behavior (PPB) by (a) differentiating between horizontal (social) and vertical (institutional) orientations of PPB as capturing an aspect of privacy multidimensionality, and (b) introducing additional explanatory factors such as privacy literacy and privacy self-efficacy into the modeling of PPB. We survey a representative sample of 686 US social media users to test relationships between privacy concern, trust, privacy self-efficacy, privacy literacy, and vertical and horizontal PPB. We find privacy concerns contribute to horizontal and vertical PPB at different levels, reinforcing the dimensionality of privacy. We also find that privacy literacy and privacy self-efficacy are important factors in explaining dimensional privacy behaviors and moderate the established relationships between privacy concerns and PPB.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Information privacy concerns (IPCs) play an important role in user behavior on social network sites (SNSs). They are associated with self-disclosure behavior, enjoyment, and, perhaps most importantly, a user’s intention and ability to form and sustain social ties on SNSs. While conceptual integration of different approaches to studying IPCs has already been pursued, prior research has pointed to potential problems with respect to the survey measurements of IPCs. More specifically, a plethora of self-assessment scales have been developed but the differences among them have not yet been systematically elaborated, and this is further complicated by many methodologically questionable adaptations of existing IPC survey scales to ever-emerging online contexts and SNS platforms. Accordingly, this study comprises a systematic literature review based on the COSMIN methodology to comprehensively examine the quality of survey scales used for measuring IPCs among SNS users. The results have unveiled significant variety with 35 uni- or multidimensional survey scales used in 71 articles published since 2009. Many of the scales are of questionable quality in terms of structural validity, and only a few of the studies tested them for measurement invariance. Nevertheless, we identified some scales that are promising candidates for future use, although further testing and potential improvements are needed. Our findings could also act as the foundation for a unified measurement approach to IPCs that could be used across different SNSs platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Facebook’s application programming interfaces (APIs) enable third-party app developers to access data and functionality and have become central to many of the platform’s ongoing data scandals and privacy concerns. Understanding how the platform and its APIs evolve and how it responds to issues requires looking closely and empirically at the evolution of access points, data structures, and graph data structures. The technicity of APIs is crucial for understanding the politics of data sharing and how APIs represent and structure phenomena and temporarily stabilise them. Instead of using APIs as an umbrella term for data retrieval, we conduct historical “technical fieldwork” for examining the evolving architecture and interfaces of Facebook’s web APIs. We contribute an in-depth technical and empirical perspective on the evolution of Facebook’s Graph API since 2006, and how it evolved into one of the most significant web APIs and an integral part of contemporary advertising infrastructures and web development cultures. Our empirical historical analysis of Facebook’s Graph API is based on the entire corpus of available archived developer documentation held by the Internet Archive. As we show, key changes in the Graph API evolution are characterized by phases of experimentation, standardization, commercialization, and regulation. We provide a “scalable reading” of the evolution of Facebook’s Graph API which provides insights in how data and data flows are governed through changes in data structures and permissions. By considering the evolving structures of APIs and individual data objects, we may develop further empirically informed critiques of platforms, APIs, and their data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Confusion about modern post-publication fact-checking is dissipating\n        as the practise nears its 20th anniversary in the United States (where it began in earnest),\n        and misinformation settles as a resistant and sometimes deadly drag on reality. But a\n        nuanced analysis of fact-checking’s role in and on the journalistic field (Bourdieu, 1993,\n        1998; Benson &amp; Neveu, 2010) is troubled by such independent characterizations of post\n        hoc claim verification as: a revolt against journalism; a professional or social reform\n        movement; a new genre; an entrepreneurial exercise; a status-seeking ploy; and/or a\n        psychologically ineffective or damaging reinforcement of falsehoods. Given that accuracy is\n        an ethical requirement of normative journalism and the defining characteristic of ‘news’(\n        hence the political duplicity of the oxymoronic term, ‘fake news’), the birth of independent\n        fact-checking troubles the practice of journalism and, by proxy, political knowledge, and\n        can thus also be read as critique of the field writ large. While gatekeeping (Lewin, 1947)\n        is assumed dead, and gate-watching (Bruns, 2003) on life support, modern fact-checkers are\n        nevertheless culling and privileging information, while simultaneously adjudicating and\n        assigning blame for public speech, which traditional ‘neutral’ journalism avoids. Using both\n        both academic and journalistic qualitative and quantitative interview tools, and framed by\n        field, gatekeeping/watching, and discourse theories (thus emulating the\n        journalistic-academic hybrid model deployed in fact-checking), I examine the largely\n        unexplored area of journalistic re-entrenchment and introduce the reverse-gate-keeping\n        theory of ‘information corralling’ in the era of escalating misinformation.</jats:p>",

The eponymous\n        Narc, Agent Sebastian, patrols grocery store parking lots looking for miscreants to confront\n        and film. When he spots a target, he runs towards them making siren noises. \"Cart Narcs!\" he\n        shouts. \"That's not where the cart goes!\" While seemingly related to established\n        entertainment genres featuring real people in everyday situations and to prank videos, we\n        identify significant features in Cart Narcs videos that distinguish them: the lack of a\n        debrief; the positioning of the Cart Narc as the \"nice guy\" in the interaction; and the Cart\n        Narc’s claim to the moral high ground. These features each remove a redemptive moment\n        present in analogous types of content, resulting in a communicative interaction engineered\n        to anger people. We ask how Agent Sebastian produces such a powerful emotional response to\n        his seemingly innocent request that people return their shopping cart and what the logic of\n        this form of media content might signify. Cart Narcs is a revealing case study in how the\n        economy-driven logic of participation produces undesirable types of content when it\n        overwhelms or wholly replaces social and aesthetic logics. Cart Narcs videos are a hybrid\n        genre concoction that trade people's anger for monetized views, cloaked by the pretense of a\n        social mission.</jats:p>",

The central research question of this paper is: what are the prospects\n        for and barriers to online civic participation activities in the everyday lives of young\n        people who, along with their families, are experiencing economic precarity and other forms\n        of marginalization? The paper explores how mobile media were put to use for coping with\n        everyday life during the pandemic, revealing some assumptions about both coping and online\n        civic engagement that were dismantled.The analysis of these experiences force a reckoning\n        with structural inequities that existed prior to the pandemic and that were further\n        exacerbated because of it. The paper thus unearths new questions regarding how to design\n        online civic participation activities involving young people with multiply intersecting\n        experiences of both marginalization and resilience.</jats:p>",

    "title": "'IF YOU CAN WORK FROM ANYWHERE, WHY WORK ANYWHERE ELSE?': FLEXIBLE\n        CITIZENSHIP, REGIMES OF MOBILITY, AND THE DISCOURSE OF DIGITAL NOMADISM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital nomadism is a term that has entered the cultural lexicon\n        relatively recently to describe a lifestyle unbound from the traditional structures and\n        constraints of office work (Makimoto and Manners, 1997; Cook, 2020; Thompson, 2018). This\n        identity is organized around the digital technologies and infrastructures that make “remote\n        work” possible, allowing digital nomads to claim “location independence” and granting them\n        the freedom to travel while working (Nash et al., 2018). Largely employed as freelancers or\n        as self-styled entrepreneurs, digital nomads assert their independence from the traditional\n        strictures of work through the digital technologies they use at the same time that they\n        remain “plugged in” to the infrastructures, economies, and lifeworlds of Silicon Valley\n        (McElroy, 2019, p. 216). As such, the digital nomad represents a key site to examine\n        privileged transnationalism and the enduring forms of coloniality that inform contemporary\n        “regimes of mobility” (Hayes and Pérez-Gañán, 2017; Glick Schiller and Salazar, 2013, p.\n        189). This paper considers how discourses of digital nomadism have been constructed,\n        circulated, and leveraged by governments offering “digital nomad visas,” “remote work\n        visas,” or “freelancer visas” to examine how regimes of mobility have been imagined and\n        enacted. Utilizing discourse analysis to examine popular press articles, Instagram posts\n        from the official accounts of tourism boards, and governmental websites, I examine the ways\n        digital nomadism was constructed during the COVID-19 pandemic and consider how this\n        lifestyle has been formalized and institutionalized. I argue that mobility itself has become\n        a central resource through which nations compete for global capital accumulation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The resurgent interest in cyberpunk in video game cultures centers\n        the genre's historical and racially problematic themes. Moreover, competitive/online play\n        and the attending toxicity, along with recent Covid-19 based anti-Asian sentiments center\n        the need to theorize the discursive patterns in which these phenomena appear. Taking the\n        recurring talk on various video game forums of isolating Asian servers because \"Asians\n        cheat\" as a site of inquiry, this project argues that the sentiment of isolating Asian\n        players to region locked servers relies on three entangled discourses: the on-again,\n        off-again collapsing of various Asian identities to a monolithic Pan-Asia (Duara, 2001),\n        Korean and Japanese \"expertise\" through acquired skill viz. their assumed video game\n        \"obsessiveness\" (Groen, 2013), and the cheating technological Other seeking to supplant\n        Whiteness at the privileged center of video games (see Nakamura, 2002, 2009). By\n        highlighting these discourses and how they function, this project hopes to lend theoretical\n        nuance to understanding racism in contemporary video game cultures.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper broadly focuses on the sharing of male pornographic self-representation (PSR) on the Reddit forum, Massive Cock. Our previous study examined how gay-straight relations are recoded on the forum. Drawing on new data currently being collected, we focus on the operation and intersection of racialized masculinities as afforded by hybrid networked technologies, platforms, and screens. Based on preliminary data collection and analysis, we argue that Massive is a space of unmarked whiteness, with a paucity of racialized dick pics. We discuss the ways in which the less than 10 percent of posters of colour mark out their racialized identities, including through the mobilization of the problematic trope of the BBC (“big black cock”), with its roots in interracial pornography. We also examine the ways in which a much smaller number of racialized men, who are not black, mark out their racial/ethnic identity. Finally we look at the few white men who draw attention to their race through appropriation of the BBC discourse as BWC (\"big white cock\"). Taken together it is clear that Massive is a “fraternity of the [white] cock” (Waugh, 2004) but it is one that is disrupted and unsettled by the presence of racialized PSR.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube's maturation as a platform can be seen through a collection of social norms, audience expectations, and politics, all of which weave themselves into the technosocial fabric of digital life. As such, certain practices that regulate the flow of information have become normalized across a certain subset of YouTube channels. This paper will look at this practice among YouTubers that are “faceless”—content creators who do not reveal their faces on camera while voluntarily revealing many other aspects of their identity. Specifically, a content analysis is performed on these channels: The Lockpicking Lawyer, AvE, SteadyCraftin, This Old Tony, bigclivedotcom, CGP Grey, and fastASMR. The wide range of categories these channels belong to (DIY, self help, science and technology, home crafting, electrical appliance teardown, and audio therapy) indicates that choosing to remain faceless is not a function of a certain type of material, but rather a salient trend that crosscuts YouTube genres. The channels analyzed suggest that these YouTubers feel empowered through remaining faceless, allowing for increased disclosure about the topic at hand. They also demonstrate that Faceless YouTubers selectively share information depending on a range of motivations, all of which revolve around imparting meaningful content to specific audiences while maintaining a specifically-constructed notion of privacy. As a platform that is continually evolving,this paper represents an advance in the study of YouTube.</jats:p>",

    "title": "SUBVERSIVE IMAGINATION AND POSSIBILITIES OF CRITICAL AGENCY IN THE\t\t\tLANDSCAPES OF CODE?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reflects the intertwinements of ‘agency’, ‘infrastructuration’, and ‘imagination’ in our increasingly networked technological everyday life. The focus of the research, navigating at the interfaces of critical media studies, domestication theory, STS, and critical software studies, is on the ways in which imaginations on agency are constructed and stabilized. Likewise, attention is directed to how societal power structures are produced, reproduced, and possibly challenged in the processes of constructing imaginaries of agency. To study the above mentioned perspectives together, critical cultural studies scholar Stuart Hall’s famous encoding/decoding model is applied and updated in the contemporary media technological context (Hall, 1973; 1980). Hall’s concept of ‘maps of meaning’ is brought in dialogue with the concepts of ‘sociotechnical imaginaries’ by Sheila Jasanoff and ‘social imaginaries’ by Charles Taylor. The multidisciplinary, multimethod, and multidata approach of the research sheds light on the diversity and complexity of imaginaries of agency in our times. Based on the results, it is suggested that there prevails an almost resigned sense of agency that many people share in relation to the conditions of their technologically mediated everyday life. Despite sporadic negotiations and dissonances, it seems that people have become accustomed to the idea that they have very little, if any, chances to influence the structures of their networked daily environments. It is suggested that future research should concentrate on making visible alternatives to modes of technology-related action as well as develop ways to challenge people to creatively (re)imagine the kind of technology they want to live with.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes what makes young adults feel insecure when they use social media in everyday life as a means to socialize and connect with peers. The analysis is based on a two-year online ethnography (Hine, 2015) conducted on Jodel, an anonymous location based social media app popular among young adults across Europe. The paper focuses on Jodel users’ anonymous disclosures about their social media related insecurities – shedding light on discourses related to social media practices that are often hidden or neglected in interview studies. The analysis finds that it is often the affordances of the social media platforms (Bucher &amp; Helmond, 2018) or changes in the design of apps such as Snapchat, Instagram or Tinder that lead to feelings of insecurity or uncertainty in relational maintenance or in the forming of new relationships. Thus, the codes of everyday actions become unclear and different expectations as to the affordances of social media platforms result in diffuse interaction orders (Goffman, 1983) in various situations. Put in other words: Because of the platforms, young adults sometimes find it difficult to know why peers behave like they do online resulting in unfounded worries and feelings of insecurity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents early stage findings from a research project that explores whether the provision of data access addresses concerns that have emerged with regards to data collection by private and public actors. Using the recent right to data access secured by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a point of departure, I examine Facebook and Twitter’s response to these regulations through the lens of their data access policies and processes. I analyse what sort of data is made available and assess what benefit the public gains from having access to their social media data. I then offer a conceptual intervention through a comparative analysis of the divergent approaches two jurisdictions take to data access. I compare the GDPR with an ongoing debate around the introduction of a consumer data access right into Australian law and analyse how these divergent legal traditions and public discourses alter the conceptualisation and enacting of the data access right (and digital rights more generally). This paper provides a timely examination of a right that has emerged in response to the increased datafication of society. As well as offering a detailed analysis of how social media platforms have responded to the data access provisions within the GDPR, the comparative analysis of the EU and Australia shows that significantly different legal foundations can animate this right, ultimately presenting two starkly different visions of internet users as either consumers or citizens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As misinformation on social media continues to proliferate, scholars are increasingly calling for explorations of the negative ramifications of health-related misinformation on health outcomes. In 2018, 96% of the top 100 shared health articles were shared on Facebook; 51% of these had neutral to poor credibility. This exploratory study seeks to understand how U.S. Latinos assess the credibility of the cancer screening and prevention information (CPSI) they engage with on Facebook. Through semi-structured in-depth interviews, participants (n=20) accessed their Facebook account alongside the researcher, typed “cancer” in the search bar, and discussed cancer-related posts they engaged with during the past 6-12 months. If a participant engaged with CPSI, the researcher asked questions regarding if and how participants assessed the credibility of the information. Computer screen and audio were recorded for analysis. Interviews are being analyzed thematically, and CPSI via content analysis. Preliminary findings suggest most CPSI engagement comes from Facebook Friends and Groups that at times share unreliable information (e.g. foods claiming cancer prevention/curative properties). Participants with higher education levels were more likely to verify information via outside sources, while others looked for cues within the post to assess credibility (i.e. being shared by a reputable news agency). However, most individuals rely on heuristics (post virality, cultural associations, testimonies) to assess information credibility, rather than a verification process. These findings can assist in developing social media campaigns to counteract health misinformation. Findings also raise broader questions regarding Facebook’s role/responsibility in regulating and monitoring its platform’s health misinformation.</jats:p>",

As Gidden (2010) argues, trust is a shared social reality. Such a sense of collectively is being ‘stretched’ across national borders and cultural boundaries. Fewer explore the dis/trust and the associated concepts of authenticity and credibility against a transnational and cross-border environment. By transnationality, we refer to the increased level of mobility of the material goods, financial capitals and social networks of contemporary migrants. In other words, they live a life that is constantly ‘transiting’ between national, social and cultural borders rather than having to choose a static sense of belonging.&#x0D;\nThe three papers are then, organised to explore the transnational characters of Chinese migrants’ lives in Australia, from financial and economic survival to dating and socialisation, and the re-exploration of selfhood and belonging at later life. The three papers draw on different research methods range from ethnographic interviews and participant observation to the online walkthrough method and interface studies, and to the researcher embedded approach, to form critical inquiries about the production of trust in a digital era from the perspective of transnational migrations.&#x0D;\nIn examining the different stages of life and the plurality of Chinese migrants in Australia, this panel has the potential to contribute to the broader conversation in online trusts in a global, polymedia era.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel investigates how complex layers of trust and (dis)trust are surrounding and impacting on the fans, also known as ‘cultural intermediaries’, involved in the production, circulation, translation and remake of Korean and Chinese webtoon and webnovel platforms in Asia and among Asian users. Collectively, the panellists argue for a reconceptualisation of the concept of ‘Internet platform’. In so doing, we interrogate the concepts of ‘platformization’, ‘platform capitalism’ and ‘digital capitalism’ by asking: how, and with what effect, Korean and Chinese digital platforms – as well as their aggregated domestic and international users, are operating in the Asia Pacific, compared to more global ‘liberal’ platforms? Noting the activities of ‘digital champions’, such as the giant Korean search portal Naver, as well as China’s Kuaikan and Bilibili enterprises, which are now rapidly emerging in the shadows of their larger competitors: iQiyi (Baidu), Taobao (Alibaba), QQ (Tencent), collectively known as BAT. In sum, we show which Korean and Chinese webtoon and webnovel platforms are taking root in various regional territories and among regional audiences. Our intent is to illustrate how digital platforms (i.e. the globality of the internet) are refashioning the image of Korea and China, which is often viewed outside of their national borders as driven by an ideologically-free ‘broadband nirvana’ (Goldsmith et al. 2011), and tainted by authoritarian state, respectively. Accordingly, all four papers will consider how platform capitalism offers new ways to understand the outreach of both Korean and Chinese digital culture – from both economic and technological viewpoints.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Sleep has become a site of daily monitoring via internet technologies, including mobile applications and wearable devices, as part of a wider normalisation of internet economies and cultural practices of self-tracking and datafication. This article contributes to the critical analysis of datafied sleep by analysing features in the most popular sleep apps.&#x0D;\nThis analysis revealed a diverse range of functions for tracking and analysing sleep patterns, as well as features to promote relaxation and rest. In doing so, sleep apps remediate the monitoring technologies of the sleep science lab – polysomnography, actigraphy – to make claims for accuracy and efficacy. Yet, the analysis also revealed how sleep apps go beyond simply monitoring sleep patterns by directly intervening in sleep-wake rhythms through two key acoustic features: the ‘smart wake up’ alarm function, and the ‘binaural beats’ sound frequency function. We show how these features operate to organise transitions between waking and sleeping states by directly intervening in and modulating sleep-wake rhythms. In doing so, we argue that these functions draw on histories of both sleep science and acoustic media in attempts to optimise the rhythms associated with sleeping bodies.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When people distrust media systems, one response is to disconnect. This emergent theme within internet research encompasses technologies, practices, discourses, and politics of disconnection. Furthering these discussions, this panel draws together four investigations into technologies and practices of digital disconnection. Each paper interrogates a different form of disconnection and considers the various elements of trust and/or mistrust they reflect.&#x0D;\nTwo of the papers focus on forms of disconnection centered around avoidance. One takes up the problem of digital propaganda and the associated declining trust in online media systems. It argues that informational avoidance in the form of ‘strategic illiteracies’ might open new spaces for resistance to misinformation. The other paper considers the challenge of managing personal availability in a context where mobile communication creates expectations of continual availability. It investigates the discursive practices that young adults use to avoid others and argues that these practices rest on implicit systems of trust.&#x0D;\nThe remaining two papers consider how neoliberal discourses of self-improvement shape disconnective practices and technologies. They investigate forms of disconnection that are based around consumption choices and technology design. In both papers, disconnection is driven by growing distrust in dominant modes of technology design, specifically, their cognitive impacts. In response, the disconnective practices and technologies discussed in these papers place their trust in individualised, and often technological, solutions.&#x0D;\nOverall, the panel contributes to scholarly debate around disconnection by considering new forms of disconnection, their role in our contemporary media environment, and the forms of trust and mistrust they reflect.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper highlights non-Western views on trust in regulation and governance through a comparative legal analysis of copyright and the music industry in Myanmar. Legal transplanting, taking a law from one legal system and implanting it, was a common practice throughout colonial history. Standardized copyright, in the form of the TRIPs Agreement, is an example of a post-colonial legal transplant, enforced by the WTO. The South-east Asian nation of Myanmar is the process of a major transition both politically and technologically that is heavily impact its creative industries in general, and music industry in particular. This interdisciplinary comparative legal analysis considers the implications of transplanting copyright regulation into an informal creative economy. Data were collected from fourteen interviews with music industry professionals and legal experts in Myanmar conducted in January 2019. While some informants expressed trust in foreign transplants and a belief in the efficacy of a new copyright law, others expressed concern that these foreign laws would fail to address issues unique to the Myanmar music industry. This study argues that the way forward involves a deeper understanding of the local system of governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I argue that music recommendation algorithms are a complex element of contemporary digital culture. We trust music streaming and recommender systems like Spotify to ‘set the mood’ for us, to soundtrack our private lives and activities, to recommend &amp; discover for us. These systems purport to ‘know’ us (alongside the millions of other users), and as such we let them into our most intimate listening spaces and moments. We fetishise and share the datafication of our listening habits, reflected to us annually in Spotify’s “Your 2018 Wrapped” and every Monday in ‘Discover Weekly’, even daily in the “playlists made for you”. As the accuracy of these recommendations increases, so too does our trust in these systems. ‘Bad’ or inaccurate recommendations feel like a betrayal, giving us the sense that the algorithms don’t really know us at all. Users speak of ‘their’ algorithm, as if it belonged to them and not a part of a complex machine learning recommendation system. This paper builds on research which critically examined the music recommendation system that powers Spotify and its many discovery features. The research explored the process through which Spotify automates discovery by incorporating established methods of music consumption, and demonstrated that music recommendation systems such as Spotify are emblematic of the politics of algorithmic culture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Research to date on the value of information has mostly focused on the consumption side of information, namely, that consumers need to experience information in order to evaluate it. When it comes to digital media, users have multiple roles. In this context, materiality is applied to assess the role that technological components play in the interaction between user and digital media. The concurrent consumption and production of information raises questions as to the influence of information production on information value perception. To this end, we conceptualize the information production process. The fundamental assumption in this research is that value perception changes as a result of production experience. Furthermore, this study examines the boundaries of value perception for producers of information. 309 participants took part in a set of experiments. Willingness-to-pay by consumers and willingness-to-accept payment by producers were measured before and after consumption/ production/ peer-production. Results show that consumers’ and producers’ subjective value before their experience were equivalent; Change in value perception before and after consumption/production produced a statistically significant effect; Producers who evaluate the information after the experience, evaluated it higher than producers who evaluated the information before the experience; and value perception measured before the production by a single producer is lower than value perception by peer-producers. Hypotheses were accepted. If accepted, additional results will be presented at the conference.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With every digital interaction, individuals are increasingly subject to algorithmic profiling, understood as the systematic and purposeful recording and classification of data related to individuals. Large Internet firms, such as Facebook and Google/Alphabet, as well as third-party data brokers collect and combine detailed personal data to create sophisticated profiles for predictive purposes. Research has started to look into people’s perception and engagement of algorithms, showing that many users are unaware of the existence of algorithms, for example those which curate news feeds, and that a majority feels uncomfortable with algorithmic profiling on Facebook. In our research, we investigate perceptions of algorithmic profiling on Facebook by addressing the following questions: What user narratives of profiling on Facebook exist? What reactions do users have when confronted with Facebook’s inferred profiles? What are the social implications of user perceptions of profiling? Drawing on rich and recent survey data from 292 US-based Facebook users, we identified four overarching themes relating to Facebook's profiling activities: uncertainty, naiveté, realism, and fatalism. While the third theme is the most prevalent, Facebook is perceived as very powerful when it comes to algorithmic profiling. However, when confronted with their own profiles through the \"My interests\" and \"My categories\" sections in the Facebook Ad preferences menu, many users indicated surprise at how imprecise or even wrong some of the inferred interests and categories were. We discuss the social implications of our findings with regards social exclusion and social justice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research has emphasized the increasing professionalization of ‘user-generated content’ for digital networks and social media. This paper highlights a contrary but parallel process: the aesthetic ‘vernacularization’ of brand images on social media and the adoption of recognizably ‘amateur’ styles by corporate brands. Analyzing the official Instagram accounts of 24 leading fashion brands between 2014-18, our research project identified eight distinctive patterns in the corporate adoption of vernacular photographic styles. In this paper we discuss the three most common patterns: (1) $2 : sharing and crediting users’ photographs on the brands’ official feed ;(2) $2 : posting the ‘amateur-looking’ photographs of a celebrity or model associated with the brand; (3) $2 : selfie-style images created by brands themselves where the brand appears to be the ‘self’ that performs its own representation. Following this analysis, we argue that user-generated content has become detached from its primary authorial configuration (being generated by non-professional users) and has solidified into a recognizable style, a ‘user-generated aesthetic’, available for brand appropriation. This detachment constitutes a form of ‘context collapse’ that is characteristic of social media in other respects, but here appears in visual form: as the collapse of contextual distinctions that enable viewers to infer authorial status, milieu and purposes from visual indicators. It further conforms to the expansion of branding practices beyond the purview of marketing, advertising and celebrity into all aspects of social life, and in particular to Instagram as a social media platform that enacts marketplace logics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitter has become a hub for many different types of educational conversations, denoted by hashtags and organized by a variety of affinities. Researchers have described these educational conversations on Twitter as sites for teacher professional development. Here, we studied #Edchat—one of the oldest and busiest Twitter educational hashtags—to examine the content of contributions for evidence of professional purposes. We collected tweets containing the text “#edchat” from October 1, 2017 to June 5, 2018, resulting in a dataset of 1,228,506 unique tweets from 196,263 different contributors. Through initial human-coded content analysis, we sorted a stratified random sample of 1,000 tweets into four inductive categories: tweets demonstrating evidence of different professional purposes related to (a) self, (b) others, (c) mutual engagement, and (d) everything else. We found 65% of the tweets in our #Edchat sample demonstrated purposes related to others, 25% demonstrated purposes related to self, and 4% of tweets demonstrated purposes related to mutual engagement. Our initial method was too time intensive—it would be untenable to collect tweets from 339 known Twitter education hashtags and conduct human-coded content analysis of each. Therefore, we are developing a scalable machine-learning model—a multiclass logistic regression classifier using an input matrix of features such as tweet types, keywords, sentiment, word count, hashtags, hyperlinks, and tweet metadata. The anticipated product of this research—a successful, generalizable machine learning model—would help educators and researchers quickly evaluate Twitter educational hashtags to determine where they might want to engage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>These days, wayfinding is often associated with ‘asking’ Google Maps for directions. Over one billion people per month use Google Maps and Google estimates that one-in-three mobile searches is location-related. Whose routes does Google Maps direct one towards and what types of pathways become naturalized? I approached these questions through performance- and drawing-based research. In the early 1960s, artist Stanley Brouwn stood on a street corner in Amsterdam and asked people for directions with pen and paper in hand. Over the course of the project, Brouwn amassed a collection of hand drawn maps. Now, in contemporary conditions of geomedia, I reactivated Brouwn’s work as an exploratory research project in Toronto, New York City, London, and Amsterdam. I also collected drawings and notes, spontaneously produced in situ, which I analyzed in relation to the location-awareness and real-time feedback of digital mapping technologies. The encounters produced notes and drawings that point to the information literacies used in street-level wayfinding and situate these in relation to the mobilities and spatial perceptions prioritised by Google Maps’ interface and affordances. The paper presents a theoretical framework to assess the types of calibrations at play when proprietary mapping platforms broker spatial information. The paper uses alternative research methods to explore how Google Maps is more than a guide but an orientation towards a Google spatial imaginary while at the same time complicated by the ad hoc layering of other wayfinding strategies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel brings together emerging scholarship that challenges the contemporary hold of major platforms over public and private life. It critically questions the scope, valence, and embeddedness of platforms in the everyday, challenging (commercial) platformization as the new normal. We attempt to offer new ways of managing, changing and co-opting platforms for the benefit of end-users rather than proprietors only. To this end, the panel discusses and debates 'non-market' approaches to tackling social and environmental effects of platforms. It is designed to build on recent work within infrastructure, platform and critical data studies to suggest alternative approaches to the neoliberal ordering of economic life. A central question is whether the data streams monetized by “big tech” can be harnessed for public, democratic, or socialist ends; in doing so, bringing them 'in house' and into competition with big tech itself. In other words, the panel takes a “protocological” (Galloway 2004) resistance approach, in appropriating the methods of algorithmic- and data-governance occurring under platformization, and utilising them at the regional (state) or (hyper-)local (city, city block) level. Moreover, it seeks to highlight examples of successful community-based and cooperative instances of platformization. Looking at the seemingly ruthless efficiency of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM) in the extraction of value through digital means, the panellists ask: what would resistance look like if we use the economic and infrastructural strategies levied against us? $2 Galloway, A.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A core understanding in memory studies is that memory is not formed by an individual in insolation. Instead, it is guided by social frameworks and enacted within a particular social context. This is articulated by van Dijck (2007) as an inseparability of mediated memories from culture. Accordingly, the active, purposeful creation of and re-engagement with digital traces of the past in the present on Instagram and Facebook by young women can be situated in the postfeminist, neoliberal environment. Significantly, the particular expectations and pressures on how young women should feel and act intersect with the performance of digital memory work. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the particular ‘feeling rules’ (Kanai, 2019) articulated by the young women and consider more broadly the role that emotion plays in shaping the performance of digital memory work on Instagram and Facebook. I draw on data gathered from semi-structured interviews with young women aged between 18 and 21 living in London, and ethnographic observations of their Instagram and Facebook profiles. This is complemented with a socioeconomic platform analysis (van Dijck, 2013) and a technical walkthrough (Light et al. 2016), carried out to examine how Instagram and Facebook encourage particular emotions to be expressed and the entanglement of memory and emotion in their memory product. The analysis explores the overlap between the encouragement by platforms and expectations of the postfeminist environment for happy moments to be shared with the way that different emotions influence what is shared by participants.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, has become an international phenomenon. But what exactly ASMR is remains misunderstood. ASMR itself is a relatively new term, coined by scientists in 2010, but it describes an age-old feeling: the sensation of tingling on the scalp and spine. Biologically, it has been compared to fission or paresthesia. ASMRtists refer to this feeling as tingles. To this end, this research is informed by the results of a three-year long participant observation and ethnographic study in YouTube’s ASMR community in order to analyze ASMR as an emerging media genre. I argue ASMR is best understood as a genre, situated between the varying content possibilities of the text and the specific affordances of YouTube. By analyzing the relationship between platform governance, algorithms, monetization, care, and creativity, I identify a key component of the ASMR genre as transactional tingles. I define transactional tingles as the interaction between ASMRtist and viewer, in which the viewer receives a form of relaxation in exchange for clicks, likes, and views in the internet’s attention economy. , ASMR and transactional tingles have more in common with the artist/patron system of the Renaissance era or the Kickstarter campaigns of the twenty-first century, in which entertainers draw on their audiences for financial support. The culmination of my ethnography was the announcement of the ASMR app, Zees, which shows how creators harness the affordances of participatory culture to push the boundaries of genres while maintaining committed to the key principles for creator and viewer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The new European right to be forgotten (Art. 17 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants EU citizens the right to demand the erasure of their personal data from anyone who processes their personal data. To enforce this right to erasure may be a problem for many of those data processors. On the one hand, they need to examine any claim to remove search results. On the other hand, they have to balance conflicting rights in order to prevent over-blocking and the accusation of censorship.&#x0D;\nThe paper examines the criteria which are potentially involved in the decision-making process of search engines when it comes to the right to erasure. We present an approach helping search engine operators and individuals to assess and decide whether search results may have to be deleted or not. Our goal is to make this process more transparent and consistent, providing more legal certainty for both the search engine operator and the person concerned by the search result in question. As a result, we develop a model to estimate the chances of success to delete a particular search result for a given person. This is a work in progress.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While the literature discusses ICTs as enablers of activism, this paper discusses the manipulation of power through ICTs in activism. Power makes using ICTs in activism dangerous and risky. This paper is a product of 30 semi-structured interviews with Arab Spring grassroots human rights groups that operated before 2015 but no longer do because of oppression and how it affected them physically and psychologically. The paper explains power structures enabled by ICTs inside and outside social movements. It also discusses how the power manifested through ICTs creates much risk of different types for activists: technical, social, psychological and political. First, ICTs created more ways for authoritarian regimes to watch over activists. The asymmetry of visibility (Brighenti, 2010) is one result of the advancements in ICTs that directly affected activists’ mental health by creating anxiety among them, not knowing when and how they are being watched. This asymmetry has also endangered activists’ lives, because if they are unaware of being under surveillance and take no precautionary measures, they are an easy target for state oppression. The two conflicting sides, activists and the state, both make use of ICTs as a space for action turning ICTs into an arena for power struggle. Another side of power that this paper discusses exists within social movements that are claimed to be leaderless. Even though activists do not want to be in an authoritarian system, they create a situation whereby their refusal to decide who is in charge may lead to an implicit power hierarchy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Infamous for their highly exploitative, algorithmically-managed labour regimes, Amazon fulfillment centers are sites of continual breakdown and disrepair for the bodies and minds of its workers. From a methodological approach via workers’ inquiry and content analysis, this paper aims to theoretically frame the effects (and affects) resulting from Amazon’s strategy of augmented despotism, which engenders new forms of domination mediated and augmented by digital tools. Through a content analysis of online video confessionals detailing the physical and mental experiences of worker burnout and breakdown, this paper aims to bring the voices of (ex)-workers at Amazon to the forefront of understanding Amazon’s integrated architectures of labour management, surveillance, and control. The focus of this content analysis will be on the experiences of “broken” Amazon workers interacting with Amazon’s technological media apparatus of augmented despotism, with a special focus on the company's virtual health clinic: Amazon Care. As worker confessionals on YouTube attest, Amazon Care is as much an architecture of managerial surveillance, control, and discipline as it is of “care.” While other wearable and trackable technologies haunt the Amazon worker during their shift, Amazon Care extends the company’s technological power beyond the confines of the fulfillment center. Drawing from political and technological theories of labour and care, this paper will look into how Amazon workers navigate (and often escape) the affective and embodied confines of Amazon's augmented despotism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Multinational food and drink companies have increased their social media marketing budget and efforts and some have been rewarded with increased youth consumption of highly refined snack foods and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) even as overall consumption of SSBs, in many more developed countries, is falling. (Brand-Miller &amp; Barclay, 2017; Chaloupka, Powell, &amp; Warner, 2019). This strategy seems to be working particularly well in Africa. But at the same time, multinational companies are also waging more existential battles against a growing public awareness of the role their products play in epidemics of overweight and obesity (Du, Tugendhaft, Erzse, &amp; Hofman, 2018; Nestle, 2018). This paper explores how ‘Big Food’ multinationals has tried to frame these debates around issues of ‘energy balance’ and highlight SSB companies’ role in promoting the exercise side of their ‘energy balance’ frame. (Ruskin, Stuckler, Serôdio, Barlow, &amp; McKee, 2018, Nestle, 2018). This messaging, this paper argues, propagates misinformation, and is implicated in the current epidemic of poor nutrition in both developing (and developed) countries. Using both thematic content analysis, augmented with audience reception study through focus groups sessions, this paper explores how these companies’ social media marketing combines with their more traditional marketing channels to simultaneously sell product *and* defend their products right to be sold untaxed and unrestricted. The paper explores how these messages resonate with young adults in Nigeria and South Africa, and finds that the SSB companies' overall campaigns and particularly the social media components, are effective in countering public health messaging.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Facebook now allows pages of the deceased to remain active, controlled by immediate family members of a deceased person, as a sort of memorialization or “electronic wake,” (Stokes, 2011). The overall goal of the author is to examine the evolution of the materiality of memorialization and investigate how our human connection with death has changed as our media tools have become untethered from tangible artefact. To explore the links between media, human relationships, and the spectral plane, and how those links might be revelatory in an age of digital media, a hauntological examination of these questions will be endeavored. The basic premise of hauntology, a clever merge of haunting and ontology derived by Jacques Derrida (1993), is that an idea, once tangibly realized and made real in the cultural zeitgeist, is never truly extinguished. Derrida’s hauntology derives from the ontological quest to articulate the nature of being, yet with the added perspective that everything that exists might not have ever lived, and nothing which is past ever really quite dies. This is no more so true than in our heavily mediated age in which written documents, photographs, film, and the Internet are able to capture, record, store—and, as will be discussed—even replicate beingness in physical form. In an age where simulacra parade as true being, and cultural memory of events as accepted historical provenance, perhaps a new perspective on the relationship between being and death is timely.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media are a prominent space for diasporic mobilization and activism, opening new avenues for studying transnational communities living outside of their countries of origin. This study uses a hybrid methodological approach to consider how Ukrainians living in the United States engaged with homeland politics during the 2013-2014 Euromaidan protest and how their use of social media intervened in their transnational protest politics. This study contributes to the broader scholarship on studying transnational mediated protest participation by examining a case of diasporic mobilization of the Ukrainian community in the United States. Triangulating semantic mapping data from online diasporic communities on Facebook with in-depth interviews, we show how diaspora members engaged in the protest despite distance and how their activity and tactical decisions were mediated by social networks. We specifically examine how diasporic personal networks and networked technologies enmesh into a set of hybrid networked practices, circumscribing how Ukrainian Americans interpret political engagement and how they strategically use the affordances of social media for protest participation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Our study examines user-generated global humor through an analysis of comic items spread on Twitter. By addressing the inherent conflict between the locality of humor and the globalizing digital participatory sphere, we aim to uncover the features of global user-generated humor. A long-term sample of humor keywords in multiple languages was used to locate 734 items reaching global audiences, which were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (a subset of 143). We found that such items focused on “the universal,” rather than a multicultural exchange. Additionally, the texts were characterized by five types of comic failures, each accompanied by some form of redemption: $2 – slapstick acts featuring shortcomings in basic human behavior but accompanied by daring attitudes; $2 , displaying “backstage” unattractive behavior but enjoying an aura of authenticity; $2 – lacking popularity or charisma but inviting sympathy; $2 – misinterpreting the world and your place in it but compensating through basic human communicability; and $2 – using nonsense humor that is nevertheless appreciated through communal understanding. Our findings chart the meaning of human failure in the digital age as a balancing act: while individuals fail in fundamental aspects of life, shared laughter through social media offers collective ways for overcoming their failures. This dynamic exists in a liminal space, seeming to existing both everywhere and nowhere. By building on globally recognizable content and situations, global humor evokes empathy or identification from broad crowds without committing to specific identities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of production platforms by exploring the political economy of the real-time animation platform Unity by Unity Technologies. Contributing to the debate on the ‘platformization of cultural production’ by examining the penetration of Unity’s economic, infrastructural, and governance extensions beyond its platform boundaries, we argue Unity has become the de facto default for the development of apps thereby impacting the production and circulation of immersive content. To explore the impact of Unity’s role in the wider process of platformization we draw on an archive of corporate documentation and promotional material, news coverage, and industry data. We situate the platform within Unity Technologies’ culture and business strategies, which enrolls and keeps developers ‘tethered’ to its proprietary platform. We found Unity’s diffusion and growth has evolved along three lines, economic expansion, infrastructural integration, and regulatory control through a series of acquisitions and business partnerships with industry-specific technologies. While there are competing real-time animation platforms, Unity Technologies’ focus on economic and infrastructural integration with industry-specific technologies and companies has made it indispensable for real-time animation workflows. As a result, global businesses such as Disney, Toyota, and Nintendo use Unity in their design process. Our analysis signals a broader shift in the cultural production of apps where a small group of production platforms shape the production, distribution, and circulation of real-time animation products. In many ways, Unity not only animates the life of the internet, but it also brings to life visions of the material world around us.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article explores the emergence of technologically integrated relationship practices among college students in two U.S. universities. This work is situated within the significant body of social research and popular cultural discourse surrounding the consequences of technology and cultural integration among young adults. Analyzing interviews with 52 participants, I explore how they construct, establish and maintain cultural practices and social norms that shape peer interaction, social networks and interpersonal relationships in offline and online settings. This paper focuses specifically on the emergence of techno-social cultural norms that impact friendship and social network construction. Findings suggest the establishment and maintenance of friendships using social networks frequently includes the use of social media profiles as means to collect social and political attitude data on potential friends. Some participants report the use of such data as essential to the decision-making process utilized while establishing and maintaining offline friendships. Motivations for this practice include safety and security, social normativity and a desire for efficiency. Furthermore, participants articulate a social and politically homogeneous friendship network as a desirable outcome to data collection. These findings contribute to our ongoing understanding of the role of informational echo chambers within a technologically integrated social environment.</jats:p>",

    "title": "RELIEF FROM COMMUNICATION: PARENTAL SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES, TRUST AND CARE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The everyday adoption of digital technologies such as mobile phones and social media has had transformative effects on interactions within the family (Clark, 2013), as families become increasingly dependent on their capacities for coordinating day-to-day activities and maintaining intimate relationships (Licoppe, 2004; Ling, 2014). Concurrently, these technologies enable new forms of surveillance, allowing parents to observe their children’s movements and interactions remotely, eg. via GPS-apps (Marx &amp; Steeves, 2010), as well as lateral forms of surveillance embedded in social media practices like ‘Facebook stalking’ (Albrechtslund, 2013). This paper explores how the surveillant capacities of communication technologies are involved in shaping relations of trust in the family, drawing on empirical data from in-depth interviews with adolescents at two schools and 17 Danish families conducted during 2017. Despite surveillance often being represented as a practice which undermines trust (Mayer, 2003; Neyland, 2006; Rooney, 2010), our findings suggest that the relationship between trust and surveillance, for the families in our study, was far less straightforward. Surveillance was an important part of care practices for parents and, in some instances, tracking technologies were able to offer a kind of ‘relief’ from social pressures to remain in contact. This paper explores the perceptions of parents and adolescents regarding using communication technologies for surveillance, to examine the nuanced constitution of trust occurring.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper draws on a digital ethnography conducted via Twitter, of a controversial subnetwork of fans of boyband One Direction known as “Larries”. The Larry fandom is built around imagining a romantic relationship exists between One Direction band members Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, referred to by the portmanteau “Larry”. Imagining relationships between celebrities is a controversial practice known in fan communities as “Real Person Slash” (RPS). For this practice Larries have been framed within popular media as conspiracy theorists. Our study sought to examine whether a more complex and nuanced understanding of the fandom was possible, particularly regarding relationships and community building in this fandom. Through digital ethnographic methods, we explored how the practices of Larries create a space in which new and unexpected desires, identities, intimacies and relations are constituted. Between March and July 2018, we followed approximately 490 public accounts, kept a fieldnote diary, and conducted semi-structured interviews with seven active users via direct messenger. Conducting observations on a daily basis over an extended period as regular fans would, we became privy to the highs, lows, excitement, and tensions of the group, that may be otherwise obscured. This study raises questions about what might be missed in studying controversial groups at a macro level only. This paper considers the benefits of undertaking qualitative digital ethnographic work and discuss the affective flows of digital networks on social media that might remain obscured by other digital methods.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores echolocation as a conceptual framework to extend our understanding of digital sociality. Echolocation is a process whereby the characteristics of an echo build a map of location and relation. Most often we think of how bats, whales, and dolphins echolocate to navigate. If we think of radar, sonar, or lidar, we might think of submarines, autonomous vehicles, or even geolocation on our mobile devices. In this paper, I discuss echolocation as a symbolic interaction framework for describing how the Self is negotiated and identified in and as a part of social space. It focuses attention on the character and function of pings, push notifications, red dots on device screens, and other responses in ongoing interactions between people in social media or between humans and nonhuman or more than human elements of media ecologies. The interpretive qualitative analysis is part of a six year ethnographic study of youth. The analysis of echolocation emerges from a subset of the larger study, those who feel anxiety and even existential vulnerability when disconnected. Based on this qualitative analysis of narratives, the paper builds and extends echolocation as a theory of digital sociality that pays close attention to the response versus the performance in the interaction model.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Mashup’ is a form of music that, in its use of samples from existing popular music recordings, has often been seen as an exemplar of the participatory cultural environment that many expected the internet to foster. It is a musical form that remains widely produced and consumed today. However, the contemporary internet is a complex environment for media distribution, with dominant platforms making use of a wide range of automatic and algorithmic regulatory tools in order to police, monitor, and remove unwelcome content – including that which is seen, rightly or wrongly, as copyright infringing. Drawing on recent empirical research on and with mashup producers – including 30 semi-structured interviews and an extensive survey (n=92) – this article explores the impact of platform regulation on mashup music today. It concludes that current regulation has significant stifling effects on this kind of remix creativity, including a substantial impact on where mashup producers distribute their music, on the aesthetics of their music, and – most pertinently – on their overall motivation to create. Having outlined these key findings, we argue that the ‘shutdown’ status of mashup producers raises profound questions concerning the balance between regulating online content in terms of protecting the artists’ rights, and cultivating participation and culturally valuable artistic expression. As such, this paper offers a timely contribution to scholarship on the complex relationship between popular music and new media in its critical exploration of internet’s detection algorithms and their implications for mashup music and cultural participation more generally.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates how young children experience digital advertising platforms. Specifically, it focuses on young children's participation in the YouTube app as part of an advertising mechanism that captures and profits from their views and attention. An innovative trans-disciplinary bridge between digital labour studies, biopolitics theory and qualitative research on children online has been developed to achieve this aim. The fact that children are going online progressively earlier raises critical questions around what they are experiencing in the virtual world. Data has become a way to profit and digital technology has become the infrastructure for capitalism permanence. This process of making a profit on user’s information leads to issues around trust and the confluence of surveillance and profit. It also raises questions around the persistence of Marxist concepts such as surplus labour, surplus value, and labour exploitation within the platform economy. Furthermore, in this environment one cannot disregard the relationship of power and the government of life; biopolitics should not be dissociable from capitalism. Thus, considering the early stage of young children’s cognitive development and their consequent vulnerability is urgent to understand how young children contribute to the political economy of the digital platform. The extent to which parents/caregivers and teachers are knowledgeable about the models of data mining, statistical profiling and corporate profit-generation that occur within this digital environment is also being investigated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube Rewind, especially its controversial 2018 and 2019 offerings, surfaces contested and contradictory understandings of what YouTube culture is and who gets to speak for the platform. Adopting and morphing the idea of media events established by Dayan and Katz, I argue that Rewinds serve as $2 . Rewinds are moments of coming together around shared rituals, anthems, and cultural leaders. The violation of the formula for this ceremonial event in 2018 upset audiences and generated a mass, organized, and negative response. By tracing the flows of content creation, including the corporate-produced Rewind videos and critical response and reaction videos from YouTube creators, this project identifies competing visions and structuring tensions of platform culture. Focusing on the question of cultural development on YouTube via the social media event of Rewind videos forefronts the larger question of how researchers can talk about online culture on a globalized scale. From viewer-driven virality, to the establishment of microcelebrities, to the role of international cultural leaders on the platform, understandings of what it means to be a YouTuber emerge from more sectors than ever before. Is a singular Rewind possible for a platform that now encompasses over 100 countries and 80 languages? If corporate visions of what YouTube is and should be no longer generate popular excitement and backing, who then gets to speak for the platform?

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Large technology platforms are facing mounting public pressure to be more transparent and proactive about their approach to content moderation. Existing research on platform governance often focuses on the ways in which the platforms are unprecedented (e.g., their size, scale, and use of algorithmic systems to sort and filter information), and thus contend with unique challenges as they attempt to manage their outsize role in shaping the contemporary public sphere. However, their distinctive features notwithstanding, platforms are currently grappling with questions that have long been fundamental to democracies with heavily marketized media systems. How can information intermediaries best operate in the public interest? Can for-profit platforms reconcile their private interests with the public good? Through what kinds of organizational infrastructures and shared value systems might this reconciliation be accomplished? Using a comparative case study approach, this paper addresses these questions by examining institutions that have historically inhabited a structural position in the public information landscape that is similar to large technology platforms. Specifically, we look at how bookstores, libraries, and supermarkets decide what to stock on their shelves and magazine racks, and how they respond when controversies arise. The study maps several considerations each of these intermediaries have faced in order to develop a typology of approaches to information curation and moderation. By examining a variety of oft-overlooked approaches to information curation and outlining their respective benefits and drawbacks, we hope to contribute a historical and conceptual perspective to scholarly and industry conversations about platform governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes libertarian internet discourse in the mid-1990s, focusing on the events surrounding the passage of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which criminalized obscene and indecent content on the internet. During this episode, hackers, early adopters, computer professionals, technology lobbyists, and civil society advocates embraced a libertarian way of thinking about the internet and the state — a way of thinking I refer to as cyberlibertarianism. These groups had long-standing libertarian dispositions, although their anti-statism ranged from a left-libertarianism, concerned with concentrations of power in the state and in the market, to a civil-libertarianism, concerned with the integrity of constitutional protections, to a right-libertarianism, concerned with laissez-faire market conditions. In responding to the events of the decade, and following from their established dispositions, these groups converged on a libertarian narrative about the internet and the state. According this narrative, the state was overbearing, intrusive, compromised, and uninformed — and therefore a threat to the internet as a sphere of freedom, individualism, competition, and innovation. This libertarian narrative structured their arguments against specific acts of state intervention. In the case of the Communications Decency Act, they argued that the regulatory measure undermined the promise of the internet as a venue of free speech, an object of the free market, and a conduit for the free flow of information.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms such as Facebook have been understood to present new possibilities for interaction. Yet, there have been concerns surrounding the reducing quality of our interaction and conversation. Such debates, however, have not considered the pre-post dimension of online environments: that is, the preparatory work that occurs to online posts before they are shared with their audience. Based on real time recordings of Facebook Messenger interactions, this paper asks what the pre-post perspective tells us about the quality of our interactions online. The analysis is theoretically informed by Goffman and methodologically by conversation analysis and addresses this question with a focus on processes of identity construction. Specifically, this paper questions how the practice of pre-post editing (the editing of messages before sending) is used by users to represent self online and what this then tells us about the quality of our online talk. In presenting innovative screen capture data, this paper argues against claims that our interaction online is declining in quality instead showing the ways users perfect their online posts by elaborating a new stage of online communication: the ‘rehearsal’ stage. In doing this, this work reflects on the wider implications the affordance of pre-post editing has on users’ social media experiences questioning the impacts constructing ‘perfect lives’ has and the potential for creating ‘reduced’ versions of self within our online interactions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the paradoxes of disconnection is that social platforms like Facebook frame it as a threat to our prosperity while critics associated with “the techlash” maintain that quite on the contrary it is the only thing that brings back the possibility for good life. Disconnection means different things for different actors and these differences manifest in varying desires and designs. The five papers in this panel draw on empirical research and media and cultural theory to find answers to questions such as what process have led to the desires to disconnect; how does something disconnect; when does it disconnect; what does it disconnect; and whose disconnection it is? Two of the papers map the choice to disconnect in situations where on one hand digital participation has become structurally necessary by the demands of the society and on the other where users are doing outdoor activities and it is connection that requires activity. Three of the papers focus on particular designs of disconnection from Facebook’s off-Facebook Activity Tool to UX Design Decks and the Light Phone. As a whole, the panel describes the different ways disconnection is becoming central to our online existence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, government and policy organizations, private companies, and research agencies have been discussing the potential disruption caused by the deployment of AI systems in working environments. This paper traces contemporary discourse on the relationship between artificial intelligence and labour and discusses how these principles must be comprehensive in their approach to labour and AI. First, the paper asserts that ethical frameworks in AI alone are not enough to guarantee the rights of workers since they lack enforcement mechanisms and the participation of worker organizations. Secondly, it argues that current discussions on AI and labour focus on the deployment of these technologies in the workplace but ignore the essential role of human labour in their development, particularly in the different cases of outsourced labour around the world. Finally, the paper recommends the use of already existing human rights frameworks on working conditions – notably the International Labour Organization conventions on the right of collective bargaining, the abolition of discrimination at work, and the right to equal remuneration – as a basis for a more comprehensive ethical framework on AI labour. It concludes by arguing that the central question regarding the future of work will not be whether intelligent machines will replace humans, but who will own and have a say on the systems that will ultimately work alongside humans.</jats:p>",

    "title": "BETWEEN LIVE AND LIFE: EXPLORING THE ONLINE PRESENCE OF PERFORMANCE\t\t\tARTISTS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last decade, the use of social media in the theatre scene has fueled debates on the possibility to redefine the performer-audience relationship on a wide scale. Scarce attention, however, has been paid on empirically studying how performance artists balance their use of social media between the need to promote their work and the ambition to experiment creatively on the medium affordances. This paper explores the use of social media by Italian contemporary theatre artists and companies. The study aims to explore the relational labour (Baym 2018) of performance artists in tracing the boundaries between online/offline performativity and between personal self-narration and artistic promotion. Through a combination of profile analysis and in-depth interviews, we want to understand how this artistic scene - that always experimented on intermedial and participatory possibilities - is making sense of social media. Preliminary results show how social media interaction and content production is becoming an integrated part of companies working routines. Companies position their social media activity outside a purely promotional logic. This anti-promotional ethos translates to a lack of efficacy in terms of strategic communication. However, it also lays the basis for the use of social media to expand performative practices. Although the interviewed companies do not exclude such a possibility, they lament their current inability in making such an attempt. Lacking resources is the most quoted explanation of this failure, followed by the refusal to compromise with the constraints of online languages, and the distrust of social media to reach wider audiences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile games have been around since at least the 1970s, serving as an important foundation to today’s ludic and digital cultures. Understanding the history of mobile games is relevant because mobile games link digital culture and urban mobility, and they promote sociability. However, reclaiming the history of mobile games poses a challenge to researchers. Many early mobile games are no longer on the market or are expensive to acquire. Others were ephemeral in nature, leaving behind few traces of their existence. To respond to these challenges, we have developed an online, publicly searchable database of mobile games, developed between 1975 and 2008. This database offers a centralized repository where researchers can search for games by using a wide range of criteria, such as title, time frame, genre, type of connectivity, number of players, place of development, authors, and hardware. This paper discusses the process for developing this database, emphasizing the interdependent relationship between theory and practice. It also discusses interdependence as a value for research, more broadly. The database was developed in collaboration with scholars/practitioners across disciplines, and its future robustness depends on the ability to crowd-source information that is scattered across the web and in archives. We argue that the pursuit of interdependence, rather than independence, helps to fuel research, widen perspectives, and disrupt normative frameworks guiding research. It is our hope that the database will improve the process of researching mobile games and serve as a historical record for an increasingly meaningful aspect of culture and social life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contributing to the swiftly emerging field of the geographies of digital sexualities, this panel explores the geosocial and geopolitical dimensions of digital sexual cultures by zooming in on the connections between sexual practices, geographic imaginaries, and locally embedded social media platforms devoted to sexual expression. Building on case studies of an Estonian platform used primarily by those interested in group sex (LC, est. 2018), a Swedish platform preferred by BDSM practitioners (Darkside.se, est. 2003), and a Finnish platform for nude self-expression (Alastonsuomi.com, est. 2007) we show how these platforms contribute to and shape sexual geographies in digital and physical registers. On the one hand, these platforms operate as spatialized tools which put bodies in motion in the interest of hooking up. They function as digital compasses that allow for orientation of sexual desires in physical spaces. On the other hand, these platforms also assemble localized online places for flirtation, imagination, visibility, and appreciation, which interlink bodies with the visual pleasures and vulnerabilities of seeing and being seen. We approach questions of locatedness and place-making both through the regional and linguistic boundaries within which these platforms operate, as well as through our participants’ sense of comfort and investment in the local as a space of sexual play. As sexual content and communication are increasingly pushed out of large, U.S.-owned social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, local and (to some extent) independent platforms where sexual expression is less regulated offer an interesting counterweight.</jats:p>",

Because of the book-length analyses preceding the panel, we are able to distill what is distinct and recognizable about these platforms – what we call ‘platform specificities’ and demonstrate how these specificities are shaping not only the experiences of the users of those platforms, but the social media ecosystem more broadly. The panel contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding platform power, social media and ways of making sense of social media, painting in board strokes plausible future developments to keep an eye on.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides an explorative analysis of gender as a critical\n        dimension of the prospering wanghong economy in China with special attention devoted to the\n        e-commerce wanghong value chains that are yet to be examined by scholars so far. Wanghong\n        refers to a particular stream of vocational Chinese internet celebrities that have acquired\n        their celebrity online and have acute incentives through various models to liquidate such\n        online influence by transforming followers into consumers. While wanghong economy is often\n        projected as a new platform economy that is by the women and for the women on diverse media\n        outlets, my analysis highlights the structurally embedded gender hierarchy of this platform\n        business ecosystem and the platform power increasingly associated with patriarchal order as\n        exemplified by the updated meanings constructed around the Chinese term “baba” (daddy),\n        which now is used to refer to platforms by wanghong and netizens. By combining the analysis\n        of female participation at different levels of wanghong economy with the “platform-as-daddy”\n        discourse prevalent on Douyin, one of the most popular social media platforms, this paper\n        seeks to connect the industrial analysis of wanghong economy as one of the most prominent\n        “platform economies” in contemporary China with its cultural dimensions. It accentuates the\n        key roles of major Chinese platform companies as not only new critical intermediaries in\n        perpetuating the ongoing patriarchal system between the state and users but also active\n        participants that actively construct, and aggressively profit from, the gendered wanghong\n        economy value chains.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In today’s digitized society, internet users increasingly rely on online services that apply algorithmic selection, like for instance Google Search or the Facebook News Feed. The algorithms that are implemented in these services automatically select information sets and assign relevance to them. This entails societal risks such as privacy breaches, surveillance, manipulation, or overuse. One way for internet users to cope with these risks, is the use of self-help strategies such as deleting cookies or using an adblocker. Therefore, this article wants to answer the following question: What are the factors that promote internet users’ self-help against algorithmic risks? To do so, we analyze nationally representative survey data for three types of algorithmic risks: surveillance, manipulation, and internet overuse. The structural equation models show that being aware of algorithmic risks (H1), having had negative experiences that are related to these risks (H2) and possessing a higher level of internet skills (H3) are positively associated with the use of self-help strategies against algorithmic risks. Therefore, we conclude that awareness of algorithmic risks and internet skills should be promoted to increase internet users’ self-help. Nevertheless, self-help can only complement—but not substitute—statutory regulation to attenuate algorithmic risks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how young TikTok creators enact strategies of\n        playfulness and absurdity in response to gun violence and trauma. Through a\n        ludic-carnivalesque reading of young people’s irreverent engagement with school shootings,\n        we demonstrate how youth use TikTok to reclaim emotional control of uncontrollable\n        situations. We situate our analysis of playful #schoolshooting videos as part of an\n        imitation public that is constituted through practices of mimesis, replication, and\n        imitation. However, we broaden our focus to consider the latent political potential of the\n        publics that memetic practices create. Within this framework we ask: What discourses and\n        shared practices emerge through playful #schoolshooting memes on TikTok and what are the\n        implications for the everyday politics of youth citizenship? Our methodology consists of two\n        phases conducted over an 18-month period. The first phase of analysis, performed\n        August–December 2019, relies on collated systemic searches for specific hashtags and sounds\n        that young people use to memeify school shootings. In the second phase, we identified two\n        seemingly unrelated events that young people discursively and memetically linked to school\n        shootings: COVID-19 lockdowns from March-May 2020 and the storming of the U.S. Capitol\n        building by radicalized Trump supporters on January 6, 2021. By analyzing these practices\n        through the lens of the ludic-carnivalesque, patterns reveal the ways young people enact\n        strategies to demarcate boundaries, articulate cogent critiques of policies and policymakers\n        that do not prevent school shootings, and to turn painful and traumatic realities into a fun\n        and harmless Bakhtinian carnival.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the Scandinavian daily press’ efforts in and\n        perspectives on algorithmic news recommendation. News recommender systems provide news\n        organisations with new opportunities to offer more relevant and personalised news\n        experiences, but their increasing use has also raised several concerns about whether and how\n        algorithms should undertake important editorial decisions. Current literature offers only\n        limited empirical insight into the actual use of these technologies in journalism, and this\n        paper is the first to map the use of news recommender systems in the Scandinavian media\n        system. Drawing on interviews with all 19 national newspapers within the Scandinavian daily\n        press, the findings reveal that 17 newspapers use news recommender systems and 14 of these\n        use personalisation. Most newspapers expressed positive attitudes toward the technologies,\n        highlighting increased relevance and better opportunities to drive subscriptions. The extent\n        of the use of news recommendation at the specific news media organisations is still limited\n        due to concerns about algorithms interfering with journalistic priorities and a reluctance\n        to jeopardise the brand value of the front page. Some newspapers address these concerns by\n        allowing for editorial control through subjectively estimated journalistic input, revealing\n        that journalistic norms and ideals affect the design and implementation of algorithms in\n        journalism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the changing socio-cultural dynamic between local music entrepreneurs and journalists/critics on Facebook in Estonia. Through the analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and experts and observations of their activities on Facebook, the study identifies the decreasing distance between music criticism and music promotion. On the one hand, the music critics once envisioned as ‘autonomous gatekeepers’ (Hirsch, 1972) find it increasingly hard to transfer their musical authority, expertise and perceived independence to the commercially driven social media environment. As a result, some of them have taken up entrepreneurship themselves, converged their various identities by mixing their critical/evaluative practices as critics and business-oriented practices as entrepreneurs. On the other hand, some niche music entrepreneurs are stepping into the role of cultural authorities by mobilizing and catering to specific taste cultures and genre communities by becoming expert gatekeepers in their own right, despite being compromised by their business interest. In this context, it is no more useful to talk about the ‘mutual dependency’ of the music press and industry PR (Forde, 2001; Negus, 1992). Rather, among the tightly interwoven music scenes like the ones in Estonia, where many players adopt a variety of different and often conflicting roles (especially on Facebook), we should recognize the complete convergence of music promotion and music criticism and the loss of critical distance and autonomy altogether.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online news comments are intended to cultivate an interdependent\n        relationship between news organizations and their audiences. However, uncivil online\n        comments have become a persistent problem that requires constant intervention through\n        moderation. In this paper, to better understand these interventions, we analyze interviews\n        of eleven managers of online comments of large Finnish news organizations. By exploring the\n        views of journalistic managers of moderation, this study contributes new insights to the\n        discussion about online content moderation, as previous research has focused more on social\n        media platforms and moderators. Our results suggest that the managers have a complex\n        relationship with comments. They would like to see more engaging comments but were also\n        frustrated with the continuous need to moderate the comments. The managers also expressed\n        concern that uncivil comments keep more constructive commenters from participating, thus\n        harming the audience relationship. Organizations tend to outsource moderation to third\n        parties or automated moderation, as moderation is often seen as time-consuming and outside\n        of the core work of journalists. However, the managers were not satisfied with outsourced or\n        automated moderation, mainly because of a lack in contextual knowledge, as also noted in\n        previous research. Reflecting previous literature, our results suggest that some aspects of\n        uncivil commenting may require alternative approaches to moderation altogether. For example,\n        some managers suggested replacing comments with other means of interaction. To address the\n        inherent contradictions in online news comment moderation, we advocate a view that focuses\n        on cultivating and rewarding civil comments instead of deleting and punishing for uncivil\n        comments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the emotions, beliefs, and deep stories about the\n        self and other that are held by individuals on the political right and left in America in\n        order to understand the manifestation of affective polarization during divisive historical\n        moments. It also documents expressions of victimhood, villainhood, and privilege to\n        determine how they intersect with narratives about the ingroup and outgroup. Horwitz (2018)\n        argues that victimhood has become a desirable status in American politics and is thus a site\n        of contestation. Therefore, we ask: what beliefs and emotions do individuals hold about the\n        ingroup and outgroup and how do these contribute to exacerbating affective polarization? We\n        conducted a four-month digital ethnography before, during and after the 2020 US election and\n        developed an innovative approach to affective discourse analysis through an iterative,\n        grounded study in order to analyse Facebook, Twitter, and Gab content. We coded 2500\n        cross-partisan posts/comments that focused on the January 6 Capitol events and election\n        outcome/fraud and were underscored by themes of race and partisanship. Individuals on the\n        political right and left expressed deep distrust towards the outgroup but thankfulness to\n        those speaking their own narrative. Findings also indicate that affective polarization has\n        deeper roots in feelings of bitterness and resentment of the other. These are linked to the\n        ingroup’s narrative of victimhood/blame and serve to strengthen the boundaries of ingroup\n        and outgroup identities as membership in the group becomes defined in part by the\n        recognition (or lack thereof) of that group’s pain and oppression.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Building on two case studies, this paper will discuss emerging healing, health and therapy cultures on social media and the role of (micro-)influencers within these cultures. While influencer cultures have become an important field of internet research over the last decade (see for example Abidin, 2015), scholars typically focus on commercial influencers in the context of fashion, beauty, travel, lifestyle genres, and adjacent genres. This paper contributes to extending how we imagine and theorise influencer practices and explores influencers and influencer practices that are motivated, arguably, by healing rather than financial or ideological ambitions. Theoretically, we consider how digital affect cultures enable influencers and followers to (re)create narratives about health, relate through resonance and engage with media rituals rather than merely seek information. As influencer practices and cultures continue to expand beyond popular or normative conceptualisations, this paper offers empirical accounts to open up the contexts and theories we use to explore influencer dynamics. Our paper is a starting point to invite conversation at the conference about the diversity of influencers and influencer cultures, how we might theorise their roles, and how care, healing, health and therapy is felt and communicated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With this paper I aim to analyse and discuss the Steam game platform in a platform economic perspective. I will argue that Steam represents a special type of platform economy due to its roots in gaming economies: Steam’s platform economy can be seen as a specific way of capitalising on the player-driven economies that arise within and beyond key game titles offered on the platform. The API offered to third party developers on Steams websites can be described as a ‘palette of monetization strategies’ that run from simple retail models in the game store, over various ways of integrating user generated content in the Steam Workshop to the prospects of harnessing and capitalising from players’ economic action in the Community market. A look some of the most-played games titles shows that this gives rise to a variety of diverse monetization strategies. Many of those monetization strategies move beyond advertising and the attention economy, making players trades another potential source of income. In all cases, of course, Steam gets its share.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of platforms is on the rise in communication studies,\n        science and technology studies (STS), game studies, internet studies, and the study of\n        human-machine communication (HMC). While originally platform studies emerged from hardware\n        studies as an integrated attempt to study the hardware, software, code, marketing, and use\n        of computational technologies—especially, early on, videogame consoles, but never limited to\n        them—its use has been broadened to include the study of software platforms, such as social\n        media sites, and their user affordances, algorithmic decision making, terms of service,\n        background code environments, and embeddedness in neoliberal capitalism: selling user data,\n        acting as advertising mediums, etc. While a fruitful field with much work developed, there\n        is a noticeable dearth of methodological theorising on the topic, even as there are numerous\n        theoretical explorations. How exactly does one $2 platform studies?

These three dimensions of platform studies are combinable,\n        provisional, and subject to extension. While the three dimensions offered up for discussion\n        here cannot speak to the entirely of what platform studies $2 or $2 , together and as a\n        starting point these initial three define the shape of platform studies, track the work it\n        has already done, and offer a solid framework and model for future\n        investigations.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ANALYZING PLATFORM POWER IN THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Across cultures and contexts, digital platforms like YouTube,\n        TikTok/Douyin, WeChat, and Spotify are fundamentally reshaping both the processes and\n        products of cultural production—from music and news to entertainment and advertising. But,\n        despite considerable attention to the perverse power of algorithms in various spheres of\n        social and economic life, we contend that existing political economic frameworks fail to\n        account for the distinctiveness of the cultural industries. Challenging essentialist\n        theories of platform dominance, this paper argues that claims of platform power need to be\n        qualified in the context of industry- and culture-specific inquiries. Building on research\n        in science and technology studies (STS), software studies, political economy, business\n        studies, and media industries studies, the paper presents a new analytical framework to\n        analyse the evolving power relationship between platforms and cultural producers. It is\n        argued that the decision space of cultural producers in their role as platform complementors\n        is shaped by three key variables: 1) platform evolution, 2) cultural industry segments, and\n        3) stages of production. The proposed framework makes clear that, while the relationship\n        between platforms and cultural producers is staggeringly uneven and, at times, highly\n        volatile, it should be understood as one of mutual dependence. That is, platforms exert\n        mechanisms of power over the phases of the creation, distribution, monetization, and\n        marketing of culture; but they also furnish space for negotiation and contestation.\n        Acknowledging this requires a framework that is less deterministic and sensitive to the\n        nuance inherent in cultural production.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Visualizations are reliant on visual encoding, in which attributes of data are depicted through graphic symbols (Cairo, 2019). As such, they are placed as a transitional mode between data and information in the linear framework of the \"wisdom hierarchy\" (DIKW). In the digital information environment, both the linear learning process and the distinction between data and information merit a re-evaluation. This paper seeks to create a better understanding of information's role in digital culture, by venturing to re-examine its attributes. Relying on a sample of all visualizations posted by the top four candidates of the 2016 US elections (n=252), I applied qualitative grounded analysis informed by theory: First, I constructed a conceptual model for the attributes of information, which relies on three layers – (1) foundation (substantiation/sources); (2) building blocks (data components); (3) data-structures (analysis). Second, following a classification of all units according to this model, I defined types of visualization rhetoric that each rely on specific formulations of information attributes (foundation, building blocks and structure) to make a political argument. Finally, I identify two modes of visual information-rhetoric in elections: unveiling and imagining. The model and categories defined in this study demonstrate how the rhetorical agility required for modern political campaigning seems to muddle the axiomatic distinctions of data and information and create new, unpredictable hybrid information and rhetorical types, some of which rely heavily on estimations and fantasy, rather than empirical observation and evidence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The notion that ‘death is a taboo’ pervades private, public and academic discourses around death, dying and bereavement in contemporary Western societies. The rise of digital media within the last decades further complicates the appreciation of the stance that death is a taboo, given the increased opportunities afforded in social media environments for embracing death, fostering new intimacies with strangers and semi-strangers but also for turning death into a spectacle (Jakobsen, 2016). The study of death-related practices online and the tensions they raise has rapidly been growing in the interdisciplinary field of Death online studies. However, in this field there is a need for developing shared conceptual and analytical frameworks and ensure methodological and theoretical robustness in line with developments in the study of social media communication. There is a need to synthesize insights from death sociology and interdisciplinary death online studies in order to shape an agenda for an integrated study of the offline and the online that can capture continuities and shifts in death-related practices (see also Borgstrom and Ellis, 2017). This panel collects four papers presented by six interdisciplinary scholars from Denmark, Sweden, Israel and the UK. Focusing on the (in)visibilities of death, dying and bereavement across contexts - online and offline - the papers critically revisit the ‘death is taboo’ thesis by investigating the particular conditions under which death, dying and bereavement are talked about, storied, and made socially visible and the ways in which technology plays a vital part in coping with mortality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The possible ubiquitous presence of technology connected to the internet and a growing ageing population has necessitated a renewed interest in the digital inclusion of older adults. The focus on chronological age is a form of ageism as it erases the heterogeneity of the community while over-emphasising a physical attribute. We argue that by introducing a conceptual framework incorporating the intersectionality theory (Crenshaw, 1990) and the continuity theory (CT) (Atchley, 1989, 1999) it is possible to explain the differences found in digital in/exclusion that go beyond chronological age. This would enable a more individualised approach to the current curriculum of digital skill acquirement and to help affect lasting change in digital technology adoption by older adults.\n\nA thematic analysis (Braun&amp;Clarke, 2006) on 26 semi-structured interviews, with self-proclaimed digital technology users aged between 66 and 84, was used to test this conceptual framework. By using both theories it was possible to explain why chronological age cannot be used as an indicator of use or non-use. Rather examining the intersections of their identity in combination with their investments in habits and skills can explain why some older adults benefit more and are able to make use of the internet in comparison to others.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, activist work and HCI approaches, these papers show how organizations formed partnerships to curate information resources, and deploy community Wi-Fi and Internet infrastructure across southwest US Indigenous communities during the most challenging months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. For Native Americans this means ideating while navigating colonial inequality. Through an investigation of sociotechnical interdependencies across a broadband network cooperative, tribes, and university labs, an HCI team reflects on how relational stability sustains fragile Internet ecologies stretched to capacity by the needs of users deeply affected by COVID-19 in New Mexico and Arizona. Through an autoethnography of community-centered digital solutions for Navajo Nation, a member of the Nation considers how the role of K’é informs a system of infrastructural care in a nation struggling with high rates of infection and systemic lack of adequate infrastructure. Through an advocacy-oriented analysis of social media content, a Diné and Lakota social media scholar discerns the relationship between community enforcement of social distancing, the loss of interpersonal interaction, mutual aid, and the impact of public health memes for the Navajo Nation. Through radical librarianship practices, a Tohono O’odham librarian and artist counteracts the values of ‘information neutrality’ shaping whiteness-centering American librarianship by generating a community-curated solution to actionable information about COVID-19 for Indigenous communities. This panel models decolonial liberation rooted in responsiveness across mediated layers of Indigenous belonging. The authors express Indigenous interpretations of collective autonomy vis-a-vis strategic Internet assemblages, and particularly, how an Indigenous ethics of care intersects with the dream of an Internet for social good.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitter has been a vital platform for organizing, coordinating, and amplifying voices during protests, especially in non-democratic countries. Although it is a globally used platform for protest movements, many studies focus on English-speaking and democratic countries. We overcome this research gap by investigating Persian, English, and Arabic tweets during the 2019-2020 protests in Iran. In this work-in-progress paper, we collected approximately 5,500,000 tweets, and apply social network analysis, Botometer and qualitative analysis, to map the Twittersphere revolving around Iran protests (RQ1). We focus on the evidence of the presence of bots, bot networks, coordinated misinformation campaigns and political astroturfing in the discussions (RQ2). Our preliminary results indicate the presence of strong homophilous networks of users formed around various political interests. At least two of the clusters in the network show an unusually high proportion of suspicious accounts. Interestingly, these clusters reflect antagonistic political affiliations—one consists mainly of pro-regime Iranian accounts, the other of anti-regime accounts tweeting in Arabic. The broader findings from this study will be valuable for understanding digital activism, protests, and political communication in authoritarian and semi-authoritarian contexts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel investigates the networked soundscapes of memetic warfare on TikTok, a platform crucial in mediating the ongoing war in Ukraine since February 2022. Introduced to the public as a unique form of war programming during the first week of Russia's full-scale military invasion (Mobilio 2022), WarTok—a portmanteau of ‘TikTok’ and ‘war’—signifies \"the war of super-empowered individuals armed only with smartphones\" (Friedmann 2022). Producing headlines such as \"TikTok's Amazing Russian-Ukraine War Videos,\" (Figure 1) the term necessitates critical and ethical scrutiny, not only for its sensationalist stance but also for the collapse of contexts it entails. Integrated into a platform that thrives on remixing, WarTok seamlessly intertwines on-the-ground war reporting with war propaganda—an aspect explored across all panel contributions through the lens of music.\n\nNetworked Soundscapes\n\nThe choice for sound as the primary step in our exploration not only derives from the platform’s logic of content creation, it also acknowledges music’s affective impact and its historical role in propaganda (Thompson &amp; Biddle 2013). Music on TikTok serves as both an affective mediator and a highly templatable networker. Recent studies highlight the templatability of TikTok sounds, offering insights into content creators' attention-grabbing techniques (Abidin &amp; Kaye 2021), logics of trend dilution (Bainotti et al., 2022), issue-specific remix cultures (Primig et al. 2023), and infrastructural meme collection (Rogers &amp; Giorgi 2023).\n\nAural linkages between templates can intersect with other platform-native modalities of expression, producing networked soundscapes. A soundscape, as we approach it by leaning into TikTok’s logic of indexing “listed” and “original” sounds, foregrounds audio as the main memetic stratifier, opening up different paths for navigating content (Geboers et al., forthcoming). Hashtags and sounds, for example, can turn into a source of mutual amplification or may remain disengaged even when united through technical means (Pilipets 2023). Feeding into contested attentional dynamics of digital media (Boler &amp; Davis 2021), propaganda by means of TikTok sharing takes on a new dimension in a highly contested space, which is said to “raise memes to the level of infrastructure” (Zulli &amp; Zulli 2021).\n\nMemetic Warfare\n\nOften driven by a cynical hunt for eyeballs, memetic warfare on social media taps into humor and mockery, inviting playful participation (Divon 2022), channeling disinformation (Bösch 2023), and using agitainment to captivate publics beyond the explicitly political (Tuters and Noordenbos forthcoming). In the context of war propaganda, memes become central agents of partisan bonding through recognizable templates and inscribed in-group cues (Arkenbout &amp; Scherz 2022). TikTok music expands the toolbox of crafting memes, opening up new venues of boundary work and populist instrumentalization (Boichak &amp; Hoskins 2022).\n\nTikTok is renowned for its ability to implant short video earworms, perceived as stickier than complete songs (Vizcaíno-Verdú &amp; Abidin 2022). Some attribute this phenomenon to the cognitive principle that human memory retains unfinished tasks more effectively than completed ones, generating affective tension (Carson 2022). Walter J. Ong’s “secondary orality”, a concept revived by Venturini (2022), is one way to address this tension in online spaces where written words often become spoken words and where evanescence is ingrained into the logic of engagement. Foregrounding the memetic function of TikTok, the panel sets out to explore how the ultra-nationalist landscape of Russian WarTok and the tactics of pro-Ukrainian hijacking intertwine in a complex ecology of imitation and attention hijacking.\n\nTHE SOUND OF DISINFORMATION: TIKTOK, COMPUTATIONAL PROPAGANDA AND THE INVASION OF UKRAINE\n\nTom Divon and Marcus Bösch\n\n“ДОБРОГО ВЕЧОРА WHERE ARE YOU FROM”: MEMETIC REVERSAL, CULTURAL APPROPRIATION, AND SOUND HIJACKING\n\nDaria Delavar-Kasmai\n\nAMBIENT PROPAGANDA: THE DARK REFRAIN OF WARTOK\n\nMarc Tuters and Boris Noordenbos\n\nWHAT IF THEY ATTACK?

    "abstract": "<jats:p>At first glance, the “generational war” between Gen Z and Millennials appears to be merely the latest iteration of an emerging generational cohort demarcating their taste cultures, subjectivities, and values. However, these seemingly trivial and playful debates over who “belongs” on TikTok and who is the “real” social media generation provide a fruitful inquiry into examining the generationing process.\n\nThis paper examines the ways that self-proclaimed members of Gen Z and Millennials dyadically use TikTok to co-construct their respective generational consciousness by asking: What role do the platform logics, affordances, memetics, and creative vernaculars of TikTok play in the generationing process, specifically the collective construction of generational borders between Millennials and Gen Z?\n\nI conduct a qualitative discursive analysis of the ways Gen Z and Millennials create dialogical TikTok memes, challenges, and trends to co-construct their respective generational identities. The analysis focuses on the assemblage of the narrative, visual, and audio content of memes alongside the platform logic and affordances that make such memetic participation feasible.\n\nSuch an analysis reveals how Gen Z and Millennials are using TikTok to publicly negotiate the borders of their respective generational identities and thus allows for a closer examination of the role of TikTok in the generationing process. Specifically, I demonstrate how the memetic discourse functions as a way for Gen Z to solidify what they perceive as their more progressive values while forcing Millennials to come to terms with the paradoxes of their own problematic values, subjectivities, and positionalities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel deploys a range of qualitative methodologies to investigate how processes of datafication meet with the subjective experiences of ordinary people, and the practices of everyday life. We draw on the model of ‘everyday data cultures’ proposed by Burgess (2017) to explore the ways diverse data practices – including the production and circulation of data visualisations, modes of data storage and vernacular engagements with data literacy – can be understood as aspects of culture. Following Burgess, we define everyday data cultures as the practices that form around and in response to the social media and other data (and data trails) that people generate as we go about our daily lives. These practices form from our diverse engagements with, experiences of, and approaches to understanding and negotiating these data Across these four papers, we address the everyday politics of social media platforms; the development of vernacular pedagogies of AI and machine leaning practices; the historical datafication of sex and gender, and mundane workplace practices of storing, concealing and revealing personal data. In doing so, we seek to highlight and amplify everyday human agency, as well as explore its limits and uneven distribution, and consider how it is being transformed through the logics of data and the machines that feed on them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we analyze the concepts of fenxiang and gongxiang—the Mandarin words for ‘sharing’—in the context of Chinese social media. Drawing on earlier work on ‘sharing’, and based on analyses of four corpuses and changes over time to the homepages of 32 Chinese social network sites (accessed through the Wayback Machine), we find that the concepts of fenxiang and gongxiang offer a heuristic for understanding Chinese social media, while also pointing to an important facet of the discursive construction of Chinese social media. Although seeming to refer to the same activities as ‘sharing’, analysis of the language of fenxiang and gongxiang in Chinese social media reveals the entanglement of a new individualistic self with a self that remains socially embedded in pre-existing relationships; it shows how micro-level harmony (fenxiang) and macro-level harmony (gongxiang) cohere with each other; while also reflecting the interplay among social media platforms, users, and the state.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Depictions of romantic relationships between humans and computers/robots/AI systems are a common trope in science fiction. With recent advances in AI conversational chatbots and augmented reality avatars, applications such as Replika have started to enable everyday people to engage in romantic relationships with AI chatbots and talk to visual representations of their AI partners. While there has been a growing body of work exploring the motivations, practices, and benefits/risks of these conversational chatbots, the romantic side of things has been relatively underexplored. While much of the work has been about the why and the overall purpose of the romantic relationship, there has been less work that examines these from a relational stage perspective, and how these systems move in and across different relationship stages of development. This is especially important because communication scholars have long theorized that Romantic Relationships fall into a unique category of relationships, such that there are more discrete stages of coming together/apart, more risk/vulnerability in these relationships, and a wider range of interactions/negotiations over identity and interdependence. Through in-depth interviews with people who participate in an online forum ILoveMyReplika, this study aims to explore how people engage with the system romantically, how these systems craft messages that are indicative of different stages of relationships, and how people handle the movement and change across time with these systems. This piece will have important implications for our understanding of human machine relationships and human relationship stages generally, as well as implications for the design of social computing agents.</jats:p>",

Contemporary, quotidian, narrow AI/ML technologies are most frequently used by social media platforms for modeling and predicting human emotional expression as signals of interpersonal interaction and personal preference. Yet while the ethical and social impacts of ML/AI systems have of late become major topics of both public discussion and academic debate , the ethical dimensions of AI/ML analytics for emotional expression have been under-theorized in these conversations.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Through the case study of Amazon Ring's cameras, this paper explores the deepening material and discursive alliance between public and private institutions in the building of digital infrastructures that support the development of community surveillance. The analysis reveals a complex supply-chain network entangled with histories of settler-colonialism, racialization and gendered inequities. Bolstered by developments in cloud computing, concealing the human and nonhuman supply-chains, these systems are never detached from material inputs; rather, they are embedded in vast infrastructural systems and complex transnational supply chains powered by logics of extraction, circulation and accumulation of capital. I argue that Amazon Ring cameras are an articulation of “infrastructural power” defined by Laleh Khalili (2018: 915) as an assemblage of “practices, discourses, physical fixtures, laws and procedures” with the aim of (re)producing capitalist relations. Through a material and discursive analysis, this paper aims to draw into the light the complex human and non-human entanglements that constitute community surveillance networks in order to move towards an infrastructural critique so that we may more effectively evaluate the social costs of digital systems that can never be detached from their material and human creators.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For LGBTIQ+ people, the internet and social media are key channels for communicating and connecting with queer peers, and learning about queer life and queer experiences. While digital social spaces have evolved over the past 20 to 30 years, many of the motivations for using these platforms remain the same. This paper draws on data from the Scrolling Beyond Binaries study, centred on a national Australian survey of 1,304 young LGBTIQ+ people. We present key findings from the study examining generational differences across our four age cohorts of our young respondents: 16–20, 21–25, 26–30 and 30–35. Even among this group of young people, we find stark differences by age in self-identification related to gender and sexuality, and also patterns of difference in the social media platforms they use. Our younger respondents identify with much more fluid forms of gender and sexuality, and also tend to favour dating and hook-up apps that are more inclusive. We seek to foreground the ways in which the internet continues to be significant for our respondents for social connection and learning. We also add to our understandings of the complex and evolving ways in which young LGBTIQ+ people use and thus (re)produce digital social spaces, returning to Nina Wakeford’s (2000 [1997]) consideration of ‘cyberqueer spaces’.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online intermediaries have always been regulated, locked in heated battles around intermediary liability for copyright or privacy reasons (Tusikov, 2016; Gorwa 2019). But a notable trend is the rapidly growing use of policy to try and govern user-generated content with a host of other perceived social or individual harms, such as disinformation, hate speech, and terrorist propaganda (Kaye, 2019; York 2019; Suzor 2019). Even as increasing academic and policy attention is paid to the global ‘techlash’, and leading voices outlining the various ways in which expression online is currently under threat, our understanding of the overall policy landscape remains ad hoc and incomplete. The goal of this paper is thus to present some initial observations on the state of harmful content regulation around the world, drawing upon a new original dataset that seeks to capture the global universe of harmful-content regulatory initiatives for user-generated content online. The first part of the paper presents descriptive results, showing the evolution (and notable increase) in policy development in the past two decades. The second half of the paper provides insight into which specific issue areas have attracted the most formal and informal regulatory arrangements, and assesses the scope (what kind of actors are seen as being a ‘platform,’ and how that is defined), key policy mechanisms (takedown regimes, transparency rules, technical standards), and sanctioning procedures (fines, criminal liability) enacted in these regulations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cats at keyboards. Dancing hamsters. A photo of a dress, and videos set to “Harlem Shake.”  The above are recognizable as “viral” phenomena—artifacts of the early twenty-first century whose production and dissemination were facilitated by the internet, proliferating social media platforms, and ubiquitous digital devices. In this paper, I argue that participation in such phenomena (producing, consuming, circulating, or “sharing” them) constitutes a significant site of twenty-first-century musical practice: viral musicking, to borrow and adapt Christopher Small’s foundational 1998 coinage. In this paper I analyze instances of viral musicking from the 2000s through the 2010s, tracking viral circulation as heterogeneous, capacious, and contradictory—a dynamic, relational assemblage of both “new” and “old” media and practices. The notion of virus as a metaphor for cultural spread is often credited to computer science and science fiction, with subsequent co-option into marketing and media; such formulations run adjacent to the popularization of \"virus\" in philosophical models for globalization and pervasive capitalism across the late twentieth century, from Derrida to Baudrillard and Deleuze. In this paper, I seek to braid these lineages with the work of scholars reading cultural contagion through lenses of alterity and difference, situating music as a particularly felicitous vector for viral contagion, exceeding and preceding Internet circulation. Ultimately, I argue that viral musicking activates utopian promises of digital advocates, through the cooperative social operation of “sharing,” even as it resonates through histories and presents of racialization, miscegenation, appropriation, and the realities of porous, breachable borders, cultures, and bodies.</jats:p>",

    "title": "TIKTOK’S PEER PEDAGOGIES - LEARNING ABOUT BOOKS THROUGH #BOOKTOK        VIDEOS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper eschews normative constructions of formalized ‘online learning’ to argue that learning with ‘the internet’ is mostly vernacular, ordinary, messy and constant. It uses the example of #booktok short videos to argue that individuals frequently learn from and with peers in online spaces, where ‘peerness’ is defined broadly. The paper draws on traditions within education, media and communications research such as theories of media pedagogies that refuse to see learning as pedagogically isolated within formal learning arrangements. I build on these foundations to conceptualize how TikTok viewers learn about books and reading via ‘peer pedagogies’. ‘Peer Pedagogies’ recognizes that in digital contexts individuals often learn from other individuals, regardless of if the ‘teacher’ in the relationship is directly known to the learner, and regardless of if ‘teaching’ is intended or purposeful. For instance, peer pedagogies and learning are frequently central characteristics of the relationships that form between ‘micro-celebrities’ and their fans. The paper discusses findings from an ongoing nationally funded Australian study which is mapping the digital ecology of teen reading in Australia. The project argues that one avenue for teens to find out about books is on digital platforms via peer pedagogies. That is, teenagers may purposefully or casually learn about books and reading from everyday users and micro-celebrities on digital platforms. The TikTok #booktok hashtag is therefore being investigated to identify examples of how young people learn about books and reading via TikTok videos and associated communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering the importance of cross-platform circulation of web contents for digital methods-oriented research, in this study we aim to expand the types of digital objects used as ‘traffic tags’ by focusing on static images as traces of online associations. We pursue this goal through a methodological experiment with Google Cloud Vision API, a computing framework for visual content analysis. Its Web Detection module pairs typical computer vision operations with Google’s search mechanism, partly performing as a more specialized batch reverse image search engine. This feature thus allows to potentially retrieve images’ spread across the web. We discuss the implications of this non-verbal methodological approach by tracking the 'live' cross-platform circulation of images shared on Twitter in the context of 2018 FIFA World Cup Final Draw ceremony, held on December 2017. Following a novel methodological protocol, we ran several iterations of Vision API processing, thus generating a time series of URLs pointing to pages in which images matching the ones being processed were found. The study analyses in depth the circulation of four popular images about the broadcasted media event, observing their ‘live’ spreading dynamics as well as the computer vision API performance. Among the findings, we point out the adoption of images as 'traffic tags' for cross-platform analysis as a promising approach to study web circulation beyond language barriers and mainstream platforms. Also, we find relevant data to discuss the specificities of the API’s algorithms and its opacity as inherent issues of the digital methods approach.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the rise of Donald Trump leading up to the 2016 US\n        presidential election, political communication scholars have turned a critical eye towards\n        the role of conservative media outlets in the construction of an overarching meta-narrative,\n        largely referred to in the existing literature as the “deep story” (Hochschild, 2016). The\n        aim of the present study to extend this seminal work to analyze how mainstream,\n        conservative, and liberal outlets rely on meta-narratives to construct meaning in their\n        coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing qualitative methods, we analyze the coverage\n        that six American news outlets afforded the April 23rd 2020 Coronavirus Task Force news\n        briefing, where President Trump insinuated injections of disinfectant could be a useful way\n        to fight COVID-19. Our analysis includes 115 news articles, 41 Facebook posts and 87\n        television clips from these outlets. Our results reveal that both the left and right wing\n        media systems employed overarching narratives in their coverage. The left-wing media heavily\n        emphasized the tendency to deny or argue scientific fact among conservatives. In contrast,\n        we observed that the right-wing media constantly used similar framing strategies in an\n        attempt to vilify the left-wing media and liberals. Considering the existing literature\n        (Kreiss, 2018: Poletta &amp; Callahan, 2019), we observed many instances where right-wing\n        pundits and journalists relied on previously established heuristics, cuing audiences to\n        perceive the left-wing media as elitist out to discredit Trump. Our findings provide an\n        in-depth analysis of how partisan media relies on meta-narratives to convey meaning to their\n        audiences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study introduces a mixed-methods approach to classifying the visual frames of state-sponsored social media propaganda. We relied on Twitter’s Election Integrity data to sample five key propaganda targets of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), including Russian and American partisan groups. We manually coded profile images and subsequently applied qualitative and quantitative processing to the images. The visual motifs identified in IRA Twitter profiles allowed us to explore how their operations deviated from canonical state propaganda marked by symbols of national identify and heroic masculinity. Indeed, the results show that the visual frames employed by the Internet Research Agency are designed to embody the vox populi with relatable, familiar, or attractive faces of ordinary people. The results also show that IRA influence operations displayed cultural acuity and familiarity with the social identity of their targets, and that the visual narrative it crafted trafficked primarily in the tropes of regular guys or implausibly attractive young women. We discuss these findings and argue that state propaganda has effectively attuned to both subcultural and visual affordances of social platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The article aims to analyze the emergence of worker-owned platforms,\n        specifically delivery workers’ experiences, as one of the laboratories of platform labor and\n        the circulation of workers’ struggles Drawing on interviews with six cases in three\n        different countries (Spain, France and Brazil), the research highlights the commonalities,\n        specificities and challenges of platformizing delivery workers’ experiences in different\n        countries. The analysis consider following dimensions: productive processes and work\n        organization, technological challenges and building platforms, use of social media to\n        communicate with and organize workers, and the future of worker-owned experiences. The\n        initiatives had very different trajectories. In Spain, some cooperatives were born from\n        union struggles. In France, we saw a strong relationship with CoopCycle, a federation of\n        delivery co-ops that provides its own software based on the principles of digital commons.\n        And in Brazil, small collectives and co-ops that still depend on social media platforms to\n        execute their work are emerging. Despite different contexts, there are commonalities, such\n        as the low number of workers, the central role of social media for communicating and\n        organizing work, and the emergence of cooperation among cooperatives, which shows that scale\n        does not need to be a standard in platform economies. The conclusions point out there is an\n        ongoing and emerging process that can be the beginning of a broader process of reinventing\n        local economic circuits of production and consumption that involves digital platforms for\n        the common good.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platforms have long been under fire for how they create and enforce policies around hate speech, harmful content, and violence. In this study, we examine how three major platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) conceptualize and implement policies around how they moderate “harm,” “violence,” and “danger” on their platforms. Through a feminist discourse analysis of public facing policy documents from official blogs and help pages, we found that platforms are often narrowly defining harm and violence in ways that perpetuate ideological hegemony around what violence is, how it manifests, and who it affects. Through this governance, they continue to control normative notions of harm and violence, denying their culpability, and effectively manage perceptions of their actions and directing users’ understanding of what is “harmful” versus what is not. Rather than changing the mechanisms of their design that enable harm, the platforms reconfigure intentionality and causality to try to stop users from being “harmful,” which, ironically, perpetuates harm.</jats:p>",

This paper\n        proposes equitable approaches to the current digital ecosystem, that is built on the\n        extraction and profit-making of personal data, that can be developed by looking beyond the\n        current market, envisioning possibilities for related policies that could enable the\n        re-design of the current memory ecosystem towards social inclusion. The argument is based on\n        a combination of ethnographic research into initiatives that foster the openness of\n        knowledge by enabling fair practices to be realized in the competitive sphere of the digital\n        economy.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There was a time when one wanted to learn about Black religion you went to church, the Black Church to be more specific. The “all-in-one agency” which W.E. B. DuBois described the Black Church as certainly operated as a centralized and essential aspect of Black life. Its networks have come to signify Black believers’ emancipatory visions since its beginning during slavery in America. Today Black users’ contemporary engagement with digital technology has both broadened and complicated the scholarly understanding of the Black Church and Black religion to include more than its Christian manifestation. A number of works provide important theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of black digital use, digital structures of inequality, and counter-discourse production. On the topic of digital religion, works have emphasized the importance of digital technology in mediating religious experience. Yet, despite findings that people of African descent are often early adopters of technology, at the intersections of blackness, religion, and digital technology scholarly work remains sparse. This paper provides both a survey and framework for the study of digital Black religion. The work of Black religious media scholars is paired with that of Heidi Campbell and others writing on digital religion to offer a needed approach to the articulation and study of digital Black religion as a tradition rooted in notions of freedom.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This presentation draws on data from my forthcoming book with MIT\n        Press to demonstrate how heteronormative and cisnormative bias pervade Silicon Valley\n        culture, get embedded in benchmark datasets and machine learning algorithms, and get\n        formalized in company policies and labor practices surrounding content moderation. The\n        presentation begins with an examination of workplace culture at Google, gaining insights\n        from Department of Labor investigations, testimonials from previous employees, and informal\n        surveys and discourse analysis conducted by employees during the circulation of James\n        Damore's infamous 'Google memo'. The presentation then moves on to examine bias embedded in\n        benchmark datasets like WordNet and ImageNet, both of which served as the training datasets\n        for Google's Image Recognition algorithms (like GoogLeNet). Lastly, the presentation turns\n        to Facebook's heteronormative and cisnormative content moderation policies and the\n        outsourced labor practices it uses to institute what Facebook has described as 'human\n        algorithms' to review content in accordance with these policies. Throughout the presentation\n        I demonstrate that we can piece together information about proprietary code by looking to\n        leaked documents, public records, press releases, open-source code, and benchmark datasets,\n        all of which, in this instance, instigate a systemic heteronormative and cisnormative bias\n        that is increasingly being embedded in the internet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research explores how did influencers incorporate the Covid-19\n        pandemic into their regular content production on YouTube by specifically examining the\n        recent genre of \"quarantine vlog,\" which emerged in concurrence with global lockdowns. I\n        adopt a grounded theory approach to analyze the YouTube transcriptions of purposefully\n        selected 9 quarantine vlogs filmed by women influencers during the early months of the\n        pandemic, along with 250 user comments. My analysis shows that quarantine vlogs are\n        significantly different than ordinary vlogs. I draw on existing research on influencer\n        cultures to explain this dissimilarity as a tension between influencers' struggle to form an\n        intimacy with the viewers - which can have a soothing effect in a moment of a crisis - and\n        the use of vlogs as a neoliberal device in order to preserve their aspirational image. I\n        demonstrate that quarantine vlogs reveal that influencers are no longer able to perform an\n        aspirational ideal in their videos without first engaging with the mental stress, anxiety,\n        confusion, and loneliness brought by COVID-19 or apologizing for their relative privilege\n        and demonstrating sympathy towards their followers who are in hardship. At the same time, to\n        preserve their aspirational persona, they reframe the pandemic moment as an opportunity for\n        productivity and self-growth. As a result, influencers carry out substantial affective labor\n        and engage in a delicate self-governance to preserve their relevance and online visibility\n        during a global moment of crisis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The web and online information has become of utmost importance. However, the short lifespan of online data (with 40% of content being removed after 1 year) poses serious challenges for preserving and safeguarding digital heritage and information. Hence, web or media historians, sociologists or digital scholars must learn to \"dig\" in online sources such as the Internet Archive or national web archives in order to find relevant research material. In this paper, we explore the requirements of researchers working with web archives and outline how they perceive the limitations and possibilities of using the archived web as a data resource, using survey data (n=154). We asked researchers with and without experience in working with web archives for, amongst others, the search functionalities and selection and access criteria they require. Given that archived web content is relatively new research material, new skills need to be acquired to work with this content which is not something evident or something every researcher is willing to do. Yakel &amp; Thores (2003) point to three distinct forms of knowledge required to work effectively with these sources: (i) domain (subject) knowledge, (ii) artifactual literacy, and their own concept of (iii) archival intelligence. In addition to arriving at significant findings that demonstrate the relationship between researcher’s domain (subject) knowledge, archival intelligence and use frequency of web archives, this study discusses the limitations of using the archived web as a data resource and concludes with actions to overcome these hurdles and fulfill the desiderata of scholars.</jats:p>",

Through a critical discourse\n        analysis of three podcasts and interviews with podcasters, this paper argues that the Black,\n        Christian podcast circuit is a counterpublic (Squires, 2002) that seeks to change Christian\n        culture in America. I argue that it is the affordances of the medium of podcasting that make\n        this counterpublic possible and that make it a potent force for changing the Christian\n        conversation about race. These podcasters offer a portrait of a divided Christian church in\n        need of repair and they make the case that repair is only possible through decolonizing the\n        Christian faith, repenting and offering reparations for the racial trauma caused by white\n        Christians, sparking Christians’ activist inclinations in favor of racial justice causes,\n        and interrogating and correcting sexism within both the Black church and white evangelical\n        culture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Few online communities exhibit the tensions between independence and interdependence better than collegiate esports. Twitch, the primary platform for live streaming esports, is central in such strife. The platform is a vital tool for colleges and athletes to forward brand, community, and entrepreneurship, while simultaneously its unbridled use indicates the need for administration and institutional interventions by universities. As such the proposed study aims to illuminate how collegiate esports clubs, including players, administrators, and program directors, use Twitch to promote independence and interdependence with esports publishers, players, fans, and college culture. Preliminary findings from 19 interviews with athletes and directors suggest some commonalities, particularly in optimism about the platform as a tool for entree into the industry. However, beyond this, directors and athletes diverged when it came to how Twitch should be employed, the labor required to successfully navigate the program, and concerns over toxic behavior associated with competitive gaming that manifested during live play. Finally, grey areas colored the interdependency between Twitch and the university. Monetization and use of streams were not clearly articulated, along with undefined policies on how to act professionally and represent universities on the platform. Ultimately, these early findings point to the lack of knowledge and flexibility of institutions like universities as they increasingly rely on platforms to foster online and offline communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study addresses how creative workers’ social media presence\n        affects their understandings of professional agency. Focusing on Finnish professional\n        actors, we ask how social media practices inform and shape actors’ occupational\n        self-conceptions and professional belongings. In the theoretical framework, we employ Baym’s\n        notion of relational labour and read it through Berlant’s (1998) conceptualisation of\n        intimacy as mobile attachments. The data is collected from 15 Finnish actors, eight\n        freelancers and seven theatre employees, from June 2020 to March 2021 by using the\n        diary-interview method. The analysis is based on a close reading of the interview material\n        and diary entries in which participants describe their experiences and feelings concerning\n        their presence, work-related connections, and promotion on Facebook and Instagram. The study\n        indicates that for both theatre actors and freelancers their social media activities are\n        entwined in their sense of professionalism and belongings to occupational communities of\n        peers. They negotiate and speculate about their social media presence in relation to peer\n        assessments in a way that involves continuous movements between visibility and invisibility\n        and between independence and interdependence. Our study suggests that to understand the\n        ambivalences involved in creative workers’ presence on social media platforms, it is\n        important to broaden the investigation from strategic self-promotion and audience engagement\n        to questions of professional identities and communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Having reduced the cost of political activism, social media has provided room for ordinary citizens to engage in politics, build networks, spread information, and resist oppressive regulation (Howard &amp; Hussain, 2013; Margetts et al., 2016). The ideas of connective action (Bennett &amp; Segerberg, 2012) and hashtag activism (Jackson et al., 2020) are recent endeavors to theorize such transitions. However, the existing literature has overemphasized the positive side of social media platforms, in particular Twitter, in challenging inequalities, as well as in giving voice to marginalized groups (Lindgren, 2019; Wonneberger et al., 2020). While scholars, to a lesser extent, investigated how social media are used to suppress online protest from a normative and more general standpoint (Gunitsky, 2015), the ways that a connective action could be disrupted, e.g., by state actors has not received much scholarly attention yet. This has become particularly important in recent years, as several governments across the globe have adopted new tactics to dismantle connective actions, such as the coordinated dissemination of fake news. This study sheds light on such disruptive processes by investigating how a connective action in the Iranian Twittersphere (revolving around #rape , i.e., Iranian #MeToo) was derailed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID pandemic’s impact on professional wrestling has come in many forms. Like other forms of sports and entertainment, professional wrestling is very dependent on physical interactions to produce content. So, what happens when wrestlers, who work as independent contractors, cannot engage in such physical labor? Fortunately, many had already been utilizing existing social media platforms as additional sources of income to supplement what they receive from their wrestling, trading on their characters and brands under neoliberal approaches to revenue generation. Their online work often aligns with their physical work, as the actual wrestling they perform is only a small fraction of their revenue-generating labor. From selling merchandise to selling themselves, the panel explores how professional wrestling uses these technologies to further their physical businesses and practices. The panel will critically explore these online activities to understand how such technologies mediate the relationship between promotions, wrestlers, and fans while also reflecting late-stage capitalist and neoliberal ideological perspectives on the Internet. This panel considers how these independent contractors have turned to neoliberal platforms and practices, even before the pandemic, to maintain a living, and the extent to which what they have done to survive operates as a template for more people in post-industrial societies operating under similar conditions.</jats:p>",

Developers seek\n        relations with other game workers and players through the process of making, researching,\n        testing, and showing their videogames. Their responses draw on biographical self-reflexivity\n        and are articulated within a network sociality that conceives the individual developer as\n        the agent of change. The development of videogames about mental health is interpreted by the\n        participants as facilitating exchanges of autobiographical experiences that are otherwise\n        regulated by the norms of professional networking. At the same time, these exchanges aim at\n        the establishment of new forms of sociality and at a fairer and more inclusive videogame\n        industry.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked passionate debate worldwide on\n        matters of public health. A portion of this debate has been dedicated to the efficacy of\n        masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of health officials agree that\n        wearing a mask is efficacious, there has been a widespread movement against masks. The\n        “anti-mask” movement is often characterized for spreading misinformation about masks and for\n        its overlap with the anti-vaccine movement. This paper focuses on the mask sentiments of the\n        anti-vaccination community prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this paper is to\n        identify if the anti-vaccination movement held prior beliefs about masks to prevent the\n        spread of respiratory diseases and if those beliefs differ from their mask sentiment today.\n        Through thematic analysis of 44 Instagram posts prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n        we find that online vaccine safety communities have, in the past, regarded mask-wearing as a\n        viable alternative to vaccines. Notably, posts supported the efficacy of mask-wearing while\n        criticizing the mandates to wear masks in healthcare settings. In this paper, we elaborate\n        on these mask narratives, as well as their implications in how the anti-vaccination group\n        had a dramatic shift in mask sentiment during the pandemic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms play an increasing role in politics,\n        facilitating the circulation of populist texts disseminated by politicians, official\n        campaign media, and user-generated content, all of which contribute to voters’ perceptions\n        of politicians and political issues. The networks and affordances of social media platforms\n        allow for the development of an individualized, affective connection with voters, which is a\n        particularly important strategy for far-right politicians, who are often stigmatized.\n        Furthermore, social media enables the circulation of user-generated materials in a form of\n        digital political participation, allowing citizens to respond in real-time to political\n        developments. While digital political participation ostensibly offers the potential for the\n        expression of marginalized perspectives, digital texts predominantly emphasize and enforce\n        existing hierarchies, particularly the supremacy of whiteness. This panel explores visuals\n        and memes circulated on social media through the lenses of platform studies, whiteness\n        studies, nostalgia, and Critical Discourse Analysis. By examining both “top-down” media\n        disseminated by public figures and “bottom-up” user-generated content, this panel provides\n        an in-depth understanding of the social media ecosystems that work to preserve and extend\n        far-right values and white supremacy. Rachel Winter focuses on the influence of official\n        campaign materials on user-generated content, as well as the impacts of both on candidate\n        image management and the racial hierarchy of the United States. An analysis of\n        representations of race in user-generated Rafael “Ted” Cruz and Robert “Beto” O’Rourke memes\n        reveals an embedded valuation of whiteness and white supremacy to the detriment of other\n        racial demographics. Political memes collected from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr,\n        and Reddit uphold the importance of the white racial identity of candidates and, in so\n        doing, attempt to preserve White American identities from the perceived threat of\n        multiculturalism embodied in racially diverse politicians and their constituents. Julia\n        DeCook examines nostalgia and chronotopes in alt-right memes, contending that the emphasis\n        on “tradition” over “progress” is an attempt to unify the alt-right and preserve white\n        identity and supremacy from threats of globalization and feminism. The alt-right creates\n        virtual nation-states that use consistent linguistic strategies to enable these groups to\n        engage in a form of collective action. Examining white supremacist memes from Reddit and\n        Instagram, Panelist 2 explores the ways that time, memory, and the abstract conception of\n        “the past” are used in digital propaganda to appeal to younger voters and emphasize the myth\n        that whiteness must be protected from the threat of multiculturalism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the platform age, copyright protected contents are primarily\n        disseminated over the internet. This model poses various challenges to the copyright regime\n        that was mainly designed in and for the analogue age. One of these challenges is related to\n        the fair balance between the interests of rightholders and other members of the society.\n        Copyright norms try to guarantee the high level of protection of rightholders and preserve\n        some flexibility for the benefit of end-users. These flexibilities range from statutory\n        limitations and exceptions (e.g., private use); resales (covered by the doctrine of\n        exhaustion); or complaint-and-redress mechanisms. Platforms, with their private norms,\n        especially end-user license agreements (EULAs), might effectively enforce that balance in\n        their role as intermediaries in the chain of (e-)commerce. In our research, conducted within\n        the frames of the „reCreating Europe” H2020 project, we focused on how these private norms\n        allow for or diminish the exercise of user flexibilities. We collected, analysed and\n        compared twenty private ordering practices. The analysed platforms include streaming sites\n        with or without host function for end-users; online video game stores and other online\n        marketplaces; and social media. Our empirical examination demonstrates that the\n        intermediaries, in line with their technical nature and business model, offer substantive\n        flexibilities for their consumers, on the one hand, and they meaningfully limit the\n        possibilities and decrease the expectations of end-users by restricting certain uses and\n        providing limited access to contents, on the other hand. Based on our findings, we measured\n        the user-friendliness of the selected platforms.</jats:p>",

Examining Chinese and English journal articles studying Douyin and\n        TikTok, we address three research questions: Firstly, what are the disciplinary approaches\n        and methodologies employed by researchers in studying Douyin and TikTok? Secondly, what are\n        the foci of research questions put forth by researchers? Thirdly, how is the academic\n        scholarship on these platforms developing independently? In terms of disciplinary leanings,\n        Douyin publications tended to be published by scholars in the humanities and social sciences\n        while TikTok and comparative publications demonstrated a broader scope of disciplinary\n        leanings. Regarding methodology, Douyin publications tended to employ qualitative ones.\n        Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed approaches for TikTok publications were more balanced.\n        Qualitative and quantitative approaches were observed in comparative publications. Data\n        collection methods across publications included digital fieldwork, surveys, interviews,\n        experiments, media texts, and ethnography; while data analyses included content, thematic,\n        statistical, network, critical discourse, and descriptive forms of analyses. Regarding\n        research questions, articles on Douyin tended to engage with e-commerce, the development of\n        short form videos, and practices, cultures and communities. Articles on TikTok tended to\n        engage with platform logics and governance concerns, fame, virality and influencers, and\n        representation of events or information. Comparative publications tended to engage with\n        platformization, expression of cultural differences, fan engagement strategies and factors\n        underlying app usage. Finally, academic scholarship on Douyin and TikTok are largely based\n        in independent geographic regions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Beyond enabling participatory forms of memory-making, digital media reconfigure power relations in memory construction. In the Philippines, we witness this through the hashtag network #ArawNgMagnakakaw (‘Day of Thieves’) to counter the heroic commemoration of the dictator Ferdinand Marcos sanctioned by the state and supported by online networks that distort and deny his crimes during his 20-year regime. This case illustrates not only how digital media facilitates the negotiation of memory by non-institutional actors, but also how it sets the conditions to resist elite narratives through non-conventional ways of remembering. This study examines the performance of counter-memory (Foucault, 1977) in the intersection of networked publics, counter-narratives, and technologies of memories. We investigate the hashtag network #ArawNgMagnanakaw by mapping its social network and analyzing its discourses as digital practices (Jones, Chik &amp; Hafner, 2015). We argue that the network derives its power from neither elite nor collective actions, but through connective action of structures, discourses and practices of remembrance. Firstly, the locus of analysis shifts from a single actor (‘who remembers’) to the assemblage (‘what enacts the remembering’) as an agent of counter-memory, with technology shaping its possibilities and boundaries. Secondly, the assemblage’s resistance to elite commemoration surfaces silenced and neglected historical narratives (‘what is remembered’) through affective articulations of protest and subversive commemorative practices (‘how is it remembered’). We theorize the ‘assemblage of counter-memory’ as the connective, discursive, and material assemblage that enact political agency to privilege marginalized narratives and play an active role in the (re)construction of memory.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Competitive professional computer gaming or “eSports” has grown rapidly over the past decade, and has extended into collegiate play, where educational institutions have begun sponsoring eSports teams, leagues, and events. However, the expansion of eSports has been accompanied by concerns regarding the online gaming culture from which eSports proceeds. Copious research establishes that women are routinely subjected to gender-based harassment in computer games and game-related activity. In the context of American collegiate eSports, this implicates the law of educational equality known as “Title IX.” Institutions subject to Title IX are required to maintain a learning environment in which educational opportunities are not impeded by sexual harassment, which will be required of eSports as it has long been required for physical sports. Yet, unlike sports played in physical space, computer games are necessarily mediated by software, which has consistently been held to constitute protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In this paper we examine the First Amendment constraints on the regulation of eSport computer games under Title IX. We argue that to the extent that choices among gaming content may be dictated by the constraints of Title IX, care must be exercised to accommodate both the statutory requirements of educational opportunity and the constitutional requirements for expressive freedom.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Imagining alternatives to the thoroughly networked contemporary\n        everyday is not easy. In our research project, we tackled this problem by developing an\n        ‘imagining workshop’ method and applying it in an experimental study with young people. In\n        this paper, we present methodological reflections based on these imagining experiments. Our\n        paper contributes to nascent research that explores and experiments with so-called\n        speculative methods in the field of critical media and infrastructure studies. We are\n        interested in whether the dynamic of hegemony that actualizes in mediated daily practices\n        can be questioned, and alternatives imagined to ‘how things are’. We seek to do this by\n        bringing together perspectives from speculative fiction and critical media infrastructure\n        studies. Our key methodological question is: “how could we as researchers create\n        interventionist methods to spark imagination and inspire (self-)reflective thinking in\n        people about their mediated everyday?” In the paper, we highlight two major observations\n        from the workshops. First, while projecting alternatives to future mediated everyday proved\n        challenging for the participants, it sparked vibrant discussions on the contemporary\n        networked society’s bleak sides. A challenge we observed is that the act of imagining does\n        not necessarily mean that what is co-produced in playful workshop settings are\n        counter-hegemonic narratives of the future. Second, our study highlights that young people\n        have concerns about their mediated everyday life, and these concerns emphasize the need to\n        actively seek alternatives to ‘how things are’. The concerns were related to privacy and\n        dataveillance, and lack of safe online spaces, fairly manufactured devices, and\n        possibilities to disconnect.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This case study pairs a walkthrough analysis of two popular virtual\n        learning environments (VLEs) (Zoom and WebEx) with undergraduate responses (n=250) to an\n        open-ended survey to investigate how VLE affordances impact student identifications and\n        quality of learning. Previous research has found that interaction and social presence are\n        necessary for learning online, but professors find these relationships difficult to achieve\n        when students will not, or cannot, turn on their cameras. Preliminary findings include three\n        main themes. First, students find Zoom more user-friendly because it is designed to look\n        like popular social media apps, yet they are still not comfortable being visible. Second,\n        many students are concerned about their classmates and professors seeing their physical\n        backgrounds, particularly those who reported having family incomes below $50,000.\n        Subsequently, they rarely turn on their cameras. Third, BIPOC who identify as women fear\n        being judged based on their physical appearance and also choose to rarely turn on their\n        cameras. This study is one of the first to explore VLE affordances and their impact on\n        identities. Early analyses point to already marginalized groups feeling the pains that came\n        with the shift to online learning more acutely. Professors and universities should provide\n        training for identity personalization and find ways to invite students to participate that\n        do not include mandatory cameras.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms are under increasing pressure to counter racist and other extremist discourses online. The perceived \"independence\" of platforms such as YouTube has attracted AltRight \"micro-celebrities\" (Lewis, 2020) that build alternative networks of influence. This paper examines how the discourses of one online AltRight \"manfluencer\" responds to tightening controls over allowable speech. We present analysis of the YouTube channel of the Swedish far right bodybuilder and motivational speaker Marcus Follin, or \"The Golden One\". His specific approach to politics includes fitspiration, motivational speaking, and other kinds of neoliberal technologies of the self that in his ideology come together as a call to defend white motherlands and join hands between European nations to fight against globalism and multiculturalism. Through conducting post-foundational discourse analysis of a corpus of 40 videos, we identify three prominent strategies that he uses to respond to increased control of online spaces. The first is to increase cultural encryption, constructing social media as territories in a “metapolitical” war will be won culturally. The second is partial articulation, where he stays focused on positive messages, and his ideology is explained as being about love, not hate. The third is migration, diversification, and new platform-specific foci, through which he finds new and ‘independent’ online spaces and builds new audiences. We conclude that we need more nuanced understandings of how far right ideologies might thrive and build resilience in response to pressure on their speech.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>AOIR 2021 conference theme “independence” of the internet provides an opportunity for researchers to reevaluate internet development in the global south by applying theories of “informational capitalism” (Castells, 2000; Schiller, 2000) and “surveillance capitalism” (Suboff, 2019). This paper aims to trace the development of informational society in Mongolia, a 30-year-old democracy in the Central Asian steppe. With a nomadic culture, a Buddhist tradition, and a communist past, Mongolia’s information society has unique encounters with global corporations such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM). The paper focuses on juxtapositions of information society with traditional, cultural, political, and social aspects of Mongolian life. I establish how Mongolia is positioned in various global information society perspectives, by investigating tensions that have not been addressed in this nation’s context of a communist past and an ongoing nomadic lifestyle. I also trace the historic development of information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives during the socialist and post-communist eras. Online speech controversies, misinformation, and commercial speech on social media all tested Mongolia’s new Constitution of 1992. The constitution promulgates a free press and the freedom of speech in the zeitgeist of the 1990s to prioritize the eradication of communist-era political censorship and communist party control. One cannot help but notice the gap in the legal frameworks of Mongolian institutions between the current and the “aspired to” states of democratization and protection of human rights and cultural experiences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Visual politics is becoming increasingly salient online. The\n        qualitative methods of the research tradition do not expand to complex media ecologies, but\n        advances in deep neural networks open an unprecedented path to large-scale analysis on the\n        basis of actual visual content. However, the analysis of social visuals is challenging,\n        since social and political scenes are semantically rich and convey complex narratives and\n        ideas. This paper examines validity conditions for integrating deep neural network tools in\n        the study of digitally augmented social visuals. It argues that the complexity of social\n        visuals needs to be reflected in the validation process and its communication: It is\n        necessary to move beyond the conventionally dichotomous approach to neural network\n        validation which focuses on data and neural network respectively, to instead acknowledge the\n        interdependency between data and tool. The final definition of good data is not available\n        until the end of the process, which itself relies on a tool that needs good data to be\n        trained. Themes change during the process not just because of our interaction with the data,\n        but also because of our interactions with the tool and the specific way in which it mediates\n        our analysis. An upshot is that the conventional approach of performance assessment – i.e.,\n        counting errors – is potentially misleading in this context. We explore our argument\n        experimentally in the context of a study that addresses climate communication on YouTube.\n        Climate themes such as polar bear in arctic landscapes and elite people/events present tough\n        cases of social visuals.</jats:p>",

The final dataset consists of 220 groups, 32967 members and 2386 events from 2011 until now (Jan 2019). The results suggest the presence of clearly identifiable European hubs for IoT development but a worldwide crowd of users. From a temporal perspective the MeetUp data shows how IoT exploded in 2015 and how it might have peaked in 2017. Within this period of time IoT has not been a “stable technology” but as evolved incorporating, within its area of “related topics” new and emerging technologies such as Cryptocurrency or cloud computing.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this panel is to examine the analytical and empirical relevance of the “visibility lens” for Internet research. In the past decade, researchers have started to take a specific interest in the constitutive role of online visibility in the organization of social reality. Studies have underlined the fundamental role of visibility afforded by digital technologies in the social recognition or exclusion of individuals, groups, and communities. They have also identified visibility and its management as being constitutive of social identities, relations, and practices among actors in a variety of fields. So far, Internet researchers have provided various definitions and operationalizations of online visibility. For example, visibility can be apprehended as both a political lever for individuals and collectives or as a conceptual category for researchers to make sense of social reality. Visibility is also frequently associated with digital materiality. As such, it is sometimes used as a criterion to categorize digital technologies regarding the control they allow for users to manage and disclose personal contents or activities. Furthermore, visibility can also be conceptualized as an affordance that is enabled by the functionalities of digital technologies and enacted through their situated uses. In this panel, presenters will raise theoretical, methodological, and ethical issues linked to visibility by drawing from a series of case studies. They will then draw similarities and contrasts between cases, as well as discuss the implications and, indeed, the relevance of formalizing the lens of visibility in the field of Internet research.</jats:p>",

At the very least, these flows are increasingly symbiotic, where television networks harness preexisting viral interest online to bolster ratings. However, the networks might also be considered parasitic, exploiting viral children for ratings in a fashion they and their carers may not have been prepared for. In tracing the trajectory of Sophia Grace and Rosie from viral success to The Ellen Show we highlight these complexities, whilst simultaneously raising concerns about the long-term impact of these trajectories on the children being made increasingly and inescapably visible across a range of networks and platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As community anchors and public spaces, libraries are in unique positions to serve emerging 21st century information needs for the unconnected. Some libraries have extended their technology offerings beyond basic computers and Internet to include mobile hotspot lending, which allows patrons to \"take home\" the Internet from the library. The research in this project examines hotspot lending programs undertaken by the Maine State Library and the Kansas State Library across 24 different libraries in small and rural communities. In the United States, rural areas tend to have lower Internet adoption because many communities face considerable barriers to competitive and fast Internet service, exacerbated by the fact that rural communities tend to be older, of lower-income, and less digitally skilled. This research examines the role of library hotspot lending and how free and mobile-based Internet connects rural communities and serves their information needs. Through qualitative and quantitative assessments this research details the scope and efficacy of programs to reach publics, the impact that rural hotspots have in communities, and the larger information and communications ecosystem in these rural communities in Maine and Kansas.</jats:p>",

Part of this approach entails taking a holistic, narrative approach to investigating everyday life (Ingold, 2000; 2006; 2011) which some scholars have applied to digital media use (Moores 2017; Sumartojo et al. 2016; Pink 2016, 2015; Pink &amp; Leder Mackley 2013; Pink 2011). We believe task-orientation offers a flexible way to define tasks performed online and offline encompassing three interrelated themes: 1) the processional quality of tool use; 2) the synergy of practitioner, tool, and material; and, 3) the coupling of perception and action. Our focus for this project is an investigation into how people perform unfamiliar tasks with digital media using the four processional phases. Unfamiliar tasks are an inherent part of our digitally-mediated everyday life to the extent that we have learned to ‘cope’ (see Sigaut 1994; see Ingold, 2000, p. 332; see also Nicolosi &amp; Falsaperna, 2015, p. 71) with them — making them, in turn, one of our most ubiquitous and essential digital skills.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, I have sought to introduce and outline the trend in Internet meme-making know as 'deep-frying' and explain its significance as a method of user critique within a naturalized medium. How do images that confuse and repel the casual viewer through profanity, enthusiastic emoji usage, over-saturation, repeated compression, bubbling/ warping, and excessive lens flaring effectively question the memetic paradigm? Firstly, by understanding memes as Hito Steryl's transgressive 'poor images' that circulate to produce communities of content creators and consumers that stand in opposition to the state-sponsored rich image making complex. Further, through the application of work by Rolande Barthes, Claude Shannon &amp; Warren Weaver, Scott Contreras-Kotterbay &amp; Łukasz Mirocha, and Rosa Menkman, I have produced a critical examination of the formal practices that elucidate this phenomenon, on the level of the linguistic &amp; iconic message, noise level, and redundancy. Lastly, I propose an orientation of these works within a diverse corpus across various major social media as a networked art practice in keeping with the tenants of the New Aesthetic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As justice-minded academics, we want to understand the role of social media in civil society with a vested interest in ensuring that social media serves a pluralistic society fairly and equitably. Gillespie (2018) has helped frame this task in terms of both governance of platforms and by platforms, but we also want to know what state governments do with social media (Gorwa, 2019). This paper focuses on how social media companies cooperate with state governments to hold users criminally liable, and the lessons this case bears for understanding and improving the fairness and equity of judicial governance. We draw on interviews with twenty public criminal defenders in NYC in which we asked: 1) where social media appears in their cases and the role it plays; 2) their access to user content and social media companies; and, 3) how they use social media as evidence and defend against it. We identified three problem areas around fair and equal access to the law. First, we heard concerns that the cooperation of social media companies was asymmetrical because companies worked almost exclusively with law enforcement. Second, public defenders were upset about overly broad search warrants that furnished the full contents of a suspect’s social media account. Third, public defenders complained about the use and admission of prejudicial evidence that played to negative, racial stereotypes of their clients. We suggest several reforms for judicial governance, including more nearly equitable cooperation practices, restrictions on search warrants, and admissibility protocols and disclaimers on admitted materials.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Smart speakers such as the Google Home have the seemingly magical capacity to respond to user invocations in natural language. I argue that these are invocationary acts. In terms of Austin’s speech act theory, smart speakers interpret what the user says (locutionary: speech-to-text), what their statement does (illocutionary: artificial intelligence), and attempt fulfil the obligation of the user’s command (perlocutionary: AI &amp; text-to-speech). The smart speaker responds with its own speech acts; in Searle’s terms it might assert facts (representatives: e.g. answering a factual question), ask the user to do something (directive, e.g. asking a question in a quiz game) communicate a psychological state (expressive: e.g. answering the question ‘Do you love me?’), commit to a future action (commissive: e.g setting a timer) or make a declaration (such as confirming a purchase). User invocations are most often directives, and are most often initiated with the ‘wake word’ ‘Hey Google’. The computer’s response comes automatically through what I call invocationary acts. In this case, the user’s invocation is answered by the evocation of synthesised speech, sound, music and/or images. Drawing on an analysis of 300 commands drawn from online publications, I developed a typology of invocationary acts: Search, Lookup, Error, Media, Third party search, Location, User data, Random, Scripted response (often randomly selected from multiple answers), Interaction (applications such as a tutorial or a game), Device (controlling media, or smart home devices) and Clock. This analysis points to the limitations of the voice user interface paradigm.</jats:p>",

Youth expressed both high levels trust and distrust in traditional telephone calling in relation to impromptu calling. Unknown impromptu calls were associated with telemarketers, creating high levels of distrust in the medium of telephony. Impromptu calls from known contacts indicated a level of urgency and seriousness.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This presentation examines how the softwarization of everyday life is experienced. The point of embarkation is the observation that despite the proliferation computation in the everyday, people pay little attention to the conditions of software and its role in shaping their mundane time-spaces. I will discuss results from a case study that used Henri Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis (1992/2004) to shed light on how the rhythms of code-based technology are experienced. The research design of the intervention was inspired by the idea of privacy mirrors (Ngueyn and Mynatt 2002). Research participants (n=13), who described their relation to their devices as intense, used tracking software (RescueTime, ManicTime, App Usage or RealizD) in their ICTs and kept media diaries. These were used as artefacts in the interviews to enable reflection on the role of ICTs in daily life. The results from the rhythmanalysis show how the complex intertwinement of digital devices and applications in the everyday evokes manifold feelings. Simultaneously, technology is perceived as an aid in organizing and managing the daily life, but it also induces feelings of losing control, chaos, and burden. The results suggest that although people might take for granted the infrastructural conditions of technology, such as data mining, they still actively negotiate their relation to devices and applications vis-à-vis temporality. Outcomes from the intervention encourage developing further research designs that use the means of softwarization itself (e.g. tracking and digital traces) to enable critical reflection.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach (media studies, computer science, and legal scholarship) for the analysis of systems that rely on AI components as central components of their design. Taking recommender systems more generally and the one built by YouTube more specifically, we develop a methodology for conceptualizing and studying the broad array of “ideas”, “norms”, or “values” such systems mobilize. Instead of limiting ourselves to a narrow understanding of these terms, we take into account, for example, translations from economic models, social theories, legal requirements, ethical principles, technical knowledge, experiential evaluations, or other constructs used to define and justify design goals and decisions that shape the production of technical objects and, consequently, the object themselves. In this paper we discuss three directions for analysis and present first results. Investigating technical knowledge includes the study of scholarly literature and experimentation with concrete objects such as LensKit for Python to understand the “ambient” knowledge and normativity engineers and designers draw on. Investigating local circumstances involves ethnographic analysis, but also the reconstruction of the business models and legal environment that weigh on YouTube’s design. Analyzing a system in use can draw on technical observation, via scraping or API data, of the actual dynamics of recommendation that emerge when users enter into the equation. Taken together, these three approaches can “encircle” the various moments where value(s) are shaped and put into work in the context of systems where direct access to specifications is improbable.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, I use Spotify as a case study to investigate user experiences of music exploration and discovery using streaming services and recommendation algorithms. Following the framing of music discovery as an affective response which allows for the categorization and definition of music, I draw upon qualitative data from Spotify users regarding their ephemeral experiences when exploring music using streaming services. I identify user practices of music archiving and collecting as a strategy to mitigate these transient encounters by slowing down the pace of their music consumption and creating enduring connections between music and their individual histories. In this way, personal music collections were found to support instances of music discovery as they created a listening context and user mindset which was sympathetic the affective definition and categorization of new music content. This investigation of collecting practice also revealed longitudinal perspectives on music discoveries which emerge through sustained listening over time, drawing attention to listener’s social surroundings, friends and online communities as the impetus for choosing to give particular music content time to grow towards being discovered. The paper concludes with implications of the use of algorithmic recommendation systems in the delivery and consumption of music and other cultural forms.</jats:p>",

Theoretically, the panel is based on the notion that society and everyday life are increasingly intertwined with and enrolled in both the logics of the health and pharmaceutical industry and in communication technology and media. Femininities have long been the subjects for the (bio)medicalizing, and conversely, up until the release of Viagra, privileged or hegemonic masculinities were left seemingly unaffected. At the same time, to understand masculinity today we must also consider how media technologies take part in the negotiation, practice, and affect of masculinities. To do so the panel presents four cases of mediatized and medicalized masculinities: Mie Birk Jensen uses analyze thousands of spam emails for their affective and normative production of virile masculinity; Tobias Raun and Michael Nebeling Petersen use ethnographic archive analysis of Youtube communities to understand peer learning and monetization of hair-loss products; and Kristian Møller uses participant observation to capture the sexual intensification in an online gay drug scene.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few years, Facebook has found itself mired in out controversy after the next. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the company received criticism when it was revealed that Russian groups had created fraudulent social media accounts on their site in order to interfere with the elections – creating anti-Hillary groups, groups stoking fears of minority populations, and materials accusing the Democratic Party of voter fraud in an attempt to discourage voter turn-out. The question is, how did we get to this point; the point where foreign entities are affecting political outcomes in other countries through a website created by a private American corporation on a media platform wherein the lines between the cultures and legal systems of different countries is sometimes difficult to draw? To answer this, I look to the policies written by the U.S. Government in the 1990s on the issue of internet governance. I argue that the focus on including commercial interests in these early governance structures has had a lasting impact on the ways in which the internet operates to this day. In considering recent controversies that stem from the blurring lines of online sovereignty, wherein commercial and governmental interests become interwoven without a clear sense of who bears the responsibility when the system operates against the interests of its users, it becomes essential to consider the historical foundations which may have led to this moment.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE ECOLOGY OF LATINX TWITTER",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitter is a conduit of culture. A miscellany of networked communities where participants reinforce and/or dismantle socially constructed ideas and narratives. For nearly a decade, studies on the uses and gratifications, and sociality of ethnic-centered networks in the U.S. have emerged. The body of literature is interdisciplinary and largely discusses Black Twitter (Brock, 2012; Florini, 2013; Sharma, 2013; Clarke, 2014; Lee, 2017), and to a lesser extent, Asian-American Twitter (Lopez, 2016). Conversely, research on Latinx Twitter is scarce (Novak, Johnson, &amp; Pontes, 2016; Slaughter, 2016; Rosenbaum, 2018). As the second largest Spanish speaking country in the world, Latinx make up 18% of the U.S. population – the nation’s largest minority group (Pew Research Center, 2017). Often described in monolithic terms, Latinx epitomizes diversity. The pan-ethnicity represents over 21 nationalities, and a host of European and Indigenous languages, in which regional dialects are blended with African tongues to varying degrees. We take the position that prior to conducting behavioral focused analyses on Latinx Twitter, the network’s ecology must be defined. This means, to understand how the network of tens of ethnicities and heritages has self-organized. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to augment existing scholarship by exploring its ecology. Through a content analysis and interviews with six Latinx and Afro-Latinx women (18-24 years old) attending a Predominately White Institution (PWI) in U.S. South, we identified three major ecological themes: (1) Seeking Latinx Twitter; (2) Mega Network versus Sub-Networks; and (3) Implications for Monolithic Narratives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2018, Schweppes partnered with Ogilvy Brazil to design a smart dress that used touch-sensors to illustrate how women are groped in nightclubs (Dickson 2018). The dress is a strong example of a host of digital devices that mobilise smart technology to legitimate women’s testimony of sexual assault in public space. It also belongs to a growing category of technology closely attached to the body and designed to either protect it from harm or lend credence to previously silenced publics.&#x0D;\nDevices like the Ogilvy dress draw attention to the marginalisation of victims’ voices; it owes its existence to institutions of power refusing to listen to women’s testimony. However, the devices also reinscribe the same silencing dynamic by positioning themselves as necessary and more “reliable” evidence of women’s experience than their verbal statements. These devices are sorely undertheorized as potential erosions of the legitimacy of individual testimony and experience that are part of digital culture more broadly speaking (Couldry 2010). The devices are also problematically framed as “solutions” to broader and contextually-sensitive social issues in ways that reify their power dynamics. These devices materialise a relationship among the wearer, bodily threat, and the corporate brand selling the device as a means to further brand recognition and to cohere associations among the brand, a social cause and, perhaps most enticingly, its solution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper critically assesses current regimes of internet governance and the role of internet freedom rankings therein. In particular, it aims to initiate a debate ultimately leading to the development of a ground-breaking comparative framework for assessing internet policy, departing from the assumption that current frameworks for measuring internet freedom are predicated too strictly on the dichotomy of democracy/non-democracy. Most stakeholders involved in benchmarking internet freedom approach it from a Western-leaning perspective that uncritically assumes that democracy-related practices are embedded in the very origins of the internet and therefore, the levels of democratisation can serve as valid indicators of internet freedom. As a result, these frameworks lack $2 when applied to invasive policies and public administration practices implemented in democracies, while lacking $2 when applied to policies and practices in non-democracies. The conceptualization and operationalization of the concept of internet freedom that underlies internet freedom rankings is of particular importance since the promotion of internet freedom is an integral part of foreign policy and rankings serve as a source of information and justification for prioritizing funding and efforts. Rankings can also impact states’ reputations, serve as advocacy tools in public diplomacy, but also impede justified criticism aimed at states who score well on key indicators. Through this intervention piece, we aim to initiate debate on developing an alternative framework for assessing internet policy. Shifting attention away from the singular focus on regime kind and politics enables us to develop a more complex system of coordinates for assessment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Using textual analysis of 28 adverts for egg donation, sharing, and freezing drawn from Facebook’s Ad Library archive, we consider what forms of motherhood, kinship, and sociality are promised through targeted advertisements for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) on Facebook. We seek to understand (1) how egg donation, sharing and freezing adverts by ART providers represent the women they expect to use their services; (2) how the meaning of these representations is changed by their delivery through algorithmically targeted marketing; and (3) what imaginative, genealogical, and relational possibilities are foreclosed or endorsed in the delivery of these adverts to algorithmically anticipated “fertile females”. Through textual analysis we seek to understand the forms of potential “life” that are present in the advertisements. We consider the representations of egg donation, identify a banal ambiguity in promised post-feminist kinship, and identify the selected families-in-making which might be created by ART. We combine this with a critical interrogation of how and why these adverts are targeted and delivered to certain demographics of algorithmically anticipated Facebook users. The opacity and structural rigidity of Facebook’s targeted advertising systems – structural mechanisms that are binaric in back-end databases and yet “lively” at the point of the user interface - require that we interrogate both media text and computational delivery mechanisms to meaningfully understand what forms of “life” are promised by gender-targeted ART. The genealogical possibility offered through ART is represented with banal ambiguity wherein potentially disruptive arrangements of kinship are derisked by an overarching narrative of simplicity and sameness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban public life has historically and famously been structured by social stratification and a segregation of social milieus. Such spatialized social inequality along the lines of, most importantly, class, age, and ethnicity engenders unequal access to civic participation and supportive social networks. Meanwhile, the Internet and Web 2.0 technologies in particular have often been hailed for their potential of bringing underrepresented voices into the public discourse and even creating so-called “networked counterpublics”, challenging social power structures. This contribution seeks to address the question of whether social media communication about urban issues challenges or reproduces patterns of spatial inequality in its attention distribution. Empirically, it investigates the distribution of place-naming within the Berlin-based Twitter discourse on housing. It finds that - while issue attention in the urban Twitter discourse is clearly spatially unequal, with a striking imbalance between center and periphery - neither sociodemographic composition nor issue characteristics perform well in explaining these patterns. Instead it proposes focusing more on local civic and activist infrastructure in future research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Access to the Internet in 1998 created a unique sphere encompassing both public and private characteristics while offering a new form of communication, identity, and political participation (Rheingold 2000). As a result, access to the Internet provided women with an alternative way of defying the traditional masculine culture through \"connection and communication\" and \"identity transformation\" (Nouraei-Simon 2005). The Internet ameliorated Iranian women's ability to contribute to the accelerating development of an online culture that offers a significant change to the definition of empowerment as it shifts the boundaries of the public and private realms, allowing Iranian women to seek self-determination despite Islamic ideology (Jones, 1997). This work shows how the weblog has become one of the key tools to challenge social barriers in the quest for Iranian women's rights (Sreberny &amp; Khiabany, 2010). This paper will critically examine the use of weblogs by some Iranian women to break the gender oriented restrictive rules imposed upon them by the patriarchal elements in higher education by exploring how and in what ways women advocate for their own and others' rights and equality? This paper incorporates a critical textual analysis of primary and secondary academic sources. It integrates a critical feminist approach and have collected data from the work of female scholars, activists, bloggers, and filmmakers and have brought forth the unheard experiences of some Iranian women in higher education.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Archives by public service media (PSM) are often regarded as an ideal instrument for creating a collective 'cultural memory', which is essential in the individualized, differentiated and polarized societies of today. Technological innovations and digitization open up new possibilities in this regard, as data can be stored and made accessible more easily. In their daily work, however, PSM archives encounter various obstacles. How do PSM across Europe deal with the digitization of audiovisual archives and what exactly are the problems and challenges that accompany this process? To answer this question, the authors conducted problem-centered interviews with journalists, members of audience relations departments, legal departments, archivists and archive managers in selected European countries (Austria, Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). In addition, selected examples of the publicly accessible archived content were analyzed and evaluated. The paper highlights tensions between personal rights and collective interests in the process of creating cultural memory: One of the main transformations in archiving that digitization has brought about is the way in which the material is publicly accessed and the proportion of the material that is publicly accessible. However, digitization has also caused significant risks, particularly with regard to the legal and ethical challenges it causes. The paper concludes with proposals for media policy.</jats:p>",

I draw here on ten years’ experience teaching in Internet studies, student and peer feedback, and the literature on critical pedagogy and decolonizing academia. I suggest that where possible we reflect on the texts we set students; redesign assessment; considering being vulnerable with students; and challenge restrictive policies and procedures (such as those around late submission of assignments). These approaches rely on trusting students, and on building their trust in us without relying solely on our institutional authority.

For that purpose, we develop a research infrastructure and conduct a series of experiments using virtual agents (n=200) in a fully controlled environment. We specifically look at YouTube recommendations for videos related to the far-right terrorist attack in the German city of Halle in 2019 and examine how these recommendations differ depending on the type and political affiliation of videos watched by the agents. We find that YouTube recommendations are highly randomized that leads to fundamentally different recommendation trajectories under the condition of identical agent activity which was also synchronized to isolate the effect of time. We also find significant discrepancies in recommendations generated in browsers, with the recommendations for Firefox being slightly less randomized than those for Chrome. Finally, our observations suggest that the recommendations for the agents starting with right-leaning news videos are marginally more consistent than those for the mainstream and left-leaning videos.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Reader comments to online news websites have become a critical component of civic engagement and debate since the introduction of digital media. While many online news organisations encourage reader comments to maintain a loyal audience, audience participation is often constrained by the terms and conditions used to govern reader comments. By imposing strict moderation policies, news organisations demonstrate a lack of trust towards the audience. Yet, many organisations continue to demand high levels of public trust in their brands and the institution of journalism. Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines the terms and conditions used to moderate reader comments to four Australian online news sites, and assesses the level of trust afforded to audiences through comment moderation policies. Public statements from each of these organisations about public trust in their organisation or the institution of news are also assessed, to contrast the level of trust these organisations expect with that which is afforded to the audience through moderation policies. This research finds that the moderation policies analysed represent significant impediments to audience expression, and demonstrate a discrepancy between the level of trust afforded to participants and that which the organisations demand from their readers. Despite early hopes that online reader comments may facilitate greater opportunities for democratic participation for citizens, the potential for substantial democratic debate on the online news sites examined in this research remains unrealised.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "“I STILL WANT TO KNOW THEY’RE NOT TERRIBLE PEOPLE”: NEGOTIATING TRUST, PLEASURE AND QUEER ETHICS IN LGBTQ+ YOUNG PEOPLE’S DATING APP USE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dating and hook-up apps constitute spaces of intense negotiation around issues of sex, identity and intimacy, in which norms are tested and reinforced. This paper examines discussions of ‘ideal app use’ which emerged in qualitative workshops conducted in 2018 with 23 LGBTQ+ app-users aged 18-35 in urban and regional New South Wales. We explore how a reading of in-app practices - such as messaging, picture-sharing and blocking - through a lens of queer ethics can inform LGBTQ+ young people’s ‘rules’ for app use. Participants were invited to create 'how-tos' for ideal app use, and describe the ways they distinguished ‘good’ (or trustworthy) profiles from ‘bad’ (untrustworthy) profiles via creative design activities. In their discussions, participants articulated their ‘rules’ for filtering matches in relation to particular design features of apps which enabled (sexed and gendered) cultures of accountability to others. As in Duguay’s (2017) research on queer women’s deployment of in-app affordances as ‘identity modulation’, participants interacted with other users and interpreted their profiles in relation not only to sexual desires, but also queer politics and identity. In many instances, this was expressed through a heightened sense of responsibility for self-knowledge and self-disclosure, and a need to connect with ‘good people’ with a shared political sensibility. At other times, participants acknowledged the challenges of negotiating politicised responsibility to others while simultaneously pursuing the kinds of pleasurable connections they sought on apps, and limiting their own self-disclosure as a means of guarding their physical and emotional safety.</jats:p>",

    "title": "TROLLING FOR ENGAGEMENT: AUSTRALIAN LEGACY NEWS OUTLETS SEEKING AUDIENCE INTERACTION METRICS ON FACEBOOK THROUGH DELIBERATELY DIVISIVE CONTENT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper empirically investigates how two prominent Australian legacy news outlets – ABC News and News.com.au – operate according to what I term a social media logic of “engagement”, a concept which builds upon van Dijck &amp; Poell’s notion of a social media logic of “popularity”. By a logic of engagement, I mean the necessity to maximize social media attention and interaction metrics. Rather than just valuing “popularity”, platforms instead place value on content that maximizes a multitude of feelings, sentiments, and reactions. Without sufficient engagement, outlets dependent on platforms such as Facebook are threatened by invisibility in the newsfeed. I specifically focus on the operations of ABC News and News.com.au on Facebook from 21 March 2018 – 10 April 2018. Within this period, I collected all the posts from each page, which amounted to 44 posts in total. From these posts, I strategically selected six posts of varying levels of engagement for closer qualitative analysis, with an emphasis on language and imagery. My findings in this paper suggest that the drive for monetizable and algorithmically-valued audience metrics on Facebook can encourage divisive and provocative news content that arouses strong negative feelings and promotes conflict. Trolls are those that deceive other users of their intentions, and seek to sow discord for their own purposes. Thus, it is beneficial to think about a potentially emerging practice of news “trolling”, as it appears that news outlets are adopting faux-naïve, and deliberately incendiary, practices when pursuing engagement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Videogames directly involve players as co-creators of on-screen events, and this interactivity is assumed to be a core source of their attraction as a successful entertainment medium. Although interactivity is an inherent property of the videogame, it is variably perceived by the end user—for some users, perceived as a more demanding process, taxing their already-limited attentional resources. At least four such demands have been explicated in extant literature: cognitive (making sense of game logics/tasks), emotional (affective responses to game events/outcomes), physical (managing controller inputs and interfaces), and social (responding to human/nonhuman in-game others). Past work has reported empirical support of these concepts through validation of closed-ended survey metrics (e.g., Video Game Demand Scale). The current study challenges and extends the demand concept through an analysis of players’ own language when describing videogame demands in short essays about gaming experiences—critical given that people may experience a phenomenon in ways not accounted for in deductive data approaches. A secondary analysis of qualitative data made freely available by VGDS authors revealed both convergence with and divergence from prior work. Comporting with VGDS, cognitive demands are mostly experienced by players as ludic concerns and physical demands are mostly experienced in relation to handheld controller perceptions. Diverging from VGDS, players’ emotional demands represented both basic and complex emotional states, and social demands manifest different depending on whether or not the social “other” is human or non-human: humans are considered demanding on interpersonal terms, whereas non-humans are considered demanding as personified evocative objects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Conversational bots, otherwise known as chatbots, operate within the fourth industrial revolution as a client facing form of AI. They are communicative interfaces that mimic human conversation to deliver information in a highly personalised way. The user experience of chatbots can change the way individuals, groups and organisations define themselves online (Whitley, Gal &amp; Kjaergaard, 2014). This paper discusses the opportunities in building an online identity via chatbots, with emphasis on harnessing the properties of chatbots to develop trust with users. Currently, organisations are limited to the properties and affordances of web browsers, search engines and social media to communicate a “shared symbolic representation” (Gioia, 1998). This paper focuses on organisational identities on the Internet, and details both opportunities and vulnerabilities in establishing trust with users through chatbots.</jats:p>",

A token stands in for something else. But what else, exactly? As this paper develops, Chaturbate tokens have different uses and meanings for the audience and performers. These differences do not only happen at the users’ level but are sustained by an ecology of associated payment services that deepen the contrast between them. An analysis of the differences in cost and value of tokens, and the environment in which these dissimilarities occur, illustrates the role of tokens as an extractive technology that profits from, and perpetuates, financial discrimination.</jats:p>",

By combing insights from AI and communication studies and STS, as well as insights into the human-data relationship from digital health studies, the paper theoretically links digital data assemblages with communication theory which provides tools to think about health data as relational and communicative. With this, social media data becomes relevant in a new light, not only for media scientists, but also for understanding health practices in a digital age more generally. The paper discusses issues this theoretical perspective raises for researchers of social media and online health engagement; what challenges and possibilities this provides in relation to studying social media discussions on health; and finally, an overview of analytical strategies and empirical fields from which these perspectives may be studied.</jats:p>",

Besides furthering the academic knowledge-base on civil unrest and protests, the works in this field envision to support a variety of stakeholders with different interests such as governments, the military, law enforcement, human rights organizations and industries such as insurance and supply chain management. I analyze the recent history of civil unrest prediction on social media platforms through examining discourses, implicated actors and technological affordances as encountered in publications and other public online artifacts.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Films and television series you watch online are watching you back. Algorithms and data analytics are making deeper inroads into film and television production in Europe: Belgian company ScriptBook offers data-driven script analysis and automated story generation, which the company sees as co-authorship between humans and machines. At the same time, data-driven streamers like Netflix and Amazon are investing heavily in local-language content. This paper examines how these developments affect creative labour in the European screen industry. More specifically, it zooms in on the development stage and the experiences of screenwriters, directors, and producers. What do audience data and algorithmic tools add to the creative process? What are the possibilities and limitations? Questions like these call for a robust theoretical and methodological toolbox, which synthesises concepts and methods from media industry studies, critical algorithm studies, and critical data studies. This research project explores the influence of algorithms and data analytics on both a macro-level (changing industry structures) and micro-level (creative practices of screenwriters and producers). The analysis is based on data from three registers: semi-structured interviews with screen workers, ethnographic field observation, and industry trade publications. These empirical data have been gathered online and offline in several European countries. In sum, this paper presents some preliminary observations of European screen production in an algorithmic culture - and how it is perceived by the people who produce the stories that land on our screens.</jats:p>",

CGI influencers are fictional characters created with computer modeling techniques that have profiles on social networks and sociomaterial trajectories built with the aid of digital marketing, business intelligence and media companies. As an empirical object, we chose Lil Miquela - \"the robot influencer\", one of the most successful examples of this genre of micro celebrity on Instagram. Our main goal was to map the ways in which Miquela acts on Instagram and to find traces that allow us to explore better the interrelationship between the strategies adopted by Miquela's creators team and her appropriations of Instagram affordances that shapes the ways in which she acts both as a fictional character and as a digital influencer. We extracted 1089 posts available in Miquela’s feed up to June 2021and used content analysis and mixed digital methods techniques to explore the data. We observed three ways of acting (practices) that are characteristic of Miquela and operate interdependently: (a) The Fictional Character, (b) The Experiment and (c) The Influencer. These findings could suggest that the three versions of Miquela act as an experimental model of what we here call “influencer-laboratories”: a type of digital influencer for which the influencer itself acts as a controlled experiment used to investigate which sociomaterial arrangements create conditions that favor the production of online influence on digital platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of my research is to examine the new visibility of atheism and non-religion in a sphere that blurs private and public. In this paper I will look at how US women performing and constructing atheist identity via personal YouTube channels are enacting and invoking a counter public(s). These technologically mediated counter publics actualize issues of race, gender, religion, nationality and the issue of having voice in broader US society. These women speak of vulnerability, stereotyping, and the wish both to be seen and to remain hidden. My study highlights issues of what it means to have privacy in a hyper mediated sphere, and how intimacy is invoked in network spaces to connote authenticity. Using Actor Network Theory (ANT) I will be looking at these performances as relational and embedded in a particular nexus of technology, associative logic, templates of behavior, as well as material affordances and objects (Latour 2005). The purpose is to look at lived non-religion, not in order to categorize or make sense of the non-religious but to look at the performance of the personal and stigmatized in an ambivalent public. As a complement to ANT I appropriate Lynn Schofield Clark’s (2011) usage of mediatization theory, her usage is dynamic and emphasizes agency, if not necessarily intent, and contributes to a discussion on rethinking the conceptualization of public sphere and public discourse. I will use ANT to develop mediatization theory, particularly exploring if and how mediatization can be understood on a micro level.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a long tradition of research on why and to whom people disclose information and manage their privacy, especially since the emergence of social media. Recently, there has been a push to conceptualize privacy in relation to social media as ‘networked privacy’, where privacy is framed in terms of networks, relationships or people. Despite the popular term it is unclear what makes networked privacy new and how it relates to other privacy conceptualizations. In this paper, we therefore analyze networked privacy together with the following privacy theories; Warren and Brandeis’ right to be left alone, Westin’s privacy control, Nissenbaum’s theory of contextual integrity and Petronio’s communication privacy management theory. Each theory refers (implicitly or explicitly) to different ontological and epistemological claims and we will clarify these and illustrate how fundamentally different the networked privacy paradigm is from its counterparts. The analysis serves as a first step towards defining fundamental principles for a paradigm of networked privacy.</jats:p>",

    "title": "KNOW YOUR MEME AND THE HOMOGENIZATION OF WEB HISTORY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Know Your Meme (KYM) is a website devoted to compiling histories,\n        definitions, and examples of internet memes. In the last decade, KYM has become popular\n        among researchers, educators, and day-to-day Web users to understand memes and their\n        meanings. As a result, it has become instrumental in establishing dominant histories of\n        memes on the Web. This paper uses a discursive interface analysis of the KYM website along\n        with the examples of Pepe the Frog, OK Boomer, and niche Facebook meme groups to demonstrate\n        how the website constructs itself as a cultural authority to define and classify memes, and\n        that an overreliance on KYM can have significant stakes. It may overlook entire uses of the\n        meme, potentially downplay harmful ideologies, and generally imply the possibility for a\n        meme to have a single primary meaning. I argue that an overreliance on KYM without\n        acknowledging its limitations tends to overlook the essential plurality of the Web and\n        instead implies a singular history of memes as an element of internet culture. However, KYM\n        can still be a useful resource and to that end, ultimately, I conclude that we should move\n        toward defining KYM as, “a curated collection of user-submitted meme instances and partially\n        crowdsourced definitions.” While KYM is undeniably a useful resource, it is important that\n        those of us who study the histories of the Web are mindful about how we lean upon this\n        particular website and situate it within our work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the configurations of social media’s affordances within the Chilean influencer industry. Chile has a growing number of professional social media influencers who blur global norms and local markets, working with both local brands and international campaigns. We argue for situating affordances within a wider context in which the features of platforms acquire particular meanings. Our analysis focuses on two dynamics. On the one hand, we examine how the Chilean influencer industry is shaped by a technological frame (Bijker, 1995) that structures the valence of affordances. We show that affordances are not “naturally” or “neutrally” imagined by actors but rather culturally located within technological frames that shape the discourses, values, and practices from which they obtain cultural meaning. On the other hand, we analyze how affordances provide a material support for the temporal and spatial expansion of technological frames. Thus, cultural contexts and platforms’ features mutually constitute each other in ways that have not always been recognized in the scholarly literature about affordances. We situate negotiations about what it means to be an influencer in Chile, the role of intermediaries (e.g. branding agencies), communication with followers, and the global influencer industry as part of this mutually constitutive relationship.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\"Digital sovereignty\" is the idea that states should “reaffirm” their\n        authority over the Internet and protect their citizens, institutions, and businesses from\n        the multiple challenges to their nation’s self-determination in the digital sphere.\n        According to this principle, sovereignty depends on more than supranational alliances or\n        international legal instruments, military might or trade: it depends on locally-owned,\n        controlled and operated innovation ecosystems, able to increase states’ technical and\n        economic independence and autonomy. Presently, digital sovereignty is understood primarily\n        as a legal concept and a set of political discourses. As a consequence, it is predominantly\n        analysed by political science, international relations and international law. However, the\n        study of digital sovereignty as a set of infrastructures and socio-material practices has\n        been largely neglected. In this proposal, I argue that the concept of (digital) sovereignty\n        should also be studied via the infrastructure-embedded “situated practices” of various\n        political and economic projects which aim to establish autonomous digital infrastructures in\n        a hyperconnected world. Although this contribution is also a call for a wider and\n        comparative research programme, I will focus here on the “pilot case” of Russia, which is\n        the subject of an ongoing research project. Ultimately, the analysis of\n        infrastructure-embedded digital sovereignty practices in Russia shows how the Russian\n        discourse on Internet sovereignty as a centralized and top-down apparatus paradoxically open\n        up technical and legal opportunities for mundane resistances and the existence of “parallel”\n        Runets, where particular instantiations of informational freedom are still\n        possible.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Developments in the past decade have demonstrated that computer game players have become increasingly keen to watch, spectate, or listen to games content instead of (or alongside) playing games themselves. This might mean watching videos about or involving games on a site like YouTube, viewing others playing in high-level competitive “esports” events, listening to games-centred podcasts that might be about game design, development, play or politics, or consuming the music of and surrounding digital games. The increasing ubiquity of easily-shared content on leading internet platforms, rapid internet speeds, and gaming as a whole becoming an ever-more varied and diverse activity, have all contributed to the growth of these activities. Although each has been studied they have rarely been considered alongside one another, nor framed in a broader context of understanding what game-related activities game-players do when not actually, themselves, playing. In this paper we bring together findings and analysis from four ongoing research projects into gaming-adjacent activities, specifically into the culture of gaming hardware videos on YouTube, drinking culture and masculinity in esports broadcasts, the production and reception of gaming podcasts, and the relationship between game music and broader practices of music creation. The panel highlights the range of phenomena in these non-gaming yet gaming-adjacent activities, and also brings out commonalities that these phenomena exhibit. We show the wider ecosystem of media consumption that many gamers engage in, and it is thus our hope that this panel will strengthen game studies’ and internet studies’ interest in these practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the extent to which marginalized communities contest practices of datafication and technological experimentation which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the aid sector. Drawing on seven years of research in the humanitarian and development sectors, the paper explores forms of resistance to digital aid practices. The paper is divided into two parts. The first section observes how datafication and digital innovation in the aid sector rework the colonial genealogies of humanitarianism and digital technology. I then theorize resistance in situations of asymmetrical power. The second section discusses empirical examples of everyday contestation. Drawing on Scott’s notion of the ‘hidden transcripts’ (1985), the paper develops the term ‘ordinary transcripts’ to illustrate the modest critique of digital power through everyday life practices such as non-participation and the oppositional appropriation of digital aid projects. Listening to the ‘ordinary transcripts’ of everyday resistance is also partly a methodological argument as it is only through ethnographic encounters that these small acts of contestation can be noticed. The paper concludes that the arguments about digital power and the persistence of colonial legacies do not preclude the acknowledgement of human agency. However, the ordinary transcripts of everyday resistance do not equal decolonization which requires a radical restructuring of power relations. Still, ordinary resistance needs to be recognized for it may contain the seeds of future decolonial struggle.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platform changes are a phenomenon endlessly confronting social media users, impacting how they create and consume content. The social media platform “Reddit” is, as of writing, in the midst of a significant planned shift in their socio-economic foundation. Reddit’s owners are moving the company from being a privately held business to a publicly-traded one. While scholarly attention in domains such as human-computer interaction (HCI) has focused on tracing how users understand and respond to changes in the interface features of social media, less consideration has been given to how users make sense of the socio-economic side of the social media platform equation. Through a thematic analysis of Reddit posts and comments mentioning the Reddit IPO made to “r/announcements,” “r/theoryofReddit,” “r/askreddit,” “r/stocks,” “r/wallstreetbets,” and “r/technology,” this study examines how users discuss and make sense of socio-economic change in this social media environment. Findings from this study focus on three themes: 1) What aspects of the techno-cultural facets of Reddit (defaults, protocols, algorithms, and interfaces) users believe might change as a result of the IPO. 2) What policy changes users believe might occur on Reddit, particularly in relation to moderation practices and the kinds of content allowed on the site. And, 3) User beliefs about the particular interests that these changes may serve.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Formerly incarcerated people, who I will hereafter refer to as “returning citizens”, struggle when reentering society as their criminal record follows them around. In the age of big data and algorithms, finding information about someone’s criminal past is often as simple as typing their name into a google search. Yet there has been little focus on understanding the consequences of big data and algorithmic decisions for everyday people, and how they live with and make sense of these systems. Drawing upon in-depth interviews, I ask: In what ways does the visibility of information about returning citizens’ criminal record as it appears on search engines impact their lives? What strategies (if any) do they use to manage their criminal record in search? Findings explore the difficulties that returning citizens' face in reentering a technologically-driven world that they do not necessarily know how to navigate, which has various consequences in their lives. Yet at the same time, returning citizens find ways of adapting and resisting these systems, with varying degrees of success. Ultimately, these findings add to critiques about the prison-industrial complex and how our reliance on big data and algorithmic systems can perpetuate unequal and colonial power dynamics.</jats:p>",

More specifically, these papers examine diverse uses and experiences of streaming ‘radio’ and its deployments for community-building, emotional sustenance, and an online reconstitution of place. In their explorations, these papers consider which methodologies are appropriate and useful to examine the affordances of streaming radio, enabling in turn analysis of informing ideas of ‘community’, intimacy, territorialization/deterritorialization, and questions of what comprises ‘radioness’ itself. Is radio still radio if it is online? What happens to the \"community\" that is conjured into being by terrestrial broadcast radio when the \"station\" is internet only?’ What does thinking from place mean when the tangibility of place is physically transcended and thus broken up and reconstituted as elements of locality, of community? The fourth and final power transposes the “perspective of frequency, force and affective tone” in transduction to the wider field of social media practices during the early stages of COVID. In this paper, the obsessive-compulsive ritual of “doomscrolling” becomes the practice through which rhythms of resonance and reverberation become imprinted upon the flows of everyday life through the transductive modulations of digital networked media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent scholarship demonstrated that Facebook is a convenient space for populist political communication as its unmediated and viral nature make populist appeals highly efficient in voters’ mobilization (Engesser et al., 2017). However, less attention has been paid to the way these populist messages appear on political actors’ communication, and what post- and page-level factors they are associated with. We investigate these questions in the context of the 2019 European Parliament (EP) election based on a unique cross-national dataset covering 12 European countries. In our research project we categorized more than 8,074 Facebook posts published on the main pages of 67 parties. Our findings show that the three dimensions of populist communication are used strategically different way and appear in different communication context. Anti-elitist messages are articulated in relation to economy, labor and social policy and immigration mostly by extreme parties. People-centrism is frequently used in relation to labor &amp; social policy, and in European- and mobilization-focused posts all over the political landscape. Out-group messages appear in immigration-related posts and in far-right parties’ communication. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube as part of a growing social media entertainment (SME) industry has taken various steps to professionalise, formalise and regulate the field of user-generated content and successfully integrated self-professionalised YouTube creators into an emerging creative workforce of SME. The industrialisation and professionalisation of YouTubing have created the assumption of a formalisation of professional identity as a YouTuber or a content creator in the SME industry. Contrary to this assumption, I argue that there is a divergence from fixed categories as it is not possible to fix permanently or define conclusively the professional identity as a YouTuber because conditions of content creator labour are precarious. In this paper, drawing upon qualitative data collected for my doctoral research, I investigate how creators who engage in self-governance as risk-bearing creative agents form their professional identities inside or outside YouTube careers and illuminate the diversity and ambivalence in their professional identities due to the precarious nature of their work. Despite being at different career stages and having a wide range of backgrounds, motivations, skills, and experiences, YouTube creators who participated in this project had something in common: They needed to be flexible in shifting between different professional identities and types of employment relations in order to make a media career on and beyond YouTube. This is because it is hard to imagine or maintain a single career path towards being a professional creator due to existing or future uncertainties.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The notion of “liquid consumption” draws on Bauman’s theory of liquid modernity to describe shifts in consumer behavior in recent years. Liquid consumption is contrasted to more traditional “solid” consumption and is characterized by ephemerality (rather than endurance), access (rather than ownership), and dematerialization (rather than material possessions). Despite the popularity of liquid consumption theory and the prominent role of digital platforms in shaping liquid consumption, a thorough analysis how digital platforms enable or constrain liquid consumption is missing. In our research, we address this gap and study the role of liquidity on three key digital platforms in the platform economy: Airbnb, Uber, and Fiverr. The research relies on a comparative case study method and is informed by the walkthrough approach, answering three distinct research questions: 1. How inherent is liquidity in a certain product/service category in the first place (pre-platform)? 2. Where do different platforms fall on the dimensions of the liquid-solid consumption spectrum? 3. How does the solidity/liquidity of the consumption/use/experience differ between providers and consumers?\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this paper is to reflect on how the transformation of LinkedIn into an online environment from which are carried out critiques and questionings about the labor market, management practices, and work relations in Brazil, allow us to challenge sociotechnical imaginaries about the platform. The emergence of protest movements about circulating content on the platform reveals that, although certain technological configurations impose themselves on users, LinkedIn is not unique, universal, or deterministic, but multiple. This article addresses the technical issue, not yet properly explored by the ontological turn movement, discussing the protest movements on LinkedIn as a starting point for challenging pre-existing sociotechnical imaginaries, in order to boost societal change and new technological futures. The methodological strategy adopted to conduct the study was digital ethnography. Data collection, part of ongoing research, took place between March 2021 and February 2022. It includes news reports on LinkedIn and observations of posts on LinkedIn and discussions among members of a blog and a Facebook group gathered to conduct critiques of the content circulating on LinkedIn. Preliminary findings suggest that the movement of questioning from the platform itself seeks to appropriate the technological affordances and constraints imposed by LinkedIn to make it a space for awareness, problematization, and promotion of societal change. By establishing new uses for the platform, unrelated to the commercial objectives for which it was created, this movement gives conditions for the constitution of new sociotechnical imaginaries in relation to the platform itself and also, to rethink work relations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Underlying many social media platforms are personalization engines designed to give people instant content and social recommendations to keep them engaged, yet understanding of their cognitive and behavioral impacts remains limited, particularly how user agency may be altered during interactions with these tools.\n\nIn interviews and focus groups, a diverse sample of 45 participants offered their experiences with these tools where they reflected on how they responded and reacted to them, and how they felt they preserved their agency or had it eroded by the technology. Participants also reported several novel outcomes that occurred that they attributed to the tools, including falling down \"rabbit holes\" where time and conscious thinking appeared to dissolve -- outcomes they did not anticipate happening.\n\nDrawing from social cognitive theory, this dissertation advances an explanatory model that demonstrates the interactional dynamic between individuals and these choice recommendation engines, as well as identifies core agency, and related cognitive and behavioral, processes that appear to be activated during the interaction.\n\nAs a practical contribution, this work demonstrates individuals can have the upper hand in these environments, so long as they have a clear understanding of the consequences of use of these tools. The model provides that guidance, building on past social cognitive work that sought to empower individuals to be free, non-constricted agents who can attain any realistic goal they desire, so long as they exercise their internal capacities to achieve it and have an awareness of the environments that may thwart it.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A key concern in international policy debates about articulating oversight of digital platform markets involves policy silos, arising from the scope of platformization and datafication, and the challenges in defining their policy boundaries and coordinating a comprehensive policy response. This paper examines how policymakers grapple with the problem by looking at a growing number of expert inquiries on digital platforms—a proxy for the international policy debate—that focus on policy problems ranging from market dominance to privacy risks to the spread of disinformation. Specifically, the paper develops a schema of related policy silos and tradeoffs that arise in these debates: 1) policy area silos, 2) market / sectoral silos, 3) temporal silos, and 4) normative tradeoffs. Then, it critically examines the implications of these silos and tradeoffs for policy interventions aimed at addressing concerns related to datafication and platformization, raising key questions about the scope of and assumptions underlying platform regulation internationally and noting the way they constrain policy design and thwart more holistic policy solutions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>It is widely held that efforts to achieve the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals must sit alongside efforts to achieve ‘universal’ digital inclusion (Graham, 2019). In Samoa, an independent island state in the Pacific, digital inclusion has been positioned as a key ‘international development’ agenda that will ‘leapfrog’ the nation into the 21st century. However, a similarly strong motivator has been fa’asamoa (the Samoan way) which, with its emphasis on relationally grounded action and knowledges, operates in tension with the underlying colonial constructs of ‘modernity’ evident within current 'Western' conceptualisations of ‘digital inclusion for international development’. In following Mignolo (2007), this paper details fa’asamoa-grounded perceptions and experiences of ‘digital inclusion for international development’ held by Samoan members of two Pasifika-led community organisations in Brisbane, Australia. The 'participants', as peer researchers, held a central position in designing and implementing the research agenda and objectives, further putting abstract conceptualisations of decolonisation into practice. Drawing on discussions and design artefacts created during a co-design workshop held in late-2021, this paper outlines how the peer researchers (consciously and unconsciously) navigate tensions between fa’asamoa and current 'Western' structures and practices of ‘digital inclusion for international development’ in their everyday and envisioned engagement with ICTs and digital technologies. In turn, this paper critically questions the effects of on-going 'Western' hegemonies in the construction of ‘modern’ subjectivities and the enactment of ‘modern’ life, and further offers critical insight into the role of technology in the discursive and practical conception of alternatives to ‘modernity/coloniality'.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Early work in fan studies deliberately focused on the positive aspects of fandom. This approach was designed to combat the stereotyping and pathologizing of fans perpetrated by mass media (Jenson, 1992; Zubernis and Larsen, 2012) and has broadly been successful. Yet popular culture is a site of political meaning and ideological conflict and recent shifts point toa pressing need to understand the dominant narratives being espoused. Work in fan studies is now being carried out on white supremacy, conspiracy theories and serial killer fandom (Stanfill, 2020; Reinhard et al., 2021; Wiest, 2016), but communities rising around people like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev remain unexplored.\n\nThis paper returns to some of the early discourses surrounding fandom and applies them to contemporary expressions of ‘dark’ fandom, in particular school shooters and mass killers. Using surveys and undertaking a content analysis of fanfiction posted to Archive of Our Own, as well as media reports focusing on these fans, I demonstrate that some forms of fandom and fan behaviour are still dismissed and Othered. Typically stigmatised through its gendered associations, fanfiction dedicated to mass killers is subject to multiple discourses of othering, but also offers multiple forms of resistance to these dominant narratives. Rather than fanfiction as a practice through which fans express emotional connections with popular media texts, I argue that fans write fanfiction about school shooters and mass killers as a way to recontextualize and understand their motives and actions in ways that other media do not.</jats:p>",

    "title": "LOOKING FOR MONTREAL DIGITAL CITIZENS: FOR WHO ARE OPEN DATA MADE?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Municipalities' development of open data portals is part of a political drive to bring citizens and local governments closer together. However, despite significant investments, these initiatives rarely find their audience, because they respond primarily to an imperative of openness that places them in a logic of supply rather than demand. Also because citizens have a minimal understanding of the concrete implications of open data. In this context, one can legitimately ask for _whom_ are these open data portals created. Using the City of Montreal (Quebec, Canada) as a case study, we provide a nuanced answer to this question. If the socio-technical device set up seems to meet the needs of an \"imagined\" public more technophile and entrepreneurial than most citizens are, this discrepancy is perceived and countered by many processes. Our longitudinal study over a decade allows us to detect a co-construction in tension of the web portal. On the one hand, we find preoccupations with municipal prerogatives, administrative routines, and open-data movement ideals - sometimes mixed with territorial branding strategies. On the other, we find attention to citizen appropriation, the search for a better understanding of empirical audiences and a willingness to design the portal for the nebulous public of \"Montrealers\". We base our analysis on a three-tiered data: the _imagined_ publics in municipal discourses, the publics _configured_ by the digital device, and the publics _constructed_ through the actions and strategies of the actors. We discuss findings on the portal’s evolution, and on the clash between imaginary worlds.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In April 2014, after Edward Snowden revealed a widespread, global spying program carried out by the U.S. government against citizens and world leaders, Brazil hosted a meeting of NETmundial, the Global Multistakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, to discuss moving away from a U.S.-centric oversight of internet governance structures and towards a global multistakeholder model. In 2016, the contract between the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the U.S. Department of Commerce expired, nearly 20 years after it was first established. While the end of that contract did meaningfully address some of the concerns raised by NETmundial, there are many ways in which the U.S.’s powerful position in developing the early commercial internet is still visible. This research seeks to address the question: In what ways were early decisions about the governance of the commercial web shaped by cultural imperialist logics and how was that reflected in policy developed in the mid to late 1990s? I address this question using archival analysis focusing on the Ira Magaziner Electronic Commerce papers at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, arguing that the U.S. incorporated little to no input from many countries, a move that stood in contradiction with narratives coming from that administration that highlighted the internet’s potential for open, equitable, global participation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this panel, we offer four papers on some of the complex ways in which sound, sensation, affect, and embodiment shape, and are shaped by, digital platforms. This approach does not eschew questions of power as a key concern, but rather foregoes broad dystopian (or utopian) generalizations, pointing instead to specific instances of platformized and platform-adjacent cultural production to see how power manifests in complex contextually specific ways. “Anti-Caste Reverberations of Haryana’s DJs and their Trucks” deploys site-specific physical and digital ethnographic methods in Haryana, to understand the affective interplay between DJ trucks’ anti-caste space-making techniques on Indian streets and its aesthetic and political extensions enabled through platform-based circulations. “Monstrous Toys and Sensory Play” considers the repurposing of children's toys in the creation of sensorially stimulating videos for adults on TikTok as tied to the (typically white, male) Western liberal-humanist orientation to bodily-sensation, while at the same time suggesting a more radically posthuman model of complex techno-ecologies. “AI.Go.Rhythms: Technology, Race, &amp; Culture in the Mix” explores the interplay of bodies and material technologies, by observing a multimedia DJ event, shifting attention from technical sonic practices towards embodied aspects of race and culture, community building, remixing, and algorithmic self-styling: a 'platform' honoring Black/Brown bodies, aesthetics, and world-making practices. “Producing Intimacy in Virtual Reality” applies an autoethnographic approach to examine the presenter’s dates in virtual reality, explaining how intimacy was produced and maintained through specific embodied experiences (sound, interaction, shared space), while also being shaped by the politics of platforms and infrastructures. As each of these papers demonstrate, this broader approach does not forego the possibility of insights which might achieve a broader scale of applicability, but merely acknowledges the micro- as a crucial site for approaching and, to whatever degree necessary, revising prior understandings of the macro-.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Ongoing political events can reshape the topography of our social media feeds and platformed experiences, destabilizing everyday routines of digital media consumption. The 2020 U.S. presidential election extended this disruption far longer than typical U.S. elections due to extended mail-in ballot counting and political unrest. Within this distinctive political milestone, I study how “ordinary” citizens consume, witness, and feel through social media during an ongoing election. My research centers on social media feeds as sites of political media exposure, examining election media experiences as well as the practices participants use to navigate their feeds as ever-shifting, ephemeral digital environments. I move away from top-down approaches to studying the social media feed by using a “small data,” observational interviewing technique that I term feed analysis interviewing to conduct three interviews each with 21 participants over the course of the election. Ultimately, my preliminary results suggest that participants understand their feeds as spaces of contestation between election affect and their “everyday,” “real,” and “normal” media lives. They use a series of sociotechnical practices to navigate and enforce these imagined boundaries, going beyond political avoidance to differentiate realms of political experience. While introducing a new methodological approach to study political communication and the social media feed, this research also challenges scholars to consider how “ordinary” citizens define and negotiate junctures of politics and everyday life in digital spaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On January 6th, 2021, right-wing demonstrators forcibly entered the United States Capitol building in an effort to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Rioters documented their efforts on social media and live-streaming platforms, creating a digital footprint of their actions. In response, members of the r/DataHoarder subreddit initiated an ad-hoc archival project to collect, deduplicate, and preserve incriminating evidence from the Capitol insurrection. This research examines the r/DataHoarder insurrection archive through the lens of a collective and spontaneous archival project. I examine the methodology undertaken by the Redditors as well as their underlying values and motivations informing their data hoarding in response to the national event. I apply thematic coding as well as quantitative analysis to a dataset of 2,700 Reddit comments documenting the archival effort. I find that users were drawn to the archive project out of a desire to contribute to law enforcement efforts, enact punitive justice upon the rioters, engage in public discourse, and preserve information for posterity. Redditors who engaged with the project repeatedly tended to focus on technical and coordination tasks while single-time participants offered encouragement and identified sources for archiving. Calls to reveal personal information about rioters or to target their places of employment were often ignored and typically proposed by Redditors who did not engage with the project otherwise.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE TOXIC TURN? CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES ON PROBLEMATIC CONTENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ‘toxic turn’ in social media platforms continues unabated. Hate speech, mis- and disinformation, misogynistic and racist speech, images, memes and videos are all far too common on social media platforms and more broadly on the internet. While the diminishing popularity of populist politicians led to hopes for less social toxicity, the Covid-19 pandemic introduced new and more complex dimensions. Tensions have emerged around what constitutes problematic content and who gets to define it. Co-regulation models, such as for example the EC Code of Conduct against Illegal Hate Speech, focus on the legality of certain types of contents, while leaving other categories of problematic contents to be defined by platforms. In parallel, the social media ecosystem became more diverse, as new platforms with hands off moderation policies attracted users who felt too constrained by the policies of mainstream platforms. The proposed panel examines this complex and dynamic landscape by problematizing what is understood as toxic, deplatformed, removable and in general problematic content on platforms with the aim to probe the boundaries of what is constituted as acceptable discourse on platforms and to map its implications.\n\nIn particular, this panel discusses the broad definition of ‘problematic content’ employed by social media platforms, a catch-all term that cuts across hate speech and propaganda, including more politically topical content such as mal-, mis-, and disinformation, hyperpartisan and polarising content, but also abusive, misogynistic, racist, and homophobic discourse. The term is also employed to refer to spam and content that infringes upon the Terms of Service or the Community Standards of social media platforms. As such, it is a broad category that resists a narrower classification given the operational scope of its use. Defining what constitutes problematic content is a key operation of platform content moderation policies but is also the subject of intense debates (de Gregorio, 2020; Gillespie, 2018; Gillespie et al., 2020; Gorwa et al., 2020).\n\nThe panel interrogates the many definitions and applications of problematic content on social media platforms and applications through an empirically informed lens and focusing on deleted contents, complex mixed narratives, and grey areas, including hidden misinformation on voice applications. Problematic Content according to Twitter Compliance API presents ongoing work on the Twitter Compliance API and the Compliance Firehose, which allow researchers to identify content that has been deleted, deactivated, protected, or suspended from Twitter, a proxy for problematic content. In Multi-Part Narratives on Telegram Siapera presents ongoing research that probes the intersection between Covid-19 scepticism, far right and other political narratives in vaccine hesitant groups on Telegram. The third contribution, What if Bill Gates really is evil, people? Investigating the infodemic’s grey areas discusses the conceptual and methodological definitions of problematic content in relation to work on anti-vax and other conspiratorial narratives on Instagram and on Twitter. The fourth contribution, Misinformation and other Harmful Content in Third-Party Voice Applications focuses on problematic content that is yet to be identified on voice applications such as personal assistants. The article addresses the methodological challenges of identifying and defining such contents on applications that have currently no content moderation policies. All contributions foreground the difficulties and costs of identifying and dealing with problematic contents on social media.\n\nThe panel fits with theme of decolonization in two ways: firstly, because it is concerned with the tensions around how toxic/problematic contents are defined and who gets to define them; and secondly, because of its focus on neo-colonial discourses or justifications for colonialism in both narratives hosted by platforms and in platforms’ attempts to regulate content. As some narratives are flagged for removal by social platforms, they also raise the question of who is deciding and what does problematic content mean, with far right discourses exploiting this tension and ironically denouncing any attempt to regulate the public discourse as ideological enforcement and justification for (neo)colonial practices performed by social media platforms. From this perspective, platforms' own claims about what constitutes acceptable content is uncomfortably close to colonial narratives of civilised discourse and brings to the fore the potential for neo-colonial narratives and practices in digital spaces.\n\nReferences\n\nDe Gregorio, G.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The EU Code of Practice on Disinformation has attempted to approach the issue of disinformation through a self-regulatory model, but this has seen limited success. We analyse 1114 self-reported actions from Code signatories (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Mozilla, TikTok and Twitter) taken from 47 monthly transparency reports addressing Covid-19 related disinformation. While the transparency reports were designed to provide clear, meaningful reporting, in reality the process of assessing each platform’s disinformation actions was difficult due to repetition, vague descriptions and a lack of quality data. Platform actions were often reported using a promotional tone and some were irrelevant to COVID-19 or disinformation.\n\nWe argue that the way in which we understand the role that social media platforms play in both the collection of data and the social outcomes that result from these data extraction processes needs to be questioned. Drawing upon the concept of data colonialism, we call for transparent access to data based on the idea that what platforms view as property is based on a “commercially motivated form of extraction” rather than a “naturally occurring form of social knowledge”. European debates about regulating online disinformation need to be set against a broader perspective on regulating the digital environment as a public infrastructure. Policymakers can achieve better civic and democratic outcomes by focusing on regulating the digital environment through, for example, robust competition, data portability, and interoperability rules. Such actions have the potential to break the dominance of Big Tech while incentivising better and new services for citizens.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is about Turkish women cooking on YouTube and how their digital labour is connected to the feminization of work in global aspect through affective publics next to hope labour and care delivery. Papacharissi (2015) explains affective publics as “publics that have been transformed by networked technologies to suggest both spaces for the interaction of people, technology, and practices and the imagined collective that evolves out of this interaction” (pp:125-126). Since offline and online activities are entwined in everyday life due to a great amount of interaction, the networked performance of self emerges along with digital steps an individual takes (Papacharissi, 2015: p.99). When a person makes a move online, (s)he performs towards an [imagined] audience that is shaped by her/his background and daily life. Because identity within presentation and narrative is performative and requires reflexivity in intra-publics as Papacharissi states (2010): “The sense of self-sustained is reflexively adjusted across platforms, publics, and taste cultures to enable optimal expression and connection. The management of this reflexivity, across spaces, publicly private and privately publicly, generates both tension and opportunity for the individual”. From the point of a networked self, gender and religion play a significant role since they are subtly embedded into manners and visibly marked in bodies, in particular, in Islam. While Muslim women blossom on social media as an influencer through consumer culture, they keep modest dressings and use their profile to be inspirational by supporting their acts on their faith base (Waltorp, 2015; Kavakci, &amp; Kraeplin, 2017).</jats:p>",

While this parenting persona emerges from a relatively typical combination of professional and personal/parenting content, I argue this persona has been strategically developed to be leveraged as Meta pursues ‘Instagram Kids’ or other apps aimed at under13s which ostensibly empower parents as initial moderators of the children’s online experiences but are simultaneously rich sources of children’s personal data and activity, something of great monetizable value to Instagram and parent company, Meta.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite its ability to arouse and titillate or disgust and anger (and sometimes both simultaneously), porn has only recently been examined through an affective lens. Writing in the inaugural issue of Porn Studies, Susanna Paasonen (2014) advocates for porn studies scholars to consider how the application of affect theory can help us better understand the appeal of pornography. Drawing on Paasonen’s concept carnal resonance and Margaret Wetherell’s (2012) affective practice, I propose the concept _carnal practice_ as a way to examine how one engages and makes sense of online pornography through the affectively felt practice of searching for, finding, and getting off to online pornography. This is done through an analysis of 48 semi-structured interviews, conducted between February 2019 and September 2020 and in 5 countries—Taiwan, South Korea, China, Japan and Canada—in which I discuss how queer East Asian men navigate their respective internet space, are drawn to particular content and platforms that satisfy their desires and curiosities, and make sense of the porn they view. In some instances, participants discussed notions of being drawn to authenticity in porn as well as porn that seems real (that is, most similar to their lived experience), attraction to particular sex acts, scenarios and races, and, in other cases, allowing a platform’s algorithm to help facilitate and fine-tune their desires, to name a few. Although this study focuses specifically on the practices of queer East Asian men, the concept of carnal practice is not limited to this group and has wider application.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigate the interplay of platform mechanisms and user tinkering in relation to invisible health conditions and ultimately challenge approaches that picture platforms as either hegemonic or liberating. We draw on initial findings from a project focused on social media uses relevant to hereditary cancer syndromes. These conditions are invisible in at least three ways. Cancer genetic risk is evidence-based and embodied, but not bodily visible. General health practitioners rarely know about hereditary cancer syndromes. Overall, hereditary cancer syndromes have not yet entered the wider collective imagination.\n\nExisting research provides evidence that individuals with these conditions turn to social media to seek, learn, produce and share information. However, little do we know about how these practices form at the intersection of embodied experiences, everyday social media uses, and platform mechanisms. In this paper we explore these dynamics drawing on a social media analysis that incorporates data from Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram and combines computational and ethnographic techniques.\n\nWhen it comes to invisible health conditions, the voice of ordinary social media users easily overcomes that of traditional elites. Local platform mechanisms differently shape how information is shared and who and what become more visible and credentialed in these sharing practices. They also influence how and which personal experiences are more curated and shared. These initial findings suggest that social media platforms are essential in making the invisible visible but raise questions on how participating in one or more platforms’ “local worlds” might affect the lived experience of those who embody this invisible.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The diffused and global nature of many digital contexts makes it difficult to trace what regions (incl. The Global South) are represented in digital activism research. This systematic review aimed at providing a sense of this distribution in digital activism research between 2011-2018 (N= 315 articles) through a coding of categories tied to region and marginality. These factors included choice of case study, case study origin and location, author origin, region and ethnic foci of the publishing journals, and digital/ social media platform (as tied to specific user demographics). The results show a high representation of Global North cases and campaigns, as well as non-region-specific and high-visibility social media groupings (e.g. hashtag publics), particularly the case in platform-based research (i.e. digital data sources). This means that researchers may need to rethink (a) where (e.g. which platform spaces) and how disadvantaged and less visible social groups are represented online, (b) which precise ethnic or regional groups such research is meant to capture in digital spaces, as well as (c) what these hindrances mean for democratic participation, grassroots movements, and counterpublics.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ALGORITHMIC JUSTICE FROM BELOW",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tracking has become an integral part of users’ social media experience and the political economy of platforms. Creator studios are part of a larger assemblage of machine-readable metrics and data analytics on the back end of a digital platform. While it has become common practice for creators to make use of this feature to grow their business, creators have also appropriated it to engage collectively in “algorithmic gossip” around social issues. We observe how algorithmic gossip can become instrumental in the hands of minoritized groups. Particularly, following the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, creators noticed that their posts were less visible after using platforms to report on the movement. As more and more creators took screenshots of their analytics and posted them, they were able to force a response out of the company. In response, Tik Tok launched an incubator to boost talent from the black community. Thereby, the company made a commitment “to elevate and amplify their voices”. In this paper we ask: Does algorithmic gossip about tracking provide a basis for overcoming algorithmic oppression or is it incorporated for hegemonic strategies of platform governance and silencing? We argue that end users gather insights from the analytics on the creator studio to reveal patterns of algorithmic injustice and bias. In the second part, we argue that platform companies undermine the collective struggle of minoritized groups through self-governance. As a result, we contend that this case study legitimizes arguments in the discourse against the self-governance of platform companies.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the discursive construction of sexual violence in humorous Internet memes. Feminist digital media scholars have taken an increased interest in the ways in which Internet communication and content reproduces notions of gender norms as well as creating misogynist, racist, homophobic and transphobic content. However, little research has investigated the role humour plays in this discourse – especially how it is presented in Internet memes.\n\nUsing #MeToo as a case study, the paper investigates the role of humour in memes that focus on sexual violence. Investigating how gender and sexuality are discursively constructed in memes, the paper focuses on how this plays into the representation of sexual violence. The paper asks: what can Internet scholars learn by taking Internet humour seriously?\n\nThe key findings of this paper is the discursive construction of sexual violence and the role humour plays in this. A himpathetic (Manne 2018) logic runs through most of the memes which centralises men’s experiences and provides disproportionate sympathy with male perpetrators and widely disregards the experiences of female victims.\n\nHumour is used to signal inclusion and exclusion as the platforms become spaces for indicating and reaffirming heteronormativity and homosociality. The work done by humour discursively excludes women, sexual minorities and people of colour. This exclusion extends to victim/survivors who often become the butt of the joke and are used as a prop to create a humorous meme.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While existing research has examined counterpublics in hashtag activism, little attention is given to digital enclaves that emerge when mainstream media disregards the voices of these communities. This paper helps us understand the process of hashtag activism that derives from the intellectual labor of digital enclaves. I examine the digital Black feminist enclave that emerged through the Black online magazine, Ebony, mobilizing #MuteRKelly on Twitter. #MuteRKelly brings attention to musical artist's, Robert Sylvester Kelly, sexual exploitation of Black women and girls. I combined digital Black feminist theory with critical technocultural discourse analysis to demonstrate how this Black feminist enclave maximized Ebony's interface to defy ideologies of capitalism, racism, colonialism, and sexism that underpin the music industry's public allegiance to Black women’s exploitation on and offline. This digital Black feminist enclave solidified in the rhetorical and technical demand of #MuteRKelly, for (1) the music industry to dispatch all financial, commercial, and social engagements with Kelly and resist negative ideologies of Black women inscribed in his musical lineage, (2) for mainstream media to eradicate discourse that romanticizes domestic violence from celebrity Black men, and (3) for survivors’ to take space in the digital sphere to assemble a grapevine rhetorically committed to advocacy aimed at legal justice and increased protection for Black women and girls. It is important for scholars to trace the lineage of internet practices that traverse to hashtag activism and for us to look at the digital enclaves that produce these practices. </jats:p>",

This falsely positions data collection and distribution undertaken by public institutions as more available to review and scrutiny. Documenting our attempts to audit the HRT-Transgender Database - a database collected by a public university in the United States - we engage in a critical examination of not only the gaps in IRB coverage of “big data” research, but also the practical limitations and troubles involved in attempting to audit data practices that, on paper, should be highly documented. Drawing from feminist and trans studies critical approaches to information practice, our work brings into frame vital issues that researchers seeking to design oversight mechanisms should address, and begins a conversation about the visceral and often painful work of providing that oversight. This research extends from a review of the limits of IRB oversight to incorporate an interrogation of how technological interventions increase the likelihood of actual and symbolic violence in the lives of transgender people, including those not present in the actual HRT-Transgender Database.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media are in the midst of an emphatic visual turn (Highfield &amp; Leaver 2016), characterised by the convergence of everyday visual expression with professional creative practice and advertising. The advertising-driven business models of social media platforms increasingly depend on automation. Platforms’ use of machine vision is a key frontier in the algorithmic classification of culture. Machine vision algorithms automatically classify and misclassify faces, expressions, objects, and brand logos in the images users create and share. Images shared by platform users form vast databases used to train these same algorithms. Despite widespread use by social platforms, machine vision is poorly understood and accounted for in the study of everyday visual cultures. In this paper we detail a critical response to the use of automation in visual social media, called critical simulation. We outline a critical simulation framework, the ‘Image Machine’, focussed firstly on Instagram. The Image Machine comprises an Instagram data harvester, and open-access machine vision toolbox that allows digital humanities researchers to interrogate the inner workings of these algorithms and analyse their visual (mis)classifications. In this paper we showcase results from the Image Machine applied to images emanating from a major Australian music festival, Splendour in the Grass. This case examines not only how machine vision classifies and operates on culture, but also how these techniques are being operationalised within the advertising model and promotional culture of platforms like Instagram. We argue that the commercial application of machine vision is interdependent with the participatory culture of platforms like Instagram.</jats:p>",

    "title": "STITCHING POLITICS AND IDENTITY ON TIKTOK",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Though a relative newcomer among social media platforms, social video-sharing platform TikTok is one of the largest social media platforms in the world, boasting over one billion monthly active users, which it garnered in just five years (Dellatto, 2021). While much of the early attention to the platform focused on more frivolous elements, such as its dances and challenges, the political weight of TikTok has become ever clearer. In the 2020 US election, Donald Trump’s plan to fill the 19,000-seat BOK Center in Tulsa was stymied by young activists who reserved tickets with no intention of attending, organized largely on TikTok (Bandy &amp; Diakopoulos, 2020). In the years since, political discourse on TikTok has continued to emerge from everyday users and political campaigns alike (see Newman, 2022), even as TikTok itself has become an object of political contention: calls for banning the app in the United States–citing security concerns influenced by xenophobia, given the app’s Chinese ownership–began in the Trump presidency (Allyn, 2020) and have recently culminated in state- and federal-level bans on the app for government-owned devices in the U.S. (Berman, 2023). While some studies have navigated limited data access and the platform’s relative infancy to offer an examination of political TikTok (see Literat &amp; Kligler-Vilenchik, 2019; Medina Serrano et al., 2020; Vijay &amp; Gekker, 2021; Guinaudeau et al., 2022), there remains a significant need for more analysis and theorization of how TikTok can become both a site for political discourse and a feature caught up within political mobilization.\n\nThis panel seeks to bring together emerging work that deals with political participation on TikTok, in order to share current wisdom and forge future research directions. The presented works specifically focus on the relationship between political participation on TikTok and political identity for three primary reasons. First, as a video-based and thus embodied platform (Raun, 2012), creator identity is more prominent and easily perceptible in the visual and auditory elements of TikTok videos than in the primarily text-based posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Second, TikTok relies more heavily on its recommendation algorithm for content distribution than its competitors traditionally have (Kaye et al., 2022; Cotter et al., 2022; Zeng &amp; Kaye, 2022; Zhang &amp; Liu, 2021), leading to the creation of “refracted publics” (Abidin, 2021) or Gemeinschaft-style communities (Kaye et al., 2022) around users’ common interests, which may include and/or be heavily informed by identity. Third, TikTok has long prioritized and found success with Generation Z and younger users more broadly (Zeng et al., 2021; Vogels et al., 2022; Stahl &amp; Literat, 2022), which has made generational identity extremely salient on the app, while also implicating political identity, as young people tend to hold political beliefs more cognizant and accepting of diverse identities than older generations (Parker et al., 2019).\n\nThe papers in this panel consider a wide range of identity characteristics of TikTok users and how these identities shape and are shaped by political discourse on TikTok. Paper 1 builds on TikTok’s targeting of Gen Z, considering the identities of age and generation through a content analysis of political remix on TikTok to uncover how younger users use TikTok for political activism as compared to their older counterparts, and finding evidence that TikTok is a powerful site of collective action. Also building from TikTok’s appeal to GenZ, Paper 2 presents a digital ethnographic analysis of the Trad-Wife phenomena on TikTok, offering that TikTok quietly (and thus insidiously) offers space for the cultivation of Christian Nationalist, ‘gentle fascisms’ within GenZ women, often without mention of ‘politics’ at all. Paper 3 offers a computational content analysis of political posts on TikTok with a focus on the interactions between identity and partisanship, and particularly the ways in which creators of marginalized identities on the right act as identity entrepreneurs, offering conservative critiques of their identity groups in ways which find popularity among conservative audiences of hegemonic identities. Finally, Paper 4 looks at differences in how TikTok users respond to male and female politicians’ TikTok videos using a combination of computational and qualitative methods, with exploratory analysis suggesting that male politicians receive more neutral and positive comments than female politicians. By focusing on identity and political discourse on TikTok, we recognize the wide range of political activity occurring on a platform often denigrated as frivolous, and foreground the importance of identity characteristics to the technological and social shaping of these dialogues.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>By developing two versions of the same platform, TikTok manages to establish its business in two highly distinctive platform ecosystems. It represents the process of ‘platformization from China’ – the penetration of platform logics developed in the techno-political economy of China into the global society. Domestically the disruptive and infrastructural nature of the platform power is intermingled with and subject to Chinese state power, evidenced by the both restrictive (e.g. censorship) and promotional policies for internet economy. At the same time, the missing agenda to account for user privacy and civil rights in the online spaces also gives legislative immunity to Chinese platforms in advancing techniques of datafication and commodification. This uncanny system of governance fosters a highly innovative and commercialized platform ecology domestically to meet with regulatory requirements of the authorities, the financial interests of the capital and the monetary and expressive expectations of the users. However, these platform logics developed in the Chinese context seem to contradict the governing values of the international platform societies. Although internationally TikTok has adopted a more restrained approach in its affordances, commodification and content moderation, the platform remains susceptible for its potential supposed connection to the Chinese state and the concomitant censorship policy. If platforms developed in the American-centric ecosystem can easily identify themselves as global, then the challenge for Chinese platforms going global lies always on this figurative ‘Chineseness’, which is not necessarily defined by the content and culture, but by the techno-political logics embedded in the affordances and operational mechanisms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The informational disorder that sprawls through multiple state-nations, exacerbated by violent uprisings and coup attempts such as the US Capitol Storm on January 6th, 2021 and the Brazilian coup attempt on January 8th, 2023, has shed new light on the political economy of disinformation industries. In particular, it brings to the forefront the problem of economic incentives for creating and spreading disinformation. This paper builds on critical platform and infrastructure research literature for analyzing the multilateral infrastructural power of programmatic advertising networks. Our research questions are: how is power exercised by programmatic advertising infrastructures while managing its multilateral relationships? In terms of technicities, governance and business models, how does these infrastructures enable or reinforce desinformation disorder? This case study draws on a multi-methodological approach, combining digital methods research and critical analysis of platform documents. The empirical data obtained has 95.269 ads collected on the website (data scraped with a Python script developed by one of the authors) during the election month. Empirical data show that MGID, a native advertising platform, placed 54% of the advertisements on Terra Brasil Notícias. Google Ads was the second largest provider of digital ads on TBN, despite its policy`s restrictions on sellers that host unreliable or harmful content on issues such as health, climate, elections and democracy. Findings from the Brazilian case also contribute to understanding the infrastructural power of big tech governing the monetization of publishers in the Global South.</jats:p>",

The paper focuses on a particular identity demographic: that of the algorithmically inferred 'female', based in the 'UK', 'aged 25-34', and therefore deemed to be interested in 'fertility'. Though other algorithmic profiles certainly exist (and generate their own critical problems), I will use this particular template of subjectivity to explore issues of representation, black-boxing and user trust from a gendered perspective.&#x0D;\nCombining online audience reception with political economy, I analyse two ad campaigns - for Clearblue Pregnancy Tests and the Natural Cycles Contraceptive app - to understand how the algorithmically fertile female comes to exist, both at the level of the database and at the level of ad representation. I argue that black-boxing occurs at two stages in this process: firstly when the subject is computationally constituted as female (ie in the database) and secondly when the user herself is delivered the ads informed by her algorithmic identity (ie at the interface). This black-boxing creates 'algorithmic imaginaries' (Bucher, 2016) for the user wherein the burden of being made a fertile female in data is experienced as a form of immaterial and emotional labour. Some algorithmic constitutions can therefore be considered a form of algorithmic women's work; work that potentially generates distrust in targeted advertising.</jats:p>",

The draft policy was one of many in recent years that have\n        mandated data localization, protectionism or other measures of greater national control over\n        the digital economy in India. These actions are widely read as a nation-state asserting its\n        sovereignty in the digital realm against the power of US-based global tech firms.

Transparency reports shared by social network and gaming platform companies indicate increased take-downs of offensive and harmful comments, posts or content by artificially intelligent (AI) tools. Nonetheless, little is known about how such tools are designed and developed, what data they are trained on; and how this is done in practice. Many studies have discussed the opacity of such algorithmic _moderation, detection and prevention_ solutions, and called for their greater transparency to understand *how* and *what* user-interactive engagement features help in AI decision-making. This study examines a) the use of AI-solutions by social media and gaming companies to proactively address cyberbullying on their platforms, b) explore the current cyberbullying detection, prevention and proactive intervention strategies by such companies, and c) through comprehensive database search, review of existing computational literature on monitoring, detection and intervention strategies to address cyberbullying incidents amongst children. Our findings show that *very scarce* resources are available in the public domain to build AI algorithmic solutions to combat cyberbullying, and _little information_ is publicly available that would allow scrutiny of platforms' enforcement mechanisms.</jats:p>",

How does the world of FOSS volunteers connect to the world of commercial ecosystems? Are firms developing policies in relation to open source communities, requesting projects conform to certain technical or behavioral standards, for example? To what extent are these strategies successful? To answer, we present a qualitative analysis of firm discourses collected during three open source conferences. We then analyze the email discussion lists of Linux and Firefox and search for the occurrence of key firm discourse terms in order to ascertain in what way these discourses are being used by FOSS developers. Our in-depth analysis of firm discourses and exploratory analysis of project discussions around these terms show that the FOSS world encompasses a diversity of industrial outlooks. They also highlight the evolution of the role of foundations: whilst foundations used to protect projects from firm interference, some have now wholly been placed in the service of firm efforts to standardize project work, particularly around the key issue of security.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Estimates place Bitcoin’s current energy consumption at 141.83 terawatt-hours/year, an amount comparable to Ukraine. While Bitcoin’s energy problem has become increasingly visible in both academic and popular discourse (see Lally et al. 2019), the computational mechanisms through which the Bitcoin network generates coins, proof-of-work, has gone under-examined. This paper interrogates the “work” in proof-of-work systems. What is this work? How can we access its material history? I trace this history through a media archaeology of computational heat, in an attempt to better situate the intimate relationship between information and energy in proof-of-work systems. I argue the “work” in these systems is principally heat-work, and trace its ideological constructions back to nineteenth-century thermodynamic science, and the reframing of doing work as something exhaustible, directional, and irreversible (Prigogine &amp; Stengers 2017; Daggett 2019). I then follow thermodynamic discourse through Cybernetics debates in the 1940s, illustrating how, early in the formation of Information Theory, the heat-work undergirding the functioning of a “bit” was obscured and compartmentalized, allowing information to be productively abstracted apart from its energetic infrastructures (Hayles 1999; Kline 2015). I conclude with a discussion of the heat-work within the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Bitcoin’s principal mining tool, arguing that proof-of-work mining is not a radical exception to the computing status quo, but rather a lens through which to think more broadly about computing’s complex relationship to energy, and ultimately, how this relationship can be different.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Launched in 2008 as a site to collect the anonymous perspectives of current and former employees as well as their self-reported salaries, Glassdoor.com has grown to be a top destination for American job seekers wanting to learn more about the work environment of particular companies. Using reviewed posted by current and former Riot Games employees (the developer behind League of Legends) as a case study, I argue that Glassdoor is an easily accessible yet underutilized public yet anonymous resource for scholars interested in a peek ‘behind the curtain’ of industries reliant on non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements, such as the games industry. In this paper I report on my ongoing analysis of 740 current and former employee reviews of Riot posted to Glassdoor between October 2009 and March 2021. Riot is a particularly fruitful case study as it is a company that has been criticized for creating a toxic work environment, with sexual harassment and a lack of promotions for women being frequently discussed in the games media. As a result of this analysis, I argue it provides ample evidence to indicate that Glassdoor can be a fruitful venue for media industry scholars interested in better understanding employee perspectives about 'notorious' companies while mitigating potential harm to informants who might otherwise be reluctant to speak ‘on the record’ about an industry that remains resistant to change.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this abstract we show the results of an interdisciplinary research\n        in which we audit fake human faces generated by the website This Person Does Not Exist\n        (TPDNE), and discuss how this system can help perpetuate normativities supported by a\n        dependency on a limited database. Our analysis is centered on the “default generic face”\n        that we created by overlapping random samples of fake human faces generated by TPDNE's\n        algorithms – a version of Generative Adversarial Network, the StyleGAN2. To carry these\n        experiments, we built a database with 4100 fake human faces taken from TPDNE via web\n        scraping; we analysed them through a Python language script; and discussed behaviours\n        identified in results. Our analyses are based on the use of images, called “cluster-images”,\n        created from this overlapping of N arbitrary fake human faces by the TPDNE's algorithm. Our\n        experiments showed that, independently of the group of fake human faces sampled, the same\n        generic white face always appeared as a result. These results intrigue particularly because\n        the lack of diversity of TPDNE's generated faces is not a mere problem to be fixed in this\n        system in this digital infrastructure, but a dynamic of reinforcing standards that\n        historically regulate bodies, territories and practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When it comes to youth and media literacy, the focus of both research and practice has been on the integration of media literacy instruction into young people’s various educational experiences, rather than studying, implementing and evaluating such initiatives in situ, on social media—which is known to be youths’ central news source. Furthermore, existing studies focus on older platforms like Facebook or Twitter, and we lack a nuanced understanding of these dynamics on the platforms most popular with youth today. The present study aims to fill this gap, by analyzing how users responded to a media literacy education campaign on the popular youth-oriented social media app TikTok, with a focus on the lessons that we might draw in terms of targeted media literacy education initiatives for youth. Our large-scale qualitative content analysis—which included 11,449 public comments posted on 5 educational TikTok videos about media literacy—facilitated a naturalistic study of young people’s attitudes towards such initiatives. We found that reactions to the campaign were mixed, and highly political in nature. While many users appreciated the media literacy campaign and TikTok’s role in implementing it, there was also resistance to the campaign, due to factors related to video content, dissemination approach, and the very identity of TikTok as a platform. Across the board, comments were highly political, illustrating the politicized nature of media literacy education today. These reactions serve as rich feedback that can usefully inform future media literacy campaigns on social media, and especially those targeting youth audiences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Soon after the $2 decision overturned the federal right to abortion in the United States, an investigation revealed a disinformation campaign against birth control, driven by anti-abortion influencers. Disinformation targeting abortion and birth control is partially rooted in conspiracy, particularly the Great Replacement Theory, which plays on fears of white people being “replaced” by people of color. This notion is a long-standing issue of the anti-abortion movement, as early successes in banning abortion were partially motivated by fears of white people having fewer babies than people of color. Studies have shown that Black Americans believe in conspiracy theories about birth control, e.g., that it is deployed by the government as a form of genocide against Black people. Unfortunately, though, these beliefs are not entirely unfounded. This problematizes definitions of conspiracy theories as inherently false and unjustified—Black Americans, for instance, have long undergone inhumane experimentation by the American medical system. This illuminates a troubling connection—that between embodied oppression and conspiracy-believing. We query whether this overlap is weaponized by the anti-abortion community to spread disinformation campaigns. Through a critical technocultural discourse analysis of 14 hours of Instagram stories and posts from 154 members of the anti-abortion collected between February 14, 2023 and February 27, 2023, we find that the anti-abortion movement has weaponized feminist knowledge-production and relies on grains of embodied experience to spread disinformation campaigns, which at times snowball into racially-motivated conspiracy theories for political and/or financial gain.</jats:p>",

When fully implemented, this digital rights platform will operationalize both privacy and racial equity as priorities for all deployments of smart city technology.\n\nFirst, the platform will feature text and the open-source iconography that visually conveys how the City of Long Beach uses specific technologies, what data the devices collect and how the City utilizes that data. We plan to strategically deploy these information points across Long Beach, physically adjacent to or digitally embedded within civic technologies, e.g., sensors, cameras, small cells, mobile payment kiosks, and a 311 app. The platform will include a feedback application consisting of access (via QR code or hyperlink) to an online dashboard where users may learn additional details, update data collection preferences, and share comments/concerns with local government officials. The ultimate goal is to develop a backend solution that enables residents to opt-out of data collection.\n\nThe platform will provide residents with a clear understanding of how local government applies predictive and diagnostic analytics to personal data, and will also empower community members by granting them agency.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet entrepreneurs, EdTech companies, AI enthusiasts, and other powerful stakeholders around the world have promoted the idea that big data and learning analytics (LA) have the potential to revolutionise education. LA, defined as the continuous measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their context (Gašević et al., 2015, p. 1), is increasingly being used to track and evaluate what students do in internet-mediated environments. A growing body of literature has questioned the benefits attributed to the use of AI-based solutions and raised a number of concerns about the current developments in the education sector. Despite this growing interest among researchers, we know little about how the beliefs, values and feelings of different groups of educational practitioners shape how they engage with AI-driven learning analytics technologies and influence the evolution of the cultures of practice shaping the adoption of learning analytics. In this paper, we report on research that asks: how do culturally situated beliefs, values and emotions shape practitioners’ engagements with narrow AI in different contexts of practice? The research project as a whole examines these cultures of practice across three contrasting contexts. Here we will discuss early findings from one of these contexts – learning analytics in higher education. With insights from this research, we aim to contribute to empower practitioners in higher education and relevant stakeholders to foster the development of critical and reflective data cultures that are able to exploit the possibilities of learning analytics while being critically responsive to their societal implications and limitations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Convenience stores in their current, most globally popular form were born in the US, reinvented in Japan, and re-exported to Asia and the world. No company better illustrates this transnational trajectory than 7-Eleven. This paper turns to the humble, often-overlooked convenience store as a crucial site for thinking critically, historically, and globally about the discourse of Internet revolutions. In Japanese language business literature and popular descriptions, 7-Eleven Japan’s innovative use of networked computing and logistics from the 1980s onwards led (among other factors) to its immense national and then international success. In this paper I will draw on my archival research into the convenience store in Japan to argue for that this is a key site from which to rethink histories of networked computing and the Internet “revolution” in a non-Western context – furthering the project of “de-Westernizing” or de-colonizing Internet studies. Building on existing research on Internet histories in East Asia, this paper turns to the convenience store industry and 7-Eleven Japan in particular to tell a different story of the Internet itself. Many contemporaneous accounts of 7-Eleven’s practices in the 1980s and 1990s treat its turn to information-gathering, networked computing, logistics, and point of service ordering systems as revolutionary developments. As such the convenience store offers an alternative account of commercial revolutions and networked computing. It also offers a different view of contemporary discourses of “convenience” by retailers such as Amazon, an infrastructural or logistical view of convenience provision, and a new way of narrating Internet history.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For many, mapping platforms are enmeshed in everyday experiences. We navigate, locate, and move through the world with the help of their locative affordances. Consequently, these platforms have an intimate awareness of our movements and location history, and this information is valuable for advertisers. One way that platforms can track and share this information is through geofences, commonly used by companies to send targeted advertisements directly to platforms. Geofences are virtual perimeters established around target locations that act as a digital tripwire, marking who and what crosses its threshold. Digital mapping platforms like Google Maps broker this location data to third-parties (Bui, Chang, &amp; McIlwain, 2022).\n\nThis paper examines two applications of geofences as intermediaries of locational data. The first is the use of geofences by the property platform, CIVVL, that applies geofences to facilitate and accelerate the tenant eviction process. The second is Hawk Analytics, a locational data broker that geofences abortion clinics and sells the locational data from the clinic’s clients to anti-choice organizations, in jurisdictions of the United States where such healthcare is illegal. In our analysis of locational data, we apply the concept of platform intimacies (Rambukkana and de Verteuil, 2021; Ley, &amp; Rambukkana, 2021) to understand the techniques through which geofences access private locational details. This paper examines the spatial relations the geofence enforces and how this often-unregulated informational infrastructure can be applied to weaponize location data. We argue that the geofence enables an extractive relationship with intimate platform knowledge while it enforces hegemonic notions of trespass and belonging.</jats:p>",

Within the United States, however, the push to regulate platform companies—specifically, social media—has faltered. Neither standard interest group politics, nor partisan deadlock, nor the clash of liberal versus conservative ideologies adequately account for this situation. Drawing upon historical sources, an examination of political-ideational foundations, and an empirical analysis of recent Congressional hearings, this paper argues that an “anemic” policy regime has emerged for governance of the social media sector in the United States over the past two decades. Key attributes of this regime—its boundary-spanning nature, competing issue definitions, lack of policy cohesion, and administrative fragmentation—combine to impede the capability for problem-solving on the topic of regulatory reform.</jats:p>",

The meme re-emerged on TikTok in the days leading to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, gaining a new meaning. This paper is part of a larger research project with the objective of identifying and scrutinizing various forms of social media memetic participation in response to human tragedies, such as the Russia-Ukraine war. In this paper we focus on \"DM memes\" as a creative sub-meme of #Vladdydaddy. Drawing from theories of memetic participation (Milner, 2016) and imagined intimacy (Greenwood &amp; Long, 2011) for the analysis. The findings suggest that the DMing Putin meme emerges as a collective coping mechanism to fulfill an emotional need through the construction of imagined intimacy. The strict censorship laws within Russian borders underscores the significance of exploring seemingly trivial online discursive practices as courageous in a political context that can carry grave consequences offline. In doing so, we bring to the forefront the global community of creators who take a firm stance towards the current political climate in Russia.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies come with the promise of decentralizing transactions and disrupting the power of market intermediaries. Despite these promises, scholars argue that the risks associated with cryptocurrencies are still unclear.\n\nSome preliminary works investigate the manipulative role played by the circulation of problematic content on platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, Discord, or Telegram. Nonetheless, the research still lacks a clear and comprehensive picture of how widespread the phenomenon is across the whole ecosystem. Despite its prominence, Facebook is understudied in this context. To fill this gap, this work focuses on the role played by Meta’s main platform, as a venue employed to reach a wide audience prone to potential manipulative practices or scams related to cryptocurrencies. As part of a broader investigation on coordinated disinformation in Africa, we have come across a cluster of Facebook groups sharing content related to cryptocurrencies. The links shared by these networks revealed a very prolific cluster of 152 groups dedicated to Airdrop and Bounty initiatives for new cryptocurrencies. We collected a list of recent posts created by these groups between November 2021 and January 2022 (378,513 URLs). A preliminary analysis of these URLs pointed out an overwhelming presence of links to Telegram (47%) that highlights the central role played by this platform in this specific ecosystem. This paper explores the overlap between the cryptocurrency community and social media, analyzing how crypto-related projects are disseminated as a new type of problematic content on Facebook and Telegram.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Hinge to happily ever after is an arduous process in which dating apps place the burden of risk management on users. Women across the U.S. have joined regional “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” private Facebook groups to manage the ambiguities of dating, crowdsource information on men, and provide social support to other women experiencing the tribulations of modern dating. Using discourse analysis, this study analyzes the collective sensemaking practices of AWDTSG groups in relation to constructing knowledge, managing privacy boundaries, content moderation, and providing social support. Preliminary analysis reveals three major findings: Facebook groups provide a space of empowerment, however anticipated acts of moderation shape how knowledge claims are formed and legitimized. Second, group level moderation enacted by admins is understood by members as a means of community protection against platform interventions and interpersonal conflict with the outgroup. Third, social support is an integral part of knowledge creation, resisting cultural logics that socialize women to see each other as competitors in the dating sphere. These findings contribute to our understanding of how ICTs may be used in the service reclaiming gossip as a mode of resistance through the act of collective sensemaking.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research discusses how TikTok’s adaptation to Russian war censorship laws after the invasion of Ukraine affected content accessibility and prioritization on the platform. The study uses a combination of scraping and sock-puppet algorithmic audits to understand the impact of platform policy on information flows during times of war. The first test found that TikTok restricted access to non-Russian content in Russia, resulting in a 95% reduction of available content in the country. The second test revealed that TikTok unevenly applied its content policies, allowing pro-war content to proliferate in Russia despite its claim of enforcing a ban on new content uploads in the country. The third test highlighted a case of “shadow-promotion,” i.e., the prioritization of content supposed to be banned. The study's findings emphasize the need to monitor the platform's policy decisions during times of conflict, as they can contribute to the creation of a 'Splinternet.' The study also underscores the significant power that social media companies wield in shaping information flows during times of war and highlights the need to closely monitor platform policy decisions during such times. The article also provides recommendations for implementing the DSA in the EU context, which could help avoid problems such as those encountered while monitoring the platform in Russia.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online harassment is a public health concern, and social media algorithms are often proposed as a solution by social media companies. As online harassment grows, there are concerns that algorithms as content moderators fail to achieve their desired effect because of inabilities to contextualize social issues. This research contributes to the intersection of algorithms and online harassment by investigating the algorithmic folk theories of the victims, perpetrators, and bystanders of online harassment. Strategically sampling the experiences of marginalized identity categories who experienced harassment, we conducted grounded theory interviews and found that people theorize that algorithmic failures fuel online harassment and isolate victims. We describe four folk theories that victims, perpetrators, and witnesses utilize to make sense of their experiences of online harassment. The $2 asserts algorithms only pay attention to harassment incidents with a large number of flags. $2 describes perceptions of how algorithms amplify harassment content to increase engagement. $2 refers to perceptions that algorithms seek to form new audiences for content, which networks harassers together. $2 finds victims perceive that algorithms fail to contextualize the harassment of marginalized communities. Victims, bystanders, and perpetrators each described using their folk theories to instigate, push back, or succumb to the culture of online harassment. Understanding these algorithmic online harassment folk theories highlights how social media algorithms perpetuate harassment and fail to support victims.\n\n $2 : algorithmic folk theories, online harassment, networked harassment, social media, content moderation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2020 TikTok saw an influx of new users, looking for a sense of relief in the face of overwhelming loneliness, and found some palliative comfort in the sense of intimacy entailed in engaging with the works of microcelebrities. At the same time many new users became creators on TikTok, saw incredible growth, and quickly found themselves navigating a larger scale of demands on their attention and on their affects than they’d ever experienced, or, usually, expected. The purpose of this paper is to examine and describe the specific demands on the affective labor and attention of content creators on TikTok, the ways in which those demands tend to exceed what the creators themselves are comfortable with or capable of sustaining, and the challenges and limitations that prevent creators from setting, communicating, or maintaining boundaries around their labor, relationships, or personal and professional lives. I investigated these questions by participant observation and a series of interviews and explore answers in an ethnographic and autoethnographic framework. Audience members treat the emotional experience of creators as an open resource in two ways: 1) externalization, placing difficult emotional experiences in the creator’s hands with the expectation that the creator will do something about it, and so the audience member doesn’t have to; and 2) extraction, soliciting the public performance of an emotional reaction to material of the audience member’s choice. The dehumanizing experience of being treated as vending machines for intimacy is an ongoing psychological harm that, to some extent, all microcelebrities endure.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the manifestation of 'everyday' online misogyny. Social media platforms are often deeply unsafe spaces for women, particularly women who speak publicly about feminist issues. In response to a number of public controversies over the last decade, platforms have introduced a range of different design interventions and policy changes. However, these interventions have predominantly focused on the most extreme, unambiguous manifestations of online misogyny. Current literature on gender-based violence emphasises that ‘everyday’ expressions of misogyny play a significant role in normalising violence against women and reinforcing the beliefs that underpin the more exceptional misogynistic attacks.\n\nThis paper presents the initial findings of a case study of everyday misogyny on Twitter in discourses about the $2 trial. It aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how everyday misogyny manifests in ordinary language and debates on social media platforms, as a step towards developing better mechanisms for identifying and responding to online misogyny. Our preliminary findings challenge platforms' traditional reliance on counterspeech-based approaches to addressing the harms of everyday misogyny. Rather than serving as a remedy, this study suggests that online debate about women's experiences of violence can instead, in some circumstances, become a vehicle for oppression, a manifestation of everyday online misogyny.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>After the leak of the Dobbs decision that ultimately overturned Roe v. Wade, technology companies made a series of public statements in support of user privacy: Apple released an advertisement showcasing privacy features; Google promised to delete location data of abortion clinic visitors; Meta announced testing of default end-to-end-encryption. Corporations like Meta once worked to convince users that their platforms were morally neutral. Now, they publicly “crack down” on manipulation and speak out for racial justice, despite privately subjecting activists to state surveillance. To bolster their authority and popularity, platforms engage in “commodity activism,” in which corporations take positions on social issues. Ultimately, this enhances corporate capital rather than enacting social change. Care, in its ideal, is opposed to neoliberalism: resisting individuality in favor of community and refusing to reduce humans to capital. Yet, paternalistic care can be a weapon – used to ensnare and to oppress. Through a critical technocultural discourse analysis of platforms’ public utterances and policy changes after the Dobbs leak, we find that platforms redefine care in three main ways. For users, care is neoliberal - platforms provide good privacy options, for which users are individually responsible. For employees, care is paternalistic - employees are offered money for healthcare, at the expense of free expression. Finally, ultimate care is for the platform - that company culture is protected, alliance with the state unthreatened, and above all, profit is promoted. Platform decisions are revealed to extend care in some ways, while also maintaining control over users and their data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A growing body of academic work on internet governance focuses on the “deplatforming of sex,” or the removal and suppression of sexual expression from the internet. Often, this is linked to the 2018 passing of FOSTA/SESTA – much-criticized twin bills that make internet intermediaries liable for content that promotes or facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. We suggest analyzing both internet governance and the deplatforming of sex in conjunction with long-term agendas of conservative lobbying groups. Specifically, we combine media historiography, policy analysis, and thematic and discourse analysis of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation’s (NCOSE, formerly Morality in Media) press releases and media texts to show how conservative moral entrepreneurs weaponize ideas of morality, obscenity, and harm in internet governance. We illustrate how NCOSE has, directly and indirectly, interfered in internet governance, first by lobbying for rigorous enforcement of obscenity laws and then for creating internet-specific obscenity laws (which we argue CDA, COPA, and FOSTA/SESTA all were for NCOSE). We show how NCOSE adjusted their rhetoric to first link pornography to addiction and pedophilia and later to trafficking and exploitation; how they took advantage of the #metoo momentum; mastered legal language, and incorporated an explicit anti-internet stance.</jats:p>",

Findings suggested that despite financial opportunities, respondents felt ambivalent by the monetization opportunities afforded by this digital space.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Before the millennium, finding other queer people often involved travelling to a queer venue in a city. Consequently, queer people have been at the forefront of internet technologies such as hook-up apps, namely $2 . Rural hook-up app use is under-researched, and queer visibility may be more carefully negotiated in rural areas than in cities.\n\nWe carried out a qualitative study to establish whether location and/or technology use shaped social, sexual and romantic network creation and/or quality. Thirty-eight participants in cities and rural areas across the UK took part.\n\nWe found hook-up apps to be the only source of local queer connection for some rural participants. Users speak of being drawn to these technologies when lonely, yet find they can contribute to feelings of isolation. Being visible, which the pictorial logic of some hook-up apps demands, can be difficult in rurality due to partial ‘outness’ about sexuality. Some fear meeting other app users in public in rural areas due to potential homophobia, yet lack access to private spaces. Some users find innovative ways to meet goals of friendship and community beyond the perceived affordances of sexual hook-ups, such as forming friendship and community groups via or beyond apps.\n\nThis demonstrates that hook-up apps are inadequately-tailored tools for participants’ queerness, which extends beyond visible sexuality to negotiated communities and relationships of trust.

    "title": "GAMING PLATFORMS AS CHAOTIC NEUTRAL?: TOXIC PERFORMANCE, COMMUNITY RESISTANCE, AND AGONISTIC POTENTIAL",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the post-gamergate era, much has been written about the toxicity of online multiplayer video gamespaces. Yet, game scholars agree that the actual definition of the term ‘toxic’ is slippery. There is also consensus that toxicity is a highly context-dependent phenomenon reliant on the relation of players to one another but extending further to include the technical elements of the game (Canossa et al., 2021; Hilvert-Bruce &amp; Neill, 2020; Kou, 2020; Kowert, 2020). Past scholarship in this area also illustrates that these spaces are deeply gendered and center masculine normativity (Cote, 2020; Gray, 2020; Ruberg, 2019; Shaw, 2015). Players from various positionalities may enter conflict when there is dissent over the definition and norms of the space. In these instances of conflict there is the potential for agonism (Laclau &amp; Mouffe, 1985). We employed cultural probes in tandem with focus groups and interviews to better understand how players experience toxicity in online gaming spaces. Emerging from participants’ conversations, this paper explores performative behaviours which are emblematic of performing toxicity or ‘counterplay’. We propose three common instances of counterplay: antagonistic counterattack, when a player reciprocates or matches the toxic behaviour of an antagonist; ludic mithridatism, when a player develops a threshold for tolerating toxicity in a gamespace; and playful transgression, when a player or group of players performs counter-hegemonic identity-work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Striving to advance our understanding of how social media is used by Sudanese people to engage in politics and continue their resistance against an authoritarian regime, this study examines how online humor facilitated political expression after the December Revolution. Using thematic analysis of user-generated content posted on the Shabab Hilween Facebook page, the main social media outlet of prominent Sudanese youth content creators, this research attempts to highlight how youth-created humorous videos prompted political expression among Sudanese social media users. The findings highlight the significance of proactive memefication and templatization as an act the page owners use to generate community user-generated content. Hundreds of memefied screenshots created or appropriated by users were observed in the comment section to address unfolding political events. This begs the question of what content is essentially popular culture for Sudanese people, especially youth, who, due to years of censorship and propaganda, have no interest in mainstream media? This study discusses the role of Sudanese content creators in addressing this cultural void. The analysis also reveals how Sudanese social media users sought political catharsis and collective relief from the Shabab Hilween page’s humorous videos and the comment section.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the changes in digital practices of intimacy during the COVID-19 social distancing period in the UK, and whether these transformations have persisted in the ‘new normal’. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, collecting quantitative and qualitative data from 824 adults who used dating apps during the pandemic, and conducting 60 in-depth interviews. The study aimed to understand the digital intimate practices of heterosexual and LGBT+ communities during and after COVID-19.\n\nFirst, we describe (using both descriptive statistics and excerpts from participant interviews) the changes to practices of digital intimacy during COVID-19. Second, we will explore the distribution of these changes among communities. In particular, we describe the differences between heterosexual and LGBT+ respondents, and between white and ethnic minority respondents. Third, we explore how these changes have endured after COVID-19. In particular, we will explore how changes to what people look for in their app use endured or returned to ‘pre-covid’\n\nThe paper concludes by arguing that dating app's increasing status as health actors, particularly during a pandemic, necessitates more research in this area. This study provides insights into how digital practices of intimacy have transformed during COVID-19 and whether these transformations have endured in the ‘new normal’. Understanding these changes is essential to adequately support people’s emotional and sexual well-being during and after a time of crisis.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines how MCNs (Multi-Channel Networks) intervene in the platform economy by manufacturing influencers. Previous studies have explored the emergence of influencers and creators from various perspectives, including platformization, creative labor, and algorithmic power. However, little attention has been paid to another crucial player – MCNs which incubate and train influencers on an industrial scale. MCNs are firms and organizations that collaborate with influencers to facilitate the production, promotion, and monetization of creative content. They serve not only as incubators for micro-entrepreneurs and influencers looking to establish their businesses, but also as a key intermediary between influencers and other stakeholders on platforms. This study combines in-depth interviews with documented lawsuits to explore the role of MCNs in the platform economy, as well as their relationships with influencers. The findings suggest that MCNs significantly shape the platform economy through three strategies: manufacturing influencers, spreading industry lore, and exploiting creativity. On one hand, MCNs help established influencers maintain their success and reduce the risk of creativity while exploiting the labor of aspirants who struggle to enter the platform economy. As such, they constitute a power imbalance by providing business for successful influencers and increasing precarity for ordinary influencers. On the other hand, MCNs continue to expand their business scopes to meet the needs of various stakeholders, mainly platforms, advertisers, and brands. Consequently, MCNs have the ability to facilitate the relationship between these actors, industrialize aspiring influencers, and determine who can participate in creative labor.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The careers of social media content creators, or influencers, live or die by their ability to cultivate and maintain an invested audience-community. To this end, they are encouraged to practise relational labour (Baym, 2018) to build authentic self-brands and intimacy with audiences. Drawing on a longitudinal ethnographic study of the London influencer industry (2017-2023), this paper examines relational labour through an intersectional feminist lens, foregrounding the ways in which structural inequalities shape relationships between creators and their audiences. This research found that the tolls of managing audience relationships are higher for marginalised creators—especially those who make critical leftist and feminist content—who find themselves on an uneven playing field in the challenges they face as well as the coping strategies at their disposal. Creators employed four key tactics to navigate relational labour and boundaries with audiences: (1) leaning into making rather than being content; (2) (dis)engagement with anti-fans through silence and digital self-harm; (3) retreating into private community spaces, away from the exposure of public platforms; and (4) turning off public comments. Marginalised creators find themselves in an intimacy triple bind, already at higher risk of trolling and harassment, yet under increased pressure to perform relational labour, adversely opening them up to further harms in the form of weaponised intimacy. Findings highlight the individualisation of risk and harm as a structural norm in the influencer industry, raising serious questions about the lack of accountability and responsibility that platforms show towards the creators who generate profit for them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing prevalence of data-rich networked information technologies—such as social media platforms, smartphones, wearable devices, and the internet of things —brings an increase in the flow of rich, deep, and often identifiable personal information available for researchers. More than just “big data,” these datasets reflect people’s lives and activities, bridge multiple dimensions of a person’s life, and are often collected, aggregated, exchanged, and mined without them knowing. We call this data “pervasive data,” and the increased scale, scope, speed, and depth of pervasive data available to researchers require that we confront the ethical frameworks that guide such research activities. Multiple stakeholders are embroiled in the challenges of research ethics in pervasive data research: researchers struggle with questions of privacy and consent, user communities may not even be aware of the widespread harvesting of their data for scientific study, platforms are increasingly restricting researcher’s access to data over fears of privacy and security, and ethical review boards face increasing difficulties in properly considering the complexities of research protocols relying on user data collected online. The results presented in this paper expand our understanding of how ethical review board members think about pervasive data research. It provides insights into how IRB professionals make decisions about the use of pervasive data in cases not obviously covered by traditional research ethics guidelines, and points to challenges for IRBs when reviewing research protocols relying on pervasive data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>TikTok has rapidly established itself as a fixture for debate on the state of the web and society at large. The platform serves as a primary generator of trends and viral content, and as a locus for political concerns around globalisation, surveillance and privacy. What is considerably understudied is how TikTok is forging connections in political discourses more locally. We present an exploration of political discourses on TikTok through the case study of local city council elections, and later state elections, for Brisbane in the state of Queensland, Australia. Video metadata was recorded using the Zeeschuimer (Peeters, 2023) tool. We focus on the discursive dynamics of the broader local community both separately and in response to the communication of candidates. We draw on research on the social news landscape and the role of ‘newsfluencers’ and community narratives amidst changing audience expectations (Hurcombe, 2022), and clustering of cross-ideological ties in social media news sharing over time (Angus et al, 2023). Through this, we contrast the topic-selective engagement across various actors, from mainstream and national news outlets, local or alternative media, businesses, organisations, political campaigners, and unaffiliated individual users. As such, we focus on how local TikTok users respond to, remix, engage with, and disseminate political communication on TikTok, as well as how they create their own political content, such as advocating for/against a candidate, an issue, or engaging in commentary on the wider election process.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The industry of sextech is on the rise. But while the term sextech has been applied to a wide range of intimate technologies, it is often understood in terms of technologies that enhance or improve sex in an individualist manner. This panel instead furthers an understanding less concerned with sexuality as a question of technological optimisation, and more invested in sextech as technologies, not only for pleasure and health, but also for regulation, surveillance, and biopolitical management. We explore the growth of the sextech industry and its relationships to surveillance capitalism, artificial intelligence, data governance, and politics of pleasure. Drawing from empirical data with sextech users, retailers, developers, and founders as well as collaborations between industry and academia, the papers explore how sextech industries outsource labour, upscale automation, and shape intimate connections through digital technologies. While we consider the interplay of sextech and public health, we do not seek to evaluate the therapeutic utility of sextech use. Instead, we adopt a sociotechnical approach, reflecting on how cultural assumptions around gender, sexuality, health, and pleasure guide and inform sextech markets. The panel is structured by moving from broad interrogations of the issues within the sex tech industry to case studies of specific platforms, before finishing with a consideration of user experiences of queering sextech to explore some possible futures. In these case studies, focusing on industry practices allows us to see how sextech is marketed as simultaneously sexually empowering, a source of self-knowledge, and a solution for social inequality and injustice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on online political discourse has long been concerned with the pervasiveness of incivility across various digital arenas. However, most of this work has focused on discourse that is rude in tone, but not necessarily harmful in substance. Consequently, there remains a significant gap in understanding the true impact of harmful online speech on both its targets and bystanders. Addressing this gap, this four-country experimental study examines perceptions and reactions to intolerant online discourse. We focus on Brazil, Germany, the UK, and the US, democracies with high internet use and notable increases in online intolerance. We manipulate three types of intolerance (discrimination, hateful speech, violent threats), tone (civil, uncivil), and target (women, LGBT) to examine how these factors influence both perceptions and reactions to intolerance. For instance, hateful and threatening speech is expected to elicit stronger responses compared to discriminatory content. Additionally, the study explores how the tone of discourse influences support for content moderation practices and engagement in political discussions, particularly among targeted identity groups. Ultimately, this research endeavors to deepen understanding of the nuanced dynamics of online intolerance and its repercussions on democratic discourse in diverse socio-political landscapes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital platforms and services are making inroads into the everyday lives of even very young children. As with many other domains of life, children’s learning and education are increasingly digitised through ‘educational technology’ software, or more commonly EdTech. The rise of the EdTech industry provokes new questions about children’s education in the digital age. Methodologically, studying the EdTech industry for children largely falls in the field of the political economy of digital childhood, an interdisciplinary research agenda underpinned by an overall interest in understanding the critical roles of institutions, especially companies and governments, in producing and distributing digital services that shape children’s and families’ everyday consumption of digital technologies. This paper focuses on the methodological offerings of a design-based method for researching the political economy of digital childhood. We explore how a design-based approach is compatible with the research interests of a political economy perspective by drawing on the processes and findings of a collaborative design intervention study which aimed to conceptualise and build a database of EdTech companies and products for young children living in Australia. Based on the findings of the Database, this paper illustrates how the design-based approach employed in this study enabled the researchers to identify the key EdTech industry trends and characteristics, surfaces the power asymmetry between EdTech corporations and individual users, and provoke new ideas and imaginaries among parents and educators to address these challenges.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we explore transnational discursive campaigns that use online popular culture to consolidate a “countercultural” vision of hard to extreme right politics. Hyperpartisan sites form a “mirror universe” or alternate news industry, counterposing their passionate partisanship against what they deem the fraudulent objectivity of mainstream media. In our preliminary study, we noted that “anti-woke” hashtags and memes were heavily freighted with transphobic images and messages and co-occurred with a range of other far-right content (with strong currents of anti-immigration, misogynist, “anti-system,” and conspiracy themes). Presented in mocking tones and mobilized by hyperpartisan sites, transphobic memes participate in consolidating far-right hegemony via online countercultural forms. In mapping the distribution patterns of this content, we observed 1) the extent to which a range of seemingly “independent” sites distribute the same content within a short period of times; 2) how “anti-woke” hashtags and memes served to consolidate a far-right worldview and package it as countercultural; 3) and finally, how transphobic content came to constitute something of a “federating” theme – an ideological entry point into or representative of a larger ensemble of sociopolitical arguments. In this sense, transphobia works as a federating meme, creating information cascades that promote alt-right ideologies. Information cascades describe patterns of online conformity (Lemieux 2003) on social media platforms like Twitter. By tracking a range of Quebecois right-wing influenceurs, we aim to ascertain the opportunistic mobilisation and reach of transphobic content in this Quebecois alternative influence network.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How do workers conceptualize a platform’s algorithm and adjust their practices to its logic? To pursue this question, we draw on an ethnography of Grab, the leading rideshare platform in Southeast Asia, composed of 60+ trips talking to drivers on the back of bikes in Hanoi, and in-depth interviews with 10 drivers. From this rich material, we identify a strategic cluster of practices that we term “taming the algorithm.”\n\nTaming requires three key moves: iteratively adapting behaviors to algorithmic pressures (improvisation), juggling competing demands to deliver a productive performance at bodily limits (scrambling), and repeating these activities over time until they become a baseline in the system (enduring). If done successfully, these moves establish routinized productivity, a pattern of algorithmically ideal labor that means the platform will consistently delegate tasks to the worker. Taming is inherently double-edged, an exhausting form of self-exploitation that nevertheless provides some predictability and agency to workers.\n\nTaming the algorithm offers a contribution on two fronts. First, it allows us to prise the ontological and the technical aspects of platform labor apart: these moves are risky, brutal, and chaotic for workers but are smoothed into desirable integers and patterns by the algorithm. Secondly, it articulates a minor freedom between the twin poles of Freedom and Unfreedom as conventionally understood, showing how workers achieve some agency and some perception of power without fundamentally disrupting the systemic inequalities maintained by platform logics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper historicizes feminist data activism, particularly as it relates to the use of grassroots data by feminist activists to address gendered violence in public spaces. It seeks to address the following question: How did grassroots data become widely accepted as a legitimate means to combat gendered violence in public spaces? This historical perspective allows us to unpack what seems to be a novel action repertoire within contemporary feminist activism.\n\nI use media genealogy to trace the history of a particular grassroots data type: the Women's Safety Audit (WSA). The data for this study come from historical records published by the feminist organisation that pioneered the WSA and different UN agencies, spanning four decades since the emergence of the WSA in the 1980s (n=41). I also drew upon modern data initiatives' documents and interviews with data activists and stakeholders who funded data activism efforts.\n\nThis paper reveals three significant forces that have shaped the WSA and how it came to be accepted as a means to address gendered violence in public spaces: the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design approach, the dominance of evidence-based practices, and the imperative of scalability. Rather than signalling the emergence of innovative epistemic cultures as some scholars suggest, this genealogy of the WSA showed that grassroots data approach has indeed been folded into other hegemonic interests throughout the history. Grappling with this entanglement and the hierarchy of power/knowledge it enacts is crucial for feminist activism to not reproduce the power relations they seek to address.</jats:p>",

These findings are only a small part of a larger four year study, funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which examined the advocacy communication activities of NGOs working on women’s health in the US, Europe, Latin America, Brazil and India.\n\nQuestions included how NGOs’ communication strategies reflect on their communication activities, and how they combine offline and online media to advocate on SRHR. The research made use of a mixed methods approach which included in depth interviews with 50 CEOs from the organizations as well as a short survey applied to the communication directors of these NGOs, including from Care International UK to Anis Brazil. This was combined with critical discourse analysis (CDA) of their institutional websites, as well as their social media engagement on social network platforms. This paper focuses on the CDA results of the social media engagement of the organizations conducted during the months of March and April 2019, when a total of 1.505 tweets were collected. Findings show an emphasis on ‘hard fact’s, including NGO journalism devices such as ‘fact checking’, however with a growth in use of more human interest stories, particularly making use of storytelling, to reach out to larger audiences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Beauty is one of the most popular and lucrative segments on YouTube, with broad transnational appeal, making it an ideal site to investigate the relationship between commercialization, globalization, and digital platforms. We focus on makeup reviews to utilize established research on cross-cultural differences in reviewing and ask how cultural repertoires of evaluation compare across multiple languages. We collected popular makeup reviews using keyword searches in five languages—English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean—associated with diverse cultural contexts. The top 20 videos in each language (n=100) were selected for analysis, producing a group of successful channels. We employed content analysis to compare the videos’ evaluative criteria, using a codebook of ten values. We found that creators across languages employ a shared cultural repertoire to evaluate beauty products, concerned with aesthetics, functionality, pleasure, and, to a lesser extent, distinctiveness and economy. While beauty creators appeal to a consistent set of values, they rarely elaborate on their meaning, focus on positivity, and emphasize the subjectivity of their evaluations. We argue that the approach to evaluation in YouTube makeup reviews challenges previously observed dichotomies between Eastern and Western countries, blending elements of both collectivist and individualist communication styles. Most creators make indirect recommendations even as they use reviews to build a distinctive personal brand. Although further research is necessary to investigate the reach of this practice, our analysis of multi-lingual makeup reviews demonstrates how the homogenization of social media entertainment need not be synonymous with Westernization.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper conceptualises digital peacebuilding by demonstrating how Muslim, Lumad, and Christian young women leaders, who are marginalised in peacebuilding processes, are using Facebook and TikTok in building everyday peace in the Philippines' Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Through an intersectional feminist lens and employing social media analysis, the article demonstrates how these women navigate their diverse identities online, shaping discussions on peace and security within BARMM and extending their influence beyond the region's peace process. Preliminary findings reveal that (1) social media is a vital platform for young women to voice their peace agenda, often neglected in traditional and institutional peacebuilding platforms; (2) within the diverse context of BARMM, different groups of young women have distinct perceptions of peacebuilding; (3) practising care both to the self and community is central to their peacebuilding work; and (4) digital peacebuilding of young women leaders extends beyond the mere use of technology to promote peace and encompasses unique ‘platform vernaculars’ (Gibbs et al., 2015). This paper broadens the narrow 'tool' view of digital peacebuilding,' emphasising the crucial interplay between technology and social practices in understanding its effectiveness in achieving and sustaining peace. Additionally, by documenting the active involvement of young women in digital peacebuilding, it ensures their perspectives are integrated into peace processes, promoting more inclusive and equitable paths to conflict resolution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Conspiracy theories have been studied increasingly in recent years, with the main research approach to understanding conspiracy theorists focusing on their personal characteristics. However, research has not yet clarified the role of online communities in the identity and social experience of believers. To address this, this research endeavor examines the social and community dynamics among conspiracy theory believers, focusing on the case study of the public Facebook group \"The Flat Earth Community – Israel.\" Through a qualitative content analysis of posts and comments from within the group, the study reveals the role of a sense of community in the experiences of group participants. Findings reveal that participants seek appreciation and solidarity within the group while engaging in boundary work to maintain the authenticity of group members and defend the group against 'threats from the outside.' This research offers a deeper understanding of how online communities, serving as safe spaces for individuals whose beliefs are marginalized by societal norms, can fulfill a similar function for conspiracy theory believers. Such an in-depth understanding can help researchers to contend with the negative aspects of belief in conspiracy theories, for example through the consideration of alternative mechanisms that could satisfy participants’ need for a sense of community.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Wars have always been mediated. However, the tools and techniques for mediation, facilitation, and creation of knowledge about the war have significantly changed in the last decade with the fast growth of new media and technologies. Understanding the details of military operations by civilians has become possible nowadays with social media and digital technology that change people's perception of war. This research focuses on Ukrainian Telegram channels that position themselves as open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigators and provide detailed information for civilians on types of missiles or drones in the air during the ongoing attack. They use information from military and open sources to facilitate the war for the general public and mediate the attacks. The paper explores how those Telegram channels became essential players in military communication during the active phase of the war in Ukraine. It also discusses the emergence of a new digital industry of monitoring the air in Ukraine for war participation and mediation. The research uses a digital ethnographic observation method to explore the ten most popular Ukrainian Telegram channels that provide information about attacks and examine types of messages, framing, wording, and other information-specificities for participatory warfare and constructing knowledge about the war. Also, textual and visual analysis of the messages and comments allows us to identify patterns in the work of those Telegram channels. This paper is a work in progress.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper charts the emergence of a distinct category of research-dedicated GenAI platforms, which we term Research GenAI or RGAI. These platforms are explicitly marketed to a cross-disciplinary academic audience, promising to automate research discovery and writing tasks, such as identifying/summarising published research, writing literature reviews, conducting data analysis, and synthesising findings. RGAI platforms (e.g., Consensus, Elicit, Research Rabbit, Scholarcy, Scite, SciSpace) are rapidly being adopted, in a context of experimentation, uncertainty, and controversy.\n\nWe define the contours of Research GenAI by mapping the history and development of RGAI platforms and developing a preliminary typology of RGAI. We situate RGAI platforms within the scholarly economy and ongoing processes of platformisation and automation of academic work. We make a case for the need to understand RGAI platforms as complex sociotechnical systems that intersect with social, ethical, institutional, and legal questions, and demonstrate this approach through an STS-informed walkthrough of two notable RGAI platforms: Consensus and Elicit. In this presentation we present our findings generated from these walkthroughs and explore the implications of the technologies for the academic publishing industry.</jats:p>",

I also suggest that the press coverage of Lensa, which both articulates key AI-related harms and frames those harms as intractable and insolvable, creates a discourse of inevitability (Leonardi &amp; Jackson, 2003; Markham, 2021) that has implications for how these issues are understood by the public, and for the approaches that are taken to address them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents initial findings from an ongoing research project that investigates the discursive construction of race, gender, and sexuality in the visual culture of three online far-right extremist platforms in Scandinavia. This interdisciplinary project brings together feminist theory of humour and harm with digital media research into memes and the far-right in order to explore the hateful discourse in the online humour of the far-right.\n\nThe data consists of visual content posted to three different social media platforms in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.\n\nAs the paper discusses work in progress, the findings of the project are limited at the time of writing. However, the initial coding of the data set reveals similar themes across the three websites:\n\n1: The function of humour in the visual content, which works to create insiders and outsiders.\n\n2: Far-right ideology which discursively constructs the “ideal” Scandinavian citizen as a white man via the discursive “othering” of the racialized (mostly Muslim) non-citizen. This othering is expressed via a characterization of the non-European outsider as barbaric, sexually perverted, and culturally backward.\n\n3: The overlap between racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia which is expressed through an anti-woke discourse that ridicules women’s rights, feminism, and questions the existence of trans lives.\n\nIn a discursive space where hate and humour coexist, violent discourse might be trivialised and considered “just a joke”. The paper, however, makes a point of taking humour seriously by critically addressing the hate hidden under the guise of humour.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of virtual celebrity realises the ambition of manufactured pop idols that inspired Japan’s idol industry in the 1970s, and spread across East Asia soon thereafter. Today, the term encompasses a variety of genres with local histories and applications, including Vocaloids, virtual idols, vTubers, virtual anchors, and virtual influencers. Although virtual celebrity was once considered a niche interest reserved for $2 and dedicated fans of ACG (Anime, Comics and Games), recent shifts in government priorities, technological innovations, and heightened capital investment have brought virtual celebrity into mainstream view. This panel considers the various organisations, technologies, platforms, labour, and stakeholders involved in East Asia’s flourishing virtual celebrity industries. Its five papers explore the commercial, cultural, and symbolic value of virtual celebrities across and beyond East Asia, examining historical antecedents; cross-industry collaborations; processes of cultural commodification; industrial practices; and emergent media discourses. Introducing cases from Japan, Korea, and China, the panel's regional focus draws attention to the “transnational” (Iwabuchi, 2014) flows of virtual celebrity across borders, languages, industries, platforms, and technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Concerns about the aging of the Chinese population (Y. Wang &amp; Su, 2024), and with the Chinese government's acknowledgment of the silver-haired economy's significant development, there is an urgent need for research into the social media engagement of the elderly. Short videos, representing a novel form of information dissemination and social engagement, offer the elderly a means to connect across time and space (Zhang &amp; Xiang, 2023). Short form video is dynamic and intuitive, making audio-visual information and public communication particularly accessible to older audiences. Notably, On 15th January 2024, the General Office of the State Council of China published the \"Opinions on Developing the Silver Economy and Enhancing the Well-Being of the Elderly.\" This document marks the inaugural national policy directive specifically addressing the “Silver Economy” by the Chinese Government (Huang, 2024). The issuance of the Opinions policy underscores the critical role of the elderly demographic within the ambit of China's contemporary digital and cultural milieu, highlighting the government's commitment to integrating this segment of the population into the broader socio-economic framework.\n\nHowever, existing research, both domestically and internationally, has predominantly examined the participation of older adults in short video platforms from the user perspective, often overlooking the significant number of older individuals actively contributing as content creators within the short video culture. Consequently, this research addresses this gap and is dedicated to examining the involvement of Chinese elderly individuals in the realm of short-form video culture, specifically as content creators.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The multifaced nature of online dating practices and experiences highlights both its empowering potential and the challenges it poses, including stigma and violence, particularly within the contexts of queer and LGBT+ communities and the subjectivities they contain. This paper aims to explore perceptions and responses to risks and fears in online dating experiences among queer young adults in Italy and Australia, utilising a qualitative approach through focus groups (15 in total, 8 in Italy and 7 in Australia). Initial findings from Italy reveal concerns about outing, appearance-based judgments, and hierarchies of intimacies, with participants employing various strategies for safety. Similar strategies for risk mitigation during offline encounters are observed across both contexts. As the analysis of Australian focus groups remains ongoing, anticipation mounts for further elucidation of the nuanced dynamics at play within this cultural setting. Overall, the study underscores the resilience and resourcefulness of queer individuals in navigating online dating complexities while emphasizing the need for safer and more inclusive digital spaces for these communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 2017, IT professionals have held the highest average salaries in China and are engaged in diverse roles spanning various levels of tech work. Despite their wage advantages, they face intense job market competition and opt to switch jobs to leverage their value or pursue higher salaries in an industry characterized by high uncertainty and mobility. To gain a competitive edge, many individuals turn to “ $2 .” Unlike its interpretation in the agricultural context as involution, $2 in the workplace refers to internal cut-throat competition. However, given the inherent uncertainty of the IT industry, the outcome of $2 does not necessarily guarantee success, prompting some professionals to abandon it. Existing research on $2 primarily examines it as a social phenomenon, with limited focus on employees’ perspectives regarding their practices and perceptions of the term, as well as their reasons for embracing $2 (not $2 ). By conducting 30 semi-structured interviews in Beijing, a city where the IT industry is highly concentrated, the research investigates how IT professionals perceive $2 from an insider perspective and how some navigate work uncertainties by embracing $2 . Using a qualitative approach, this study contributes to academic discourse by providing an empirical perspective distinct from media narratives. Findings reveal that both $2 and $2 are adaptive responses to the commercialization of labour in the Chinese IT sector. This research highlights the nuanced dynamics of competition and withdrawal in contemporary Chinese workplaces.</jats:p>",

    "title": "‘GUERILLA ANALYSIS’ AND THE INSTITUTIONAL VOICE: THE TELEGRAM’S PRODUCTIVE MESO-SPACE OF CORONAVIRUS VISUALIZATIONS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>During the coronavirus pandemic, Israeli Telegram became a staple venue of pandemic news, as the platform served as the Ministry of Health’s primary official output. Over time, Telegram also became home to a community of ‘Guerilla Analysts’ who pooled together their analytical resources to create a ‘National Graph Headquarters’. Utilizing the same data as the MoH channel, this ragtag crew of data-loving laypeople created a space in which data-literacies are shared and developed. Informed by conceptualizations of messaging apps as “news meso-space(s)”, digital collaborative information-making practices, and the notion that visualizations can promote civic deliberation and political empowerment, this paper explores the rhetorical and discursive framework that enabled informational migration and evolution, and the co-production of data-oriented pandemic narratives across both groups, resulting in an exceptionally empowering informational eco-system. It does so by applying qualitative rhetorical visualization analysis to 100 pairs of institutional and guerilla visualizations of the same data, prior to qualitative discourse analysis of 30 related comment threads. Findings reveal that while the ‘Institutional Voice’ remained focused on conservative visualizations of the present and past, guerilla analysts often re-visualize MoH visualizations into predictive narratives, and take bolder swings in proposing actionable implications. While primarily focused on sociable elucidation of complex analyses, comment discourse also challenges and re-visualizes ‘Guerilla’ narratives, further extending informational empowerment. Predominantly conceptualized as a subversive venue, I highlight Telegram as a civic platform and propose a conceptualization of messaging apps as productive and empowering meso-spaces, utilizing common social and analytical resources towards a common good.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Engagement with beauty has historically been seen as inherently consumptive and (perhaps therefore) inherently feminine and trivial. Popular discourse today would suggest, however, that beauty is increasingly seen as creative, and no longer assumed to be the domain of any one gender, particularly in online spaces. Amidst celebrations of the democratisation of beauty on one end, and cries of an appearance-obsessed culture on the other, what does a situated feminist examination of online beauty culture tell us today? This paper maps the practices of beauty brands online by analysing 545 Instagram posts made by the five most followed beauty brands in India to examine whom they represent and how, but also how these images are produced at the intersection of techno-aesthetic choices, platform affordances, market considerations, and the modes of gendered identity privileged by culture at a given point in time. In the Indian context, where gendered labour precarity has been baked into the social system, and the promise of transformation through digital democratisation runs loud in socio-political discourse, the beauty brand on Instagram offers a site to examine new modes of gendered precarious labour and economic insecurity. At the same time, it also points to the new ecology of beauty media today: the actors and technologies that make it possible, the opportunities it presents, and the new aesthetics and production modes it affords.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on online hate speech is burgeoning, highlighting its significant negative consequences on individual and societal levels. Still, there is a lack of attention directed towards understanding the perceptions and experiences of individuals in the general population toward this phenomenon. Such insights could significantly help decision-makers and scholars in formulating initiatives to inform and educate the public, thereby preventing further harm. Therefore, quality insight into the understanding and perceptions of hate speech, as well as related experiences and behaviour is needed. In the absence of established survey instruments and given the fragmented and limited nature of the existing data, the primary objective of this scoping review is to systematically identify online hate speech survey measures, as well as the topics and populations the associated research addressed. Preliminary findings reveal a disproportionate focus on students and young adults and the predominant use of non-representative sampling methods, leaving older population groups under-researched and raising concerns about results’ generalizability. Broad research scopes are predominant; in order to better understand real-world experiences, scholars should aim for more detailed research scopes, including studying OHS in specific online contexts and within specific groups. In terms of topics, existing survey measures mostly cover the topics of direct exposure/perpetration of OHS, neglecting the whole hate speech ecosystem; what comes before and after the dissemination of hate speech online. In terms of question types, ordinal scales are most common, but the lack of standardized scales results in fragmented findings that are difficult to compare.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Like other media industries (e.g. music, film, TV), the podcasting industry has spent the last year coming to grips with the impact that generative artificial intelligence tools will have on the future of podcast production and consumption. Several high-profile examples of AI-generated podcasts have raised questions about the ethics, legality, and creativity of AI for creating podcast scripts, voices, and sound design. These in turn raise larger concerns about ownership and the economics of the platforms that distribute podcasts (like Spotify). In this paper, I survey the state of artificial intelligence in the podcasting industry to address the following two questions: How is AI being used by podcasters and other actors in the podcasting industry? How is the use of AI in podcasting framed in articles and writing about the industry? By sampling a number of podcasts that employ AI during the production and consumption process (e.g. AI scriptwriting, AI voiced hosts, AI sound design, etc.), my paper explores how podcasters and others in the podcasting industry are using AI as part of their everyday work. I develop a typology for the different ways AI is currently being used in podcasting in order to explore the anxieties around the use of artificial intelligence in the cultural industries as well as the everyday, and more mundane, impact AI is having on workflows, production capabilities and notions of creativity in the creative industries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The popular short-form video app TikTok is mainly discussed as a discrete app or in relation to its parent company ByteDance. This view neglects how TikTok and other ByteDance apps maintain and advance ByteDance’s highly complex app ecosystem. This paper, therefore, positions ByteDance-owned apps as both apps and “platform tools.” TikTok allows end-users to watch videos, allows creators to make and distribute content, advertisers to endorse products, and developers to build app features. As a platform tool, TikTok is a software-based resource that mediates “platformization,” extending TikTok’s economic, infrastructural, and governmental data-centric logic within and beyond ByteDance’s app ecosystem. Increasingly, ByteDance’s platform tools rely heavily on AI technology because of ByteDance’s early investments in AI technology and the growing interest such tools within the cultural industries. We survey ByteDance’s AI-powered platform tools alongside non-AI ones using systematic financial and infrastructural analysis, uncovering how ByteDance’s platform tools expand ByteDance as a “multi-sided,” “multi-layered,” and “multi-situated” platform. Platform tools, thus, facilitate growth along these three dimensions by encouraging platform dependence; interoperability and interdependence within ByteDance’s app ecosystem; and platformization, including “parallel platformization.” Our empirical work ultimately shows how ByteDance uses platform tools to accrue and operationalize infrastructural and economic power, and how apps have moved from discrete objects to interconnected clusters of platform tools.</jats:p>",

Rather than the current focus on utilitarian outcomes related to industry and efficiency, we suggest that automation in the home may have bearing on identity, spirituality and mental wellbeing.\n\nWe suggest that as connected technology and automation becomes more embedded in the context of the home, consideration must be given to how this impacts on meaningful practices that require embodied, tangible experience and action. These may be religious or spiritual in nature, such as use of the Lakshmi jhadu (grass broom) as part of a morning sweeping ritual in rural Indian households. Alternatively, they may also be related to cultural and interpersonal meaning such as creating a physical cassette mix-tape to give to a loved one.\n\nWe ask: how is value and meaning in embodied ritual practice impacted by intervention with digital technologies in the home? Can borrowing principles of traditional ritual practice support sustainable and meaningful smart interventions to home life?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The failure of the youth from low-privilege backgrounds in obtaining quality private education to become more employable in the competitive job market has coincided with the growth and affordability of the smartphone-Internet in India. Using ethnographic methods, both in-person and online, with 20 young men from low-privileged backgrounds in Kolkata (India), this ongoing research investigates how they access content of the digital industries, mostly on YouTube, to acquire skills for and information about income opportunities against a lack of access to quality institutions. It asks whether and how the outcomes of such Internet use are shaped by their specific life contexts which influence the scope of application of such information. $2 the affordable Internet resources, the young men exercise their agency to attempt to fill the deficiencies of formal institutions. This indicates an overcoming of the second digital divide, although not uniformly. In line with the third digital divide, these findings reveal greater obstacles in the efficacy of applying livelihood-related online resources in terms of the nature of livelihoods sought, availability of energy and time, social expectations, and the availability of avenues for finding lesser employment via offline ties. With examples, I aim to argue that the extent of divide (2nd or 3rd) is not uniform for individuals in a population group but varies with uses. This research contributes both to knowledge of digital experiences from the Global South and extends the theories of domestication of digital technology and digital divides to youth in low-privilege settings.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study delves into the digital identity formation of vendors and customers on darknet drug trade sites, focusing on Cebulka, the largest Polish-language cryptomarket. Recently, we have seen a rise in interest in studying online drug trade. Despite this growing attention, research on how individuals present themselves online and construct their identities in dark web environments remains relatively scarce. Through a dual-stage methodology combining conventional content analysis (CCA) of 8170 posts and in-depth interviews with users (n=10), this study explores how Cebulka’s users curate their online personas. The findings reveal that vendors employ sophisticated marketing strategies, emphasizing product quality to build brand identity. Consumers, in turn, contribute by sharing detailed feedback. All these practices foster a community of informed users who view themselves as superior to traditional street-level traders and clear web (social media) users. This self-perception extends to a belief in their enhanced knowledge and quasi-expertise concerning drugs, a distinction from conventional drug users, and a separation between their online and real-life identities. The study illustrates that these digital personas are collectively shaped, drawing on social identity theory and performance theories to understand the platform’s behavior and interactions. This research not only bridges a gap in understanding the complex dynamics of darknet drug trading but also offers insights into the broader subculture of drug users, suggesting distinct identifications and identities among those active on the dark web. It challenges traditional views of drug traders and has implications for harm reduction and policy development.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research examines the concept of \"disconnective action\" during crises, positing it as a necessary counterpart to \"connective action\" (Bennett &amp; Segerberg, 2012). While digital media is typically lauded for fostering connectivity during socio-political controversies, it also presents affordances for disconnectivity, such as unfriending, unfollowing, and banning. This project aims to understand the dynamics and implications of digital disconnection, particularly during crises that serve as catalysts for revealing divergent opinions among social network users (Sibona, 2014; John &amp; Dvir-Gvirsman, 2015; John &amp; Gal, 2018). The theoretical backdrop of this study involves \"disconnective power\" (Light &amp; Cassidy, 2014), which refers to the ability of dominant actors to employ digital media as tools for political, cultural, and social fragmentation. The research proposes that this form of power is particularly evident in the strategic use of digital technologies to isolate political systems and promote societal disintegration. Accordingly, the new forms of propaganda utilize disconnective affordances to undermine cross-conflict horizontal networks. By framing disconnection as a performative \"speech act\" (Austin,1962; Butler, 1990) and examining the role of social media as both a unifying and divisive force, this study contributes to a nuanced understanding of digital interaction in times of socio-political unrest. Over five years, data on public unfriending announcements were collected, particularly from Russian-speaking Facebook users during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The research reveals the dominant logics behind publicized disconnective actions and the influence of individual users in initiating broader disconnective trends.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are today implemented across various societal sectors, ranging from health care and security to taking part in shaping the media environment we encounter online. In the last decade there has been a significant shift in the field of AI, as the development of AI applications is no longer confined to the laboratory, but rather widely used and tested in and on societies. With this rapid industrialisation of AI, there is an increased need to understand the implications of both the development and deployment of these systems. While critical scholars have started to scrutinize different components of AI development, the study of evaluative practices in AI has received limited attention. A few studies have highlighted the importance of benchmarking practices and how these methods become integral in establishing the validity of the system and its success, which then enables widespread application. This paper presents a research agenda that outlines how to study machine-learning evaluation practices that move beyond the laboratory into industry applications and standardised validation practices. Based on emerging research and illustrative empirical examples from recent fieldwork, we argue to study machine-learning evaluation as a sociotechnical and political phenomenon that requires multi-level scrutiny. Therefore, we provide three analytical entry points for future research that address the political dynamics of (1) standardised validation infrastructures, (2) the circulation of evaluation methods and (3) the situated enactment of evaluation in practice.</jats:p>",

Along with content creation, they interrogate agricultural products, infrastructure networks and their own body to create an authentic rural China. Their invisible labor on logistical level to ensure the data flow contributes to a richer typology on platform labor and global perspective on platformization studies.\n\nBased on one-year field work, I investigate how these e-commerce streamers handle logistical challenges from three aspects. Firstly, they select and define the authentic rural products considering the visibility requirements on platform. Secondly, they put extract work to maintain power networks to ensure streaming, like prepare portable electrical generators. Thirdly, they discipline their own body and develop labor degradation to simply the intense streaming activities. Borrow concepts from logistical media studies, this research theorize their labor as logistical struggle.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of these e-commerce streamers in marginalized rural China informs the diverse process to perform authenticity in platform economy era and the multiple layers of platform labor across global scales. It also shows how authenticity based on structural inequality, urban-rural divide policy, is commodified and enhances the social status of marginalized social group by enforcing them more invisible labor.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nostalgia is a culturally resonant, politically potent, and increasingly networked sensemaking resource that frames how people see the past and understand their place in the world. Despite nostalgia's locative meaning, there is a lack of research applying network analytic methods to study its structure and social-semiotic function in online networks which enable connective action based on discursive, affective, and mimetic bonds. While research indicates nostalgia’s dual-edge social function in group dynamics of solidarity and exclusion, these studies often take collective identity a priori, limiting understanding of how platform affordances structure the formation of affective publics around nostalgic discourse and sentiment. Through a semantic network analysis of the popular hashtag #nostalgia (&gt;140B views) on TikTok, this study offers a first step toward understanding the meaning of nostalgia in networked processes of group identification by mapping a topology of “nostalgic neighborhoods” emerging from the co-linkages of hashtags on the platform. Based on the equivalence of these neighborhoods’ semantic structures and thematic meanings, I identify three types of affective publics – play-grounds, heart-lands, and reflecting pools – that emerged in relation to different linguistic and technical functions of the hashtag. I argue the different affective intensities and meanings of nostalgia within these publics reflected the platform’s dynamics of imitation and virality. As TikTok’s algorithmic affordances of visibility and association are less rooted in interpersonal social ties, this study contributes important insights into how the hashtag, as a semiotic technology (Zappavigna, 2018), structures nostalgic affective publics on popular site for nostalgia within youth cultures.</jats:p>",

    "title": "A GAME OF PRIVACY TUG OF WAR: A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF PRIVACY SETTINGS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Privacy settings are a critical mechanism for platforms to manage, control, and impact user privacy online. The policies of social media platforms and their technical design—including the choice architecture of privacy settings—\"serve as a form of privatized governance directly enacting rights and regulating the flow of information online (DeNardis &amp; Hackl, 2015). Many platforms use a rhetoric of “choice and control,” relying on privacy settings to shoulder the burden of responsibility for user privacy (Horne, 2021). Another challenge to privacy on social media platforms is that there is a wide disparity of settings choices across different platforms, with varying defaults (Horne, 2023). Additionally, the interconnection and the technical importance of privacy settings has a clear and well-established history. This paper examines this history via a historical analysis of Meta’s changes to privacy settings. The analysis focuses on Meta as it is one of the oldest and largest of social media platforms; it also hosts a comprehensive archive of news articles, which tracks critical updates to Meta products. The study seeks to determine what privacy settings changes Meta has made, when the changes were announced, as well as analyze how these changes were framed in news articles.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents findings from an ongoing project focused on sober curious communities on TikTok. In this paper I argue that these communities offer a haven from in ‘intoxigenic’ digital spaces for individuals navigating the complexities of sobriety.\n\nThis research examines the implications of TikTok's emergence as a locus of sociality for the sober curious movement, both in terms of individual well-being and broader societal attitudes towards addiction and recovery. Central to this is an exploration of the creative and expressive practices employed by individuals within sober curious communities and the attitudes and experiences of those who follow them.\n\nThe paper draws on qualitative data from interviews with 28 sober curious TikTok users and a systematic content analysis of 800 TikTok videos.\n\nEmergent findings reveal insights into the role of TikTok in destigmatizing addiction, fostering empathy and promoting positive representations of abstinence and resilience.\n\nThree key themes with be explored: the value of digital storytelling, the nature of TikTok accountability, and the visibility of failures or relapses. These themes underscore TikTok's significance as a platform for personal expression, accountability, and community-building within the sober curious movement.\n\nCombined, these themes speak to TikTok as an important platform for the sober curious. TikTok allows the messy, unpredictable, embodied and digital practices and experiences of sobriety to play out. Reframing sobriety beyond medicalised narratives of addiction to provide a more nuanced and freeing set of practices and contexts that enable respondents to rethink and re-evaluate their relationship with alcohol.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital traces generated by internet users are automatically collected, stored, and analyzed by public and private actors. This dataveillance becomes salient to users through repeated exposure over time to triggers of a sense of dataveillance. This can lead to a range of consequences including democratically concerning responses such as the self-inhibition of legitimate digital communication behavior, known as the chilling effects of dataveillance. Such chilling effects are expected to subtly accumulate over time. Hence, longitudinal in-situ studies are required to capture the temporal dynamics of individuals’ perception of dataveillance and the resulting behavioral changes. Relying on a longitudinal online field experiment with a representative sample of Swiss internet users, this study investigates how chilling effects accumulate over time and aims to capture the temporal dynamics of chilling effects. Preliminary results reveal that the experimental treatment successfully heightened participants' sense of dataveillance over time. Time significantly predicted this increase, aligning with the notion of accumulating chilling effects. Furthermore, the comfort levels of the digital communication behaviors, including information searching, opinion voicing, and information disclosing, were over time lower for the experimental treatment than control condition, supporting the chilling-effects hypothesis. Accumulating chilling effects were found for information disclosing as the experimental treatment and time predicted a decrease in participants’ comfortability level. This article provides an innovative contribution to the growing research on the chilling effects of dataveillance and adds to the empirical understanding of the nature of chilling effects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted the development of comprehensive AI developmental and governance frameworks globally. Yet, existing literature on AI innovation in non-Western societies often overlooks economically advanced but geographically non-dominant societies, instead focusing on large nation-states like China or developing regions in Global South such as South Africa. This paper examines the variegated sociotechnical imaginaries of AI in three Asian developmental societies - Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan - addressing two research questions: what are the desired forms of AI development and governance in small-size advanced economies? How does this desired form vary according to the historical, institutional, and geopolitical contexts of these societies?\n\nThrough discourse analysis of policy documents from the early 2010s to 2024, the paper identifies three imaginaries of techno-developmentalism: Singapore’s cybernetic pragmaticism to legitimize its neoliberal authoritarian rule, Hong Kong’s techno-entrepreneurship in refashioning financial capitalism, and Taiwan’s defensive survival modality against internal socio-economic instability and external threats posed by the rivalry of superpowers. Decision-makers in these societies must establish AI developmental frameworks capable of resource allocation, actor coordination, strategic coupling with the global tech economy, and managing uncertainties in specific AI-centric socio-economic reform.\n\nBy offering comparative case studies of these Asian societies, this paper contributes to understanding the heterogeneous narratives and practices of AI innovation, moving beyond simplistic narratives trapped in the Global North and South binary.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is long-standing research on women’s use of media for romantic/erotic fantasy, including novelettes (Radway, 1984), porn (Juffer, 1998) and erotica apps Bellas &amp; McAllister, 2023). This presentation explores the similarities and differences between earlier forms of media romancing and the use of an AI companion. Emerging research on AI chatbots uses frameworks that assign novelty to human-machine communications. In this study, we focus on the user experience – we conducted qualitative, in-depth interviews with twenty mostly midlife female users of the Replika chatbot, whom we recruited online. Thematic analysis identified that the women used the bot, first, for fantasies of a companion they were lacking in real life, such as an attentive lover, friend or child, in the context of feeling alone (due to e.g. living alone, caring for family, inattentive husband or having a chronic condition). Second, the bot was reflexively used for caring for or managing the self, such as validating one’s worth and emotions to neutralize negative thinking, following the therapeutic ethos (Illouz, 2008, Gravel-Patry, 2023). The fantasies of an attentive partner were similar to previous work on romancing, although the women’s life situations were more diverse than often investigated. The use of the bot for regulating emotions, however, was new and signifies the spirit of our time emphasizing self-management and positive thinking. The study contextualizes human-machine communication by discussing the individual experiences of female Replika users to understand better both change and continuity in our communication with media, from romance novels to AI chatbots.</jats:p>",

To do this, I analyze all references to and use of content from the Virtual Humans website in relevant published research from 2019 to 2024 (n=189), including the website’s database of existing virtual influencers, interviews with virtual influencer creators and virtual influencer characters themselves, articles on the state of the virtual influencer industry, and profiles of each listed virtual influencer. I pair this analysis with a brief history of VirtualHumans.org from a political economy perspective, noting the factors which went into the website’s creation; its acquisition by Offbeat Media Group, a digital marketing agency; and its organizational shifts following the sudden departure of its founder in 2023. Ultimately, I question whether academic viewpoints of the emergent virtual influencer industry, many which refer to the Virtual Humans website as a valuable resource for grasping a sense of the size and scope of the virtual influencer phenomenon, adequately consider the rooted biases and commercial interests represented by the website as not only a database but a powerful broker within the industry. Moreover, by narrating the organizational development of VirtualHumans.org as an enterprise, I contribute detailed context into the formation of these biases and commercial interests which inform its position in the virtual influencer scene.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Critical digital literacy comprises subsets of medium- and content-related skills necessary for digital privacy and digital citizenship. Frameworks for defining and evaluating digital literacy proliferate in academia and policymaking; however, in a networked climate subsumed by dataveillance, algorithmic bias, political bots, and deep fakes, these frameworks need to be updated. Algorithms may be the greatest determinant in sociopolitical online interactions and information gathering, and without a multivalent literacy of algorithms, nuanced understandings of digital privacy and digital citizenship may be unachievable. We therefore propose ‘algorithmic literacy’ become an essential element for digital literacy in young adult media education. Researchers have highlighted how intersectional aspects of gender, ability, and socioeconomic status are stronger predictors of low digital literacy than age. Following a tradition of participatory (rather than protectionist) research about youth privacy online, our research foregrounds young adults’ practices and perspectives on algorithmic culture in order to co-develop a framework for algorithmic literacy. Our paper shares findings from a participatory project co-designing an algorithmic literacy toolkit with young adults as co-researchers and participants. We created a curriculum focusing on reviewing the current critical scholarly literature, policy, and popular discourse on algorithms. After two weeks of intensive research, our student co-researchers met amongst themselves to devise a sustainable, ‘living-document’ type of toolkit, comprising a website, an Instagram page, and a Medium blog. Reflected in the toolkit's name, The Algorithmic You uses an intersectional lens to facilitate peer-oriented ‘self-discovery’ of how algorithms shape and produce interactions in the everyday lives of young adults.</jats:p>",

Along with this growth as a form of leisure, video game companies have recognized the importance of the communities and cultures that consumers build around their products. Fans establish identities linked to their gaming habits, whether they are playing games themselves or viewing games played by professionals. Fans also participate in communities, often facilitated through online forums. As part of this, fans discuss, express, and assess their relationship with the companies in charge of their hobbies. How do fans establish and negotiate trust with these companies and why might consumer trust to lapse? This project analyzes approximately 2,500 online forum posts from video game players and esports viewers to understand their perspectives on the companies involved in these spaces. Ultimately, the landscape appears to be developing increasing negativity where fans feel exploited and progressively concerned about company decisions. Fans have called into question the quality of video games and esports streams, motivations for specific decisions behind the scenes, and whether or not their actions as fans reward companies who are using them to meet a specific financial goal. A sense of common knowledge is developed that certain companies will make decisions at the perceived expense of the audience to increase profit. Although these sentiments are not present for all forum users, these discussions reveal increasing negative associations toward specific companies, games, and franchises.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing networked connectivity and affordability of technology facilitated the rise of digitally-mediated service work. Workers, mostly located in the Global South, can now directly obtain ‘gigs’ through online labor platforms and microwork intermediaries such as Upwork and Onlinejobs.ph. Within the Philippine digital labor economy, we see an emerging category of digital labor intermediaries—locally called peer mentors and coaches-- who are playing a significant role in the expansion and continued uptake of digital platform labor in the country. Building on and drawing connections between earlier works on the influencer economy (Abidin, 2015; Senft, 2013; and Marwick, 2013) and on labor migration brokerage literature (Shreshta &amp; Yeoh, 2018; Lin, Lindquist, Xiang, &amp; Yeoh, 2017), the paper conceptualizes digital labor brokerage arising within various ‘spaces of (labor) intermediation.’ Drawing from participant observation in online freelancing Facebook groups and interviews with these brokers and digital workers, we examine the transactional nature underlying the ‘producer-audience’ relationship of digital labor brokerage, the activation of trust and influence through mediated encounters, and the power dynamic underlying the digitally mediated symbolic and material power taking place between them and their respective teams. The paper seeks to contribute to the digital labor literature in two ways: 1) by characterizing the emergence of digital labor brokers in a digital labor supplying country in the global South, the role they play in the digital platform labor economy and the interventions that they engage; and 2) analyzing the structural conditions that facilitate the emergence of digital labor brokerage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Digital Future Coalition (1996-2002), was an unprecedented public interest coalition on Internet and copyright policy, with much farther-ranging effects than has been recognized previously. Uniting commercial and noncommercial stakeholders to push back against IP maximalism on the nascent Internet, it altered both treaty and legislative language, blocked U.S. copyright protection for databases, enhanced popular engagement with fair use and set the stage for the “Right to Repair” movement. This historical research was accomplished primarily by interviewing representatives of the DFC and opposing groups, as well as one ex-government official, and by consulting a hitherto untapped, private archive of documents relevant to the history of the DFC. We consider our topic within contexts in three areas: the history of the formation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA;) public interest coalition characteristics in communication; and the political roles of coalitions. In this article, we accept the assessment of the DMCA as legislation that both foreclosed options for the Internet’s development and created an enduring regime to protect copyright monopolies on the Internet. However, we argue that a closer look at the DFC’s actions, goals and long-range effects can reposition that coalition productively in the history. Such repositioning helps to understand how different the DMCA today is from the originally-proposed policy and the implications of those differences. Finally a detailed accounting of the DFC’s dynamics and tactics may prove instructive in assessing the efficacy of contemporary information activist groups.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Certain varieties of feminism have become more popular, and so have anti-feminist reactions to it with both sides competing for visibility. However, the (gendered) interplay between feminist and anti-feminist counterpublics is still uncharted. At the same time, research in the field of feminist media studies is beginning to address questions of power inequalities $2 feminist publics on social media platforms. This study sheds light on the networked structure of the German-language #MeToo protest on Twitter in order to reveal who succeeded in becoming visible and influential in this digital protest and in order to show differences in networking practices among those involved. Analyzing the Twitter interaction network around #MeToo over a period of three month, we find that – as expected – this network consists of some highly connected hubs and a majority of nodes with only few connections. The most central nodes, only 1.1 percent of the Twitter users involved, account for 35 percent of interactions within the network. Applying qualitative and quantitative content analyses, this study shows that Twitter accounts of traditional news media play a central role in the #MeToo network from the very beginning, indicating that protest networks are less equal and horizontal than often assumed. At the same time, k-core decomposition reveals that most Twitter users in the network’s core published mostly racist and anti-feminist content, indicating that few but very loud and well-connected voices used the #MeToo protest to strategically mobilize against migration in Germany and Austria.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>AGEING WITH SMARTPHONES ‘FROM BELOW’: INSIGHTS FROM JAPAN, UGANDA, AL-QUDS AND IRELAND This session examines new ways to theorize the smartphone, based on a comparative study of smartphone use amongst older people in four different fieldsites for a period of 16 months ethnographic fieldwork. Along with gender, age is one of the primary parameters by which societies throughout history have structured and governed themselves (Spencer, 1990). Since the 1960s, however, we have lived with an unprecedented modern consciousness that has presented an increasingly powerful challenge to this hegemonic principle by placing a high value on youth culture (Hodkinson, 1999). As a result, there is a new uncertainty about the meaning of age (Degnen, 2007). In addition, age has also extended class discrepancies, as those around the world between the ages of 45–70 have become a class that has settled its children and can now capitalize upon the new choices of consumer culture (Blaikie, 1999). Yet, these ageing populations increasingly face problems of loneliness linked to a loss of authority of seniority (Hazan, 1994), though this may be alleviated by contact through digital devices and networked platforms, mainly smartphones. Focusing on populations in their sixties, seventies and eighties is one of the panel’s major contributions, as mostly up until now smartphones have been associated with the idea of a youth technology and many of their attributes associated with that age group (Jenkins et al., 2016). Hence, we wish to release the smartphone from its earlier connections, allowing us to theorise it more broadly as part of the life of ‘non-digital natives’. The four papers in the panel show how understanding smartphones is more than simply addressing the culture of ‘apps’ or the ‘culture of connectivity’. Rather, the smartphone presents an ecology of digitization tailored to the specific configurations of the individual user which is best understood through the ethnographic method of holistic contextualization. This approach links smartphone usage with all aspects of offline life and creates a role for digital anthropologists who are well placed to tackle fundamental questions about smartphones because they can gain access to this intimate and mainly private configuration and processes of personalization within their social and cultural contexts. Using Pype’s (2019) concept of `smart from below’ we provide illustrations showing how it is the users who actually create smartphones. To follow normative contemporary theory, this would require situating our findings in relation to established theoretical debates about new communications media. The nuance given by comparing four fieldsites with a vast variety of smartphone usage ties us to the initial context of difference and comparison, thus providing novel conceptualizations of the smartphone. These include concepts such as ‘screen ecology’, ‘the transportal home’, ‘beyond anthropomorphism’, ‘social ecology’, ‘perpetual opportunism’, ‘contradiction and ambivalence’, ‘the control hub’, ‘multifaceted connectivity’ and others. Each of these may help us to visualise, understand, and explain what people do with their smartphones and why. But where this subsumes Uganda, al-Quds, alongside Japan and Ireland there is a danger of creating neo-imperial homogenisations based on citing de-contextualised critiques. Our panel strives to describes an alternative path that could allow for theoretical development of the contemporary smartphone, while avoiding these betrayals of either substance or original insight. Three papers provide more extended examples of what we have achieved ‘the transportal home’ through fieldwork in Japan, ‘care transcending distance’ through fieldwork in Uganda, and we explore ‘contradiction, ambivalence and multifaceted connectivity’ though fieldwork in al-Quds. The fourth paper is more theoretical, aiming to link between the presented ethnographies and exemplify the grounding of theory of the smartphone. We hope that our panel will encourage global discussion of the role of the smartphones in the everyday lives of individuals from all age groups, not just the young. Such an expansion would allow for a deeper understanding of this device which, as we demonstrate, is so central to many people’s experience of social life, home, and care. References Blaikie, A.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We are only beginning to understand the ways in which young people are introducing technologies into the family system and the ways that is impacting family relationships. What seems clear is that the face-to-face relationship does not translate directly to the online context, and online communication is not completely replacing in-person family relationships. Despite the lack of existing research, it is reasonable to expect that family relationships impact how youth and parents use online media. Building on socialization theory, in the current study we considered the ways in which youth technology use impacts parent technology use in parent-child dyads from India and the U.S. (98 dyads; youth: 37% female; mean age=17.3; parents: 54.6% female; mean age=41.5). When considering frequency of six types of technology use in a series of linear regression analyses: 1) general use to look for information, news, and use online tools, 2) audio or video calls, 3) texting, instant messaging, discussion boards, or email, 4) sending or receiving audio or video, and photos, 5) create or maintain blogs, microblogs, or websites, and 6) social networking sites, child technology use accounted for 8.4% to 27.0% of the variance in parent use. Despite the small sample size, it is clear that child technology use is strongly associated with parent use, even when considering diverse ways of using technology. Future research should use longitudinal data to explore how children impact parents’ technology use over time – how that influence changes with age, sociohistorical time and place, and life transitions.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE VISCERAL EMBODIMENT OF DIGITAL PLEASURES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel explores digital pleasures that arise through the entanglement of bodies and digital technologies. Focusing on the digital structures and affordances that facilitate seeking, receiving and giving pleasure we analyse the ways in which intimacy is not only interactive, but also profoundly embodied. Haraway’s work in particular highlights the importance of taking seriously the nexus of human bodies and technologies and attending to the ways in which technologies not only deliver and mediate pleasure, but potentially expand upon our capacity to experience it. This panel explores how mediated practices engage the body as a site of pleasure and embodied affective intensity. Within this frame, we suggest that digitally mediated pleasures, while widely consumed, still have a hint of the ‘fringe’ or ‘subversive’. As well as proposing a theoretical framework for understanding embodied digital pleasures, this panel also examines specific examples of digital pleasure from sex to drugs and sound. To date the research corpus has largely focused upon the micro-social interactions of digital intimacies. This emphasis on relational intimacy puts the body into the background of the digitally mediated encounter and limits the ways in which we can talk about embodiment, sex and pleasure online. Embodied pleasure is intrinsic to the human condition, and digital media is deeply embedded in contemporary life. How these intersect is a key piece of the puzzle of what it means to be human in contemporary society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been a recurring narrative in research that revolves around mobile technologies and society, particularly in relation to Africa: that these technologies have the potential to reconfigure and revolutionise the development trajectories of entire countries (Donner &amp; Locke, 2019). But if these narratives are to be the case, then, indeed, the role that mobile devices can play in production (in this case of art, media, and design) is going to have to be something that allows people in the global South to earn a living. This paper presents an exploration of the creative practices, with a focus on mobile creative practices, of a cohort of Extended Curriculum Program (ECP) Visual Design students from a university in Cape Town, South Africa (2014). All of these students came from low-income, resource constrained contexts in the townships that surround Cape Town. In questioning whether mobile technologies can help young South African creatives forge careers or attain resources that could help them do so, the role of mobile technologies is complicated. While these devices offer new emerging creative affordances, and in some cases, can offer means to generate income, the material reality is a different story. I conclude by arguing that instead of these devices offering access to a global network, they, at best, provide the means for young creatives, such as those featured in this study, to a forge a media patchwork.</jats:p>",

    "title": "STUDYING YOUTH ONLINE POLITICAL EXPRESSION: EMPIRICAL FINDINGS AND        METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>We are living through a highly politicized time, with deep divisions foregrounding the significance and importance of political expression and dialogue. Youth have been at the forefront of these important conversations, in both academic research and in the popular press. On the one hand, we are seeing a resurgence of activism and engagement among youth (Bond, Chenoweth &amp; Pressman 2018; Deal 2019), who are using online platforms to express themselves politically in rich and creative ways (Graef 2016; Jenkins et al., 2016). On the other hand, deep concerns have emerged about “some of the darker sides of networked media engagement” (boyd, 2017, n.p.), including the spread of misinformation, increased polarization and politically motivated bullying among youth (Rogers, 2017). If we see youth as active agents in their own political socialization (Youniss, McLellan &amp; Yates, 1997), the ways they actively express and negotiate their civic identities online (Jenkins et al., 2016) offer rich possibilities for understanding how we can best support them as civic actors. The research presented in this panel aims to move beyond a simplified depiction of youth as either idealized political role models (e.g. Greta Thunberg or the Parkland Youth) or, conversely, as apathetic and politically disengaged. In light of the conference theme exploring what it means to have a Life mediated by the internet, we place emergent and senior scholars studying youth and online political expression in dialogue with one another to discuss both findings and particular considerations brought up by internet research (franzke et al., 2020), and especially internet research involving youth (Livingstone &amp; Third, 2017). By encouraging researchers and audience members to reflect on the epistemological, ethical, and practical aspects of their own research, we aim to identify new questions for further study as we seek to understand the evolution of youth and online political expression. The first presentation reviews findings from a cross-platform study utilizing a mixed methods approach to explore youth online political expression and cross-cutting political talk on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. These presenters discuss their findings in relation to the challenges and opportunities they encountered when identifying and analyzing youth-generated cross-platform data. The second presentation highlights findings from a social discourse analysis of Twitter and Reddit threads on youth-centric issues of immigration (DACA) and environmental issues (plastic pollution) to identify how the intersection of issue, platform and aims of discourse shape the characteristics of online civic discourse. This presenter discusses the challenges she encountered when creating both a codebook and coding scheme for data analysis. The third presentation considers the role of gender and intersectional identity in online humorous political expression through a case study of a U.S. Black Muslim teen’s TikTok posts. This presenter discusses the challenges of placing critical technocultural discourse analysis into dialogue with digital media literacy and youth participatory action research endeavors. The fourth presentation highlights findings emerging from a series of ethnographic interviews with young people in a comparative study exploring online youth political expression in democratic and non-democratic contexts. This presenter discusses challenges of qualitative research when working with young people, especially marginalized youth, who utilize hidden forms of expression to engage in politics. Finally, our respondent will invite audience members into the discussion by offering a reflection on the four presentations and asking session attendees to comment on their own research experiences and larger implications they see for the study of youth political expression online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this work is to understand the role of digital storytelling as a conversation asset regarding social and health emergencies, specifically fictional parody characters in social media, as chroniclers of ongoing crises. We will focus on a strikingly popular phenomenon: the Twitter account @coronavid19, where the virus, presented as a fictional character, offers a humorous chronicle in almost real time through social media, from the early breaking news related to the presence of the virus in the country to the unfolding of an unprecedented social and health crisis. The account got more than 450,000 followers in its first week of existence, coinciding with the first confirmed Covid19 cases in mainland Spain (February 2020) and was widely covered by mainstream media. It currently has more than 860.000 followers, which is way higher than official health and governmental Twitter accounts. This paradigmatic case study has been chosen considering its impact from the early stages of the pandemic, but also its peculiarities as a fictional character and a privileged chronicler in the first person. Our case analysis is aimed to understand how fictional parody characters are built in discursive and extra-discursive terms, how they interact with followers and how narrative and character traits evolve along the crisis. We also want to observe whether they add nuances to social discussion, reframe news content (emphasizing or downplaying events) and serve as a tool to cope with hard times, fostering collective empowerment, mutual empathy, while stressing official recommendations using irony and mocking irrational behaviour.</jats:p>",

Such measures could be divided into four categories: Regulating platforms, criminalization of offenders, governmental monitoring, and relying on civil society. The existing literature so far has focused more on examining the pros and cons of individual policy directions rather than providing an overview of the entire dynamics when multiples measures are combined in practice. It is due to most countries still being at their infancy discussing and inventing a disinformation regulation suitable for their legal freedom of speech protection structure. South Korea is unique in that it has operated a system dealing with disinformation for over a decade now, and in that it has a system specifically dedicated to election protection combining three of the four measures introduced above. Through scrutinizing both the legal framework and execution practices of the multiple disinformation countermeasures in South Korea, this research expands the existing literature by offering insights on how combining measures could result in unforeseen discounts of freedom of speech.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DATA SELVES: TRUST, CONTROL AND SELF-REPRESENTATION IN DIGITAL SOCIETY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>A considerable amount of personal data is now collected on and by individuals: footsteps on Fitbits, screen time in Apple’s iOS, conversations on dating apps, sleeping patterns in baby tracker apps, and viewing habits on Netflix and YouTube. What value do these data have, for individuals but also for corporations, governments, and researchers? When these data are provided back to users, how do people make sense of it? What ‘truth claims’ do quantified personal data make? How do we navigate anxieties around datafied selves, and in what ways are bodies rendered visible or invisible through processes of datafication in digital society?&#x0D;\nIn this panel we explore these questions through four papers centered on the notion of the “data-selfie.” Data-selfies take different forms, including but not limited to:- Visuals that reference the “status” or “progress” of a user’s physical body, as in 3-D scans, or charts generated by self-monitoring apps for health and fitness.- Visuals that reference the remapping of photographic self-expression to biometric, corporate and state surveillance, such as airport facial recognition check points that ask flyers to pose for a selfie, or sex offender databases that now contain images first posted to hook up apps by consenting teenagers.- Representations of the embodied or commoditized self, produced not as stand-alone expression, but as conversational prompts that encourage qualitative, “story-driven” data, in the interests of pedagogy, therapy, activism, etc.- Profiles that reference users as “targets” whose chief value is the metadata they generate. Using proprietary algorithms, platforms mine this metadata—which can include information about a users’ device, physical location, and their activities online—categorizing it for internal use, and selling it to third parties interested in influencing the consumer, social and/or political preferences of the “targets” in question.&#x0D;\nIn Paper 1, Authors 1, 2, and 3 develop a new conceptualisation for understanding how individuals reveal themselves through their own quantified personal data. They call this the ‘confessional data selfie’. Drawing on a sample of 59 examples from the top posts in subreddit r/DataIsBeautiful, they argue that the confessional data selfie represents an aspect of one’s self, through visualisations of personal data, inviting analysis, eliciting responses and personal story-telling, and opening one’s life up to others.&#x0D;\nIn Paper 2, Authors 4, 5, and 6 take a political economy of communication approach to analyse the data markets of dating apps. They consider three cases: Grindr, Match Group (parent company of Tinder), and Bumble. Drawing on trade press reportage, financial reports, and other materials associated with the apps and publishers in question, they point to the increased global concentration in ownership of dating app services and raise questions about the ways in which dating apps are now in the ‘data business’, using personal data to profile users and monetise private interactions.&#x0D;\nIn Paper 3, Author 7 reports on experiences of ‘data anxiety’ among older people in Australia. Author 7 draws on data literacy workshops, home-based interviews and focus groups with older internet users, that led to discussions of control over personal data, control over social interactions, and the resulting implications for exposure, openness, and visibility. Also key to this study was the taking and sharing of selfies in a closed Facebook group, serving as the starting point for reflections on these various experiences of control. Many of these older participants questioned whether or not ongoing participation in social media and broader data structures were ‘worthwhile’. This raises broader questions about the extent to which users are willing to sacrifice control over personal data - or the feeling of control - in order to participate and be visible.&#x0D;\nFinally, in Paper 4, Author 8 asks: when is the face data? Moving from examples of ‘deepfake’ video exhibitions to Google Art as a repository of ‘face-data’ as cultural and social capital, Author 8 goes on to examine how notions of face-as-data apply to individuals living with the neurological condition of autism. Can facial recognition apps help people with autism to read and decode human expressions?&#x0D;\nTaken together, these four papers each engage with questions about the relationship between personal data and broader structures of power and representation: from corporations like Grindr and Tinder using dating app data to profile users, to Google using uploaded selfies to train facial recognition algorithms; through to re-purposing and narrativising personal data as part of practices of self-representation; and the feelings of anxiety, unease or creepiness that accompany the increased datafication of personal identity. Self-representation is also a key recurrent thread in these papers, from confessional data selfies as acts of revelation through personal quantified data, through to the photographic selfie as a research exercise that prompts discussions of control and data privacy.</jats:p>",

    "title": "‘MARKING THEIR OWN HOMEWORK’: TRUST AND AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how the Australian advertising industry debates trust in the infrastructures of digital advertising. The advertising industry is undergoing a major change as digital advertising is increasingly dominated by new advertising technology (adtech) players and major tech companies such as Facebook and Google. These new companies which rely on automated systems of ad targeting, pricing and placement to control large amounts of digital advertising inventory and offer new more ‘efficient’ ways to micro-target advertising.&#x0D;\nYet these companies have garnered reputations for misrepresenting their numbers; a problem compounded by Google and Facebook’s reticence to provide independent audience verification. This has led to a high degree of mistrust from Australian advertisers. Neither Google or Facebook offers serious third-party auditing, leading many in the advertising industry to say that they are ‘marking their own homework’.&#x0D;\nIn this paper I ask, how is trust of measurement and verification infrastructures debated within the digital advertising industry? Is it fair to compare businesses that distribute advertising in very different ways? I answer these questions through qualitative analysis of submissions made to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as part of its current Digital Platforms Inquiry (DPI) in 2018 and 2019. I also draw on summaries of four public forums the ACCC held in 2018 as well as wide reading in the advertising industry trade press. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the role standards and measures play within industry and how they relate to trust during industry transformation.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet Studies scholarship tends to focus on new and hegemonic digital media, overlooking persistent uses of “older”, non-proprietary protocols and applications by some social groups who are key to configuring the nexus between technology and society. In response, we examine the contemporary political significance of using “old” social media through the empirical case of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) use. We advance a critique of platforms (closed, centralised, hegemonic social media) that we contrast with co-constructed devices that deeply involve users in their technological design and social construction. As a contemporary but long used online chat protocol, IRC serves as an important source for the critique of the currently hegemonic — but increasingly distrusted — infrastructures of computer-mediated communication. Drawing on Boltanski and Chiapello’s theory of critique and recuperation, we contrast the uses and underlying social norms of IRC with those of currently mainstream social media platforms. We claim that certain technical limitations that actors of IRC development did not feel necessary to address have kept it from incorporation into regimes of capital accumulation and social control, but also hindered its mass adoption. Ultimately, IRC continues to serve social groups key to the collaborative production of software, hardware and politics. While the general history of digital innovations illustrates the logic of critique and recuperation, our case study highlights the possibilities and pitfalls of resistance to it.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we describe a research methodology we have developed, based upon digital ethnography approaches, and which used mobile devices, digital ethnographic software and creative data collection activities. Our approach, refined over the course of a number of interconnected research projects, addressed these difficulties through a staged process – utilising traditional ethnographic techniques, but augmenting them with something more novel: the “domestic probe”. In essence, the domestic probe comprised a box of equipment given to the household to use in order to record and interpret their use of domestic technologies. In more recent work, we extended our participatory approach through the use of digital media, such as by using iPad minis pre-loaded with a data collection software tool, Ethnocorder. As we argue in this paper, these approaches carry three specific trust-related methodological benefits (and challenges): the foster trust in us as researchers; trust in our participants as co-researchers; and, as a result of this mutual researcher-participant trust, insight and a productive point of entry into discussing participant \"domestication\" of, and trust in, various household technologies.</jats:p>",

    "title": "FROM KNOWLEDGE CATHEDRALS TO NETWORKED CO-CREATION: PUBLIC LIBRARIES, TRUST AND THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the mid-nineteenth century, public libraries have been trusted sites of information. They have retained this public trust even as the networked society and digital technologies have profoundly changed the status and function of information in social and economic life. Information super-abundance, ‘platform capitalism’ and the rise of ‘big data’ have made information a currency within increasingly intersecting processes of commercial exchange, governance, surveillance and self-expression. Libraries are not on the sidelines of this shift. As media centres and information managers, they have supported users to navigate how information is distributed and accessed. They are also actively shaping how information is put-to-use, reconfiguring their service delivery around user-centred models emphasising participation and co-creation, user experience, pleasure, innovation, and peer-to-peer learning. This paper explores the tensions at the heart of the library’s continued status as a site of trusted information. Using a theoretically contextualized ethnographic methodology, the paper discusses how libraries perform as infrastructures of trust in the knowledge economy. Part one contextualises the library’s altered relation to information within its physical transformation as an institution. Part two draws upon interviews with Australian library professionals to drill down into the range of ways libraries perform informational trust at a time of systemic mistrust. Our findings reveal that many of these institutional performances of trust are non-equivalent, suggesting that we need to develop new thinking around the trust infrastructures we need in an information-abundant, entrepreneurialist culture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A videogame engine is a software tool that enables interactive digital content to be built, and a code framework that enables that content to run on different platforms, including consoles, smartphones, and virtual reality devices. Today, game engines form the backbone of videogame development and, increasingly, software development more broadly. The Unity engine — a key player in this industry, and the main case study of this paper — aims to ‘democratise game development’ through an accessible editing interface, a flexible licensing structure, and a toolset that is interoperable with a range of different design tools, middleware software, programming languages, and production workflows. This paper evaluates the core claim made by and about Unity — that it is has democratised game development — through a framework that analyses the engine’s ‘articulations’ in multiple areas of software culture: design, workflow, education, identity, political economy, and governance. These contexts form a 'circuit of cultural software' wherein the discourse of democratisation functions as a governing logic. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 24 Australian developers, students, and educators, as well as participant observation and ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that people feel empowered by Unity not only because of the tools it provides, but also because of its capacity to create what Angela McRobbie (2016) calls a ‘creativity dispositif’ — an affective space where developers are granted a degree of social security to explore possibilities for self-entrepreneurship in what would otherwise be a career path fraught with risk and uncertainty.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>North West Queensland (NWQ) is one of Australia’s least digitally included regions (Thomas et. al. 2018). This research investigated the lived experience of digital inclusion – comprised of internet access, affordability and digital ability – in NWQ’s rural farming households. A qualitative approach was employed to illuminate factors that underlie particularly low levels of digital inclusion among ‘farmers and farm managers’. By talking to cattle farmers at rural events and remote property visits in the Northern Gulf region, the researcher explored the specific opportunities for, and barriers to, getting connected and using digital technologies in life and business for both men and women. The findings revealed a paradox in women’s lived experience of digital inclusion. While internet access is often limited and sometimes out of their control, rural women are thrust into undertaking computer-based tasks and managing data scarcity, which are often seen as ‘women’s work’. Ironically, many of these women develop a thirst for further digital skills and connections, which can be difficult to obtain in the absence of digital ability programs in rural areas. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile phones have become ubiquitous tools for hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants in their transit from their home countries towards the United States (U.S). These communication technologies are not only changing traditional patterns of migration, they are also enabling and inducing migration by providing feelings of trust, closeness, and safety (Barros, 2017). By applying the methods of historical qualitative research and using a media archeological approach, I employ Durham Peters (2009) theory of _infrastructuralism_ to investigate, which are the major infrastructural transitions that have allowed contemporary Central American migrants to use the same mobile phone and plan and to have Internet coverage across multiple national borders during their journey? How have these shifts enabled, induced, changed, and determined new ways and patterns of migration? I conclude that these infrastructural shifts have not only allowed mobile phones to change the traditional migratory patterns, but they are also creating a profitable business for a few private transnational telecommunications corporations. My conclusion presents a central paradox which is, that at the same time that the global capital promotes and enables a “borderless” world through the use of communication technologies which in turn promote emotions of trust, safety, and closeness, the nation-state borders are becoming more harsh, surveilled, and rigid for the migrants who are constantly harassed, detained, and persecuted.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In Canada, known to Indigenous peoples as Turtle Island, the proposed Trans Mountain pipeline would more than double transport of bitumen from Alberta’s oil sands, and though national legitimation of the project is strong, it relies on economic discourse that overwrites environmental concerns, as well as Canada’s lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples. Rejecting settler-colonial authority, pipeline protestors have turned to on-the-ground tactics including petitions and demonstrations - and also to social media, where they share information, organize, and express resistance. On Twitter, user profiles are associated with a diversity of locations including places like Vancouver and Ottawa, recognized under “official,” colonial names. Twitter’s free-form location field, however, enables users to self-select their locations, and connect with one another by situating themselves according to anti-colonial or Indigenous place names, such as “Secwepemcul’ecw” and “Unceded Syilx Territory.” Considering the colonial nature of resource extraction in Canada (Preston, 2017), our project addresses: in what ways does anti-pipeline sentiment correlate with anti-colonial or Indigenous-affiliated toponymic identifiers on Twitter? Applying digital methods, we found empirically that these locations map onto the hashtag discursive space consistently with the issue alignment of discourses, suggesting that users on Twitter do indeed engage in toponymic politics (Rogers, 2015). As a space of resistance and expression of marginalized perspectives, Twitter’s free-form user location enables political expression in ways that unavailable on platforms insisting on geolocation or geotagging. By design, Twitter enables users to establish geographies of trust beyond colonial hegemony as users identify according to Indigenous place names.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel presents on-going research from a large research project on digital infrastructures and citizen participation in the Nordic countries, with a focus on the datafication of the public sector and the construction of new borders between public services and citizens. In recent years, governments have faced increasing pressures to become datafied or “data-driven”. A more data-driven public is said to be able to develop a whole new range of services that are envisaged to result in better services, more effective government, more transparency in the public sector, more just service delivery, and the empowerment of citizens. The panel critically examines the challenges that arise when the precepts are to be converted into working services – such as: What kinds of foreseen and unforeseen transformations does the development of new services give rise to? • What kinds of resistance are the new services facing? • What new forms of expertise, enrollment of new actors, organizational restructuring and redelegation of roles and relations are needed? • How are citizens/clients envisioned and inscribed into the scenarios for future public administration? • How are citizens/clients consulted in the design and development of the services? • How are the new services experienced by citizens/clients? In sum, the presentations in this panel span a range of urgent themes related to the construction of borders (and alleys) between public sector services and citizens – from anticipations to effects and efforts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past few years, a growing number of proposals have been developed to govern major platforms for user-generated content through formalized legislation as well as voluntary self-regulatory initiatives. This paper focusses on the increasingly significant use of trade agreements for the governance of these platforms. While trade agreements have been analysed by academics working on internet governance, copyright, and other issues, they still have underexplored implications for national governments that are trying to craft regulation designed to address a host of perceived democratic externalities posed by dominant technology firms and platform providers like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Presenting the first results of an interdisciplinary project bringing together digital communication scholars, internet governance researchers, and international relations academics to look at the nexus of digital governance and international trade, the paper seeks to understand how different political actors are using trade agreements to ‘lock in’ their preferences on platform governance topics like intermediary liability and competition policy. Building on the analysis of major bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, as well as leaked documents from ongoing negotiations, the paper provides a mapping of the issues related to platform governance included in these instruments. Using this dataset, it then analyses the respective positions of various countries on relevant issues in the negotiations, seeking to create a typology of key issues that will provide a starting point for a deeper analysis of key actor strategies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>QueeringTheMap.com, launched in late 2017 by designer Lucas LaRochelle, is a ‘community-generated mapping project that geo-locates queer moments, memories and histories in relation to physical space’. In a Google Maps-style interface, users can locate pins anchored to physical locations. Attached to each pin is a story. Collectively, there are tens of thousands of stories about being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming: coming out stories, stories of first kisses, sexual encounters, break-ups, pride marches, assaults, traumas, and realisations. These stories digitally layer physical spaces with anonymous individual and collective stories; they locate queer life and they queer the map. In this project we seek to document these experiences, improve understandings of community archiving and digital storytelling practices, and expose the potential for reconfiguring forms of resistance and solidarity through new platforms for collectivity and community-making. In this paper, we consider how these narratives may be understood at scale to provide insights into the digital architecture of queer lives. We focus our analysis on the 1,941 posts pinned to Australia, to consider how QTM reaffirms contemporary understandings of the physical-digital continuum and queers how we conceive of traces and places in this context.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the interface between increased religiousity among Muslim Arab women in Israel, and their social media use. To understand their use of social media as part of a profound change in social identity, fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with Muslim women aged 19-26 who are, or have been, social media users, who live in Israel, and who have become significantly more religious than they had previously been. The findings show two different logics of social media use in times of religious identity change. The first includes reconstructing social media ties to be an alternative, supportive environment, while the second relates to decision making based on the religious rules newly adopted by respondents. Two main social practices were related to the second kind of social media use: managing (and often removing) ties with male users, which raised profound personal dilemmas, and removing digital traces by deleting past posts and photos. Such decisions were made to obey religious rules rather than to gratify personal needs. Social media accompany and assist in the identity change, starting from its very beginnings, and throughout the process. While previous research shows that SNS tie management is an essential part of our identity, our findings show the religious identity of women to be a distinct case where religious rules guide behaviour and decision making. The very fact that these acts and dilemmas are visible to us is a result of paying special attention to identities in flux.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While social media influencers are held up in the popular imagination as self-enterprising cultural tastemakers, their requisite career visibility opens them up to intensified public scrutiny and, consequently, networked hate and harassment. Key repositories of such critique are influencer “hateblogs”—online spaces wherein anti-fans collectively police the activities of highly visible Instagrammers, YouTubers, and the like. This in-progress, mixed methods study brings together analyses of two “hateblog” communities: Get Off My Internets (GOMI) and the now-defunct Reblogging Donk (RBD), both of which targeted women social media personalities almost exclusively. Our analysis reveals an overarching critique of influencers' perceived duplicity or “fakery'' in the realms of parenting/domesticity, relationships, and personal appearance. Such accusations cast influencers as deceitful, avaricious, and lazy charlatans who unfairly profit off of ersatz performances of perfection. Yet as moral discourses (Gray, 2005), these critiques seem to dismantle the tropes of entrepreneurial femininity, suggesting a form of displaced anger. That is, while such expressions may be deployed in disavowal of individual performances of feminine-coded ideals, they are ostensibly rooted in broader sociocultural critiques connected to gendered expectations of authenticity, labor, and privilege. But while hatebloggers’ purport to disillusion us by exposing the artifice of social media, their expressions do little for progressive gender politics. We thus conclude by highlighting the limitations of this expressive act—one that seeks to liberate women from normative constraints while simultaneously engaging in gendered forms of symbolic violence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly being taken-up across scientific disciplines, medical imaging is no exception. To stimulate development and facilitate the scientific evaluation of new approaches, AI-based research in medical imaging is increasingly organised in a competitive manner through digital machine-learning development platforms such as Kaggle and Grand Challenge—two of the leading platforms in the field. For medical image analysis, such competitions constitute an important research infrastructure, steering global research and development in this dedicated AI subfield. Yet, little is known about how these platform-based infrastructures that operate across the medical AI research pipeline shape the conditions for model production and evaluation. This paper addresses this issue through a critical empirical case study of 120 medical imaging competitions on Kaggle and Grand Challenge between 2017 and 2022. We show that platforms as well as competition organisers shape power relations in medical AI research at the level of data and task design, model production and evaluation in several distinct ways. Taken together, because competitions play a central rol within the field, these findings highlight the impact these powerful actors ultimately have on steering medical image AI research directions as they see fit and influence the types of models that are implemented into clinical settings.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores how transnational identities are negotiated through digital and social media use, and how the narratives online contribute to Rohingya transnational identity. Recent studies have made significant strides in understanding refugees’ media practices during migration, transnational family ties, settlement in a host society. However, little attention has been paid to more nuanced understanding every day of risks and opportunities of digital media practice in the context of conflict and forced migration. Drawing on a qualitative approach of semi-structured and social media scroll back interviews methods, I investigate the use of technologies in their everyday experiences of prolonged displacement in the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp, Bangladesh and among resettled refugees in Brisbane, Australia, both distinct but interconnected within a power structure. The findings expose the ‘double-edged’ nature of communication technologies. While most participants think technologies have been a lifeline for their survival, participants from the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp show that security and surveillance are key concerns for members of the Rohingya diaspora. In this paper, I argue that although digital and social media offer a niche of a repertoire of resistance and the rise of a new form of community in a context of statelessness, the use of such technologies can be juxtaposed with the consequence of digital surveillance and victimisation in everyday life in a refugee camp. By focusing on both urban and refugee camp settings, this paper offers critical insights into power inequalities and transnational diaspora activism, authoritarian politics, specifically its mediation by digital technologies.</jats:p>",

The second paper analyzes the election-related Twitter data by topic modeling and identifies issues, in which “fake news” was in play, and how social trust influence fake news sharing on social media was further discussed. The third paper characterize how the election-related information on social media influenced the offline behavior of the political participants by conducting a nation-wide survey to examine correlation between the online political information consumption behavior and the motivation to participate in real-life political activities. The fourth paper focuses on the relationship among socially mediated activism, fake news, and trust in social media in the referenda of same-sex marriage issues.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While many studies suggest media representations of marginalized social groups play a vital role in shaping one’s worldview (Gerbner et al. 1994) or normalizing power imbalances (Harwood and Anderson 2002), videogames continue to privilege characters that are White, adult and male. This paper revisits key questions addressed in Williams, et al.’s “The Virtual Census: Representation of Gender, Race and Age in Videogames” (2009) to examine how representations of gender, race, and age in videogames have changed over the last ten years. The present study analyses the United Kingdom’s top 100 best-selling games of 2017 and looks for changing and continuing trends in the representation of videogame characters compared to the original study. While our sample still shows a preference for White, adult, and male characters, a small but significant increase in the representation of female characters and people of colour offers hope for the future of gaming. By revisiting the 2009 census, we aim to provide empirical evidence that may contribute to further discussions of how gender, race and age are portrayed in videogames, both within academic and industry circles.</jats:p>",

Historically, CAT is applied to human-human\n        communication exchanges. As the theory posits that interpersonal relationships can and will\n        influence motivations or intentions for dyadic communication, this makes sense. However, we\n        argue that as AI-based voice technologies become more sophisticated as voice assistants\n        enter our intimate spaces, the application of CAT to the human-machine communicative\n        relationship is warranted.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital technologies enable the mass datafication of human activity in new and intimate ways, allowing for both active and passive tracking bodily functions, physical movements, consumption habits, social encounters, and even moods and feelings. Despite the seeming newness of these developments, however, Internet scholars recognize that data production and use has always been bound up with broader relations between individuals, communities, and claims to the privateness or publicness of certain bodies, spaces, and behaviors. Most recently, critical data scholars have illuminated the complex, often surreptitious contexts in which datafication occurs, offering a range of conceptual frameworks to contend with the meanings and implications of these deeply personal digital-human entanglements.\n\nIn this paper we take up and recast the notion of “intimate data.” Elsewhere denoting a particular category of tracked activities deemed private or sensitive, we instead consider intimacy as marking a set of (often unequal) socio-political relationships. That is, we mobilize “intimate data” to attend to the processes by which individuals and collectives are datafied in ways that have repercussions for knowledges about oneself and others. In so doing, we sidestep hermetic liberal conceptions of data that center ideals like consent and exchange to think about data collection as eliciting confessions , vulnerabilities, monetizable practices, and new possibilities for governing (inter)personal and other relations. We advance different, alternative political responses, focusing specifically on (1) the (racialized, gendered, classed, sexualized) normativity of intimate data, (2) (re)considerations of privacy and surveillance, (3) tensions around visibility, and (4) responsibilization of individuals to police spaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how the state, neoliberal capitalism, and digital mass media converge to shape particular kind of Chinese “consumer-citizen” (Mazzarella 2013) public: the “melon-eating masses.” By examining how Chinese internet users participate in a genre of public gossip vernacularly known as “melon eating” when the state looms as the final arbiter of judgement, this study illuminates how the politics of “knowing what not to know” (Hillenbrand 2020) unfold in day-to-day (digital) lives in China. Through attending to the “social poetics” (Herzfeld 1988) of netizens’ performance of “rationality” and their understanding and stereotyping of each other, we show how domestic social imaginaries of the Chinese nation and the “rational” Chinese consumer-citizen are co-produced (Jasanoff 2004; Erickson et al 2013), and how they serve to deflect criticism from the Chinese state. Building on anthropological scholarship on gossip as a form of social control (Merry 1984), we explore how public gossiping becomes incorporated into the state’s panoptic apparatus. As Chinese internet users form “partial theories” about “relationships and events” (Van Vleet 2003) through public gossip, “melon-eating” can paradoxically normalize the unknowability of truth under an already-opaque governmental regime.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On March 13, 2020, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman from Louisville, Kentucky, was killed by police officers during a raid on her apartment. In this study, we analyze the complex intersections between race, gender, and the aesthetic norms dominant on Instagram, as they played out in the political expression around the killing of Breonna Taylor, as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. On a theoretical level, this research offers a model explaining how social media platforms (in this case, Instagram) can enable—as well as constrain—certain forms of political expression, through the interaction between their affordances, norms, and contents. An analysis of 5779 Instagram posts and 2173 related comments show how the conversation around #justiceforbre manifested in a collection of posts that was rather uniform, centered on reposting a limited set of posts that were visually appealing, highlighting Taylor’s femininity. A dominant norm in the corpus was connecting political expression around the killing of Breonna Taylor to the user’s own identity, so that the “right” way to speak around the issue varied based on one’s racial group. Through this analysis, this study points at how the interaction between affordances, norms and contents uniquely shaped the kind of political expression that was enabled on Instagram. While adopting the Instagram aesthetic made a powerful impact for the BLM movement, the analyzed contents also show the limits posed on activist action around race relations when it is confined to aesthetically pleasing forms of expression that focus on femininity and beauty. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Datafication of childhood and family life (Barassi, 2020; Mascheroni &amp; Siibak, 2021) represents one of the main expressions of data colonialism (Couldry &amp; Mejias, 2019). Indeed, data relations are pervading the practices and imaginaries of parenting and childhood to the point of being taken for granted. This poses significant epistemological and methodological challenges. This contribution sets out to advance some methodological proposals to study such phenomena through hybrid methods. Adopting a longitudinal mixed methods research design within a sample of 20 families with young children (0-8 y.o) which combines interviews, observational and visual data (Pink &amp; Leder-Mackley, 2012) and drawing upon the concept of families as communicative figurations (Hepp et al., 2018) we argue that network methods and constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) appear suited as analytical tools to capture the interactions between data (generated by the media practices of each household’s member) and each family figuration with the goal to foreground the power relations at play and bring to the surface taken for granted practices and imaginaries. The first empirical application showed that these techniques allow to map each family’s constellation of actors, their data practices and imaginaries, and the digital media ensemble highlighting patterns of spatial differentiation and the media-related structure of relationships that unveil household’s power relations and norms. Moreover, the resulting visualisations emerged as worth-experimenting means to foster participants’ reflexivity.\n\nThese results suggest that CGT methodology and hybrid network methods may represent a way to materialize data relations and disentangle data colonialism in family life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, male supremacist and anti-women formations have become increasingly prevalent online. In particular, considerable attention has been focused on the incel (involuntary celibate) community due to a number of high-profile mass killings in the United States, Canada and, more recently, the UK. Incel ideology is a misogynistic formation, whose male proponents blame women for their lack of sexual activity. It operates in the broader virtual space of the manosphere, a loose conglomerate of online communities spread across various digital platforms, which are united in their antipathy toward feminism, their belief in evolutionary psychology and their adherence to the Red Pill (a process of enlightenment, whereby one comes to understand the world as a liberal feminist conspiracy that disadvantages men).\n\nThis research tracks the dynamic pathways by which incel ideology spreads within and across online communities, digital platforms and geographical spaces, with a view to better understanding processes of radicalization, including ‘algorithmic radicalization.’ We also explore the dynamic interplay between incel and alt-right rhetoric. Understanding the contagion dynamics of extremist ideas - how such ideas circulate, gain new audiences, and morph into new ones - is crucial to researchers, educators, platforms and security practitioners: However, theoretical and practical understanding of the online contagion of extremist ideologies is lacking. It is only by understanding these ‘pilling pipelines’ (Ging and Murphy 2021) that effective interventions can be developed, whether educational, technological, legal or platform-governance-related.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Most research on social media and mental health takes a social psychological focus on associations between types of use (social comparisons) or content (idealised images of thinness) and negative effects. Drawing on critical media studies research on platforms, this presentation shifts the conversation towards exploring how social media platforms or mechanisms shape vulnerable users’ experiences of use and content. Interviews with people with eating disorders (EDs) (n=31) highlighted three key experiences: (i) messaging apps that afforded interpersonal communication with chosen trusted audiences and modes of interaction enhanced wellness, whereas platforms and features pushing interaction and extensive, competitive connections were distressing and shunned, (ii) diet influencers, reeled by algorithms, were especially harmful for people with EDs who sought to steer their feeds towards recovery influencers, which however could rehash triggering aesthetic codes informed by the attention economy; (iii) social media support groups, coaches and mental health advice were deemed useful, however the sheer plenitude of offer and business models also created a minefield. The findings map onto historical intertwining of the countercultural quest to open a space for user-generated content and interaction and commercial entrepreneurialism, both characterised by libertarianism. The participants sought to carve out spaces in social media with trusted friends and alternative vernacular content. Yet, the platforms catapulted them out of their comfort zones into harmful interactions and content streams. The problem here is not specific use or content, but libertarian and commercial social media infrastructures that do not afford safe spaces for vulnerable people with eating disorders or others.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Building on and expanding discussions of the value of anonymity and pseudonymity in digital cultures in general, and in queer digital cultures in particular, this paper explores notions of opacity as modes of resistance to dominating regimes of visibility on and beyond social media platforms. Across queer, postcolonial and digital media theorizing, opacity provides a way of thinking through the tension between the visible and the invisible, challenging the idea of public visibility and identification as that which drives data cultures and legitimizes deviant sexual practices and expressions. Suggestive of discussions on tactical, queer uses of social media in terms of disconnection and reluctance, opacity affords yet another way of thinking resistance to platform power and user control. Based on an ethnographic study of the Swedish digital BDSM, fetish and kink platform Darkside, this paper theorizes opacity in two ways: first, as a way of discussing tactical uses of Darkside between modes of revealing and concealing, and second, as a way of conceptualizing the platform as a borderland between intelligibility and unintelligibility. Opacity implies a lack of clarity; something opaque may be both difficult to see clearly as well as to understand. Drawing on Édouard Glissant (1997) and his idea of “the right to opacity” as a form of resistance to surveillance and imperial domination, a digital sexual politics of opacity could help provide recognition without a demand to fully understand sexual otherness, opening up for new modes of obscure and pleasurable sexual expressions and transgressions on social media platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although Wikipedia uniquely challenges the boundaries of the encyclopedic genre in terms of collaboration, technology, authority, and knowledge production, it remains an encyclopedia, an epistemological method and forum that carries with it the ideological traces and functions of Enlightenment print culture. Such print culture manifests itself most visibly in the policy of verifiability. Although verifiability ensures that editors support their claims with a reliable, published source, a concern emerges when we recognize that verifiability and reliability are typically only granted to written, published sources. Consequently, Wikipedia omits a tremendous amount of human knowledge, especially from cultures without a (privileged) history of print culture. Cultures and regions representing the global south, indigenous cultures and peoples, and other types of knowledge where an oral culture plays a large part in the transmission and curation of knowledge are simply not accounted for. Wikipedia’s vision (somewhat paradoxically) remains hindered by its adherence to colonialist epistemologies that continue to define the genre. This paper articulates Wikipedia’s colonialist epistemology problem by 1) reviewing the core content policies that prohibit alternative and indigenous sources of knowledge, especially verifiability and notability policies and 2) focusing on direct examples of the encyclopedia’s inability to represent indigenous knowledge. In linking contemporary Wikipedia policies to colonialist ideologies, we also trace the encyclopedia genre from its western predecessor, showcasing how Wikipedia continues this tradition via its own techno-optimistic rhetoric. Finally, we discuss failed attempts to address the issue of indigenous knowledge within Wikipedia, and make recommendations for its future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the use of creative methods including walking workshops, design fiction and policy prototyping to investigate questions of trust, security and ethics in public space Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.\n\nWe describe how the walking workshops, or 'walkshops', were developed to incorporate both real IoT deployments, and design fictions representing mundane speculations, in the context of a city in the North-West of England. The first event was held in the physical city, highlighting its hybrid nature as ubiquitous data collection becomes common. The event was also repeated in a digital hybrid space created for this purpose which replicated the features of the city walk virtually. These activities were used to engage with local council officers and cybersecurity experts, and supported the development of new local government policies for secure and ethical IoT deployment.\n\nThe outcomes of this work include reflections on the use of these methods, the delivery of policy recommendations, and the development of an online tool to support organizations in consideration of IoT deployments. Potential users of this tool include public bodies evaluating whether or not deployments conform to policy, those undertaking the design or procurement process for a deployment, and any other organizations assessing ethical and security aspects of IoT.\n\nWe reflect on how combining such creative methods with others such as speculative design allows us a deeper insight into questions of data ownership, ethical data practice and data governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing the ‘infodemic’ accompanying the coronavirus pandemic, many online communities were faced with questions of how to organize and moderate a deluge of information regarding the virus. On the social media platform Reddit, new communities (subreddits) about the virus quickly emerged. Accompanied by some negotiation and contestation, r/coronavirus eventually became the official platform-wide information channel about the pandemic. However, many existing subreddits nevertheless had to decide how to deal with the topic. Should they ban it from their community and refer to the official subreddit, allow the topic without restrictions, or adapt existing moderation mechanisms to the evolving situation? New localized communities emerged for discussing the course of the pandemic in particular countries or regions. Additionally, communities in languages other than English were facing challenges in dealing with covid-19 content. In this submission, I explore moderation strategies in several region- and language-based subreddits to examine how rules in existing online communities were changed in the light of pandemic information. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Catchcries of empowerment and enterprise have been documented and critiqued by a range of scholars, and continue to be invoked within the postfeminist mainstream (Negra 2014, Winch 2013, Adkins and Dever 2016, Banet-Weiser 2015, Dobson 2014). Yet, on the social media platform TikTok, a number of alternative feminist trends have emerged. Young users are increasingly disidentifying with, or even zealously rejecting, postfeminist ideals. This emerging form of online feminist consciousness, however, intertwines with existing regimes of femininity and girlhood, producing a fraught environment within which establishing a young, feminine identity is particularly precarious. Expanding on scholarship examining teenage girlhood on TikTok (Kennedy 2020) and the ‘memeified’ politics of Gen Z (Zeng and Abidin 2021), we consider how young girls on TikTok have developed ‘remixed’ feminine identities by positioning figures such as the ‘girlboss’, the ‘pick me girl’ and ‘that girl’ as imagined others.\n\nThroughout our analysis, we highlight a range of tensions and contradictions that are evoked within normative frames of youthful femininity. These include performing ‘wokeness’ (Sobande 2019); compulsory irony (Chateau 2020); navigating digital literacies (Nissenbaum and Shifman 2017); manufacturing relatability (Kanai 2019) and compliance with hegemonic feminine norms. Ultimately, we argue that through practices of humour, irony and disidentification, the ‘girlboss’, the ‘pick me girl’ and 'that girl' are evoked as feminine Others, producing a collective feminist politics that lacks positive identity markers, where the feminine self must precariously navigate practices of identification, disidentification, opposition and rejection.\n\n</jats:p>",

It collects five papers exploring a broad (but in many ways common) set of ethical dilemmas faced by researchers engaged with specific platforms such as Reddit, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, and private messaging platforms. These include: a study of people's online conversations about health matters on Reddit in support of a proposed situated ethics framework for researchers working with publicly available data; an exploration into sourcing practices among Reddit researchers to determine if their sources could be unmasked and located in Reddit archives; a broader systematic review of over 700 research studies that used Reddit data to assess the kinds of analysis and methods researchers are engaging in as well as any ethical considerations that emerge when researching Reddit; a critical examination of the use of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for academic research; and an investigation into current practices and ethical dilemmas faced when researching closed messaging applications and their users. Taken together, these papers illuminate emerging ethical dilemmas facing researchers when investigating novel platforms and user communities; challenges often not fully addressed–if even contemplated–in existing ethical guidelines. These papers are among those under consideration for publication in a special issue of the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society associated with the AoIR Ethics Working Committee and AoIR2021.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A third of the world’s population is active on social media and a growing number is sharing ephemeral content on such platforms. Though originally pioneered by Snapchat, Instagram has come to dominate the ephemeral media market and, as of January 2019, boasts half a billion daily Instagram Stories users (Statista, 2019). Launched roughly 2.5 years ago, in August 2016, Instagram Stories offers people a novel way of communicating through sharing photos and videos that, by default, are only available for 24 hours and then disappear. This phenomenon presents unique challenges for researchers but also demands additional attention in order to understand contemporary forms of sociability and meaning-making. This study examines people’s everyday engagements with ephemeral media through an exploration of more than 400 Instagram stories created during the 2019 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival.&#x0D;\nThrough this empirical work, we aim to examine the place of ephemeral media in everyday communication and to start a public conversation around the Implications of “losing” ephemeral media and how this might impact archival practices for the study of historical events that get heavily mediated through digital media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain is an emerging technology characterized by peer-to-peer value transfer, decentralization, and democratic ideals of consensus. It also has a stark gender problem, with women representing just 14% of those participating in the space. This paper is based on 30 semi-structured interviews with women who work in blockchain, and participant observation at 17 blockchain meetups and conferences. The gendered discourses and practices surrounding blockchain events provide a productive site for examining the social construction of technologies, and more specifically the gendered social shaping of technologies. I use the theoretical lens of technofeminism, which strikes a balance between technophilia and technophobia, to explore the complex ways in which women’s everyday lives and technological change interrelate in the age of digitization. This co-construction approach challenges the prevailing discourses of technologies like blockchain as neutral and value-free. The goal of my study is not to ask or answer questions such as, “why aren’t there more women in blockchain?” or “how can we attract more women into blockchain?” Rather, I examine the gendered sociotechnical relations surrounding blockchain, as exemplified by discourses and practices at meetups and conferences. For instance, ‘by women, for women’ blockchain meetups serve as important spaces of resistance and support, whereas ‘women in blockchain’ panels at blockchain conferences ring hollow as ‘inclusive’ gestures, instead highlighting the exclusive culture at play. My findings explore how women’s identities and experiences are both enabled and constrained, often simultaneously, through participation in the blockchain space.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Citizens are increasingly assessed, profiled, categorized and scored according to data analytics, their future behavior is predicted, and services are allocated accordingly. State-citizen relations become quasi-automated and dependent on algorithmic decision-making, yet (largely) without people’s knowledge and without avenues to meaningfully engage and intervene. This raises significant challenges for democratic processes and active citizenship. How do we participate as citizens in a society in which we are constantly rated and categorized in ways that we do not understand? How do we affect the development and management of the very data systems that increasingly organize society? How do we develop new democratic practices to ensure participation and accountability? This paper explores emerging opportunities for participatory and deliberative forms of governing the implementation of data analytics, particularly in the public sector. It investigates how models of engagement and deliberation – from citizen juries and citizen assemblies to deliberative polls and public dialogues – can advance civic participation in the roll-out and implementation of data analytics and thus democratize algorithmic governance. It assesses the suitability of these practices by evaluating, e.g., the level of participation, policy impcts, and institutional challenges and obstacles, bringing together insights from the fields of critical data studies and democratic innovation. The paper draws on findings from 15 expert interviews conducted between 2019 and 2021 with members of government and civil society as well as a fact-finding workshop that form part of a two-year project investigating the practices, structures and constraints of citizen engagement with datafied governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is a digital skills crisis: the digital skills crisis does not exist. Through a conceptual history of skill––a word, concept, and action––this paper analyzes the historical, cultural, and material constructions of skill and how it has come to influence current discourse around the alleged “digital skills crisis”. Rather than an intrinsic quality to be acquired, we show how skill has been deployed as a political concept to order bodies and processes according to the interests of power and capital. Pushing back against skilled/unskilled dichotomies, we argue skill itself has been used as a technology in the division of labor (Marx, 1990) to maintain patriarchal (Berg, 1994), and colonial hierarchies (Kumar, 2018). This genealogy helps situate how skill is conceptually operationalized alongside technology in contemporary politics. Through a systematic analysis of policy and public speech from four US presidents––from Clinton’s push to bridge the “digital divide” to Trump’s executive order to “combat the skills crisis”––we show how skills discourse is framed as a deficit issue in both democratic and republican administrations. By centering the conceptual roots of skill, this paper attempts to reclaim an understanding of skills as collective social knowledge that are essential to, and not separate from, technology (Veblen, 1914). Through this work, we hope to generate a broader discussion about the normative assumptions which tie the idea of skill to technological progress so we may re-imagine the kinds of collective social knowledge we need to produce a more just and equitable future.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The political turmoil unleashed in recent years has influenced how people interact and organize themselves. Social media platforms played an important role in the organization of these movements that spilled across the globe. In a scenario of political turmoil, Brazil is suffering from an economic downturn and a lack of political leadership in recent years that made an unprecedented crisis. Influenced by these social dynamics of the platforms, three social movements emerged in this period, June Journeys, diesel crisis, and panelaço, and have influenced in traditional news media agenda. These movements represent evolving power dynamics in society, attempting to replace a dominant belief system that legitimizes the status quo by supporting collective action for change. This study, under the lens of sociology and social media theory, examines the evolution of these movements using data gathered from Google News API. Preliminary results indicate that there is a strong critique about some of these movements by traditional news media as they are challenging pre-existing power relationships. However, the promises to break from the constraints of traditional media and embrace novel forms of connection and community are yet limited. This study concludes with an agenda for future research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This presentation focuses on the documentation and mediation of the January 6, 2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump in an effort to overturn the certification of Joseph Biden’s electoral victory. We analyzed videos participants recorded and shared through a variety of social networking, live-streaming, and messaging applications. We offer a cross-platform descriptive analysis of footage transmitted from participants during the Capitol Riots from seven different platforms: the social networking sites Facebook, Twitter, and Parler; the live-streaming sites DLive, Twitch, and Periscope; and the messaging application Snapchat. In examining this range of platforms and applications, we argue not just for the importance of attending to the documentation of violent protests, but to also account for the broad spectrum of possibilities at play across the ecology of digital video-sharing platforms in building digitally networked publics. This analysis allows us to provisionally argue that the Capitol Rioters were not only interested in particular political outcomes; they were also interested in mediated outcomes that were consciously drawing from the structured affordances of their smartphones and their online networks to create many different media spectacles that were distributed across an ecology of platforms.</jats:p>",

In contrast to the tradition of universal design in the field of human-computer interaction, this research centers difference to investigate how users’ perspectives and expectations, shaped by their identities, help determine the affordances of social media and their ethical implications. Twenty-five in-depth interviews and youth-guided “think aloud” social media tours were carried out with a diverse range of young people from underrepresented groups. Findings illustrate how young people perceive and experience empowering and disempowering aspects of social media design. Interviewees expressed a palpable sense of underrepresentation in the digital technology design sector and noted several ways in which design elements of social media can exacerbate a sense of inadequacy. The negative implications of user profile design and popularity rating systems that encourage conformity were found to be of particular concern for low-income youth, youth of color, and other underrepresented groups. However, our findings also illuminate youth perceptions on how social media can sometimes serve as a tool to counter negative stereotypes and build social capital. The analysis includes concrete suggestions from underrepresented youth for more ethical and equitable social media design.</jats:p>",

The unintended humor of his analogies was ridiculed as evidence that this older lawmaker was too out of touch with modern communications technology to effectively govern them. Yet the episode itself can be understood as evidence of a larger truth—one that both exculpates Stevens somewhat and underlines a broader challenge for internet governance: Namely, that nearly all internet laws and regulations necessarily rely on imperfect metaphor and analogy to keep them in accordance with pre-digital law and constitutional principles, and that even lawmakers and judges with considerable expertise in the field must also rely upon such figurative language. Furthermore, because rhetorical comparisons are fundamentally interpretive, rather than indexical reflections of the things they describe, their use in internet governance amplifies the risk that the prevailing laws and regulations will benefit some users over others, and some uses over others. The internet, in other words, is like a series of analogies. In this article, we catalog many of these analogies and metaphors, document their use in internet governance and policy, and critically investigate how the choice of comparative rhetoric to render the internet knowable introduces hidden bias into the governance process, benefiting some stakeholders over others.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For scholars exploring digital youth cultures, creative research methods offer the potential to disrupt existing power imbalances, form empowering creative practices or closely engage with knowledge production that is dynamic, embodied and socially contextual. Yet the experience of doing creative research methods poses challenges that are often under- or unacknowledged in our work.&#x0D;\nThis roundtable brings together researchers from different countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, and the United Kingdom), career stages, and with differing methodological expertise to discuss the ethical, personal, theoretical and methodological challenges of creative methods research to understand intersectionally diverse groups of young people and their digitally lives.&#x0D;\nIn the spirit of creative methods, our roundtable opens with a short creative, hands-on task that encourages reflection on the following aspects of researching young people’s digital lives: approaching ethics, anonymity, care and vulnerability; choosing suitable research methods; including young people in research; rethinking what counts as “data”; and publishing research results.&#x0D;\nWe will then share brief summaries of our research, addressing ethical challenges at different stages of the research process; from diversity in recruitment and interactions between research designs and young people’s digital lives, to representations of young voices in academic writing and young people’s possibilities of long-term commitments in participatory research. We want to emphasize the importance of openly discussing the challenges we face as researchers but also as practitioners, educators and activists, and we will invite participants to discuss their own research relating to creative methods, ethics and youth digital cultures.&#x0D;\nOur work emphasises the political and pedagogical need for research that approaches young people’s diverse media practices through respectful listening and co-production methods. Additionally, we wish to reflect on our own positions as researchers and feminists, and on which perspectives we can represent and which we cannot.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Memes are efficient tools for far-right activism. They also offer a window into the reactionary values expressed by far-right constituents in digital spheres. In this paper, we conceptualize memes as a meeting place between the values of the far-right and the values characterizing memetic communication on social media. We examined this process through the lens of Schwartz’s theory of basic human values and a case study from Italy. Specifically, we focus on a photo-based meme genre that we named “alternative calendar commemorations.” These memes memorialize events or figures that are key to the imaginary of the far-right. As expected, we found strong appeals to collectivistic values such as patriotism and tradition. However, we also found a partial re-negotiation of the collectivistic values of the far-right through some of the individualistic values intrinsic to memes. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of this new amalgamation between context-specific far-right values and those embedded in the globalizing format of digital memes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What does it feel like to be watched by a machine? How do we make sense of our present state of concurrent awareness of and obliviousness of living our everyday lives under ubiquitous surveillance? This presentation will explore these questions through an analysis of a selection of creepypasta stories that draw their horror from the experience of being watched by - or through - a machine. Conceptualized as “digital urban legends” and “contemporary folklore” creepypastas are short internet-based horror stories often posted anonymously and copied and pasted from forum to forum and collected in online archives.The stories analysed in this paper bring their horror to the technological devices that permeate our everyday lives, such as web cameras, GPS navigation, home security systems, and baby monitors. In these stories, the topic of surveillance and the experience of being watched is a pervasive theme, and quotidian technological devices take on a threatening presence. Sometimes the threat is connected to the idea of surveillance by nefarious corporations or hostile individuals, while in other stories the horror emerges from the realization that the watcher is not human at all. Combining horror tropes with the idea of digital surveillance, these stories function as affective articulations that reveal the anxieties that haunt our relationship with the devices with which we surround ourselves. Through its analysis, this paper argues that the fears articulated in these stories revolve around how machine vision technologies mediate our relationship with reality and redistribute agency within human/machine assemblages.</jats:p>",

    "title": "WHO REMAINS OFFLINE AND WHY? THE EVOLUTION OF INDIVIDUAL FACTORS\t\t\tINFLUENCING INTERNET NON-USE FROM 2011 TO 2019 IN A HIGHLY DIGITISED SOCIETY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Switzerland is one of the countries with the highest internet penetration rates worldwide. Nevertheless, 600,000 people or 8% of the population remain offline. Being digitally excluded is problematic as internet use yields many advantages in everyday life. Obtaining real-time traffic information, applying for jobs, buying things or being an informed citizen increasingly requires internet use. Offline alternatives are often inferior, more expensive or non-existent. In countries where internet adoption is almost universal, the disadvantages of not being online are likely to increase and become even more detrimental to life chances. The choice of appropriate public policies to bridge digital divides, i.e., gaps between internet users and non-users, requires the empirical assessment of internet non-use in highly digitised societies. Therefore, this article investigates how digital divides have evolved from 2011 to 2019. Based on survey data representative of the Swiss population, binary logistic regressions show that structural inequalities significantly influence digital divides: lower income and educational level consistently predicted internet non-use and the age gap between users and non-users increased. Gender did not significantly affect non-use. The main self-reported reason for not using the internet was a perceived lack of usefulness. Proxy internet use, i.e., asking someone to do something online, significantly correlated with an increased intention to use the internet. Thus, an increased interest in the internet as well as indirect exposure to it are key enabling factors for internet use. These representative, long-term results form an input for more evidence-based public policies to mitigate the risks of digital exclusion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the memory work concerning Michael Jackson on the social content aggregation site Reddit. By means of their posts, comments and replies, people contributing to this site—Redditors—enter into a process we call the dynamics of mnemonic stabilization. This is a collaborative process in which networked individuals share their memories about, in this case, Michael Jackson. This process resembles Jackson’s dance technique called moonwalking: Redditors seem to go back in time, but they continually alter how Jackson is remembered and forgotten, depending on the (personal) context of the present and an imagined future. These theoretical observations are empirically assessed by a content analysis of mnemonic comments and replies (N=917) posted on the subreddit /r/MichaelJackson between June 25, 2009, and December 31, 2018. This revealed that most posts with a mnemonic dimension focus on personal memories of Michael Jackson’s music, performances and (perceived) positive characteristics</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines a network of women in AI research who together expanded the range of methodologies and disciplines usually included in AI in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, Barbara Grosz and Candace Sidner’s concept of $2 offered a way to model conversational context and collaboration in multi-agent AI environments. Drawing on archival work, interviews, conference proceedings, white papers, and departmental reports, I consider the cultural, institutional, and intellectual forces that shaped this network and their research. Using a technofeminist framework (Wajcman 2004; Haraway 1990) and borrowing from Michelle Murphy’s (2012) concept of protocol feminism, this paper examines their “feminist AI protocol.” I outline on one hand an assemblage of techniques, values, methods, and practices that illustrate a protocol rooted in community, interdisciplinarity, and care; these researchers formalized human-computer dialogue as fundamentally collaborative, grounding their approach in the diverse goals and desires of real users. I argue their philosophy of “language as action” mirrors ideas circulating in feminist and critical STS simultaneously. On the other hand, this network of researchers did so from within a particular set of cultural and epistemological parameters of their computer science departments. The research practices of this network offer an opportunity to consider the limits of any feminist AI protocol without a deeper commitment to feminist epistemologies. There remains an urgent need to reflect on how to build feminist AI technologies that make room for and include many different standpoints.</jats:p>",

We draw on the concept of affective witnessing (Papailias, 2016; Richardson and Schankweiler, 2019) as a process whereby the boundaries between mourner and witness blur through the affective intensity of mobile media. We contextualise affective witnessing in terms of feminist materialism of care practices (Pols, 2012; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2011; Lupton and Hjorth, forthcoming) to focus on the importance of taking seriously care—care at a distance of family and friends, self-care and care of intimate digital publics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How is mental illness conceptualised, designed, experienced or produced by digital life? This panel explores how digital technologies and media are transforming the performance, recognition, and experience of mental illness. We bring together different methodological and theoretical contributions towards an interdisciplinary study of mental illness and digital life. Our first two papers analyse specifically chatbots and ingestible sensors that are used for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of mental illness in their entanglements with private companies, state policy, and university lab experimentations. Our first paper frames the emerging field of computational psychiatry as a biopolitical form of governance of mental illness through algorithmic and digital means, and analyses the logic of control through the example of a cognitive-behavioural therapy chatbot for depression and anxiety. The second paper turns to the body as a site of intervention for the treatment of psychiatric diagnoses and explores how we can think through the assemblages of digital technology, embodiment and moods associated with mental illness. Understanding online forums as potentially “enabling places,” the third paper discusses the relationships between space and location, and social experiences of mental ill-health on online forums posted by forum users living in remote areas in Australia. Our final paper considers the absence of these “enabling places” as digital platforms disafford familial or relational experiences of mental illness, and design out families where a parent or adult carer lives with mental illness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This papers investigates whether forms of caring surveillance exist in journalism alongside the better known form of threatening surveillance. It explores which ethical and deontological approaches regulate them, and whether journalists, who rightly fear surveillance technology when used to threaten their professional independency, suddenly see it as a useful and beneficial tool when it’s put into use by journalists themselves. Surveillance in journalism has been depicted under an Orwellian aura that implies an inner negativity and malignity. Given the worrisome number of published on the mounting dangers and threats that journalism faces, especially in the digital realm, this scary depiction of surveillance is still dramatically true. Still, forms of surveillance practices daily occur in the exercise of journalism, with journalists regularly using tools and equipment that hold immense intrusive capabilities. While this surveillance capacity is partially regulated by local and international laws, deontological norms lack careful considerations. In the light of the challenges brought arising from the surveillance cultures, do journalists need to review their ethical guidelines for the use of surveillance technology? Is there an uncritical and \"self-absolving\" approach to its use? Should a debate within their community be stimulated through a bottom-up approach, and foster a new professional culture more aware of the opportunities, dangers and responsibilities connected to such technology? Interviews with journalists attempt to reveal common patterns on how journalists perceive the use of surveillance technology, outlining potential paths for self-regulatory deontological norms produced by the journalistic community itself.</jats:p>",

The company supplies information technology (IT) solutions to governments, nonprofits, and corporations, focusing on data integration and surveillance services. To investigate Palantir’s opaque technology practices, this article presents findings from a topic modeling of Palantir patents (n=155) filed from 2006-2019 in the US, Germany, Australia, UK, and EU. This approach follows recent literature that uses patents as data for researching opaque IT firms. We begin by summarizing scholarship on Palantir and IT for policing, intelligence, and security. Our findings show that Palantir’s IT produces infrastructural layers of meaning/context via metadata that are wrapped ‘on top’ of previously held legacy data. We thus use the concept of infrastructuring to understand Palantir’s practices, where information standards like metadata are theorized as phenomena for structuring social worlds.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Police management of sexual assault kits (SAKs) has led to systemic\n        disorganization resulting in lost and forgotten forensic evidence. In response, advocates\n        champion 'sexual assault kit tracking platforms' as a pillar of survivor-centered and\n        trauma-informed approaches to rape kit reform at the state level and to create independent\n        oversight over forensic processes. In 2017, Idaho became the first state to implement a\n        statewide tracking platform. The Idaho Sexual Assault Kit Tracking System (IKTS) allows the\n        public to track kits from distribution to collection, and testing at law enforcement\n        facilities. The emergence of tracking platforms raises questions about what governance\n        paradigms, data relations, and discourses these systems enable. I find concerns about\n        \"timeliness\" and the temporal life of forensic evidence structured the creation, deployment,\n        and maintenance of IKTS. I argue timeliness is a data governance paradigm with multiple and\n        shifting meanings of temporality that comprise various legal, social, and data\n        relationships. I show how the discourse of tardy, slow, and untimely forensic evidence is a\n        mechanism to codify consistent statewide forensic practice and centralize legal\n        decision-making. The legislature's treatment of SAK disorganization as a problem of\n        unmanaged \"temporality\" assumes a view of evidence processing as merely and neutrally\n        unmechanized. On one hand, this treatment obscures how racialized rape myths shape police\n        decision-making; on the other, IKTS protocols offer some intervention. I argue this should\n        not be read as signs of a racial justice technofix, but as indications of the limits and\n        possibilities of a \"technolegal\" response to violence.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE QUANTUM STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE RECONFIGURATION IN 5G",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Transnational information networks are a proxy for power that embody\n        visions of futures and possibilities (Mosco 2005; DeNardis 2020). This paper looks at the\n        topological reconfiguration of networks that comes with the development and deployment of 5G\n        technologies. The paper argues that 5G networks exist in an apparent paradox of quantum\n        superposition: the networks are controlled both by states and private corporations, and the\n        intelligence is located both in the end-points as well as in the network. But just like in\n        the thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat, if one would observe the networks in case of an\n        incident, the control over the network resides inside the network and with the state.\n        However, this would merely describe the topographic qualities of the network, not its\n        topological configuration. I use the concept of a quantum state that originates in physics,\n        but is readily used in quantum social science (ie Barad 2007; Der Derian and Wendt 2020), to\n        explain how, in the development of the topology of 5G networks, several ‘states’ that seem\n        exclusionary occur simultaneously. This approach helps to explore how the creation of\n        material possibilities in transnational information networks is entangled with transnational\n        institutions, markets, and nation-states. Through this contribution, I seek to build a\n        bridge between constructivist and realist traditions in international relations by using\n        approaches from quantum social science and science and technology studies to increase\n        understanding of the role of communication networks in tussles for power.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Firms and research organizations require humans to annotate raw data\n        to make it compatible with machine learning algorithms. These tasks are often outsourced to\n        individuals worldwide through labor platforms or infrastructures that serve as marketplaces\n        where labour is exchanged as a commodity. The firms that operate them consider workers as\n        “independent contractors” without the social and economic benefits of traditional employment\n        relations. This presentation explores the personal networks of Latin American data workers\n        who train and verify data for machine learning algorithms from their homes. A series of\n        in-depth interviews and an analysis of a self-completion questionnaire and web traffic data\n        suggests that these workers are embedded of networks of trusts build on online and offline\n        interactions. These findings show a continuation of exploitative supply chains in the\n        current artificial intelligence market, where wealthy companies and research institutions in\n        advanced economies profit from the economic and political situation of developing countries\n        to access disembedded labor. This paper concludes by arguing that, though outsourced online\n        labour, artificial intelligence developers not only extract value from their workers, but\n        also indirectly from their communities and personal networks.</jats:p>",

For Facebook (who hold a\n        dominant 39% share of the VR market) VR is not simply a gaming device but as a new frontier\n        for social media, framed by Zuckerberg as a “new kind of social computing platform”.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper uses the findings of an investigation into the\n        /r/patientgamers subreddit to account for the ways that our leisure time and our play have\n        been assimilated by the logics of neoliberal, late capitalism. I do this by tracing classed\n        experiences of slowness as experienced by video game players. The figure of the patientgamer\n        was selected not just because of their protracted approach to video game consumption, but\n        because the grows out of a frustration with the financial and temporal costs to access\n        leisure. Through Foucauldian discourse analysis, two major themes were detected across a\n        number of posts which traced how many players tried, and often failed, to slow down their\n        lives in restful ways through their play and the conversations that emerged from the impulse\n        to treat their leisure time as work. Specifically, users’ nostalgia for their childhoods and\n        their anxieties around possessing a video game backlog are both emblematic of the way that\n        video game play has been made legible to capitalist logics such that any distinction between\n        labour and leisure becomes moot and attempt to lift from the patientgamer ethos some\n        potential ways that the work of play may be reframed to undercut logics of efficiency and\n        productivity. The case study of /r/patientgamers holds relevance not just for the study of\n        games and/as culture, but of how technocapitalism instrumentalizes all leisure and the\n        consequences felt by those who try to slow their rhythms of consumption but do so without\n        proper attention to issues of class and power.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data breaches and data misuse are frequent occurrences in today’s\n        digital society and often spark debate over who should hold responsibility. While many hold\n        the platforms responsible when confronted with violations of data privacy, some users shift\n        the blame inward for trusting the platforms and posting on them. While a large body of\n        research has dedicated itself to issues of data privacy, discourses of individual\n        responsibility and the internalization of user self-blame have received less attention. This\n        study explores how users respond to unknown use of their personal data through the case of\n        CrystalKnows, a personality detection algorithm that generated profiles about individuals\n        using unknown data sources, often without the user’s knowledge. Founded in 2015,\n        CrystalKnows claims to have the world’s largest personality database, providing and selling\n        algorithmically generated user profiles, often without the express consent of these\n        individuals. Interviews were conducted with individuals whose profiles appeared on the\n        platform (N=37) to reveal users’ reactions and rationalizations of the data collected about\n        them. Rationales of self-blame vary but commonly center issues of ambiguity concerning\n        digital consent and the algorithm itself. Ultimately, these contribute to feelings of\n        resignation often paired with the unrealistic alternative of total platform non-use. We\n        argue that these complex discourses of self-blame, independence/choice, and\n        resignation/non-use as the only options are intertwined with data privacy reform efforts.\n        Understanding the sources of self-blame and how deep it runs is an important step to\n        interrogating and refuting some of these assumptions, if broader reforms hope to garner\n        support and implementation.</jats:p>",

    "title": "EMERGENT GOVERNANCE: COMPETITION POLICY AS PLATFORM REGULATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Much of the scholarly debate around platform regulation is\n        outcome-focused, concerning rules and norms that should govern platform behavior, rather\n        than focusing on questions of policy processes. However, the question of politics underlying\n        the development of these rules is essential to understanding how and why particular forms of\n        oversight have developed in response to the growing scope of platform capitalism. To address\n        this gap, this paper provides a preliminary account of why competition policy has emerged as\n        a prominent governance mechanism for platform oversight, which privileges stronger antitrust\n        enforcement and economic regulation and has resulted in antitrust lawsuits against and\n        investigations into major tech companies like Google and Facebook. With the US as a case\n        study, I examine a series of 2017-2020 policy debates about oversight of digital platform\n        markets, exploring how the boundaries of competition policy are discursively contested and\n        negotiated in these debates by stakeholders ranging from policy experts to regulators to\n        public interest groups. I argue that these policy debates, driven by a burgeoning\n        antimonopoly movement, produced a set of policy ideas vis-à-vis platform oversight that\n        coalesced around a governance paradigm rooted in competition policy. However, the framework\n        ultimately ultimately prioritizes optimizing competition in digital platform markets above\n        other goals, like data regulation. Consequently, it came up short in providing a policy\n        answer to the expansive forces driving platform capitalism. I theorize these blind spots as\n        partly attributable to the dominance and insularity of the competition policy framework as a\n        foundation for governing platform sectors.</jats:p>",

It analyzes the role of smartphone push notifications and technical affordances of “layering” media across diverse media devices and platforms in users’ mediatized life (e.g. screenshotting a tweet, posting it to Facebook, and users’ commenting on the post), and these platform and device features role in co-constructing terrorist attacks as datafied media events along with mobile media posts and reactions by users and formal news accounts and aggregations by media outlets. Using a data collection framework that logs screenshots of participants’ mobile media devices every five seconds over the course of longitudinal studies, I qualitatively observe screenshots capturing the mobile media usage of 16 subjects from late May to late June 2017, including media relating to two terrorist attacks in the UK. This paper illustrates the role of mobile device and datafied platform features in the sparking of mediatized microrituals and the broader construction of terrorist attacks as datafied media events. It also highlights the layering of mediatization, wherein the above-mentioned interface elements often migrate with a given media object across platforms within a single mobile environment on the user-end, and as it is layered with the users’ in-person contexts beyond the screen. The study of mediatized terrorism, therefore, must be understood across these layers, necessitating further empirical exploration and conceptual development.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes a multi-dimensional theory of temporal control in\n        the gig economy. Specifically, we focus on different types of platform-based temporal\n        control and their respective effects on (a) workers’ autonomy, (b) value of free time, and\n        (c) their social and political connectedness. Theoretically, we draw on the sociology of\n        time and normative time literature in political theory. Empirically, the framework is\n        informed by the synthesis of the literature about algorithms in the gig economy, with\n        particular attention to the methods of temporal control. Meanwhile, we draw insights from a\n        larger comparative project that examines algorithmic labor control and resistance across\n        ride-hailing platforms (Uber and Lyft), TaskRabbit, and delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber\n        Eats, and Instacart) in the United States. The project interviewed 50 gig workers between\n        2017 and 2020. Through a systematic synthesis of primary and secondary materials, this paper\n        contributes to understanding temporalities and work autonomy in the gig economy, and more\n        broadly, flexible workplaces where the boundaries between work and non-work time become\n        blurred.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE AFFECTIVE BODY: PLATFORMED PRESENCE AND VIRTUAL EMBODIMENT IN THE        POPULIST POLITICS OF NARENDRA MODI",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Political theory agrees that the charismatic leader’s cult of personality is a cornerstone of populist politics, with an increasingly distrustful, contentious, and internally divided society seeing the leader as the embodiment of the popular will more viscerally than the electoral process allows (Laclau 2005). The power of the hypermasculine leader persists in the digital age where populists exert authoritarian control over media narratives and infrastructures, as feminist critiques of the iconography of statesmen like Putin, Erdogan and Duterte demonstrate (Chavez and Pacheo 2020). Yet this brand of strongman politics is discursively co-produced by the leader’s physical presence; my presentation argues in contrast that Indian PM Narendra’s Modi’s affective body is animated by its persistent digitization, virtualization, and absence of liveness. Modi’s populism is driven by his appeal as a technocrat, a man accessible to the people via hologram, Twitter, exclusive apps, 3D modelled YouTube videos, and other digitally enabled forms of disembodied representation which create a “fantasy of unmediated access” (Govil and Baishya 2018). When Modi appears in public to perform yoga or lay a silver brick in the foundations of a temple, his corporeal form is one iteration of his virtualized, mediated persona. Modi’s independence from the demands of embodiment is made possible by his substantive digital presence. The experiential intensity and interactivity of social media creates what I term “platform affect”, which mobilizes affective discourses like nationalism to material effect, such as drawing large crowds galvanized by a sense of intimacy with Modi’s virtual and physical person.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As various racial justice movements emerged under the “Black Lives Matter” slogan after George Floyd’s murder in May 2020, Monyee Chau posted some artwork on Instagram with the slogan, #YellowPerilSupportsBlackPower. The artwork—symbolizing Asians with a yellow tiger and African Americans with a black panther—ignited Asians’ activism in support of African Americans and became circulated via multiple social media platforms. In this study, I view the #YellowPerilSupportsBlackPower movement (YPSBP) as digital activism, and I analyze how Asian Americans project their “Asianness” to advocate for the Black community. In particular, I focus on memory work among Asian participants when they demonstrate their solidarity with the Black community. By analyzing mediated memory work on Instagram, I identify the three types of memory work in which Asian participants engage. I conclude that this memory work plays a key role in legitimatizing a process through which Asian Americans can produce affective ties with the Black community that build a multiracial identity extending beyond color lines. This exploration of interracial solidarity enriches both the social movement and digital activism scholarship by illustrating how memory work mediates and amplifies affective solidarity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital visualizations have seen an exponential rise in use by politicians, candidates and other political actors. Digital visualizations may be informative and engaging as well as potentially, persuasive or misleading when applied by political candidates. However, the ways in which different actors utilize them has yet to receive systematic scholarly attention. Informed by a comprehensive theoretical framework related to political power, digital visualizations and social media campaigns, I performed grounded qualitative content-analysis of all \"cost-of-living\" visualizations posted to Facebook during the 2015 Israeli election period, by both peripheral and primary political actors. I define two main argumentation strategies (Progress Makers &amp; Hinderers and Re-visualized Economy), reliant on different narrative, visual, and information-oriented choices by different actors. An overview of my findings reveals digital visualizations as a meeting ground between the political power of actors, the rhetorical power of emotionality and the cultural power of numbers. I conclude with a reflection on revisualization as a means of expanding a fourth type of power, discursive power, wherein visualizations are used as an act of resistance by weaker actors against the narrative of reality promoted by stronger actors, relying on the rhetorical affordances of the digital political visualization genre toincrease their rhetorical power. Digital visualizations thus offer a uniquely agile tool for political actors of all types to utilize in gaining discursive power in the competition over election narratives in the digital arena of social media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an ethnographic account of how a community of\n        Bengali-speaking rappers called the Cypher Projekt, based in the Indian state of West\n        Bengal, attempted to create an online place for conducting cyphers during India’s harsh\n        lockdowns in 2020. As an integral practice in Hip Hop culture, a rap cypher is akin to a\n        poetry slam and typically held in physical locations where proximity between rappers is key\n        to lyrical improvisation and competitive engagement. The Covid-19 lockdowns imposed\n        throughout India in 2020 forced this community of Indian rappers to explore online\n        environments for conducting the cyphers. However, due to infrastructural constraints related\n        to latency in Internet connections, the cyphers were replaced with informal discussion\n        sessions. These sessions were referred to as the Streamyard cyphers, owing to use of the\n        free version of a web-enabled video-conferencing application called Streamyard. The\n        ethnographic study revealed how the online sessions served as lively informal hangouts for\n        members of the community, in line with several characteristics of Ray Oldenberg’s third\n        place. However, there were other crucial aspects that did not meet the characteristics of a\n        third place, which necessitated the explanatory power offered by the Indian social practice\n        of the adda. The Streamyard cyphers clearly offered a vibrant third place for the\n        undertaking of addas amid the Covid-induced Indian lockdowns of 2020. While Oldenburg’s\n        notion of the third place still holds relevance for the examination of informal sociality,\n        in the Global South, its application requires augmentation with scholarly analyses of social\n        practices in specific sociocultural contexts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Apologies have become a prominent feature of online platforms’ corporate communications. Whether in response to instances of harassment, security lapses, or political manipulation, official expressions of remorse or regret—often coupled with vows to “do better”—work to reconcile or recover a platform’s commitments in the face of public relations, economic, or regulatory pressure. Despite their prominence, however, apologies have received comparably less critical attention in research on harassment and abuse than other corporate responses. In this work, we employ discourse analysis to explore three high-profile apologies: former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao’s July 2015 apology for missteps in addressing the site’s abusive climate; Riot Games’ 2018 apology for hostility and sexual harassment at the company; and Twitch’s June 2020 apology in response to allegations that some streamers had engaged in offline sexual harassment--leading to online harassment of the alleged victims. Throughout our analysis, we pay particular attention to how apologies 1) construct and reproduce particular ideals of platforms and attendant actors and 2) distribute or assign culpability for harassment and abuse. What emerges is an outline of how this genre of corporate apology is emblematic individualist approach to structural problems like online harassment, while offering pseudo-empowerment to end users through new online \"tools\" that $2 are primarily responsible for using.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PLEASURE+GENDER+PLAY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>From the start, play and game studies scholars have investigated the experiences of women and girls who play games online, as well as gendered assumptions around digital as well as non-digital play (Brunner et al., 2000; Bryce &amp; Rutter, 2002; Delamere &amp; Shaw, 2008; Fron et al., 2007a, 2007b; Pearce, 2009). Scholars have challenged ideas such as that girls and women have weaker gameplay skills than boys and men (Jenson &amp; De Castell, 2008), that women are not interested in competitive play (Taylor, 2006), that girls and women are different in their play experiences and interests (Royse et al., 2007) and that women are not frequent or loyal players (Consalvo &amp; Begy, 2015; Williams et al., 2009). However, there is still more to learn about how women, girls, boys, men, nonbinary and other individuals play, as well as how gender can play an important role beyond as an identity marker in playful expressions as well as normative expectations for play. This panel offers new ways of examining how gender, games, and other forms of online play, can be analyzed and understood. These four papers argue for a more nuanced understanding of gender and play, further challenging gaming culture’s preoccupation that certain games and certain styles of play are more “valid” than others (Consalvo &amp; Paul, 2019). To do that, we offer fresh analytical tools, different theoretical lenses and underexplored sites for study. $2 “No Need For Speed” makes a unique contribution to gaming and play literature, offering a new articulation of the temporal experiences within and external to game play - especially in COVID/pandemic times. In particular, the authors argue that the concept of “slow gaming,” might offer new possibilities for both our experiences of play and the way that time within the games industry itself is being reconceptualized. The authors offer three different games as examples of how “slow gaming” challenges our relationship to play, domesticity, notions of gender, and labor practices within the gaming industry more broadly. This paper argues that playing slow games, or playing games slowly, might provide a unique political rejoinder to contemporary life under late capitalism. $2 Two papers in this panel bring underutilized theoretical frameworks to the study of gender and games: examining how socioeconomic class and boundary keeping intersect with gender and gameplay in important ways. The presentation “Working for hearts: Social class and time management games” reads popular casual games such as Sally’s Spa through an intersectional critique. Adding to gendered examinations of casual games (Chess, 2012, 2017), this paper brings in a critique of social class. It does so through exploring the classed positions of jobs in these games, as well as how the player’s agency is limited both through classed expectations of certain occupations as well as further undermined by particular design decisions and gameplay mechanics as well as game narratives. It demonstrates how class is an important aspect of identity that can help us better understand gaming representations. The second paper to bring in underutilized theory is “Gendered expectations of playing nice, boundary keeping and problematic/toxic behaviors in casual video game communities.” This paper offers a different way of understanding the role of toxic behavior and players in game communities: through the sociological lens of boundary keeping. While not dismissing the real effects of harassment, it explores how activities such as trolling and other problematic gameplay is defined differently within different player groups, how it can strengthen some in-game communities or spur the creation of groups dedicated to combating such problems, and in the process helping to further enrich and make more inclusive gaming culture. $2 “Girls, Platforms, and Play” examines an offline form of gendered play and competition – pre-teen and teen girls riding hobbyhorses – and how the activity has been differently contested and/or constructed on two platforms: YouTube and Instagram. Legacy media video content of hobbyhorse competitions uploaded to YouTube inevitably have led – given YouTube’s largely antisocial comment culture (Burgess &amp; Green, 2018) – to hobbyhorsers’ activities to be delegitimized for a number of reasons by commenters: mainly, because it’s just girls playing with toys, not participating in a sport; or because it is an athletic endeavor, but its participants should compete in a “real” sport, like track and field; or because it’s not real equestrianism. Instagram's affordances, which help encourage connections among subculture participants and the creation of communities (Leaver, Highfield, &amp; Abidin, 2020), have allowed hobbyhorse enthusiasts to create a space of their own online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Through document analysis and participant observation, this paper\n        examines the patent strategy of Transsion, a Chinese company that dominates Africa’s\n        smartphone market and a leading innovator in facial recognition technologies optimised for\n        darker skins. We identify two major narratives surrounding Transsion’s facial recognition\n        patent strategy. First is the “empowerment” narrative, in which Transsion argues that there\n        are “blind spots” in conventional AI camera technologies and interprets its AI camera as not\n        just a fix to existing blindness but also an empowerment tool for dark-skinned users by\n        “seeing” and capturing their beauty. While the “empowerment” narrative is more externally\n        oriented, Transsion uses a “warfare” narrative to interpret its patent strategy internally.\n        This may have to do with cut-throat market competition, patents race, and the rapid pace of\n        innovation, which gave Transsion a strong sense of crisis. Other major Chinese brands are\n        also entering the African market. Transsion thus considers its facial recognition patents as\n        “competitive weaponry” in preparation for a future clash in Africa’s smartphone market. This\n        study makes three contributions. Empirically, through document analysis and participant\n        observation, we examine a relatively less known Chinese smartphone company that has made\n        huge impact in the Global South. Theoretically, we shed on the possibility of algorithmic\n        empowerment against racist facial recognition systems, although developing AI as a weaponry,\n        in the Chinese-African contexts, may also lead to new forms of imperialism. Thematically,\n        echoing this year’s AoIR conference theme, this study reveals the politics and geopolitics\n        of independence through patents.</jats:p>",

We hypothesize that these could be explained through the interplay\n        of three avenues: (1) values—the literature on values in Japan foregrounds harmony,\n        collectivism, and the avoidance of shame; (2) Topic—gender and sexual harassment—drawing on\n        literature on the rootedness of sexism in this society; (3) Platform—mounting concerns over\n        privacy issues on Twitter in Japan. We conducted fifteen interviews with Japanese men and\n        women from varied backgrounds and assembled 119 newspaper articles that explain why people\n        are reluctant to speak up. We applied a combination of grounded and thematic analysis to\n        analyze these samples. Our analysis affirmed that the three avenues are key to understanding\n        the movement’s absence and reformulation. Perceived Japanese values clash against the values\n        that respondents and newspapers detected in the movement, and the new formulations are\n        evaluated as “softening” the protest by blending in acceptable values. However, while most\n        participants appreciated the movement, they were afraid of retaliation and isolation, given\n        their perception of Japanese values. We tentatively argue that it’s not values as essential\n        orientations but the prevalent perceptions of popular values that limit activism. Such\n        perceptions of national values become self-fulfilling prophecies; people “perform” the\n        values that they think others will appreciate and, in so doing, reinforce those\n        values.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube’s ‘up next’ feature algorithmically suggests videos to watch\n        after a video that is currently playing. This feature has been criticised for limiting\n        users’ exposure to diverse media content and information sources; meanwhile, YouTube has\n        reported that they have implemented technical and policy changes to address these concerns.\n        Yet, there is limited data to support either the existing concerns or YouTube’s claims.\n        Drawing on the concept of platform observability, this paper combines computational and\n        qualitative methods to investigate the types of content YouTube’s ‘up next’ feature\n        amplifies over time, using three search terms associated with sociocultural issues where\n        concerns have been raised about YouTube’s role: ‘coronavirus’, ‘feminism’ and ‘beauty’. Over\n        six weeks, we collected the videos (and their metadata) that were highly ranked in the\n        search results for each keyword, as well as the top-ranked recommendations associated with\n        each video, repeating the exercise for three steps in the recommendation chain. We then\n        examined patterns in the recommended videos (and channels) for each query and their\n        variation over time. We found evidence of YouTube's stated efforts to boost ‘authoritative’\n        media outlets, but at the same time, misleading and controversial content continues to be\n        recommended. We also found that while algorithmic recommendations offer diversity in videos\n        over time, there are clear ‘winners’ at the channel level that are given a visibility boost\n        in YouTube’s 'up next' feature. These impacts were attenuated differently depending on the\n        nature of the search topic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As has been widely reported, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately sickened and killed Black Americans. At the same time, however, there is a significant body of conversation on Black Twitter that jokes about the pandemic. This includes tweets that nickname the pandemic as \"Miss Rona,” as in “god i need a drink so bad, miss rona i promise i will be good.” Through an analysis of tweets using the “Miss Rona” nickname, we examine how Black Twitter humor serves as a site of political critique of both public policy failures and the Trump administration more broadly, with users leveraging practices like Signifyin’, African American Vernacular English (AAVE), and wordplay to resist legibility by outsiders as they orient toward their own community. Black humor is political commentary that resonates with the Black community because the tweets address or refer to Black trauma during the pandemic: dealing with continued racial violence, white supremacist ideology, and medical disparities based on race. The tweets are also expressions of Black Twitter catharsis (joy despite pain) through witty one-sided Twitter banters that skillfully and playfully engage with several facets of the social and political climate. We consider how these conversations go beyond laughing to keep from crying to coded political statements and cultural alliance, and argue that Black Twitter’s jokes about the collective trauma of COVID-19 is a resource for online camaraderie, cultural critique, and community affiliation.</jats:p>",

Meese Frith and\n        Wilken (2020) suggest that controversies around 5G stem from infrastructural anxieties best\n        examined in the framework of geopolitics. We build on this work by analyzing the emerging\n        infrastructural imaginary of 5G in light of the changing global division of labor.\n        Sociotechnical imaginaries (Jasanoff and Kim 2015) refer to the vision of technologies\n        themselves, while ideologies refer to the totality of social relations, translating the\n        objective reality of material conditions to subjective lived experience (Bory 2020). The\n        Western imaginaries around 5G infrastructures reflect, deflect, translate and sublimate the\n        infrastructural anxieties tied to the development and deployment of new network paradigms.\n        Their controversial nature, contradictory content, and fragmented presentation is a\n        necessary part of living through the trauma of lost historical agency on the part of Western\n        superpowers. We engaged in code ethnography (Rosa 2019) of GSM, internet, and 5G\n        technologies, as well as participant observation in the main standard-development\n        organizations of the internet and 5G, and semi-structured interviews with equipment vendors\n        and network operators. Our methodological assumption, taken from World Systems Theory\n        (Wallerstein and Wallerstein 2004), is that the character and content of imaginaries and\n        their underpinning ideologies creatively reflect the position of actors in the global\n        division of labor. This paper contributes to the understanding of the role of\n        infrastructures in geopolitical power tussles and straddles the fields of science and\n        technology studies and international relations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created new opportunities and new tensions\n        related to workplace surveillance. Monitoring workers via digital tools to analyze\n        everything from keystrokes to email and social media to the websites they visit is\n        increasingly common, and the shift to remote work in the early days of the pandemic led many\n        employers to consider new ways to monitor their employees while working from home.

In particular, we unpack the sociotechnical implications of\n        shifting work surveillance practices due to COVID-19, focusing on how evolving and emergent\n        workplace surveillance practices may impact workers. Using factorial vignettes, survey\n        respondents (N=645) read and responded to 35 scenarios about future workplace surveillance\n        practices. Each scenario randomly varied four factors about workplace monitoring: the type\n        of data being collected, the purpose for data collection, the actors who can access the\n        data, and the transmission principle guiding data collection. For each scenario, respondents\n        assessed both the appropriateness of each scenario and how concerning they found it. We\n        evaluate this data, as well as data about respondents’ work environment before and during\n        the pandemic, using Nissenbaum’s framework of privacy as contextual integrity.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, I explore the role of ambient context in the encoding and decoding of election tweets and the ways these tweets signal perceived affective interconnectedness between users. I particularly explore the tweets by Turkish microcelebrities that do not make sense outside of a transient context and thus rely on the ambient context provided by shared online or offline experiences. These tweets include reactions or responses to TV interviews, news reports, rallies and so on. In scholarly works, similar tweets have been mainly observed within hashtagged datasets where the hashtag provides the necessary context. Building on Abidin’s (2015) account on perceived interconnectedness as a performance of intimacy between influencers and followers, I analyse such tweets as signifiers of affective interconnectedness that reinforce a ‘feeling of community’ (Dean, 2010). Thus, I argue that during political events, for Twitter microcelebrities, affect, as in, manifestations of experienced emotions (Papacharissi, 2012), replaces other strategies of intimacy in building these bonds. Political events create an environment where intimacy is capitalized to reinforce affective experiences and is simultaneously generated through them. Understanding the subtext in these affective expressions imply a degree of togetherness between the microcelebrity and the follower, a shared, in-group experience that relies on an existing familiarity and reinforces the intimacy between them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile live streaming recently advanced as popular form of content creation for streamers on short-video apps like Douyin and TikTok to make money through virtual gifts from viewers. Virtual gifts are primarily used to reward streamers for their content or performance in a live stream, yet on Douyin social aspects seem to be more crucial for virtual gifting. We are looking at three types of live streams by young male hosts (= streamers) on Douyin to analyze the motivations of female viewers to watch and make virtual gifts to the hosts and to explore resulting power relations between hosts and viewers. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with female of all three live streams who sent virtual gifts to hosts. We find female viewers send virtual gifts, for example, because they wanted to make the host happy or to help them achieve an assigned virtual gifts task. We did not find aspects of power imbalances regarding the monetary or social value of virtual gifts. While interviewees do not expect anything from the hosts in return for their virtual gifts, they appreciate online gestures, like a host blowing a kiss. In contrast, we observed viewers send virtual gifts to help a host win a live stream competition which holds implicit expectations. Overall, we find female viewers of male-hosted Douyin live streams mainly use virtual gifts as a social means of appreciation and support for friendship in a parasocial online interaction.</jats:p>",

It casts economists as institutional engineers, choosing a outcome and then arranging a set of market rules and conditions to achieve it. The toolkit from mechanism design is widely used in economics, policymaking, and now in building and managing online environments. Mechanism design has become one of the most pervasive yet inconspicuous influences on the digital mediation of social life. Its optimizing schemes structure online advertising markets and other multi-sided platform businesses. Whatever normative rationales mechanism design might draw on in its economic origins, as its influence has grown and its applications have become more computational, we suggest those justifications for using mechanism design to orchestrate and optimize human interaction are losing traction. In this article, we ask what ideological work mechanism design is doing in economics, computer science, and its applications to the governance of digital platforms. Observing mechanism design in action in algorithmic environments, we argue it has become a tool for producing information domination, distributing social costs in ways that benefit designers, and controlling and coordinating participants in multi-sided platforms.</jats:p>",

Black women YouTubers actively critiqued the light skin preference, as well as\n        anti-Blackness reflected in K-beauty brands through the Black Girls, Tries Korean Makeup\n        video series. Korean viewers, on the other hand, strongly rejected these accusations of the\n        anti-Black aspect of K-beauty, explaining distinctive Korean racial dynamic as a one-ethnic\n        country where the light skin preference is not translated to the anti-Blackness. I argue\n        that this inter-cultural and inter-racial conflict arguably has been shaped by YouTube’s\n        digital infrastructure that prioritizes short, trendy, how-to-style videos, that do not\n        require a lengthy contextualization of each culture’s beauty practices, and history of\n        oppressions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the complex interdependencies in today’s digital news ecology, it is still common to study digital journalism primarily by looking at how ‘non-journalists’ are influencing journalists from ‘outside’ the field of professional journalism. When it comes to how digital journalism is shaping non-journalists, we mostly find audience research or research on the effects of journalistic reporting. We argue that understanding journalism’s role in society today requires us to more broadly ask how imaginaries about journalism influence all kinds of actors that make up our digital public. In this paper, we therefore discuss how imaginaries about journalism shape the practices and identity of Mozilla, an organization best known for the development of the Firefox web browser. Mozilla currently explores collaborations with, or support of journalism, and we argue that this exploration is shaped by imaginaries about journalism. Using a Mozilla project as an example that seeks to support alternatives to advertising as the dominant way to finance journalistic content online, we show how Mozilla is trying to support its own mission by supporting organizations whose practices and values are considered compatible with this mission. We argue that Mozilla is not aiming to support ‘journalism’ as such, but a particular and rather traditional idea of fact-oriented journalism that facilitates political deliberation. Our findings suggest that studying how particular imaginaries about digital journalism influence non-journalists can help illuminate journalism’s role in today's digital news ecology beyond its ‘democratic function’ and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the digital transformation as a whole.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Tinder’s swipe feature operates algorithms that have influenced a new\n        generation of dating apps. In this paper, we argue that the mystique surrounding Tinder’s\n        algorithms is as productive for the dating app industry as the actual technical operations\n        they perform. We seek to understand how actors in the dating industry construct matchmaking\n        algorithms as strategic unknowns that can be harnessed to reach commercial objectives. To do\n        so, we mobilize the notion of ‘algorithmic blackboxing’ – how actors strategically construct\n        algorithms as black boxes to reach certain goals – to analyze a corpus of 48 online dating\n        guides that offer ‘best advice’ to exploit Tinder’s matchmaking algorithms. Our analysis\n        shows that dating guides overwhelmingly construct Tinder’s algorithms as black boxes whose\n        secrets must be unlocked for users to generate matches and, therefore, find love. The\n        alleged unintelligibility and opacity of Tinder’s algorithms allow self-proclaimed ‘dating\n        experts’ to sell their advice or services in the context of a speculative dating economy. To\n        obtain more matches, dating guides promote a common injunction: to hack Tinder. They invite\n        users to modulate their behaviors and practices to become more algorithmically recognizable.\n        Dating guides also readily invoke rhetorical arguments that draw on statistical data\n        produced by Tinder, which highlights the emergence of new ‘regimes of truth’ within the\n        matchmaking industry that enact a dataist ideology. We conclude by advocating for the\n        importance of critically examining the increasing algorithmic mediation of dating cultures\n        at the intersection of Internet, gender, and sexuality studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Young people’s relationship with the news has been a cause of concern, especially due to the role of social media as a central component of their lives, often seen as a prominent cause of declining trust in the news. This proposal features some of the results of a multi-method, interdisciplinary study of the University of Helsinki (2019-2021) that examines how Finnish audiences view the power of traditional news media and social media. The project understands trust as a four-dimensional concept: generalized trust in the media, trust in specific sources, trust in terms of specific issues, and trust determined by one’s individual disposition. Based on the results of two general surveys in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, a survey focused on young people (18-29-year-olds), three focus group interviews, as well as a three-day online discussion of 30 participants of the same age group in Fall 2020, we analyze how young people and experience the trust in news sources online. We also discuss how the pandemic has shaped their experiences. While the most defining characteristic of Finnish audiences is a combination of both basic trust and critical approaches toward news, this is markedly true for young people. At the same time, our findings do not confirm the worst fears of moral panic about growing distrust and news avoidance by young people. Rather, they suggest a combination of independence and interdependence by young people, of both legacy news media and online and social media sources.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Though the role of digital media in protest movements has received\n        plenty of attention since the onset of Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Uprisings a decade\n        ago, the way that protest movements have enabled the institutional development of\n        independent digital news media has received less attention. How do protest movements enable\n        the rise of independent digital news media? How do these emerging outlets interact with\n        components of pre-existing media? And what techno political constraints do these outlets\n        face? To answer these questions, we zoom in on Lebanon where an uprising broke out in 2019\n        and gave rise to a network of independent and interdependent digital media outlets. We focus\n        on the rise of Megaphone, an independent social-media-native news outlet that left its mark\n        on the country’s political and media scene. Based on a politico-economic analysis of the\n        emerging digital media scene in Lebanon, a historical analysis of the distinctive meaning of\n        media independence in that context, and a case study of Megaphone, we examine the notion of\n        independent digital media in the context of protest movements and analyze the distinctive\n        travails of social-media-native outlets. We also show how, in Lebanon, independence\n        movements, protest movements, and uprisings have historically contributed to introducing new\n        media forms and outlets and shaping Lebanon’s media. Our paper contributes to a\n        techno-political and algorithmic notion of media independence and begins to theorize\n        social-media-native independent news outlets as a peculiar form of emerging, and\n        increasingly prevalent, media institution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel focuses on different ways that practices of children, youth, and families are legitimatized (and deligitimatized) in schools, homes, and market places. With a focus on media consumption, the four papers examine the lived realities of families in the late 2010’s, a time period dominated by Trump-era politics, neoliberal ideologies, digital capitalisms and dilemmas of trust. In this moment, children and youth are positioned variously as in need of media literacy, parental regulations, and social controls. Simultaneously, children and youth are looked to as the future generation of political activists, savvy consumers, and promotional actors. In these polarized and sometimes conflicting positions, particular practices are recognized and condoned, while others are subject to intense scrutiny. We ask a number of questions: what discursive constructions are available for children and youth engaging with digital media? What options do parents have in terms of positioning themselves and their parenting in relation to children and media? In what ways are hierarchies of value enacted and replicated in relation to media and education? These questions are all framed by larger questions from the field of child studies and how the child is framed in various discourses - civic, parental, promotional and educational.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In October 2016, the contract between the United States Department of\n        Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) officially\n        expired. This contract represented a long-standing and close relationship between the United\n        States government and ICANN, a relationship that positioned the U.S. as a kind of linchpin\n        in determining the shape and coordination of the global, extraterritorial internet. This\n        research seeks to address the question: what interests and values shaped ICANN at the time\n        of its establishment and in what ways do debates about this system reflect broader concerns\n        about the U.S.-centric nature of early internet governance policy? I address this question\n        using archival analysis focusing on the Ira Magaziner Electronic Commerce papers at the\n        Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. In examining this archive, there are\n        repeated concerns about the U.S.-centric nature of early internet governance policy,\n        concerns that were clear as early as the mid-1990s and which remained at issue with the\n        oversight of ICANN until 2016. While espousing the values of competitive free-market, the\n        internet governance policy promoted by the U.S. government during the Clinton Administration\n        raised concerns about the concentration of power and potentially monopolistic control of the\n        network by a single nation. Understanding the foundations of debates around oversight and\n        multistakeholderism that took place as early as the 1990s helps us better understand more\n        recent changes in internet governance and also help contextualize and ground discussions\n        about how to best create a truly representative global internet in the future.</jats:p>",

    "title": "WHEN DEATH DEPENDS ON NETWORKED INFORMATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the founding stories of the United States centers on Patrick\n        Henry’s 1775 declaration “give me liberty, or give me death” on the floor of the Second\n        Virginia Convention where war with Britain was being debated (Cohen, 1981). A similar\n        sentiment is part of several national origin stories including the 1320 Declaration of\n        Scottish Independence, which may have been an inspiration for Henry, and Greece’s national\n        motto of “Liberty or Death,” which was the rallying cry in the 1820 Greek War of\n        Independence. In each instance the suggestion is that independence will be achieved either\n        through successful revolution or death. But in our modern networked cultures, what kind of\n        independence can be found in death? This panel takes up the AoIR 2021 Independence theme by\n        considering how our information and communication technologies are entangled with the end of\n        human life, both at individual and community levels. Our case studies focus primarily on the\n        United States and is deeply invested in considering practices that are evolving in the\n        context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the long epidemic of\n        police killings of people of color in the U.S. In each of these long events, we are\n        witnessing a myriad of efforts to collect mortality data and render it in ways that make\n        sense of scales of loss. But questions about digital afterlives, networked and remixed loss,\n        and proprietary control over digital remains complicates the foundational narratives of\n        liberty through death and enrolls our dead in practices of nation formation even when those\n        very lives were rendered expendable by the nation-state. At the same time, these practices\n        are an important part of the problematic narrative that nothing dies on the internet, where\n        deaths can circulate as undead memes and commodified data streams. The papers on this panel\n        examine the intersection of data management and speculative death (life insurance, mortality\n        tables, pandemic statistics, counting the dead or potential dead) and death care management\n        (personal digital archives, maintenance work, kinship ties, digital estate planning/mortuary\n        rites, memorialization). As interdisciplinary scholars from Library and Information Science,\n        Science and Technology Studies, and media history, we interrogate the historical,\n        sociotechnical, and cultural aspects of sorting and caring for the dead through networked\n        information. How are people, institutions, and infrastructures working to make sense of and\n        account for the dead on both individual and collective scales? In what ways do histories of\n        racialized and gendered surveillance and violence impact the treatment of the dead when it\n        comes to both digital and physical remains? Major digital platforms and tech companies are\n        increasingly at the center of memorialization and mourning practices, both building on and\n        transforming the ways that these longer histories inform mortuary politics. All four papers\n        show how institutions and individuals are using digital media and networked information—\n        from mortality data and barcodes affixed to coffins to social media memorials and\n        crowdfunding platforms—to assess, track, memorialize, and otherwise manage the dead. We pay\n        particularly close attention to the ways that race, gender, sexuality, immigration status,\n        and citizenship affect how the dead are counted and remembered. We trace the history of\n        technologies used to assess risk and manage mortality, comparing recent COVID-19 related\n        developments to previous crises or pandemics and to longer histories of deathcare management\n        as data management, including the history of the life insurance industry, mortality tables,\n        and surveillance, from chattel slavery to contemporary predictive policing. In the 21st\n        century the majority of these practices have transitioned to online and networked spaces,\n        even as they continue to create social networks of information and ritual. Despite digital\n        technologies being offered as a “solution” to the problem of death, our disparate case\n        studies show how digital systems tend to reinforce existing structural inequalities, thereby\n        troubling any sense that independence from violent social formations exists even in death.\n        Cohen, Charles (October 1981). \"The 'Liberty or Death' Speech: A Note on Religion and\n        Revolutionary Rhetoric\".

The term encompasses (1) the technological capacity to modify cultural commodities after they have reached (and perhaps experience by) users; (2) the erosion of digital ownership, emblematic of similar trends in companies limiting one’s ability to modify – or even repair – their owned hardware and software; and (3) the data-driven race for content optimisation, where platform owners use consumer surveillance to deliver their products for maximum engagement (Helles and Flyverbom 2019). These three components of the term are further explored in relation to the ontological and epistemological repercussions of a continually updating cultural commodities, across four key domains. First, cloud culture highlights $2 . Second, it emphasises the $2 , and the shift of platform power toward large-scale cultural revisions. Third, it alerts over the seeming $2 of replaced and rewritten digital objects. Fourth and ultimately, this might have severe repercussions on $2 both for media researchers and – more importantly – the public at large</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Global events like a pandemic or climate change are massive in scope\n        but experienced at the local, lived, microscopic level. What sorts of methodologies and\n        mindsets can help critical internet researchers, functioning as interventionists or\n        activists, find traction by oscillating between these levels?

This panel presents four\n        papers addressing these questions based on a large scale online autoethnography in 2020.\n        This “Massive/Micro” project simultaneously used and studied the angst and novelty of\n        isolation during a pandemic, activating researchers, activists, and artists to explore the\n        massive yet microscopic properties of COVID-19 as a “glocal” phenomenon.

    "title": "'GLOBAL, NETWORKED AND COLLABORATIVE': HOW THE NORMALIZATION OF LEAKING SHAPED THE IDENTITY AND PRACTICE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>From the Panama Papers to the Migrants' Files, we appear to witness a 'Golden Age of global muckraking'. While cross-border collaborations among journalists are not new, data technologies have dramatically increased their scale and degree of collaboration. Transnational collaborations among journalists are increasingly data-driven operations specialized on facilitating the analysis of huge leaks. In a more dynamic media environment, where traditional identities and routines of journalism are being challenged, data-driven transnational networks help to articulate global standards of investigative journalism and shape journalism's ability to tackle issues in an increasingly globalized and interdependent world.&#x0D;\nThis paper shows how data-driven journalism networks today are shaped by the ways in which journalists normalized leaking in technological, organizational, and cultural ways since Wikileaks’ publication of the Afghan war logs. The result has been a) the establishment – or evolution – of national and transnational structures that facilitate collaborations; and b) that the concept of ‘leaking’ was moved away from radical transparency advocacy, and into traditional journalistic ethics and identities. The subsequent normalization of leaking is relevant beyond leaking itself, as it more broadly shapes practices around ‘data-driven cross-border collaboration’. This means that the practices, organizational structures and technologies developed around leaking also shape collaborative data collection or data sharing projects. To examine the future of journalism in a more globalized and datafied world, I will conclude with suggesting that media and journalism studies needs to rely more on theories and methodological frameworks that do justice to journalism’s increasingly transcultural nature.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>It is widely accepted that different online social media platforms produce different modes of communication, however the ways in which these modalities are shaped by the constraints of a particular platform remain difficult to quantify. On 7 November 2017 Twitter doubled the character limit for users to 280 characters, presenting a unique opportunity to study the response of this population to an exogenous change to the communication medium. Here we analyse a large dataset comprising 387 million English-language tweets (10% of all public tweets) collected over the September 2017--January 2018 period to quantify and explain large-scale changes in individual behaviour and communication patterns precipitated by the character-length change. Using statistical and natural language processing techniques we find that linguistic complexity increased after the change, with individuals writing at a significantly higher reading level. However, we find that some textual properties such as statistical language distribution remain invariant across the change, and are no different to writings in different online media. By fitting a generative mathematical model to the data we find a surprisingly slow response of the Twitter population to this exogenous change, with a substantial number of users taking a number of weeks to adjust to the new medium. In the talk we describe the model and Bayesian parameter estimation techniques used to make these inferences. Furthermore, we argue for mathematical models as an alternative exploratory methodology for \"Big\" social media datasets, empowering the researcher to make inferences about the human behavioural processes which underlie large-scale patterns and trends.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Fitness trackers are an increasingly popular tool for tracking health and physical activity. Their benefits hinge on ubiquitous data collection and the algorithmic processing of personal fitness information (PFI). While PFI can reveal novel insights about users’ physical activity, health, and personal habits, it also contains potentially sensitive information that third parties may access in contexts unanticipated by fitness tracker users. This paper argues while many users attempt to manage their PFI with privacy boundaries, they can also succumb to “information flow solipsism,” or being broadly unaware of how fitness tracker companies might collect and aggregate their PFI. Our mixed-methods approach involved a survey and semi-structured interviews. Most survey respondents had limited knowledge of companies’ data tracking and retention policies. Additionally, most interviewees expressed only minimal privacy concerns regarding PFI. While others recognized PFI may need boundaries to manage information flows, they did not find the information sensitive enough to require personal responsibility for the definition of such boundaries. Viewing these results through Communication Privacy Management theory, users’ conceptualizations of ownership, privacy rules, and turbulence regarding their PFI influence how they manage privacy boundaries. Inherent trust of fitness tracker companies also led users to assume privacy rules properly limit the flow of PFI. This combination suggests fitness tracker users are potentially in a state of information flow solipsism, a position of ignorance of how PFI flows across devices and platforms that creates unanticipated privacy risks.</jats:p>",

In response social media companies have become more active in regulating and banning particular users and channels.&#x0D;\nThrough the use of affordances theory, this paper examines one example of the regulation of content on a social media site, the revamp of the quarantining function on Reddit in late 2018. Quarantines are designed to halt participation within and growth of subreddits without banning them outright.&#x0D;\nThe paper uses quantitative and qualitative data to examine the consequences of this revamp on two subreddits, r/Braincels and r/TheRedPill. Through studying activity levels on these subreddits the paper argues that quarantines did limit discussion within these subreddits. However, it also argues that the revamp had unintended consequences, in particular a growth in distrust between subreddit users and Reddit as a site, and a shift of users away from Reddit to less regulated sites.&#x0D;\nThe paper argues that quarantining shifted the affordances of Reddit, in this instance resulting in greater discouragement of activity on particular subreddits. Using the mechanisms and conditions framework (Davis and Chouinard, 2016) the paper however argues that users adapted to and circumvented this discouragement to continue engaging in particular behavior.&#x0D;\nWhile quarantining had short term benefits, using an affordances framework this paper argues it had unintended consequences, ones which can result in a continued radicalization of actions and beliefs, furthering distrust in the online sphere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The internet offers the possibility of forming de-institutionalized, organizational structures that engage in the democratic process in ways that go far beyond volunteering, protesting, or voting. The digital space enables people to collaborate and communicate with one another more effectively, even if they have never met in real life (Shirky 2009). Formations such as Telecomix and Project PM show that this capability can be harnessed in the service of meaningful collective political and social actions. Journalist and activist Barrett Brown's latest venture, $2 , hopes to further that potential. Pursuance looks to empower political actors via \"process democracy\" (Brown 2018), offering participants a platform in which they can organize, build, and act on social justice endeavors. Pursuance is important because it provides a means for individuals to rapidly and effectively assemble, disassemble, and reassemble into mission-driven teams. This lessens the need for stable institutions to direct civic or political activism, thus reducing the problems that often follow, e.g. the Iron Law of Oligarchy (Michels 2015). We explore the potential of Brown's endeavor, asking: How can Pursuance most effectively further the practice of deinstitutionalized democracy? What can be learned from past groups that have engaged in the kind of activity Pursuance aims to facilitate?</jats:p>",

The topics in this panel span agriculture and environmentalism, gender and sexuality, collective identity and culture, memory and data migration, and relational development with social robots. The panel discusses ways in which technology serves as solutions to and causes of new transnational challenges for networked publics, as well as ways technology is supplanting what has historically been referred to as the “natural.” The goal of this panel is to demonstrate the diverse applications of robotics, as well as foster an open-mindset for reconceptualizing humanity in a post-human world. Specific panel presentations discuss: - Honeybee colony collapse in agriculture and artificial pollinators known as Robobees. - Industry recommendations for the development of ethical and successful caretaking robots for aging populations based on interpersonal communication scholarship. - Asymmetrical relationships and ethical implications of elevating sexbots to human status from the theoretical perspective of Rousseau’s natural self. - Digital interlocutors as scripted-selves that co-produce and standardize cultural norms. - Transference of human memory to cloud-based memory through voice commands as the foundation for algorithmic future-thinking. These research topics identify the importance and relevance of scholarship in the area of HMC and advocate for their inclusion in the conceptualization, prototyping, and creation of robotic and AI technologies. This panel offers an opportunity to engage in a necessary, provocative, and timely discussion about HMC and the role of critical scholarship in shaping technologies of the future.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we predict hateful content as well as quantify the causal link between anonymity and hateful content in political discussions online. First, we make use of a supervised machine-learning model to find a prediction model of cyberhate in political discussions on a dominating Swedish Internet forum, Flashback. Second, we investigate how changes in anonymity affect the writing of hateful content. We scrape text from the political discussions on Flashback and let a research assistant manually classify each post from a random subset of the threads by whether it contained, e.g. hateful writings, aggressive writings as well as towards whom the hate is directed. We use the classified data to find a prediction model in the full set of threads. We then use the predictions of hate to estimate the effect of changes in anonymity on cyberhate. An event suddenly changed the anonymity at the discussion forum. The event affected only a certain type of user, creating a quasi-experiment, with early-registered users as a treatment group and late-registered users as a control group. We find a prediction model of hateful content. Using these predictions in the quasi-experimental estimation, we find that early users of the forum decreased their share of hateful content more than later registered users did after the event when there was a threat of less anonymity. We also show that this behavioural change is a combination of individuals’ changing how they express themselves and that they reduce their writing or stop entirely.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PUBLIC SPEECH: LISTENING TO WOMEN IN THE VIDEOGAME INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the 1990s, conversations about the dearth of women working in the video game industry have centered on three topics: 1) ways to draw more women into the field, 2) the experiences of women working in the industry, and 3) the experiences of those who once worked in the industry but left (Cassell &amp; Jenkins, 1998; Hepler, 2017; Kafai, Heeter, Denner &amp; Sun, 2008). While there has been considerable research on the conditions and occupational identities of video game developers, less scholarly attention has been devoted to women in games work, the barriers/obstacles and challenges/opportunities they face, or how they talk about their experiences. Our study looked to see who among the group of women who work in the games industry has already invested her time and energy to tell a public story, whether that is in a blog posting, a book chapter, a televised talk, a radio interview, or other public media, thereby building the foundations of the study by focusing on that sub-group. This paper offers a feminist methodological approach that demonstrates how discourse focused on affect can be re-read as intimately related to silences about power, and how the rhetorical constraints that public speech imposes upon what can be said about “women in games” aids us in understanding what might remain unspoken, and why.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research considers the Cambrian explosion (Nelms, Maurer, Swartz, &amp; Mainwaring, 2017) of mobile and social payment technologies from a perspective that integrates classical theorizing on money and payments (Mauss, 2002; Simmel, 2005) and more recent work (Bandelj, Wherry, &amp; Zelizer, 2017; Dodd, 2014; Maurer, 2015; Zelizer, 2017), as well as research coming out of the $2 and $2 at the $2 at Amsterdam. The paper negotiates mobile and social payment apps and the social realities that they stand upon and applies theoretical viewpoints from these key authors to the emerging technologies, based on a contemporary investigation of what 'social' entails in social payment spaces. The empirical core of this work-in-progress employs the walkthrough method (Light et al., 2016), and compares select mobile and social payment platforms. Furthermore, researchers content-analyze app store screenshots, as well as app descriptions and user comments. Preliminary analysis maps these apps on a continuum of sociality/publicness, with Venmo and its social feed on the liberal side of the spectrum, apps that integrate into messenger services in the middle (e.g. Apple Pay Cash, Square Cash, Google Pay), and apps borne out of banking (Zelle) on the conservative side. Criteria for analysis follow conceptual categories from the literature, such as visibility, objectivity, freedom from everything personal, gifting, earmarking capacities, and other features.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the years that have passed since the social media powered protest movement of 2011-2012, the Russian government has dramatically expanded its restrictions on the Internet, while simultaneously consolidating its grip on traditional media. The Internet, which long provided a space for alternative media and free speech to blossom, is becoming increasingly restricted by a growing corpus of legislation and expanding state surveillance. With legally ill-defined prohibitions on, e.g., offending the feelings of religious believers, propagating 'non-traditional family values' and disseminating 'extremism' in place, online freedom of speech in Russia is at threat. Meanwhile, the Russian state continues to refine its skills in covertly manipulating online discourses, as it has quite successfully practiced it since the 2000s. Yet, because of its transnational configuration, the Internet continues to evade comprehensive state control and offers ever new opportunities for disseminating and consuming dissenting opinions. Developments over the past year, including the series of anti-corruption mass protests organised by opposition leader Aleksei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, have demonstrated how online challenges to the status-quo are still able to gather momentum and create 'real world' political turbulence. The panel presents a multifaceted investigation of how the Russian-language segment of the Internet, often dubbed Runet, is shaped by and gives shape to online politics and activism. How should we understand the particular complexities of these contestations between an increasingly authoritarian state and its citizens? How are these processes facilitated or hampered by the infrastructural conditions created by national and global media industries and internet companies?</jats:p>",

Each paper will take one or two key concepts from the original book, including Empire, multitude, ideology, and cognitive capitalism, and apply them to the contemporary moment in the games sector. Our aim is to explore the strengths and limitations of these concepts, as well as identify the salient ways in which the sector has evolved over the last ten years. For example, we will examine efforts at unionisation in the sector; how gender and race have emerged as key concerns in the last few years in sites of game work; how apps are affecting the representation of capitalist and military systems; and how ‘multitude’ in the sector has assumed new forms in the wake of new distribution platforms. The panel will make a case for integrating social theory with the analysis of production cultures and textual practices, as well as situating the analysis of games within the field of new media and internet studies more broadly.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Decision making machines are today ‘trusted’ to perform or assist with a rapidly expanding array of tasks. Indeed, many contemporary industries could not now function without them. Nevertheless, this trust in and reliance upon digital automation is far from unproblematic. This paper combines insights drawn from qualitative research with creative industries professionals, with approaches derived from software studies and media archaeology to critically interrogate three ways that digital automation is currently employed and accompanying questions that relate to trust. Firstly, digital automation is examined as a way of saving time and/or reducing human labor, such as when programmers use automated build tools or graphical user interfaces. Secondly, automation enables new types of behavior by operating at more-than-human speeds, as exemplified by high-frequency trading algorithms. Finally, the mode of digital automation associated with machine learning attempts to both predict and influence human behaviors, as epitomized by personalization algorithms within social media and search engines.&#x0D;\nWhile creative machines are increasingly trusted to underpin industries, culture and society, we should at least query the desirability of increasing dependence on these technologies as they are currently employed. These for-profit, corporate-controlled tools performatively reproduce a neoliberal worldview. Discussing misplaced trust in digital automation frequently conjures an imagined binary opposition between humans and machines, however, this reductive fantasy conceals the far more concrete conflict between differing technocultural assemblages composed of humans and machines. Across the examples explored in this talk, what emerges are numerous ways in which creative machines are used to perpetuate social inequalities.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital and social media has become deeply intertwined into children’s mundane daily routines. Considered to be digital natives, young people are often assumed to be experts in using digital and social media. As they are indeed enthusiastic users of new devices and social media platforms, children might be quick in picking up on platform’s features and affordances. However, their ability for a strategic understanding of risks and opportunities is often questioned. Parental anxiety about children’s engagement with digital and social media stems from their lack of confidence in children’s ability to navigate online risk. While academic research attempted to identify and measure digital skills, less is known how these skills are negotiated in the family.&#x0D;\nDrawing on separate home-based interviews with children and parents, this paper looks at the approaches parents use to govern children’s digital and social media use. It discusses how confidence in children’s abilities – or varying degrees of it – affects the parental approach and success in working with their children on developing safe digital practices. Three dominant parental approaches identified across the sample are practices where parents act as *watchdog*, *chaperon* and/or *collaborator*. Central to each of these approaches are varying degrees of trust in children’s ability to engage in safe practices online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In October 2017, millions of people reflected on their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment, publicly sharing their testimonials in an expression of global vulnerability using the hashtag #MeToo. Many of the tweets portrayed the angst and distress individuals experienced in their decision to participate, indicating the psychological costs of engaging with #MeToo. Further, some tweets expressed frustration at the re-appropriated nature of the campaign and the collective feeling of an “intersectional betrayal” by white women and feminists who dominated the mainstream media reporting of the movement. This research foregrounds the intersectional concerns that result from the scale and reach of the millions of testimonials suspended online that constitute the #MeToo movement. It highlights how the many stories that have circulated the online sphere obscure the absence and recognition of marginalised women and those who are already more vulnerable in regards to experiencing sexual assault. The paper adopts an intersectional framework, as conceptualised by Crenshaw (1991), to further an understanding of how race, class, and gender collide and how subordination can be reproduced within feminist protests. Drawing on a large data set of tweets, this research combines content, discourse and social network analysis to examine the narratives related to participation. The paper highlights the experiences and reflections of users who self-identified as queer, disabled, or a person of colour within their tweets. A social network analysis is also used to visualise a snapshot of the affective publics that arose at the beginning and to illustrate how systems of oppression converge.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital technology is becoming increasingly enmeshed in the everyday practices of cooking and eating (see Lewis 2018; Kirkwood 2018). In negotiating the increasingly complex web of culinary information online users need to remain vigilant about the voices and perspectives they turn to for food and nutrition advice.&#x0D;\nIn examining which online sources are trustworthy, this paper adds to the scholarship that highlights how the growing industrialisation of food negatively impacted food literacy (Pollan 2006; Vileisis 2008). In relation to digital food media, Lewis (2018, 214) argues that “food citizens increasingly require a critical media literacy…”. This is important considering that consumers are more likely to turn to the media than nutrition professionals for advice (Contois and Day 2018, 16).&#x0D;\nThis paper builds on Lewis’ (2018) calls for greater critical media literacy Through textual analysis of online news and popular commentary, this paper examines the two Australian case studies of Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans and fraudulent wellness advocate Belle Gibson. These examples highlight risks associated with online culinary information and provide contrasting perspectives on credibility and trustworthiness. Evans leverages mainstream media exposure and experience as a chef to establish credibility for his online channels where he explores his alternative culinary views more extensively. Gibson’s reputation meanwhile was established through achieving grassroots fame online for supposedly beating cancer through shunning conventional treatments. Understanding how trustworthiness or authority is established and negotiated, and particularly how these characteristics work between legacy and online media are important in developing critical media literacy around food.</jats:p>",

However, currently literature in older Chinese people’s media consumption mainly focuses on experience and processes within China few have paid attention to surging number of older Chinese who are ageing in a transnational context. Through analysing data collected from eight focused group (12 people each) conducted at a Chinese restaurant in Brisbane, Australia, and examining OCM participants’ WeChat use,it is found that WeChat not only facilitates the formation of an older Chinese social space in Australia but the platform has acted as a self- and mutual-reliance mechanism for OCMs to negotiate and make sense of their biological change of ageing and biographic change of transnational migration.</jats:p>",

Looking at the esports bar spectatorship experience, we describe how attendance substantiates and supports fans’ relationship with their fandom and with other fans. We draw on existing literature about esports experiences, practices of offline gaming hobbyists, and sports and media tourism, to show that shared time and place, attendance, and their contribution to an individual’s gaming capital (Consalvo, 2007; Walsh &amp; Apperley, 2009) are important elements of this situated hinterland.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is an urgent need for the currently mostly disparate and quantitative research on traditional or cyberbullying, to not only take note of each other, but also to analyse the interdependences, intersections and conflation of bullying in digital and offline spaces in a more comprehensive manner. More recent conceptualisations of ‘space’ offer valuable contributions to a reflection upon the epistemological and related methodological considerations when seeking to understand the lifeworlds, practices and experiences of young people involved in bullying. In this sense, we have recently advanced the concept of “cON/FFlating situational spaces and places” (Bork-Hüffer and Yeoh 2017: 93) in an attempt to integrate existing algorithmic, (post-)feminist and relational perspectives to the analysis of bullying (cf. Bork-Hüffer et al. 2020). We ask: Whether and how does bullying in physical and digital spaces intersect in school contexts? We applied narratives produced by young people themselves in Austria with the objective to let them speak with their own voice when describing their experiences and involvement with (cyber)bullying. Even when bullying practices themselves seemed to be restricted to digital spaces, they are still entangled within the spatialities of participants’ relations, practices, identities and life-worlds that stretch across inseparable socio-material and technological spheres. The results reflect how the ontogenesis of socio-technological developments shapes the opportunities for, types of, frequencies and harshness of bullying attacks.</jats:p>",

It argues that the auto industry and its managerial analysts play crucial roles in the development of platform theory and platform capitalism. While analyses of platform capitalism have tended to focus on the digital economy, this paper article highlights the continuities between digital platform capitalism and the manufacturing paradigms of the automobile industry, and the Toyota Production System as it developed in the 1960s in particular. This includes attention to the Japanese and American managerial theorizations of automobile manufacture that are the heartlands of platform capitalism. This genealogy impacts how we periodize the platform capitalism, and where we locate the emergence of platform theory. Ultimately it makes a case for thinking through the continuities of today’s digital platform capitalism and the commercial internet with what this talk will term automobile platform capitalism.</jats:p>",

In the context of internet studies, professional wrestling raises additional questions: How do performers use social media to maintain relationships with fans?

In this extended abstract, I present key concepts and guiding research questions for an investigation of fan culture and gender norms.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As individuals trade information to access social media products and services, privacy has become increasingly valuable. Elite discourses have tended to frame privacy in terms of its vertical or institutional dimensions, but much less attention has been given to how users individually interpret and make sense of this complex notion. How do privacy sense-making processes intersect with privacy concerns and self-efficacy? What happens to these outcomes when an individual’s ideas about privacy collide with framing by an authoritative source? This project poses a 2x2 survey-based experiment with 628 subjects to explore these questions. We examine differences in privacy concerns and self-efficacy resulting from an individual’s own conceptualization of privacy, as well as from the presentation of similar and alternative framing of the concept. Preliminary results indicate that while individual conceptualizations show no differences in outcomes, higher levels of privacy self-efficacy result from the framing of privacy in horizontal terms and lower levels of privacy concern result when framing is consistent with the individual’s conceptualization. Strategic and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet and social media use can be both beneficial and harmful for vulnerable youth, offering support and increased self-knowledge, but also exposure to adverse content. Research on the critical question of what makes a difference between the digital pathways to wellbeing or harm is minimal. However, there is some indication that how adolescents engage with the internet and its particular digital affordances makes a difference to their wellbeing outcomes. In this paper, we offer insights into the role of different dimensions of digital engagement in aiding or worsening internet-related mental health difficulties. We report on findings from cross-national comparative qualitative research with 62 adolescents aged 12 to 22 years old from Norway and the UK who experience internet-related mental health difficulties.\n\nFindings show that young people actively engage with the digital world both by utilising its affordances but also shaping its parameters, sometimes going against the grain of what was envisioned by design. The adolescents we spoke to were generally skilled internet users, but sophisticated skills do not necessarily make for better mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Independent of digital skill, affordances may result in even riskier online engagement shaped by the operation of algorithms. At times this can breach young people’s abilities to counteract and cope with detrimental consequences. In many cases, we find that the algorithms are “out of sync” with adolescents’ state of mind and ability to cope, exacerbating their mental health difficulties. We conclude with reflections on the implications for platform design and therapeutic support.</jats:p>",

This detailed account of exploitation enables us to see more clearly the contours and causes of the moral and epistemic injustice involved in CCM, and helps us understand precisely why these forms of exploitation are unjust.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, colonizing the neighborhood is more accessible to the everyday individual than ever before with the widespread accessibility and popularity of hyper-local digital platforms like Nextdoor. Our project investigates how individuals use these platforms to better understand how their colonial practices are reshaped and perpetuated in the era of the networked smart home. Through a content analysis of user-generated posts in West Philadelphia, we find that users rarely engage with explicitly racist language or topics. Rather than interpret this finding as an indication that Nextdoor users are not racist, or that the platform’s content moderation strategies prevent racism, we argue that users, instead, rely on postracial practices to simultaneously normalize and obscure anti-Blackness. Drawing from Mukherjee et al.’s (2019) concept of “postrace,” we find that users commonly engage in three practices. First, users increasingly shifted away from explicit racial identifiers to more general \"race-neutral\" goals of safety and community. Second, users shied away from using problematic but non-explicit racialized language (e.g., \"thugs\"), opting to embed their racializing opinions in broader “policy” discussions. Third, even with increased attention on the harms of surveillance technologies on people of color, discussions around monitoring remained relatively consistent. These themes reflect postracial racism as yet another iteration of colonization in the neighborhood, entrenching essentializing tactics, perpetuating carceral logics, and developing and perfecting surveillance through the site of Blackness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms had for a long time successfully positioned themselves in the “sweet spot” between beneficial legislative protections and a remarkable absence of obligations (Gillespie 2010: 348), yielding little need to take direct responsibility for the content of users. Increasingly, and specifically since 2016, public and policy pressure has pushed platforms to become something different: not the allegedly neutral tech companies, but powerful intermediaries responsible for the functioning of public discourse and democracy. Platforms have struggled to develop their positions and processes for handling contested and delicate issues such as hate speech and misinformation, and the (at times unwritten) policies are still changing regularly. The panel examines four interrelated aspects of platform policies, including (1) the complexification and commodification of copyright content moderation, (2) platform verification processes and policies to classify some users, things, and places as ‘official,’ or ‘authentic’, (3) the relationship between human reviewers and AI in the enforcement of content moderation policies, and (4) the dilemma platforms face when turning to human rights as a standard for their platform policies. Taken together, the papers of this panel analyze crucial power dynamics and inequalities embedded within and extending beyond platform policies. For this, the panel convenes a productive multidisciplinary conversation and methodological exchange. This examination of the social, political, legal and economic underpinnings of recent changes in platform policies from a global perspective will allow us to better understand the ability of platforms to “re-fashion the world in their image” and to foster change.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Following the infrastructural turn in media studies with its focus on the material and social practices, this paper offers to reexamine contemporary data colonialism by empirically exploring some of its most crucial infrastructural artifacts – data centers. Particularly, this paper explores six data centers currently built in Israel as part of \"Project Nimbus\" – a $1.2 billion tender offered by the Israeli government to move its computational infrastructure \"to the cloud\". The tender was won by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, and has drawn considerable attention, both due to its high-cost and technical complexity; and due to attempts by these companies' workers to curtail the tech giants' involvement in Israel/Palestine on moral grounds. Power differentials are also present within the Israeli society, as intimate governmental data will be processed and stored by foreign US companies.\n\nBased on thematic analysis of local journalistic sources, public officials’ documents, local planning authorities and the tender winners themselves, we delineate the concrete materialization of this cloud infrastructure. We show that the notion of data colonialism is complicated within project Nimbus, when lines blur in terms of whose data is colonized by whom, whose lands are used (and colonized) by these centers, and whose resources (predominantly electricity and water) will be used for their functioning. Thus, this paper offers a more granular understanding of data colonialism, and of the different actors and stakeholders involved in the creation and sustainment of this emerging global regime.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a key technology in contemporary societies with high amounts of resources being dedicated globally to its development. Simultaneously, AI technology has been at the center of public debate considering its societal impact. Social Media Platforms (SMPs) play a crucial role in providing a space for public debates but also partake in public discourses on various levels. Understanding social media’s power in informing, shaping, and stirring these debates as stakeholders as well as providing a public arena is crucial, especially in light of their global reach and position. While traditional media’s role is often questioned for framing public debates and resulting imaginaries, this paper is questioning what multiple roles SMPs play in shaping users and, hence, public(s) imaginaries of AI? The research design focuses on YouTube as a case study conceptualizing the platform as a multi-sided stakeholder. The operationalization is based on a mixed-method approach, considering four streams of data to analyze YouTube as an AI innovator, technological implementer, media representative, as well as a political mediator. The mixed-methods approach draws on a combination of document analysis, platform analysis as well as content analysis of YouTube content. This brings forth the ongoing negotiation between platform, creator, and users to question the multifaceted role SMPs play in shaping imaginaries of AI. The analysis showed that YouTube acts as a multisided stakeholder and is shaping users’ imaginaries of AI from various angles depending on the intended audience of the public communication, created content, or applied technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years a growing number of Finnish social media influencers have started to discuss political questions and even actors known for light lifestyle content have become vocal about social justice issues. In this paper, we explore how popular Finnish influencers experience the new expectations set for them and how they handle the mixture of intimate and algorithmic logics of Instagram. Our analysis draws from online observations of a wide range of lifestyle influencers and eight semi-structured, in-depth interviews with influencers and influencer agency representatives. Theoretically, we use Lauren Berlant’s (2008) analysis of ‘intimate publics’ to examine Instagram as a platform for vague intimacy, where feelings and commercial exchange flourish and circulate in proximity to the political.\n\nOur investigation into influencers’ experiences of politicised Instagram through the concept of vague intimacy reveals the complex interplay of authenticity, politics, values, commercialised exchange, intimacy and feelings. Our study shows that influencers’ social media engagement comprises mixed feelings and ambiguity as they struggle to manage their visibility and meet followers’ expectations. Their politically oriented content on Instagram intertwines with their everyday lives but not without a cost: their inboxes overflow with DMs from followers seeking meaningful discussion. Although influencers seek to make politics look easy and engage in meaningful conversations with their followers, balancing between inclusive politics, commercial visibility and protecting one’s own boundaries is hard work.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel analyzes the textual and audiovisual discourses in which big tech companies envision social spaces and their platforms’ roles in relation to those spaces. The panel asks: What are the visions of human life and technology that big tech companies narrate in relation to public and social spaces? And how do these tech-generated visions compare to current insights in and critiques of how these companies intervene in and disrupt social spaces? Situated within the field of critical platform studies, the panel’s premise is that the discourses produced by tech companies form an integral part of these companies’ interventions in people’s relations with themselves, others, and their environments. In order to develop a critical understanding of the platform society, it is crucial to examine those discourses through which tech companies present themselves almost as state-like powers that can be trusted with “public” services. Employing methods of textual and visual analysis, this panel offers such perspective. In its analysis of big tech’s spatial visions, the panel moves between different scales of spaces (domestic, educational, urban, extraterrestrial). In relation to these spaces, the panel articulates a discrepancy between the visions of life produced by tech companies and big tech’s invasive, perhaps even extractivist and colonial logic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online sexual abuse and violence have become an urgent global problem for women and girls, and in particular for poor women, women of colour and LGBTQ women (Ging and Siapera, 2019). Online sexual harassment and abuse is an especially urgent issue for young people, for whom digital spaces are key sites of communication, identity formation, self-expression and sexual interaction. The toxic dynamics that frequently underpin these complex entanglements thus pose a significant threat to ethical digital intimacy. This situation became substantially more extreme during COVID-19, with rates of online abuse and harassment rising as young people have been forced to spend more and more time online. During this period, usage of particular platforms (e.g. TikTok) dramatically increased. A substantial rise in screen time also impacted young people’s experiences and digital intimacies in important ways.\n\nThis paper reports on the findings of a cross-national study conducted in England and Ireland, which explored pedagogical interventions into the continuum of online and offline sexual violence amongst young people in schools. In particular, we are interested in how different social media platforms are used to perpetuate different types of online abuse based on certain technological affordances, such as Snapchat quick adds, shout outs and streaks, and Instagram direct message and group chat features. We make a number of concrete recommendations, pointing in particular to urgent paradigm shifts in digital ethics and digital safety initiatives, with a particular focus on platform algorithims, policies and governance.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, they did so mistrusting the electoral process and believing that Donald Trump had been robbed of the presidency. Presidential rhetoric has the power to shape the attitudes of the public and steer the country (Mercieca, 2020). Indeed, presidential rhetoric has the power to shape what Taylor (2004) describes as the social imaginary – the rhetorical construction of a version of a shared reality that takes hold in public discourse and public consciousness. Trump’s rhetoric in 2020 around the vote continued a narrative that he had started when he took office. In this study, using the framework of social imaginaries, we qualitatively and inductively analyze messaging on campaign social media accounts around the 2020 presidential campaign. We also examine the Facebook advertisements and the targets of those ads specifically around the vote. We compare Trump’s rhetoric to that of his opponent Joe Biden to contrast the distinct imaginaries around the vote each political candidate articulated. We find that Trump relied on his social media accounts to sow distrust of the vote process and doubt about the accuracy of the vote count on Election Day. More concerning, we also find that Trump attacked the voting process through his paid advertising on Facebook, targeting voters in key battleground states.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Affordances are central to consider how sociality and technology intertwine. However, while this entanglement propelled the popularity of the term, it also persistently connected the social and the technical. It is argued how considering affordances as eminently social opens up analytical possibilities to consider cultural, individual, and social contexts, and how these in turn can affect social action in digital environments. This means considering affordances as intersubjective and co-constructed, and posing them in relation to sociological tenets such as that of the social situation.\n\nThrough 26 interviews with a variety of Reddit users, results suggest how affordances are understood and employed relationally to navigate complex social contexts, to infer dominant social norms and cultural codes and, once internalized, are deployed to sanction deviations or promote compliance to them. It is shown how the concepts of affordances and social situations can be fruitfully employed as an entry point into the cultural and social dynamics of groups and digital environments. Contextually, it challenges the idea of the social situation as a sociological concept rooted in physical interaction.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When it comes to the study of internet phenomena, the visual constitutes a privileged mode of analysis, as seen by the ample and storied scholarship on visual media dn visually based methods. In order to disrupt this “hegemony of the visual,” and explore alternate ways of knowing and being online, this panel bring internet studies scholarship into meaningful dialogue with sound studies scholarship and poses the provocation: “how can sound be used methodologically in order to expand and deepen our understanding of the internet?” This topic is addressed in a variety of ways by the contributing authors. The first paper of this panel introduces the concept of deep listening as a feminist analytical method for “tuning-in” to the persistent hegemonic structures that underly digitally mapping technology. The second paper presents the concept of “the sonic interface” as a means to examine how sound mediates our everyday interactions with the internet. The third paper proposes the use of participatory arts based methods as a reflexive and critical framework through which researchers can begin to “listen” to alternative internet narratives while centering the voices of communities rather than researchers. The final paper deploys sound as a method for studying social behaviour on TikTok, and demonstrates the widespread applicability of sonic methods in the wider study of internet phenomena. All in all, this panel aims to highlight the immensely generative potential of centring sound in our interrogations of the online and the digital.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I respond to debates on the addictive and distractive\n        quality associated with algorithmic environments like the popular short-video app TikTok.\n        TikTok has frequently been discussed for its addictive nature. Many commentators and critics\n        rendering the app as emblematic for the ways in which digital media as such distract their\n        users from more meaningful and profound experiences. Contrasting such commentary, I draw on\n        a one and half year long ethnographic investigation of TikTok. Doing so, I outline how young\n        adult users of the app appropriated the TikTok algorithm's addictive quality in their search\n        for distraction and escape in everyday life and during the pandemic. Teasing out\n        similarities with prior media forms, like soap operas or magazines, offering similar sites\n        of escape in daily life, I discuss how the sense of getting carried away on TikTok was\n        constructed by users in interaction with the app's algorithm. Finally, I will conclude by\n        arguing that independence, in the context of algorithms and their emotional consequences,\n        comes to matter not in absolute but relative terms. While for my participants ‘mindless\n        scrolling’ through TikTok induced pleasure, the same practice, on other platforms, like\n        Instagram, induced boredom. These subtle differences within the landscape of ‘addictive\n        media’ are often overlooked within debates and the question how they come into being require\n        more attention.</jats:p>",

How do they describe digital stress, is it different from other forms of stress and how does digital stress express itself? The focus is not genuinely on the topic of digital stress, but on the attempt to make this phenomenon empirically tangible and to link it to concepts of digital wellbeing. If everyday discourses are primarily concerned with new possibilities or negative implications associated with the use of digital technologies and media, we would like to turn to a more holistic perspective which builds on subjective perceptions as well as practices. This ensures not only that the ambivalent potential of digital media is taken into account, but also that the media repertoire of the users is considered in its full complexity</jats:p>",

The insights gathered from this inquiry unveil a thoughtful approach adopted by these individuals, strategically accentuating their roles as fathers while also elucidating their priorities, logistical considerations, and compatibility criteria. By shedding light on these details, this study serves as a crucial exploration into the complexities that confront modern single parents navigating the terrain of dating apps.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital political visualizations often highlight an inherent conflict between visualization practitioner heuristics and standards, which are geared towards leading audiences to a ‘correct’ reading, and the use of “strategic ambiguity” (Eisenberg, 1984) to increase political appeal. While excellence in creation and interpretation of visualization is studied and theorized primarily with the visualization’s attributes in mind, the ubiquity of digital political visualizations as a rhetorical genre brings forth a host of audience-side considerations and decoding processes so far neglected by scholars. Thus, this paper amalgamates perspectives onto visualization as a communicative technology, a rhetorical genre, and a persuasion-tool by exploring the relationship between graphical excellence, audience’s graphical literacy, and the ensuing polysemy in personal/group readings of digital political visualizations. Asking: How do audiences decode political messages embedded in visualizations shared online? We conducted a bi-national focus-group study (8 groups, 67 participants), in which participants conduct group- and individual- decoding of digital political visualization stimuli. We find that all stimuli, regardless of design heuristics and/or topic, resulted in starkly polysemic readings, with participants’ attitudes ranging between graphical avoidance, and calls for ‘interpretive freedom,’ suggesting that the epitome of literacy is the ability to see beyond the intended meaning and assert one’s own interpretation according to their worldviews. We thus suggest is it imperative to view digital political visualizations’ reception as a result of both visualizers’ choices and audience’s individual/collective interpretive freedom, striving for ‘graphical excellence’ as a shared pursuit of both audiences and visualizers, aimed to bring forth more benign digital deliberation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data scraping practices have recently come under scrutiny, as datasets scraped from the web’s social spaces are the basis of new generative AI tools like Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. These practices of scrapers and crawlers are based on the conception of the internet as a mountain of data that’s sitting, waiting, available to be acted upon, extracted and put to use. In this paper, we examine the robots.txt exclusion protocol which has been used to govern the behavior of crawlers and is often taken as a proxy for consent in widespread data scraping and web archiving. By addressing the underlying assumptions of the protocol, we aim to counter a recent narrative that “the basic social contract of the web is falling apart” (Pierce, 2024), and instead argue that data extractive infrastructures have always been at work over the past 30 years of the web. Positioning this work within the field of critical data studies, we aim to find new ways for web archives and modes of collection to become unbound from the “capitalist logics of data extraction” upon which they’re currently built (Theilen et al., 2021).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past five years, the music industry and streaming giants have embraced the success of Latin, Korean and Afrobeats music and heavily promoted their multicultural expertise and international expansion (Spotify 2021a, 2018b; Dredge 2022). However, despite academic efforts to understand streaming classification and recommendation (Seaver 2022; Maasø &amp; Spilker 2022; Hesmondhalgh et al. 2023) it is still unclear which musical taxonomies are used by music streaming platforms. The publication of the DCMS report (2023) in the UK has brought to the fore the importance of understanding streaming software infrastructures, including how music is organised by platforms, and how recommendations and curation are automated. What kind of cultural visions, understandings, and taxonomies of music are currently hardwired into recommender systems? This paper analyses the taxonomies and the metadata standards used to code music catalogue into streaming services to argue that the current industry practices do not contribute to the international vision promoted. Using a mixed methods approach, this paper combines interface analysis of music streaming platforms, discourse analysis over PR industry materials and ethnographic fieldwork at industry conferences, and interviews with industry, public, and start-up stakeholders. In doing so, it contrasts the disparity between industry emphasis on automation, expertise and internationalisation with practices that reveal Western-centric, incoherent and error-prone approaches to catalogue. Following a postcolonial cultural economy framework (Saha 2021), I show how these underdeveloped software infrastructures contribute to the making and reproduction of culture and race, and more widely how they impact music cultures worldwide.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The internet has transformed the dissemination and reception of scientific information, creating unique opportunities and challenges for public science. This panel explores the impact of digitally mediated communication on public perceptions of science, focusing on the proliferation of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and science politicization in online spaces. Drawing from diverse disciplinary perspectives, including communication, information science, and history, our panelists describe how various aspects of the digital influence public (mis)understandings of science.\n\nFirst, they discuss the epistemological nuances of preprint servers, retracted articles, and clickbait journalism, highlighting the need for a framework of scientific and digital literacy. They then explore how intermediaries like Wikipedia and social media facilitate scientific controversies, from Y2K to 5G, that circulate within scientific publics and counterpublics. Finally, they consider the challenges of using retractions to correct flawed science in an environment characterized by politicized scientific distrust. By elucidating these digital dynamics, the panel aims to inform the larger discussion of the public relevance of reliable scientific information in the face of politicized attacks on science.</jats:p>",

    "title": "EXPLORING APPIFICATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel offers a reflection on the evolution and transformations of apps and app studies over the past decade, emphasizing how apps have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines and shaped our cultural and economic landscape. This process, known as ‘appification’, involves integrating various aspects of daily life and activities into mobile applications, fundamentally altering how we communicate, access information, make payments, and use digital services (Dieter et al., 2019; Goggin, 2021; Morris and Murray, 2018). Research in app studies has evolved in multiple directions during this time to analyse the implications of appification. This has included examining how app interfaces and features influence social, cultural, and economic practices, employing methods such as the walkthrough method or feature analysis (Hasinoff &amp; Bivens, 2021; Light et al., 2018). Additionally, there has been a focus on the technical and material dimensions of the data infrastructures in which apps are situated (Gerlitz et al., 2019). Simultaneously, the emergence of new app genres, like ‘super apps’, which combine features, services, and practices in unique ways, has transformed apps into platforms for further development. However, this evolution also raises methodological questions on researching and contextualizing change over time (Helmond &amp; van der Vlist, 2021). The evolving and dynamic nature of apps, accordingly, necessitates a continuous need for critical reflection on the methods used to study apps and the phenomenon of appification.\n\nThe panel explores the concept of appification through various lenses, including governance and safety measures in dating apps, the complexities of app-based authentication, the global rise of super-apps and their historical evolution in the Chinese context, and the integration of AI technologies into mobile and enterprise applications. Methodologically, the panel showcases diverse strategies to explore appification, such as the walkthrough method, creating research personas, decompiling and debugging app software packages, historical analysis using app repositories, and analysing mini-apps and app store inventories. Together, these studies provide insight into emerging approaches for understanding appification going forward and how apps are reshaping interactions, governance, and technology integration across different domains and cultural contexts.\n\nAll five papers in this panel engage with the concept of appification, which entails the integration of various aspects of daily life into mobile applications, fundamentally changing how we communicate, access information, conduct transactions, and use digital services. The first paper employs the walkthrough method to explore how dating apps shape the notion of ‘safety’ through their policies and technological features, shedding light on how safety measures are often traded for data and how these apps normalise surveillance practices. The second paper investigates the appification of dating by examining Tinder’s authentication mechanisms, revealing the complexities of user interactions and data exchanges within the app ecosystem. Advancing the field of app studies, the panel thus explores methodological strategies and conceptual frameworks to address the nuances of appification. The third paper maps out the global landscape of ‘super apps’ and theorises the process of ‘super-appification’, where apps extend beyond their traditional boundaries to offer a wide range of features and services, reshaping user engagement and corporate expansion. A comparative historiography of prominent Chinese super apps forms the basis of the fourth paper, tracing their evolution, features, and strategies driving their dominance. Lastly, the fifth paper examines the emerging ecosystems of AI apps, exploring their infrastructural features and relationships. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing transformations in the mobile ecosystem and the appification process, highlighting the crucial role of app features in shaping social interactions and corporate strategies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This decade has been characterized by a deep crisis of trust and legitimacy, which is linked in complex ways to digital technologies and modes of communication. This panel focuses on the role of visuality in trust. It starts from the premise that images are increasingly used to express reliability and trustworthiness, increase engagement in online environments, while also being met with increasing suspicion across platforms. We propose five linked papers that explore how visual digital trust is experienced and made sense of by social media users, content creators and platforms. We are finding that trust is often too abstract for social media users to be able to address directly, rather it is experienced and articulated via norms and practices of (in)authenticity, relatability, coherence, credibility, authority. Thus, our papers focus on these various aspects, experiences and components of visual digital trust moving from perceptions of in/authenticity (paper 1) and social media users’ practices of distributed seeing at its service (paper 2), to users perceptions of creators’ commercial motivations and how that intersects with trust (paper 3), to questions of embodied trust in representations of gym bodies (paper 4) and finally the negotiations of trustworthiness in the context of YouTube’s “Health” program (paper 5).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Advancements in Large Language Models have been showing important research opportunities within the field of communication studies. It offers the capacity to conduct large-scale content classification and annotation with low computational expertise and reduced manual coding efforts, potentially allowing more possibilities for researchers in social sciences to explore understudied topics (Bail, 2023; Chang et al., 2024). Because of its functioning and vast domains and language training, LLMS also potentially unlocks more generalizable, complex, and diverse analyses across various communication materials than previous computational tools and approaches (Chang et al., 2024). These materials encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from journalistic content to the digital discourse of political actors and social media conversation threads. At the same time, LLMs also raise important concerns with potential biases, data privacy, models’ transparency, environmental impact, and power imbalances (Jameel et al., 2020; Fecher et al., 2023). Although highly discussed recently, as a recent topic LLMs still need deeper theoretical elaboration and dialogue between empirical investigations specifically for communication scholars (Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2024; Guzman and Lewis, 2020).\n\nOur panel assembles a collection of case studies that harness LLMs to tackle text classification and annotation tasks related to media and communication problems, issues, and topics. These research papers engage in an exploration of: (a) pipeline structuring: diverse methodologies for structuring effective pipelines tailored to this form of analysis; (b) tools and models comparison: comparisons of the various LLMs tools and models available for text classification and annotation, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses; (c) optimal variables and tasks: identifying the variables and tasks where LLMs demonstrates exceptional performance and reliability; (d) limitations: discussions on the existing limitations of these tools, including limitations related to specific tasks, variables, languages and data formats; (e) prompt development: strategies for developing, adapting and adjusting prompts that allows better results for specific tasks; and (e) ethical and political dimensions: an examination of the ethical and political considerations inherent in the deployment of LLMs in communication research.\n\nThis panel puts together valuable efforts of different research groups across the world to not only use, but also reflect on the use of LLMs in Communication studies. They show important avenues for the field to think about different approaches to validity, ethics and truthful cooperation between humans and computational models without erasing the challenges of doing so, and the disagreements - not only between humans, but between humans and their computational language models too.</jats:p>",

    "title": "AMBIENT AMPLIFICATION: ATTENTION HIJACKING AND SOCIAL MEDIA PROPAGANDA",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade, the rise of memetic media in combination with multimodal platform environments have radically transformed our experience of digital culture. On TikTok, gestures and sounds go viral. Twitter (X) @tags operate as bonding tools and ignite ‘supercharged’ critical publics. Coordinated link-sharing and attention-hijacking drive cross-platform engagement. Narratives promoted by state institutions become part of the global digital culture war. Networked content made up of heterogeneous elements sparks new forms of presencing, propaganda, and play, producing conflict-ridden communities of practice.\n\nThe amalgamation of this all into people’s everyday lives marks a qualitative shift in the ways we use social media. While there has always been an affective component to digital objects such as hashtags (Papacharissi 2015), contemporary audiovisual platforms increasingly target the full sensory experience of human bodies. The focus shifts from fleeting encounters with recommended content to ambient arrangements of linked sounds, networked text, clickable icons, and moving images (Han and Zappavigna 2024; Parry 2023). Within these structures, hybrid cultures of amplification emerge, relying on both intensification and extension. As expressive modalities evolve, amplification not only animates momentary affective impulses but also manifests through repeated attempts at attention hijacking that spread across platforms via everyday acts of sharing (John 2017; Citton 2017).\n\nIn view of these transitions, internet scholars turn to the role of affect to describe the rhythms of online exchanges that are not reducible to singular constituents and can both diminish and increase the engaging potential of content- and data-informed connectivity (Hillis, Paasonen and Petit 2015; Boler and Davis 2020; Slaby 2019). Acts of participation that open up spaces of amplification escape any clear-cut demarcation. Platform communities assembled through different digital objects sidestep binary conceptions of authenticity and (coordinated) performance, allowing amplification to emerge from multiple discrepancies (Graham et al. 2021; DiResta 2021). Platform-mediated processes of authentication target misinformation campaigns, aiming to identify ‘trustworthy’ content (Burton, Chun et al. 2023). At the same time, seemingly straightforward contributions we like and share can be anything but (Phillips and Milner 2021).\n\nUnderstood as a web of affective stimulations (Siapera 2019), ambient amplification refers to social media encounters that bear potential for contestation in different registers of online performance, human and nonhuman. On the one hand, the proliferation of echo chambers and filter bubbles drawing together like-minded communities easily fits into the 'crowd modulation' project through the exhaustion of collective inclinations and correlated metadata (Rogers and Niederer 2020; Apprich et al. 2019). On the other hand, the layeredness of networked embodiment on audiovisual platforms rewires predefined trajectories of amplification through 'dissonant' connections that refuse to be contained in neat taxonomies. Although a great variety of scholarly work is dedicated to polarised engagement, there is still a large gap in studying how different modes of amplification are made to work in more ambiguous contexts (Paasonen 2023).\n\nThe main challenge in approaching this research field is that the messiness of platform-mediated communication is difficult to comprehend. The shifts in relations of data-intensive participation and networked attention capture have made up the platforms' appeal since the very beginnings of the social web (Gillespie 2010), yet the actual ways these relations are made to work remain understudied. Moving away from the analysis of symptoms–as in the most visible content and events of peak intensity–this panel focuses on the ambient logic of amplification forged by the various attachments that online engagement in multimodal social media affords.\n\nStarting from the premise of plurality, it brings together five papers, each of which explores a different aspect of ambient amplification: Paper 1 explores the role of ‘thirst trap propaganda’ in military image wars on TikTok. Paper 2 reflects on the role of gestures in targeted war propaganda placements, presenting a visual method of slow circulation for amplified TikTok content. Paper 3 analyzes hashtagging- and @-tagging practices on X that undergird a polyvocal infrastructure exposing journalists to networked critique. Paper 4 looks into the spectrum of coordination in the service of attention hijacking, investigating what makes coordinated link-sharing on Facebook look ‘authentic enough’. Paper 5 interrogates the weaponization of narratives of a global culture war by Russian embassies, uncovering geopolitical strategies of amplification.</jats:p>",

It starts with the question of how women’s affective and emotional labour are exploited to create a commodified self. Drawing from interviews, analysis of select vlogs and audience comments, and participant observation during the vlog recording; the study also explores their motivation for participating in the ‘fame-work’ and how it enhances the ‘visibility’ of women’s domestic work. The work reveals that the primary motivation to engage in these labours comes in the form of fame, acknowledgement of their invisible housework, and creating an identity which facilitates a sense of empowerment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>From daily cold plunges to meticulous morning routines to obsessive fitness tracking, there is a rising cohort of American male influencers centered around the notion of reaching “maximum potential” physically and mentally. Focusing on a cohort I’m calling “Masculinized Optimization Influencers,” I argue that this group is best understood through the lens of Sara Ahmed’s (2004) “affective economies.” Defined as those who place a dual focus on men’s need to hustle equally at the gym and in their career, Masculine Optimization Influencers present a particular vision of masculinity that binds together physical discipline with financial success. Crucially though, this is presented as much more than a selfish pursuit, this cohort’s approach joins a long American tradition of presenting bodywork as a moral imperative (White et al., 1995). Moreover, as this research will argue, they construct this path of self-optimization as a sacred pursuit. Such an approach attempts to justify hierarchical relations at a time when masculinity and capitalism are facing critique. Through identifying how “emotions circulate between bodies and signs,” and paying particular attention to the emotions of shame and disgust, this research examines how this affective economy mobilizes emotions to sacralize their ascendance in a dissymmetric economic system (Ahmed, 2004, p. 119).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The AoIR Flashpoint Symposium conducted in Hyderabad, India, explored multiple facets of digital labour–that which takes place through and on platforms, monitored or managed via digital interfaces, as well as forms of work that contribute to building, maintaining, and populating digital infrastructures. The discussions at the symposium proceeded from the recognition of the need for regulation with the consumer of technology as our main object of concern, while also attending to the humans at the center of the machinery of production–those who build the insides of the machines (coders, designers, annotators) as well as those who make the content that flows through it. This panel extends the discussions at the Symposium with five papers that attend to different types of digital/digitally-enabled work: content creation and curation, app-based services, infrastructuring through tech work, and advocacy for a just and open digital commons. Together, the papers intend to make visible how the everyday labour of those in the Global South undergirds the global network of digital goods, services, and infrastructures–both materially and discursively. We think of the digital economy and culture in planetary terms (Graham &amp; Ferrari, 2022), driven by technologies largely imagined in the West even as they are enabled in very specific ways by workers in the Global South. Much recent work in rapidly digitizing geographies in South Asia and Latin America has pointed to the embedded nature of the digital, as technology and as experience. Cultural creators on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Spotify speak to increasingly dispersed audiences, their content subject to a variety of regulatory regimes monitored and managed in algorithmically impenetrable ways . Gig workers find their work patterns are constrained and defined by interfaces driven by neo-colonial imaginaries that defy regulation yet prompt innovative forms of resistance. Public discourse veers between the celebratory and the cautionary, as in much of the globe, with states responding, in turn, with shut downs and penalties and sops and incentives. The papers in this panel while locating their arguments and their insights in the specific context of India, also speak to the need for imaginaries that are at once broad and contextual, that take from aspirational articulations while rejecting a universalising logic, whether in the realm of design, or use, or regulation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's social media-dominated landscape, identifying the manifestation of white nationalism on platforms such as TikTok is essential to understanding the spread of extremist content. This research examines the interplay between content and form in TikTok videos, revealing how creators exploit platform-specific features to propagate white nationalist narratives. Rooted in the Identity Approach, which encompasses Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorization Theory, the study elucidates how individuals, particularly on social media, define themselves within interchangeable group memberships, giving rise to in-group/out-group distinctions. Applying this framework to digital platforms highlights the role of content in signaling group membership and shaping collective identity.\n\nBy analyzing white nationalist content on TikTok through qualitative content analysis (n = 75), the study identifies seven types, including nationalist militarism, traditionalism, AfD edit, stylized political speech/news video, infographic/documentation, demo footage and patriotic self-presentation. Each type uses different strategies, from glorifying militarism to repackaging political figures for TikTok. The typology sheds light on extremists' strategies for narrative dissemination on TikTok, and offers insights for platform moderation and interventions to mitigate the spread of extremist content. In addition, the study examines the emotional appeal and recruitment strategies embedded in extremist narratives and explores the influence of eudaimonic entertainment. Methodological challenges, ethical considerations, and barriers to research, are discussed, providing valuable insights for future research on online extremism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the changing documentality of AI-generated images and their role in the industrial production of war imaginaries. In doing so, we center our analysis on the paradigmatic case of Adobe Stock selling photorealistic AI images depicting the Israel-Gaza conflict. After the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, the stock photo service Adobe Stock started to collect of AI-generated images produced by users depicting the conflict. Paying customers were then able to download and publish these images in both online and printed media. A public debate ensued when news media began using pictures from this collection, sparking discussion due to the lack of proper contextualization regarding their AI origin. The primary research question guiding this project is therefore: How does the popularisation and industrialisation of photorealistic AI-generated pictures alter the criteria by which we ascribe documentality to images employed in news reporting? To this end we conducted a mixed method research. In the first phase we collected and analyzed 55 articles related to the Adobe Stock case. The initial content analysis focused on framing of the news, in order to point out key themes and discourses surrounding the controversy. The second phase involves photo-elicitation interviews with photojournalists and photo editors, exploring the documentary and informational value of AI-generated images. Preliminary findings highlight the significance of metadata, the role of illustrative captions, and the aesthetics shaping representations of war and violence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The social media industry has begun more prominently positioning itself as a vehicle for tapping into local community. Facebook offers hundreds of region-specific community groups, proudly touting these in nation-wide commercials. Reddit has hundreds of subreddits focused on specific states, cities, and towns. And Nextdoor encourages users to sign up and “Get the most out of your neighborhood.” In these locally oriented digital spaces, users interact, discuss community issues, and share information about what is happening around them. Volunteer moderators with localized knowledge are important agents in the creation, maintenance, and upkeep of these digital spaces. And, as we show, Facebook, Reddit, and Nextdoor create strategic communication to guide this localized volunteer moderator labor to realize specific goals within these spaces. In this work, we ask: “What are the promises the social media industry make about local community groups, and how do they position volunteer moderators to help realize those promises?” Through a qualitative content analysis of 849 documents produced by Facebook, Reddit, and NextDoor, we trace how platforms position their version of local community as slightly different utopian spaces, and channel volunteer moderator labor both through direct instruction and appeals to civic virtue.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Danmei 耽美 culture, which features male-male romance and/or erotica, emerged in mainland China in the late 1990s and has been flourishing since the 2010s across East and Southeast Asia. The dynamic Chinese danmei culture has received significant attention in academia in recent years, either by mapping out the resistant potential against the heteronormativity or by highlighting the escapist route for expressing the women participants’ desires. The danmei culture has evolved into a transmedia landscape, and at the same time, an ever-expanding cultural industry being exploited by the logic of capital. Danmei writers as affective labors living in such a cultural industry have been rarely considered in present danmei studies.\n\nThrough exploring the datafication of qing (情, affects and desires) via in-depth interviews with contracted danmei writers on Jinjiang, I examine the distinct feature of danmei writers as ambivalent affective labor. For danmei writers, the datafication and monetization of qing leads to increasingly formulaic writing. By selecting, appropriating and combing the elements in the database of qing, danmei writers are able to swiftly generate a male homoerotic love story that efficiently and effectively invoke the affects and desires of readers for better monetization. Pleasures and pains are both involved in doing the ambivalent affective labor, which further consolidates the precariousness of the affective labour. However, the affects and desires per se cannot be fully manipulated – transformative momentum is embedded in the water-like qing all the time.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The family genealogy industry has seen exponential growth in recent years, in large part due to the rise of direct-to-consumer DNA testing platforms. To some extent, ancestry-oriented DNA platforms function like other social media networks, connecting users in intimate publics. Yet they differ in that rather than ordering users by social relationships such as friendship, individuals are displayed according to how many centimorgans they share. In recent years, digital researchers have extended the sociological concept of ‘family display’ to consider digital displays of family. Yet limited work has considered how DNA platforms may constitute digital displays of family or how DNA data shape the bio-digital identities for affected communities who have limited avenues to familial information. In this presentation, I draw on data from the first empirical study to capture the Australian direct-to-consumer DNA users’ experiences, combining accounts from genealogy enthusiasts with accounts from those affected by adoption and donor conception. Reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (n=23) derived two key themes: (1) DNA displays of family - how users are connected and ordered on the DNA platform, and (2) Defining the bio-digital self - how identity is shaped by DNA data. This work firstly contributes to understanding digital displays of family, specifically how DNA platforms shape understandings and practices of family. Secondly, this work provides insights into how DNA data (like other biometric data) shape individual identities in complex ways.</jats:p>",

    "title": "CONTROVERSIES, PROBLEMATIC INFORMATION, AND POLARISATION: CASE STUDIES ACROSS SIX COUNTRIES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Political trends around the world have drawn further scholarly attention to the study of polarisation, especially also as it is expressed and potentially deepened by public communication on digital and social media platforms. The very concept of polarisation itself, however, remains ill-defined especially in communication research, where it is often used as a mere buzzword without sufficient definition – even in spite of a wide range of conceptual approaches that variously emphasise issue-centric, ideological, affective, interpretive, interactional, or other facets of polarisation (Marino &amp; Ianelli, 2023; Esau et al., 2023).\n\nIssue-centric approaches to the study of polarisation often connect it with specific controversies, and therefore align well with controversy mapping and related methodological frameworks. Especially where they study such controversies in digital and social media contexts, they also point to the significant intersections between the circulation of problematic information by and the deepening of polarisation between partisan actors, as well as to the often asymmetrical nature of such contestations (where groups on one side of a given controversy are substantially more likely to use problematic information to support their cause than the groups opposing them; Kreiss &amp; McGregor, 2023).\n\nUnfortunately, much of the recent research in this field has continued to focus on a small number of key political contexts, with emphasis especially on the US and UK. This panel reviews evidence on the intersection of controversies, problematic information, and polarisation through a series of case studies from six continents: North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. In combination, these studies present a substantially more comprehensive picture of global similarities and local differences.\n\nPaper 1 explores the polarising impact of disinformation campaigns in favour of incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 Brasilian presidential election. It reveals a potentially unusual bottom-up disinformation pattern that produces a reverse influence flow from grassroots activists to political leaders and complicates standard distinctions between mis- and disinformation; this also creates new challenges for fact-checking efforts.\n\nPaper 2 examines the dynamics of Italian public opinion in response to the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions in early 2020. Drawing on longitudinal survey data, it identifies a range of perspectives from extreme communitarian to extreme libertarian, and connects this to patterns of legacy and social media use, attitudes towards political institutions, and levels of exposure to mis- and disinformation.\n\nPaper 3 compares the divergent dynamics of political debates on Indigenous rights in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. In the campaigning leading up to Australia’s 2023 referendum on greater Indigenous recognition and representation, it identifies a highly asymmetrical contest that flipped public opinion from strong support for Indigenous recognition to a 60% No vote within less than one year. In the heated political debate about Māori rights in Aotearoa New Zealand since the 2023 election of a new, conservative coalition government, it identifies continuing Māori/non-Māori solidarity in resistance to the reduction of rights stemming from the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nPaper 4 investigates the debates on Twitter about measures to combat sexual violence in Indonesia that came into effect in 2021 and 2022. Drawing on extensive content and network analysis, the study shows that, diverging from the #metoo-style activism against sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence that is common in Western contexts, in Indonesia this agenda is interpreted predominantly through the lens of an underlying polarisation between secular nationalist and Islamist political groupings in the world’s largest Muslim-majority democracy.\n\nPaper 5 compares the online dynamics of the abortion debate in the US before and after the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, focussing especially on political candidates’ social media messaging on abortion rights. Analysis of Democrats’ and Republicans’ posts about the issue, and of broader Twitter and Facebook user engagement with the issue, is expected to point to substantial differences between the parties, timeframes, and platforms.\n\nIn combination, these five papers cover a rich selection of case studies on the intersections between controversies, problematic information, and polarisation around the world. Extended abstracts for all five papers are included in the submission.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Examining and explaining tensions between being public and private on the internet is an enduring aspect of the work of the Association of Internet Researchers. In this paper, I present a concept to aid those working in this space: digital identity integrity, the ability to use a range of personal accounts and platforms to meaningfully participate in digital cultures and economies. When an individual can maintain a reasonable amount of privacy over their identity, knows how to effectively use platforms and services, and is in a position to contribute to broader digital and data justice projects, they can be said to have digital identity integrity.\n\nThis paper is drawn from a larger research project into digital identity integrity, and presents the results of its first two stages: establishing the discourse of the identity verification industry, and conducting pilot workshops on evaluating digital identity integrity. The project builds a case for including resistive practices to identity unification – like being anonymous or creating multiple accounts on one platform – to get a fuller picture of digital identity and inclusion.\n\nThe goal of this research project is to work with the idea of digital identity integrity as a way to evaluate the push and pull between public and private when it comes to identities on the internet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Whenever a celebrity posts a photo on Instagram, it is almost inevitable that the first comment on it will be made by a porn bot (Alvarez 2020). Observations of this kind – some focusing on the distorted perception of ‘sexiness’ and social media authenticity (Thing 2020; Salim 2023), others contesting Instagram’s community guidelines prohibiting both nudity and automation (Santos 2023) – have been ubiquitous in online tech reports for years. In academic discussions, scholars usually define porn bots as automated or semi-automated software agents that operate via sexual solicitation to capture attention (Narrang 2019). Twitter porn bots using Not Safe for Work (NSFW) hashtags to advertise commercial links have been addressed in their generic patterns (Paasonen, Jarrett, and Light 2019). Tumblr porn bots have generated significant controversy due to their uninterrupted operation during the platform’s so-called ‘porn ban’ (Pilipets and Paasonen 2020). Within Instagram, as we will show, porn bots continuously intervene in a network of relationships that users forge with the platform, avoiding detection through a range of circumvention tactics. In all these instances, porn bots operate as medium-specific, heterosexually scripted ‘personas’ (Bucher 2014), demonstrating remarkable adaptability to the platforms’ current cultures of use.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This work explores the intersection of toxicity and symbolic violence as fundamental concepts for understanding two critical dimensions of online violence: its propagation and legitimation. Drawing from Critical Discourse Analysis, we emphasize language's role in negotiating power relationships, demonstrating its significance in shaping social practices and power dynamics. Building on our previous work on gender toxicity, we investigate how toxicity becomes a form of legitimizing violent discourses.Further, we present a framework categorizing violence legitimation into \"discursive structure\" and \"spreadable structure.\" Discursive structures encompass implicit and explicit violence, including humor, stereotyping, and name-calling, revealing strategies employed in violent discourse. Spreadable structures, including polarization and toxicity, explore how discourse spreads on platforms, affecting visibility and influencing dominant perspectives. The understanding of these categories requires consideration of social and infrastructural power dynamics within the online context.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of education technologies (EdTech) in schools has rapidly expanded during COVID-19 due to remote learning requirements. Despite the diversity of EdTech products used in schools, only a handful, including Google Classroom, dominate children’s classrooms in the UK. The way these products operate and process data as part of teaching and learning may expose children to data protection risks with immeasurable consequences for children and their life prospects. This paper demonstrates how these data protection risks can manifest when children use Google Classroom for learning in principle and practice. We conducted a legal analysis of privacy policies and legal terms that applied to Google Classroom and other Google services accessible to children within the Google Classroom environment to demonstrate data protection risks in principle and a socio-technical investigation, using a web browser plug-in, called Lightbeam (for Firefox browser) and Thunderbeam (for Chrome browser), to capture the data flow throughout each child’s user journey, in practice. Through legal analysis of Google’s privacy policies, we identified various data protection risks, including the lack of transparency and purpose specification in data processing. We demonstrated how these risks, in principle, became more tangible in practice with scenarios in which each child’s user journey in and through Google Classroom can be exposed to third-party commercial tracking services. Drawing on an example of effective regulatory enforcement, we demonstrated how the risks to commercial exploitation of children’s personal data in education can be tamed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As the EU Digital Services Act increasingly involves civil society organisations (CSOs) in the context of the development and application of its Code of Conduct, CSOs’ role in moderation policies requires further scrutiny. Theoretically, this paper seeks to contribute to platform governance as a complex multi-stakeholder dynamic process with unresolved tensions between different policy actors and their interests. At the European level, we can schematically understand this process to involve a triangle with three sets of actors: EU policy makers, platforms, and CSOs. We see platform governance as a terrain of struggle where no actor can unilaterally impose their will, but where power is exercised asymmetrically. Since CSOs are called upon to represent the interests of their constituencies and especially those communities that are vulnerabilised through harmful contents and current platform content policies, it is important to examine their role in the emerging EU content regulatory field more closely. In particular, this paper poses the following research questions: How do CSOs determine their policies vis-a-vis platforms? How independent are they from platforms and to what extent do they align their views with those of platforms? Empirically, the paper draws on participant ethnographic research in a leading CSO alongside in depth interviews with key informants and document analysis. The findings indicate that notwithstanding the aspirational role of CSOs in upholding fundamental rights and the rights of their constituencies, there are few safeguards against platform influence. This may end up compromising the crucial role that CSOs play in platform governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Post-secular pilgrimage is increasingly popular, affording communitas (Maddrell &amp; della Dora, 2013) as well as collective effervescence (Serazio, 2013) to pilgrims. Pilgrimage can be augmented by digital media (Maddrell &amp; della Dora, 2013), but pilgrims usually limit their access to habitual devices, people, and digital services during their pilgrimage (Jorge, 2023). This paper focuses on the case of the World Youth Day 2023, hosted in Lisbon, and seeks to explore the role of digital and social media in sustaining pilgrim communities as atmospheres developed through time flows (Hitchen, 2021). To such end, we use the notion of affective temporalities (Nikunen, 2023). We performed a content, multimodal analysis (Bouvier &amp; Rasmussen, 2022) on the material gathered through searching Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Giphy, and maps and apps related to the event.\n\nWhile Facebook groups allowed for coordination and peer support and advice, TikTok and Instagram afforded gains of visibility through hashtags. Giphy appears as a repository of humorous content from both official and vernacular cultures. As for apps and maps, they seemed to be more focused in the present, as they were helpful tools to navigate and manage the logistics of the event, but did not take on a collaborative mode. Anticipation, coordination and rememorating were shared affective temporalities shared by pilgrims through social media, through which communitas, effervescence and longing were processed.</jats:p>",

The aim is to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complications of digital markets around mobility for the people concerned, and most importantly offer insight into the ways in which platform economy shapes migrant mobility and safety of migrants. Moreover we discuss how both platformization and European migration policies are intrinsically connected with the emergence of these markets.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Politigram (also Theorygram) is a loose subculture of pseudonymous meme accounts on Instagram, focused on debating political ideologies and theories using memes. Politigram’s memes often feature political positions that are either idiosyncratic (e.g. “Feminist-Monarcho-Primitivism”) or outside the so-called Overton window of publicly acceptable political ideologies (such as Leninism or Stalinism). While a growing amount of research addresses how online spaces such as 4chan produce and popularise memes featuring far-right ideology, memes that depict left-revolutionary themes are relatively understudied. Since some authors have begun to view anonymous or pseudonymous online spaces as inherently problematic, understanding the variety of practices and content in online spaces that focus on fringe politics is important. Our analysis follows memes that feature Lenin and Stalin through a large number of Instagram accounts posting memes. We concentrate on Lenin and Stalin because they represent fringe ideologies that remain indirectly relevant in contemporary political discourse. With a visual dataset from 45,000 accounts from 2021, we study the thematic variations, boundary work and political positioning performed by Lenin and Stalin memes. We describe how requirements of theoretical literacy, militancy as a communicative value and parody of conceptions of communism drive the discussion of fringe political positions on Politigram. We conclude by contrasting memetic logics in this context with established accounts of “dissimulative identity play” in anonymous online spaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper develops the concept of transient-platform paradigm by closely examining a blockchain technology experiment for a social media platform. To do so, this paper presents partial findings from the platform biography (doctoral thesis) (Burgess &amp; Baym, 2020) of one such BSM, DTube. DTube aspired to provide a fair and transparent alternative creator economy built without the foundations of an advertising revenue model (unlike YouTube). It relied on the critical affordance tokenization or cryptocurrency to overcome the economic challenges. The research was conducted in three phases and followed various ethnographic methods. This research is motivated to articulate the emergent \"structures of feeling\" or the \"social experience which is still in process\" (Williams, 1977, p. 132). It aims to comprehend the imaginaries of a future Internet / Web that experiments like DTube are trying to articulate.\n\nDTube represented an emergent system since it introduced \"new meanings and values, new practices, new relationships\" (p. 123) in a social media system. The discourse of rewarding social interactions was a definitive characteristic in this emergent culture's new meanings and practices. In the process, it shaped a new paradigm that this paper calls a 'transient-platform paradigm', where dispersed initiatives attempt to recreate social media platforms for users by the users.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Female conservative political influencers are an obscure but growing force within American politics, steadily sewing distrust in public institutions. By exploiting the inadequacies and inequalities in a capitalistic society, these women profit off the fears they cultivate through conspiratorial narratives such as the government poisoning food and indoctrinating children to encourage their Instagram audiences to boycott “woke” corporations by purchasing their household supplies through Patriot Wellness Boxes and other conservative MLMs. Guided by Abidin’s (2021) framework of refracted publics and Cotter’s (2019) concept of “playing the visibility game,” this study seeks to understand the ways that vaguely coded conservative MLMs such as Patriot Wellness Box enable conservative female influencers to circumvent algorithms and sentiment seed more radical conspiracies within lifestyle content. The major findings reveal that these women utilize self-amplification groups to simultaneously to grow their audiences and obscure their connections to the far-right and one another. Second, the MLMs are discussed in ways that mirror sovereign citizen/white militia rhetoric that positions the government as an existential threat they must be prepared to fight. While they are not organizing militias, they are promoting anti-democratic messages, xenophobia, and authoritarian-esque sentiments under the guise of a conservative lifestyle achievable through MLM participation.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Research exploring identity performance on Tiktok has highlighted a departure from older self-making frameworks - such as the networked self- and a move towards a more ‘algorithmized’ version of self-making online. This departure takes us from a framework that emphasises performance in the Goffmanian sense to a model that emphasises the role of the algorithm in shaping our identity practices. Social media platforms, though, have been established as important spaces for the performance health and illness identities. With this in mind, this paper asks whether and how illness performances occur on Tiktok and further explores the extent to which we are departing from more traditional self-making practices.\n\nTo do this, we draw on findings from an ongoing Leverhulme Trust-funded project focused on social media uses relevant to hereditary cancer syndromes. These syndromes mark health conditions linked to known genetic mutations, also called “cancer genes”, that heighten the risk of having cancer from an early age. Carriers of these genetic mutations are often referred to as ‘previvors’: healthy individuals who are coping with the awareness of having a genetic predisposition to cancer. We used computational techniques to access posts about two hereditary cancer syndromes: BRCA 1/2 and Lynch Syndrome published on TikTok followed by a qualitative content analysis. From this, our initial findings show how strong elements of older identity frameworks remain present in content produced by previvors on TikTok with previvors identity performances remaining very much networked, interactive and connected to specific communities.</jats:p>",

The need stems from a gradual ecological collapse which brings about unforeseeable consequences to human civilization and infrastructures. By investigating the process of global development to local infrastructure, more resilient and localized communication solutions can be implemented.\n\nFindings\n\nThis paper aims to find the challenges in moving from global software development to a local implementation of open source infrastructure by mapping out the issues offline-first protocols face in reaching a stage of local implementation of their development and the issues communities face in implementing their own communication infrastructures. These findings can support the steps of moving from global software development projects to locally implemented infrastructures.\n\nMethod\n\nThe method is based on semi-structured interviews with four communities and four protocols with a minimum of 2 interviews with each project and community. At the end of the project an online workshop is hosted enabling collective reflection for the communities and projects, and potential knowledge sharing.\n\nOriginality\n\nThe research of moving from global to local is extensively explored through the scaling and commercialization of software. By flipping the approach around and looking at global software developments implementation in local communities this paper delves into a relatively unexplored, and necessary, area of research. The research also supports the active implementation of FLOSS projects for real communities striving towards data-sovereignty and local infrastructures.</jats:p>",

    "title": "WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IT: BRAZILIAN USERS’ ALGORITHMIC IMAGINARIES OF SPOTIFY WRAPPED",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Spotify Wrapped’ is a promotional initiative offered by the music platform consisting of a summary of each user’s yearly listening habits. Although Spotify is generally classified as a streaming service, initiatives such as Wrapped have a clear component of sociability (Hagen &amp; Lüders 2017) – in this case, not only because they are based on the harvesting of users’ behavioural data but also because they are created to be shared on platforms such as Instagram and Twitter/X. Indeed, Spotify Wrapped has acquired its own role in digital popular culture, inciting anticipation and excitement from users worldwide and becoming an 'algorithmic event' (Annabell &amp; Vindum Rasmussen 2023) in and of itself. In this paper, we propose to scrutinise how this algorithmic event is perceived and understood by Brazilian users, whilst also identifying and unpacking the platform affordances and algorithmic imaginaries (Bucher, 2017) that inform those interpretations and their associated performances of taste and identity (Airoldi, 2019, Prey, 2018). We explore in particular how users negotiate the tensions between algorithmic personalisation and individuation and the possibilities for shared experience to emerge during this event. Through a mixed-method approach, we argue that the 'eventness' (Frosh and Pinchevski, 2018) of Spotify Wrapped is distributed, clustered but sparsely connected, and marked by fleeting, fluid and ephemeral feelings of shared experience and recognition rather than by enduring communities, which in turn reflects and extends previous theorisations of affective publics (Papacharissi, 2014) and social media liveness (Lupinacci, 2021)</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The governance of platform algorithms presents a critical challenge as these technologies increasingly pose threats to privacy, agency, fairness, and equity, often reenacting and mediating existing power systems. Traditional governance models, primarily top-down approaches led by policymakers and private corporations, are essential yet insufficient. This paper argues for the incorporation of \"bottom-up governance,\" focusing on the \"epistemic-democratic tension\" (Krick, 2022) between inclusive participation and expertise-based decision-making. I argue that to ensure that algorithms function fairly and justly for all, bottom-up governance requires involving and taking seriously “lay” experts. Bottom-up governance extends beyond merely soliciting input from citizens on algorithms; it necessitates recognizing the authority of non-technical knowers and privileging subjugated standpoints.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>First emerging around 2015, tradwives represent a nostalgic yearning for a mythic past and white supremacist utopia. Yet, in recent years, tradwife creators have received increased mainstream attention and notoriety for their display of “traditional” gender roles, 1950s aesthetics, and open anti-feminism. This online prominence has led some of them, paradoxically, to emerge as the breadwinner in their family–a development that seems at odds with their professed belief that women should eschew careers in favor of childrearing and homemaking. In this in-progress, mixed-methods project, we aim to understand the tensions between the traditional gender roles tradwives advocate for and the entrepreneurial nature of their online promotion and monetization of said lifestyle. We conducted a computational text analysis of 25 English-language creators’ websites, as well as a qualitative analysis of the creators’ Instagram Story highlights. Our emerging findings show that tradwives’ solution to the tension between their professed ideology and their entrepreneurial activities lies in the obfuscation thereof: Neither housework nor creator labor are discussed as work. Explicit political discussions remain similarly unspoken, except for occasional expressions of opposition to feminism and reproductive rights. Religion, however, features prominently. The obfuscation of labor and absence of explicit politics represents a strategic move towards palatability that allows the current iteration of the tradwife to find greater mainstream appeal than earlier tradwives. Our results suggest that the tradwife is a particular influencer style or vernacular around a coherent ideological theme, thus emerging as a metapolitical branding strategy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>When surveyed and interviewed about digital peer support for mental health, LGBTQ+ young people in Australia, aged 16-25 years, most commonly named Instagram as the most supportive social media platform. Most of the 36 interview participants described how Instagram affords mental health support in varied ways, from regular engagement with supportive friends, to following and engaging with accounts that promote LGBTQ+ mental health. The feature of Close Friend Stories was particularly highlighted as affording easy access to friendship support when needed, and allowed a signaling of support without having to ask for it. Many discussed how Close Friend Stories afforded ‘mental health posting’ – for themselves and/or friends – that allayed concerns about burdening friends with mental health struggles, and offered assurance that only friends with the capacity to offer support could do so. This paper argues that the Close Friends feature operates through friendship’s ‘ambient co-presence’ on Instagram, among young LGBTQ+ users, offering space for vulnerable posting. This paper engages with theories of digital co-presence and intimacy, to consider the intimate logic of vulnerable posting and subsequent support among LGBTQ+ young people who use Instagram.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Drawing on iterative, empirical work that investigates the conditions of an everyday hypermediated environment, this paper focuses on experiences of livestreaming from the Disney Parks in order to think about the embodied and the technological in relation to the limits of mobility within this configuration of space(s). Central to the issues I am taking up here is an idea of space which is doubly lived: first, as a physical, tangible space (in thinking about live streamers in the Disney Parks), and second, as a virtual space (such as Internet streaming sites such as YouTube, for example). As such, I am arguing that we can think about these spaces as a vicarious space in which vicarity is underpinned by a sense of mobility and an investment in the embodied. Vicarious space is implicitly configured through the technological in relation to video-sharing platforms and within social, cultural, political, and economic structures and systems which are – ultimately – everyday and mundane. These ideas come to be framed by an overwhelming sense of industry that is threaded through enmeshed within neo-liberal political structures. Yet industry is not often seen here, and instead, these practices and experiences relating to live streaming are understood as centrally relating to pleasure and affect. What I am asking here then is how is vicarity imagined in terms of embodied subjectivity and agency? And how should we understand this in terms of the Internet and opportunities for connectivity?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents three projects where we have developed participatory digital research methods designed to extend observability of digital advertising on social media platforms and engage with users’ individual experiences with digital advertising. In each approach, participants collected instances of digital advertising from social media apps by taking screenshots or using a screen-capture mobile app. Participants also assumed active roles in the interpretation and analysis of the collected ads through dialogue with research teams in the form of SMS chats, surveys and interviews. We then critically reflect on the politics and ethics of participatory screen capture as a method that emerges as a response to ‘platform opaqueness’. Because of the lack of platform transparency, one of the only reliable ways for researchers to study advertising in these spaces is to work directly with users to capture what they see. In our projects, the practice of screenshotting facilitated scaffolded consent as participants chose the images to send and discuss with researchers. These approaches also position participants as experts on their own experience with and theories of algorithmic, digital platform advertising. We conclude by considering the significance of collected data: collections of ads that illustrate the relationships between users and digital advertising models. The ads targeted to individual users reflect platform ad models’ attempts to respond and pre-empt user engagement, and in the process, construct digital subjectivities. By co-analysing digital advertising with users, we observe the ways social media platform users and algorithmic advertising models continuously enact and react to each other.</jats:p>",

Key questions guiding our investigation include suitable assessment techniques for DiE detection and evaluation and effective governance responses.\n\nOur research employs established communications theories of propaganda, emphasizing propaganda analysis as a tool for understanding DiE and developing institutional responses. We examine two nuclear emergency cases—the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP) disaster and the occupation of the Zaporozhzhian Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine—to uncover the disruptive impact of disinformation on emergency communication.\n\nThrough the categorization of propaganda into black, gray, and white types, we analyze tactics employed in DiE, shedding light on strategic intent, transparency, and veracity. Case studies reveal instances of false narratives propagated by governments and media channels, influencing public perception and exacerbating tensions. While our study has not observed significant AI-enabled DiE, we highlight its use in DiE identification. However, state-led counter-disinformation initiatives face challenges, including jurisdictional issues and calls to protect free expression.\n\nWe posit the necessity of non-state-led networked governance structures, drawing parallels with successful cybersecurity governance models. These frameworks, informed by interdisciplinary insights and operating independently from states, are primed to address the multifaceted challenges posed by DiE. Addressing participatory, structural, and operational impediments within existing content moderation governance mechanisms emerges as a pivotal imperative for the realization of effective strategies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper uses family privacy theory and the dataveillance literature as lenses through which to explore state use of health technologies in the care of unwell children, and the contribution of such technologies to children’s datafication.\n\nFamily privacy is an important ideology which informs legal and political understandings of the family, and influences laws governing the family’s relationship with state and society. Respect for family privacy is commonly understood to entail state non-intervention in ordinary family life. Increasingly, however, scholars recognise that family privacy may be more widely understand to entail family autonomy or decision-making and can be understood to afford parental control over how family information, particularly children’s information, is used.\n\nThis paper draws upon responses to freedom of information requests received from Integrated Care Boards and Trusts across England as well as information on the NHS Transformation Directorate’s website. This research confirms that a range of telehealth technologies are now being used to support children's health care including virtual wards, apps, wearables and other medical devices which monitor patients’ vital signs. Patients and their parents are, however, rarely told by the NHS how these technologies use patient data. This paper uses the UK General Data Protection Regulation as a framework for exploring what transparent, lawful and fair use of children’s data entails in the context of digitised healthcare. It argues that the NHS could do more to support parents and children to understand these technologies and the implications for children’s privacy.</jats:p>",

For this goal, we curated a comprehensive list of relevant English-speaking actors, and we collected their most recent Facebook posts relevant to the climate change discourse. After that, the data were analyzed through multiple quantitative language register markers and some engagement-related metrics.\n\nThrough the analysis of the data, we identified some distinct language patterns among different sides of the debate, such as the tendency of the pro-climate action groups to resort to more scientific terms in their communication. Furthermore, audience responses to variation in the language register showed significant divergences among the two groups, with the pro-climate audience showing heightened sensitivity to shifts in language register.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of tailoring communication strategies to promote productive discussions within the polarized climate change debate.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Conspirituality refers to the confluence of New Age spirituality and conspiracism that frame reality through holistic thinking—connecting events and energies, the inner self to the outer world in unseen ways. Conspirituality has thrived online: between the pleasure of the weekly horoscope and the obsession with the QAnon drop is a mode of causal promiscuity in which, as Q puts it, “future proves past.” This panel traces forms of conspirituality from MAGA mystics to New Age influencers, from technolibertarian imageboards to Silicon Valley vision quests. While conspirituality marks an online psychographic segmentation, it also traces a formal quality that organizes ways of navigating, knowing, and critiquing the internet, which is undergirded by New Age spirituality’s perennialism: a belief that different spiritual traditions are equally valid, because they all essentially worship the same divine source that emanates throughout the cosmos and the human body. The internet supercharges perennialism, providing a connective medium for New Age ideology of manifesting: the belief that we create our own reality. As users trawl the internet for snippets and statistics to feed their confirmation bias and populate their vision boards, the connective medium of the internet manifests toxicity and misinformation at scale. The papers in this panel develop a line of research on the coevolution of spirituality and technology from organized to new religious movements. Instead of demystification, we use ethnographic, textual, and hermeneutic approaches—examining internet users, governance, genealogies, and internet studies itself—to politicize networked conspirituality as vernacular theories of power and powerlessness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel explores the rise of ludic technologies as both figurative and computational “platforms” for American political participation. As COVID-19 forced many politicians to abandon massive rallies and other in-person engagement into 2020, American politicians turned to video games for alternative means of public outreach, from “Biden Island” in $2 to Twitch streams with Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez and Bernie Sanders. This panel contextualizes these and other “ludopolitical” phenomena from a variety of perspectives, ranging from digital media studies to queer studies and political economy. We attend to the mass re-politicization of games and question the politics of identity, content moderation, and labour that are downloaded onto policy when party communication becomes strategically playful.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the quest for independence from traditional media constraints, open pedagogy — involving students in the creation of openly licensed materials — offers training in open culture practices alongside deeper learning. Our research builds upon an exploratory study by Hilton et al. (2019). We collected quantitative and qualitative data about the experiences of 85 students participating in an open pedagogy course project: creating content for the open textbook Humans R Social Media (HRSM). We asked students to compare their experiences working on HRSM with traditional learning activities (e.g., writing papers, taking quizzes). About 66% of students said the HRSM project had greater educational value than traditional learning activities. Most students (54.1%) also reported that HRSM helped them master more core academic content, and 51.8% said the project helped them become more collaborative learners. Although a small percentage preferred traditional learning activities, most students reported that open pedagogy’s focus on agency and choice enabled them to share their individuality and creativity. We also found that students valued knowing their work could be shared beyond the classroom; and that publishing, in the words of one student, “gave me more incentive to make sure my assignments were my best product.” This study tentatively reinforces the benefits of independent, hands-on learning as well as collaborative interdependence in an online environment. These findings suggest the active nature of open pedagogy holds rich possibilities for cultivating participatory learning activities, involving students in the creation of knowledge as they learn, and cultivating interdependent connection and community.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Smart technologies promise a future in which the care needed by vulnerable people can be delivered at a distance, informed by Internet of Things-enabled remote sensing and by artificial intelligence used to identify problematic patterns in physiological readings and behavioural data. In this context, surveillance is widely portrayed as a means to maintain the independence of those being monitored. This paper examines the promise of smart care through analysis of documentation from policy, from research and development settings and from marketing materials aimed at carers, people living with dementia and social care agencies in the UK. For informal carers, the monitoring carried out by smart care systems is predominantly framed as reassurance for the carer, while for the person living with dementia a reassurance is offered that there will be help at times of need. For healthcare professionals, lack of knowledge is positioned as a limiting factor on providing optimal care and hence the monitoring offered by smart care becomes an ethical responsibility in the search for improved care as well as a means to increased efficiency. While smart care aims to promote independence, this form of surveillance and the AI-generated predictions that are built upon it can offer imperatives to action that may act against autonomy. To evaluate ethical implications more fully we need to move beyond the promotional discourse to find out more about how people live with such systems and how these systems become a part of the relations of expertise and responsibility that pervade care.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel analyzes the use of mobile apps to mediate experiences of precarity—that is threats to life and livelihood itself. While we acknowledge that mobile apps offer opportunities to form networks of resistance, many apps also pose substantial risks to users. To begin to articulate these risks, the presentations in this panel consider case studies of several apps targeted at mediating experiences of precarity. First, we offer an analysis of “safety-oriented mobility” apps, which help users to avoid location-specific instances of harassment and violence. This presentation argues that that these apps can reinforce harmful homogeneity in spaces, enable surveillance of marginalized populations, and provide a false sense of security to users. Following this, we examine apps that have responded to intimate partner violence. In this presentation, we suggest that these mobile apps do very little to protect their users from harm and, instead, provide a short-term distraction from underlying issues. Finally, we look to LBGTQ+ apps aimed at finding romantic partners or coordinating sexual encounters through location sharing. In this presentation, we suggest that these apps pose risks of unwanted exposure and discrimination, particularly due to an uptick in data breaches and leaks. We conclude this panel by offering a collective statement that argues for systemic intervention addressing the inequalities within society but, until that time comes, we argue for measures that secure these mobile apps (and the data contained therein) and protect their users.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile technologies such as the instant messaging application WhatsApp have become significant resources for information and social support in times of crisis, as well as for crisis communication. In times of crisis, these applications afford the exchange of real-time information and can influence users' coping behaviors. Conversely, they have also been reported to constitute a potential source of misinformation and increased exposure to emotional distress. To date, the role WhatsApp groups play for individuals, families, and communities living in regions affected by ongoing conflicts has yet to be investigated.\n\nThis research draws upon the salutogenic and ecological theories to examine parents' digital coping processes with political violence in southern Israel. To this end, the study examines the types of coping resources provided in local online parent groups (OPGs) during violence escalation and relative calm periods. The study involves a mixed-methods approach comprising qualitative in-depth interviews with 15 couples who are parents of children under the age of 17 residing in communities near the Israel-Gaza border and an online ethnography of four local OPGs. Study findings reveal three levels of parents' coping resources on OPGs: personal, family, and communal digital coping resources. In addition, four WhatsApp affordances immediacy, reachability, mobility, and multimediality—contributed to WhatsApp's role as a shared and ubiquitous coping resource. This study expands the original models and core concepts of the salutogenic and ecological paradigms traditionally studied solely in offline environments and examines the effectiveness of digital contexts in helping parents cope with an ongoing collective stressor.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Practices of self-care and social support have long been identified across social media platforms and apps, as people find new ways of using and adapting digital technologies to mediate and address personal and public health issues. But digital health participation is considerably contested and unevenly experienced, whether through the commodified ‘platformization’ of the health sector, or in the potentially ‘unhealthy’ engagement with dominant social media platforms or dating and hookup apps. Contemporary policy frameworks for participatory, digital-enabled healthcare (e.g., NHS, 2019) assume that we all engage in health or help seeking practices online, but have no answers to associated risks of over-exposure, invasive health surveillance or experiences of discrimination and harassment online, particularly for those at the margins. In our case studies, this is pertinent for transgender, non-binary and female hookup app users, people seeking support for mental ill-health, illicit drug users participating in crypto-markets and dark web communities. In response to this scenario, this panel asks: what are the forms and capacities for collective care in the current digital ecosystem, between social media platforms and dating apps struggling to address harassment or mental wellbeing, within health service-supported online forums, and across the dark web? This panel looks at evidence and answers, as well as research practices and ethics, to understand personal and collective attempts to negotiate, manage, circumvent and otherwise find ways to reinvent cultures of care through digital platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics applications have proliferated primarily in the industrial sphere, and social scientific studies emphasized robots’ functionality and appropriateness for certain roles, especially those related to work and most particularly to robots replacing humans’ jobs. Notably, robot studies are often premised on negative prognostications, emphasizing how robots threaten livelihoods and are disruptive. As AI and robot technologies advance, however, more positive possibilities arise for robots’ social integration. However, there is an ontological divide between humans and machines that will likely influence people’s responses to and interactions with these emerging technologies. People may logically know and intend to treat robots as mere technological tools, but reflexively respond to them socially. This study explores these possible dynamics and examines how people perceive robots as social and human-like entities. A qualitative analysis of open-ended comments (N=591) collected through a survey on robot perceptions was conducted. Five main themes about social life with robots were revealed: robot as tool/machine (32.5% of comments), human-robot relationships (26.9%), social adjustment (19.0%), robot rights (10.7%), and robots’ aliveness/appearance (10.0%). The findings show that human-robot ontology is an important consideration for robots’ social acceptance and integration. AI-supported robotic technology presents great promise; however, its advancement challenges the ontological divide that has implications not only for human-machine interaction but also for self-identity and ultimately human-human relations. In terms of suggestions, these dynamics should be explored in tandem with ways to improve human-machine communication and considered from usability and design standpoints.</jats:p>",

What opportunities exist for decolonization of media content in the platformization of the cultural industries in the Philippines? What are the conditions of the Filipino media landscape that contribute to the success of Wattpad’s pan-entertainment strategy in this territory? This paper brings together publishing studies, platform studies and media ecology and draws on interviews with Wattpad authors in the Philippines. It argues that post-colonial tensions play out in the dominant languages of traditional and platformed cultural production, Wattpad is creating opportunities for greater diversity and inclusion in Filipino book and media culture, and media products developed from Wattpad benefit from distinctly Filipino modes of reception.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This conference paper addresses gaps in scholarship and pedagogy surrounding the phenomenon of “dark patterns” in digital marketing and interface design by showcasing three curriculum-building projects. Dark patterns refer to a set of design strategies that co-opt the human-centred values advocated for in the fields of user experience (UX) design and human-computer interaction (HCI) to manipulate users into taking actions contrary to their personal interests. Recent dark patterns research has clustered within the fields of HCI, media studies, and game studies, with a focus on e-commerce and online gambling platforms. The presented projects put this established research into conversation with scholarship from business and marketing, science and technology studies, cognitive neuroscience, and disability studies to both create a more holistic definition of dark patterns and implement this expanded definition into university course curricula. These include $2 , focused on contextualizing dark patterns within historical market segmentation and merchandising strategies; $2 , on broadening the definition of dark patterns to include non-screen interfaces; and $2 , on analyzing how dark patterns have a disproportionate effect on individuals with certain cognitive disabilities. Collectively, these projects aimed to grant a greater historicity and social context to the phenomenon of dark patterns and introduce them as a utilizable pedagogical concept within the disciplines of communications, technology, and design. The findings of these projects are presented through the sharing of pedagogical materials, informal and formal feedback, and planned curriculum revisions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous studies show that random tweet collections that include more than one hashtag had relatively low rate of unavailable tweets while political related datasets have a higher rate of tweet decay (Almuhimedi et al., 2013; Bastos, 2021; Bhattacharya &amp; Ganguly, 2016; McCammon, 2022; Zubiaga, 2018). For example, Zubiaga’s (2018) study indicates that 81.4% of their 30 randomly selected real-world events datasets remained available after 4 years, while Bastos’ (2021) study shows that only 67% of Brexit debate related tweets were available after the same amount of time. Our preliminary study looks at the #BlackLivesMatter discussion on Twitter and we find that only 63% tweets remain available after 2 years, which is significantly higher compared to the previous studies.\n\nThis preliminary work adds to the existing literature in two keyways. First, we broaden the kinds of discussion spaces where information decay has been studied by focusing on #BlackLivesMatter (hereafter, BLM), which in the U.S. has become a highly politicized movement (Stewart et al., 2018). Second, to our best knowledge, this is the first study looking at social movement tweets since Musk took over and it may highlight how the landscape on Twitter has shifted.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND REVOLUTION IN AFRICA: COMPLEXITIES, AMBIVALENCES, AND CONTEXTUAL REALITIES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Introductory statement\n\nThe rise of digital technologies has brought about significant changes in revolutionary projects across Africa. The impact of these technologies on social movements and activism is complex and multi-faceted. This panel examines the role of technology in shaping African revolutionary projects, such as the use of social media platforms for mobilisation and coordination, and the challenges around issues like manipulation and exploitation. It also delves into the diverse goals and aspirations that drive these movements, from seeking social justice to reorganising social orders. By discussing these topics, the panel aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between technology and revolution in Africa and the different discourses that shape these movements.\n\nRelationship between the papers\n\nThe first paper focuses on Kenya and examines the role of digital technologies, specifically social media, in promoting socio-political change and revolution. The author notes that Kenya has been regarded as one of the technological hubs in Africa, and the increased use of internet technologies has become part of the everyday life of most citizens, especially in urban areas. Social media has become essential for political participation in Kenya, particularly among marginalised communities such as the youth and women. The author highlights the dynamics of protests and socio-political issues that shape socio-political movements, emphasising the use of social media in politically led and grassroots-led protests.\n\nOn the other hand, paper B looks at Nigeria and explores the forms of civic engagement and citizenship performance on Twitter spaces leading up to the country's 2023 national elections. The author uses the lens of digital citizenship to situate citizens as politically engaged subjects who gather and share information and make rights claims online, potentially altering the balance of power. The author acknowledges the need for contextual understanding when studying a country like Nigeria imbued with culture and diversity. The author also highlights how new media technologies facilitate African digital citizenship and the tacit and observable ways citizens experience their social and cultural context in digital environments that may be uniquely African.\n\nPaper C examines the presence of influencers and grievances among the \"soro soke\" generation during Nigeria's 2023 election cycle. The study aims to show the significance of influencers in the core networks of \"soro soke\" election tweeters and how their grievances are expressed through personalized statements of hopes, frustrations, and lifestyles that lead to collective action. Additionally, the author explores the response of leading presidential candidates to the #EndSARS movement, highlighting how the movement connected the \"soro soke\" generation with like-minded politicians and how resources were mobilized to support them.\n\nPaper D critiques the discourse of social media platforms driving political revolutions in Southern Africa. It rejects the technological determinism and solutionism approaches and favours theoretical toolkits such as social shaping of technologies, structuration theory and technological dramas. The paper explores digital technologies' complex roles in political struggles, acknowledging their potential for democratization, citizen participation and political voice, as well as negative impacts like digital surveillance, authoritarianism, disinformation campaigns, cyberbullying, and dark participation. It highlights the disruptive tendencies of hashtag movements in Southern Africa, examining digital technologies' positive and negative outcomes. This study contributes to understanding the relationship between digital technologies and political struggles in Southern Africa and challenges revolutionary technologies, actors, movements, and goals' rhetoric on social media.\n\nThis paper examines how African youth and first-generation young African diasporas in the USA, UK, and France use social media to contest and reframe global media narratives about Africa and its people. It analyzes subversive online narratives that challenge settler colonialism legacies and global north media control. Social media provides a new frontier for disrupting media hegemonies and challenging stereotypes. The study concludes that social media facilitates protests and increases opportunities for youth engagement in collective action. African youth and diasporic communities use social media to challenge negative stereotypes and reframe global media narratives about Africa, redefining identities in the process.\n\nAll 5 papers are related in that they all focus on the role of digital technologies in shaping political and social change. They explore how digital technologies are leveraged to challenge dominant narratives, amplify alternative voices, and mobilize collective action. The abstracts also share a critical perspective that seeks to move beyond deterministic and solutionist approaches to analyzing the relationship between society and technologies and instead highlight the complex and multifaceted ways in which digital technologies can enable or constrain political struggles. In addition, the abstracts focus on different geographic contexts, including Nigeria, Kenya, Southern Africa, and the diaspora in the USA, UK, and France, indicating the global reach of digital technologies in shaping political and social change. Overall, the abstracts highlight the potential of digital technologies as a tool for challenging dominant narratives and mobilizing collective action while also acknowledging the ambivalent and contested nature of their impact.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>To better understand what drives the public’s perception and acceptance of AI in different roles, we propose a study that looks at varying AI domains by occupational status and individual differences across ontological perceptions, automation anxiety, perceived status, and identity threat. As a first step, we conducted a representative survey of the US population (N = 1,005) that looked into the public's perceptions of AI replacement of high-status jobs. Results indicate that a majority of participants hold negative attitudes about AI replacement in all domains presented. However, participants were more open to AI replacement in lower-status roles such as journalist and hiring manager compared to higher-status roles of spiritual leader and trial judge. Contrary to our expectations, participants believed that trial judge was a slightly worse idea than AI spiritual advisor. This finding suggests that the associated machine heuristic of the judge role as being a more rational and objective occupation was not triggered in our sample. Our results also suggest that more vulnerable populations are more reluctant to accept AI in the majority of jobs. These findings are in line with previous public opinion surveys and demonstrate that individuals with lower levels of power and status are more likely to be reluctant to accept new technology and potentially perceive it as a threat. Our next step will be to include more occupations that can be potentially automated and look for explanatory mechanisms driving the public’s view of AI integration.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Through the case of the technologically augmented K-pop idol group Mad Monster, this article explores the participatory culture in the supposedly revolutionary proliferation of “humanlike, realistic” digital technologies by drawing on the concept of meta-authenticity, loosely defined as the desire or achievement of authenticity in practices of inauthenticity. I focus on the implications of the social integration of artificial agents and augmentative tools for humans, not to re-establish the human-nonhuman binary but to illuminate the persisting human presence and involvement. Mad Monster’s authenticity was achieved through—not despite—their blatantly “inauthentic” technological augmentations like extreme facial and voice filters. They were co-managed to perform as per “human” authenticity expectations while drawing on the presumption of inauthenticity: by the comedy duo, their fans, existing institutions, and commercial interests—the locus of their authenticity was in collaborative performances. Mad Monster is a case of contemporary meta-authenticity that demands a shift of focus from technological states to collaborative performances around it: how “humanlike” or technologically augmented cyborgs are involved in social spheres matters more than what they are. Their success as “fake but/thus real” AR-filtered, autotuned celebrities also warns of how diverse humans’ crucial contributions can be easily hidden in cyborg phenomena that stress their technological components, and how accountability can be diverted. The revolutionary potential of cyborgs rests not in technical achievements but in the collaborations of the actors involved: questioning, shaking, and breaking the standards.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The essay brings together Black feminist theory, critical disability studies, and feminist science and technology studies together through the concept of technological practices of refusal. The concept of technological practices of refusal describes how disabled people engage in everyday, often communal technological practices as means to challenge normative logics and engage in collective world-making practices toward collective liberation and societal transformation. Technological practices of refusal extends Schalk &amp; Kim’s (2020) feminist-of-color disability studies and Campt's (2017) practices of refusal to highlight the interrelations between ableism and white supremacy and the ways in which systems of domination operate to dehumanize individuals based on deviations from white supremacist configurations of race, class, gender and ability. The concept therefore not only underscores how disabled people reimagine and enact new social formations despite the foreclosure of subjectivity and futurity, but maps out new points of affinity for solidarity and collective action.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing concentration of power and dependence on few platforms in the media sector necessitate regulatory measures to counter the potential threats to media pluralism and editorial independence stemming from this concentration. While some legal initiatives aim to address the imbalanced power dynamics between platforms and news media, such as the efforts at the EU level through the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) to establish a fair playing field in digital markets, it is crucial to empower countervailing forces. This article explores the concept of \"counterpower\" within the context of media concentration and platform dependence, delving into its theoretical and practical implications. The practical analysis is grounded in 12 semi-structured interviews conducted with news organisations of various sizes in the UK and the Netherlands, revealing a heightened awareness of the necessity to reduce dependences and promote more direct and engaged journalism. The interviews identified specific strategies, albeit with some limitations, highlighting the need for additional support, especially for local news organisations striving for autonomy in reducing dependences. In a nutshell, the article examines the legal prerequisites for news organisations to establish a \"counterpower,\" serving as a complementary piece of the larger puzzle in addressing the broader challenges of media concentration and platform dependence. Finally, alongside the evolving EU regulatory framework, encompassing the DSA, DMA, and EMFA, there is a growing demand for enabling “counterpower” and developing robust media (concentration) laws in Europe, particularly focusing on safeguarding local journalism.</jats:p>",

However, the complex dynamics of feminist expression in these online spaces—and the role of popular culture in facilitating such discourse—are still to be fully elucidated. Here, focusing on the understudied social media platform Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), we analyze the online discussion sparked by the stand-up comedy acts of Chinese female comedians. Drawing on a qualitative content analysis of Douyin videos and related comments, we demonstrate how users employed the platform’s creative features to challenge everyday sexism by echoing or building upon the stand-up comedians’ gags. At the same time, the analysis also uncovers how Douyin is used to insult and push back against these feminist voices. Our findings shed light on the sophisticated role of Douyin as a platform for digital feminist expression, and the ways in which it can amplify both feminist discourse or, conversely, give voice to misogynistic attacks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A fast-growing international success, ByteDance’s short video platform TikTok is a relevant case study to examine how digital platforms expand infrastructurally and accumulate power. TikTok has achieved popularity comparable to major players, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. It now grapples with balancing the diverse interests of its different user groups, chief among which content creators. We interrogate how TikTok manages this challenge via an exploratory study that studies the platform’s evolution through what we dub ‘platform tools,’ or, the software-based instruments for cultural production on social media platforms. Such software-based tools have been previously theorized using the ‘boundary resources’ framework, which emerged from information systems studies. This framework conceptualizes platform tools as interrelated, contextual, and dynamic, changing in response to variables internal and external to the platform ecosystem. Recognizing that platform tools are ever-changing, we conduct a ‘platform historiography’ to periodize three main trends: platform tools (1) have contributed to the formalization and professionalization of platform content; (2) have encouraged the standardization of platform-dependent cultural production; and (3) have furthered the platformization of TikTok both within, as well as outside the cultural industries. Our paper serves as a response to calls from media scholars to view platforms as contingent and ever-evolving, and to further social media historiography. More specifically, we contribute to the literature on platform studies because it focuses on an understudied aspect of platform governance: platform tools.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The podcasting landscape has been reshaped in the past several years by acquisitions and mergers among players in the industry. Major platform services like Spotify, SiriusXM, iHeartMedia, Google, and Apple have all attempted to more closely bind consumers to their proprietary services, threatening the open architecture of distribution via RSS. While control and monetization of intellectual property is one key driver of platformization in podcasting, another key institutional shift is being accelerated these changes: the datafication of the audience. In short, datafication involves the quantification of human activity to enable surveillance, prediction, and mass customization of advertising.\n\nIn this paper, I explore one significant impact of widescale platformization within podcasting: the emergence of programmatic advertising markets. By essentially “listening in” to these industry discourses about podcast advertising (in podcasts and in the Podcast Upfront presentations from Spring 2022), this essay outlines the importance of platform-to-platform data transactions and highlights the resulting shifts in the podcasting ecosystem: away from the intimate, relationship-driven ethos of the medium and toward a quantitative, surveillance-driven ecosystem.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The condition of road infrastructure in New Orleans is recognized among citizens as unacceptably poor. This problem is situated in the context of a long list of problems with the municipal government and city services that have combined to create an atmosphere of distrust and deep frustration. On Instagram, ‘Look At This F*ckin’ Street’ exists to document failing local infrastructure and has nearly 100,000 followers and an active culture of crowdsourced user submissions and regular engagement in comments and reposts. In this paper, I utilize Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis to explore all of the relevant discursive modalities seen in the account in order to uncover how they work to challenge and ultimately undermine power. Via an open coding process, I identify three main strategies employed by the anonymous account manager and the participating followers: Shaming, Mocking, and Exposing. Within each of these strategies, I explore the specific techniques observed within these discourses that contribute to the effectiveness of these strategies. I argue that LATFS is an effective and powerful participatory platform for exposing a broad range of systemic problems and their causes, allowing residents to take back the narrative of their city’s infrastructure challenges, diminish and demean the powerful interests responsible, and, ultimately attempt to reclaim the power lost to negligent or even bad-faith municipal authorities in New Orleans.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper argues that the production of ‘infrastructural insecurity’ is an inherent part of the standardization of information networks. Infrastructural insecurity is the outcome of an intentional process within infrastructural production, standardization, and maintenance that leaves end-users of the infrastructure vulnerable to attacks that benefit a particular actor. We ground this analysis in an interrogation of the responses to the disclosure of three security vulnerabilities in telecommunications networks, namely (1) a security flaw in Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) that allows for the data interception and surveillance, SMS interception and location tracking by third parties, (2) the lack of encryption of permanent identifiers that allowed for the deployment of rogue base stations, which allowed for man-in-the-middle attacks, resulting in interception of all voice and data traffic in a physical signal vicinity, and (3) the lack of forward secrecy between user-equipment and the home network, which allows for the decryption of current encrypted data stream if credentials were obtained in the past. To research the shaping of communication and infrastructure architectures in the face of insecurities, we develop a novel approach to the study of Internet governance and standard-setting processes that leverages web scraping and computer-assisted document set discovery software tools combined with document analysis. We bring these methods into conversation with theoretical approaches from material media studies, science and technology studies, and critical security studies. This is an important contribution because it asks fundamental questions about the adequacy and legitimacy of standardization processes.</jats:p>",

In this article, I propose the term ‘lifestyle governmentality’ to capture Red as a cultural technology of citizenship that directs self-managing subjects toward the desired outcomes sought by the institutions of the official government. This research project combines a systematic document analysis of regulations, notices, and guidelines related to platform governance, discourse analysis of Red's content, with walk-through method, and in-depth interviews with Red influencers (n=12) and users (n=35). I suggest that the inducement offered by Red to facilitate and improve users’ personal life, fulfillment and success through lifestyle sharing is distinctly tied to a hybrid model of governmentality that combines neoliberal and socialist political reasoning about governance, enterprise, and social welfare.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Communication and technology in India are dominated and hegemonized by elite oppressor castes (Savarnas). The absence of marginalized castes (Bahujans) in mass media systematically erases narratives, histories and opportunities present to them. In this study, we look at alternative digital Bahujan publishing as sites for claiming media representation and how a vision of anticaste internet is emerging through these publishing practices.\n\nWe study how despite systemic challenges, Bahujan publication spaces have emerged across digital media as sites of intersectional discourse on caste through new media like blogs, visual art, memes, YouTube channels, infographics, podcasts etc. Further, We look at how this has exposed caste issues under the casteless facade of digital technology through challenges of caste-hate speech, poor moderation, algorithmic bias and inadequate platform governance.\n\nWe draw from qualitative interviews with bahujan publishers across digital mediums. Through a critical caste lens, we uncover motivations, infrastructural needs, editorial processes, audience engagement, challenges and the future vision of these publishing projects. We discuss questions of identity, community, hate-speech, platform censorship, mental health and self-care which emerge in online anti-caste publishing.\n\nWe conclude that in spite of the historic erasure and marginalization of bahujans from media narratives, bahujan publishing has opened a space for an emerging vision of anti-caste internet which needs to be studied from an infrastructure and platform lens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of an exploratory study that examines the social implications that platform algorithms raise for LGBTQ+ communities. We share the preliminary results of our Phase 2 group interviews, which were conducted with Canadian social media managers of LGBTQ+ non-profit organizations and with Canada-based LGBTQ+ tech workers. Algorithmic controversies relating to LGBTQ+ communities identified in Phase 1 were used as prompts to elicit discussions among participants. In this paper, we pay close attention to how participants queered dominant algorithmic imaginaries. Our preliminary analysis highlights four main findings. First, participants questioned dominant discourses that depict AI technology as being inherently new, instead re-inscribing algorithmic controversies within a long-lasting history of gender and sexual oppression. Second, participants reconfigured the ideal-type user embedded in sociotechnical systems but also identified challenges with effecting sociotechnical change as LGBTQ+ stakeholders. Third, participants subverted the notion of algorithmic resistance by questioning whether effective technological resistance should rely on technological misuse or disuse. Fourth, participants translated algorithmic controversies via their positionality as LGBTQ+ stakeholders to move beyond purely technicist considerations. Finally, we highlight the importance of mobilizing stakeholders from marginalized communities to contest the dominant discourses through which society makes sense of AI technologies.</jats:p>",

    "title": "GENDER AND MISINFORMATION: DIGITAL HATE AND HARASSMENT (PART II)",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms allow for free expression and speech, but also open possibilities for online misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, harm, and conspiracy theories (Nadim and Fladmoe, 2019). Here, gender as an analytical category plays a significant role in understanding how women, LGBTQ+ people, and members of various minorities, in particular, are disproportionately targeted by hate actors. In fact, through gendered violence and online hate, social media serves to promote structural inequality where gender minorities become the target of harassment (Jane 2014a; Jane 2017). Gendered violence and cyberhate have consequences that negatively impact women and queer groups and pose a threat to political goals through victimization and reinforcement of patriarchy (Jane, 2014b). Though anonymous in nature, mobilized and networked hate becomes a product of what Castells (1986) refers to as the culture of real virtuality where is a flow of capital, information, technology, images as well as organizational interaction. In particular, gendered cyberhate targets women in longstanding discourses that view men as superior to women (Jane, 2014b). Misogyny exists as a connective tissue that legitimizes the subjugation of feminine and othered identities in relation to heteronormative patriarchy (Kaul, 2021).\n\nIn particular, online violence against women in politics poses a deepening challenge to democracy, serving as a key tool of illiberalism and democratic backsliding across the globe. Hate speech against women in politics, female journalists and other public figures encompasses all forms of aggression, coercion, and intimidation seeking to exclude women from the digital public sphere simply because they are women. Gender misinformation here itself becomes a form of violence that undermines women and othered identities and weaponizes gendered narratives to promote political, social, or economic objectives. This online behavior seeks to achieve political outcomes: targeting individual women to harm them or drive them out of public life, while also sending a message that women in general should not be involved in politics. It is important to note that digital misogyny may not be overt at all times but benign and subtle - involving “everyday, seemingly innocent slights, comments, overgeneralizations, othering, and denigration of marginalized groups” (Anderson, 2010; Anderson, 2015) that although unintentional is insidious and dangerous.\n\nDespite growing concerns about the increasing prevalence of misogynistic or sexist hate speech on different popular digital platforms, research in this field and the attention directed at ways to combat hate online is relatively recent. At this juncture, this panel on Gender Misinformation: Hate and Harassment will provide a forum to discuss how women in politics, journalism, and the film industry are perceived, and what the hate that targets these women looks like in practice in a global context. We bring together scholars whose interdisciplinary and comparative work in Germany, Azerbaijan, the Philippines, India, and Brazil focuses on prominent women in the digital public sphere and political leaders from racial, ethnic, religious, or other minority groups to demonstrate how misogynistic speech acts to exacerbate patriarchal norms and operationalize a relationship between gender and power. In addition to the focus on digital hate and harassment in the Global South, this panel also brings together a diversity of methodological interventions\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson Kristin J. (2015).

    "title": "INFRASTRUCTURES OF MANIPULATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel presents research on web and information infrastructures used for manipulative purposes. In contrast to platform manipulation (Woolley &amp; Howard, 2018; Benkler et al., 2018), where users such as bad actors seek to gamify and exploit the weaknesses of online social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, the papers in the present panel describe studies where web or information infrastructures such as those involved in search and information retrieval are manipulated to alter or produce facts (rather than social commentary on facts). For example, studies have shown how infrastructures like Google Search are manipulated by conservative elites (Tripodi, 2022), how anonymous editors use Wikidata to revise the distribution of information related to political protest movements (Ford, 2022), and how administrators harness information schemas to improve the findability of their advertising content (Iliadis, 2022). In these areas and more, web and digital infrastructures are being manipulated to serve the interests of politically motivated actors (Acker, 2018; Acker &amp; Donovan, 2019).\n\nInfrastructures typically refer to shared public services like sewers, telephone poles, and electricity. According to Bowker et al. (2010, p. 98), information infrastructure refers to “digital facilities and services usually associated with the internet.” Information infrastructures are thus enabling resources, in network form, whose key role is that of a distributor, but rather than goods or services, information infrastructures distribute “knowledge, culture, and practice” (Bowker et al., 2010, p. 114). Such structures do this through their development of ontologies or classification schemes that enable dividing the world into categories or, through their application to large data sets, by offering an enormous, open store of data that can be used by others for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving facts and sharing information. Recently, several scholars have elaborated on the political nature of such infrastructural processes of digitization and datafication, including in the domains of archiving and preservation (Thylstrup, 2018, 2022), governance and management (Flyverbom &amp; Murray, 2018), metrics and sorting (Alaimo &amp; Kallinikos, 2021), and the creation of global ontologies for things like web search (Iliadis et al., 2023) and surveillance services (Iliadis &amp; Acker, 2022).\n\nManipulation of social media content and messaging is likewise a major research area over the last several years owing to the prevalence of online misinformation and disinformation campaigns (Reagle, 2016; Paris, 2021; Culloty &amp; Suiter, 2021), particularly those associated with electoral politics (Tucker &amp; Persily, 2020) and health misinformation (Keselman et al., 2022). Yet, online manipulation is not a new phenomenon and has long been discussed as a feature of the web in the context of the history of trolling, abuse, and hate (Phillips, 2015, 2019). Manipulation is thus a multivalent concept and is found in several domains which share the notion that manipulation is related to the altering, editing, treating, controlling, and influencing of content and messages for the purpose of misleading individuals. Historically, though, less attention has focused on manipulation as it has been mobilized infrastructurally, particularly with respect to the information infrastructures that transmit content and messages. Infrastructures should be understood here in a broad sense as undergirding the communication structures that transmit messages and content. Such infrastructures can be found in computer science, news and journalism, government, policy, and other areas where messaging is organized using some form of schema, whether it be technical, linguistic, financial, or otherwise.\n\nThe first paper uses interviews to highlight the “importance of abortion-related web search and whether or not that system has been manipulated by actors trying to prevent abortion access.” The paper “examines how people (users) search for information about abortion, how organizations (content providers) utilize search engine optimization to reach potential users, and how advertisers try to attract visitors.” The second paper uses autoethnography and process tracing with respect to “the AP African American Studies debacle in order to elucidate digitally mediated disinformation as a strategy for stoking moral panic and thereby gaining widespread public buy-in to the establishment of educational censorship infrastructure.” The third paper analyzes Palantir as a surveillance platform that shapes and is shaped by infrastructures of manipulation. The paper “provides a method for researching companies like Palantir and its surveillance infrastructures” through digital media archiving of “over 600+ documents which have been stored, cleaned, annotated, and uploaded into an online digital archive that will be publicly available for media researchers to study.” The fourth and final paper is “an ethnographic study of a single Wikipedia article and how it evolved over the course of a decade” in the context of political revolutons. The paper describes “a framework for understanding new methods of controlling facts in the context of automated knowledge products” and “the importance of semantic infrastructure to new methods of control and influence on Wikipedia and the wider knowledge infrastructures that are increasingly dependent on it.”</jats:p>",

Depending on where a member places skin care on this spectrum influences who they view as credible experts, and in turn what information that member deems trustworthy. Using an STS/Feminist STS theoretical framing, this paper investigates how members of the subreddit r/SkincareAddiction identify, evaluate, and perform skincare expertise. These expressions of expertise provide valuable insight into how members negotiate community norms, personal experience, and scientific studies to not only discern skincare knowledge, but also construct an understanding of their own skin.</jats:p>",

    "title": "RESEARCHING UNDER PLATFORMS’ GAZE: RETHINKING THE CHALLENGES OF PLATFORM GOVERNANCE RESEARCH",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Researching on platforms through platforms poses challenges to researchers, particularly when observing subcultures and content at the margins. Inspired by Massanari’s essay on researching under the “alt-right” gaze, this paper uses autoethnography to address the impact the system of platform governance has on researcher vulnerability in data collection, persona management and results dissemination, particularly for researchers gathering data censored by platforms and for early-career researchers constructing their personae through digital media. My goal is to examine how the intersection of platform power, academic precarity and the creator economy affects early-career researchers and academics. At the heart of this are the questions: How can researchers gather data, disseminate results and establish a professional profile under platforms’ all-encompassing gaze? What does platform governance and its focus on specific areas of control mean for researching content and users at the margins? What risks do platforms themselves pose to researchers’ work? And how does the broader precarity of particularly early-career academic work intersect with the effects of platform power? To this end, this paper starts with personal experiences of censorship in research to define ‘platform’s gaze’ as gendered, raced, heteronormative and puritan surveillance, constructing a social reality where marginalised individuals and dissent are both hyper-visible and vulnerable to harassment and silencing. It continues by discussing the increasing digital labour required by the ‘impact agenda’ and the difficulty of managing a researcher online persona in an age of growing digital censorship, concluding with considerations on activist interventions in the platform governance field.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Using survey data from a 2022 survey of fans that was distributed on Tumblr between February 22 and March 21, 2022, this paper speculatively maps the network of Tumblr. Tumblr is home to fandoms of all kinds, acting as a space where fans can gather, discuss theories, produce fan texts and media, and interact with fanworks, making them one of the key distinctive communities that use the site and a suitable community to investigate the shape of the network. First, we analyze the prevalence of particular demographic answers from the survey over time to find points at which a large number of responses have similar identities. Second, we use the baseline probability of any given answer within our data set to examine times when it becomes disproportionately prevalent compared to elsewhere in the data. Through looking at these correlations between time and probability in specific demographic answers, we can identify moments when the survey was traveling through a homophilic network within the platform, and therefore extract information about how homophily works on this platform. By mapping Tumblr through these survey homophiles, we can gain a greater understanding of how people gather and interact on the platform. This has implications both for questions of community and subcultural belonging, but also issues like the spread of mis- and disinformation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>TikTok wants to “inspire creativity” and “spark joy,” Meta aims to “bring the world closer together,” and YouTube aspires to “give everyone a voice and show them to the world.” Platforms claim that they want to do $2 . However, they regularly get international attention for being $2 instead. Social media data scandals are a prominent point of research. Yet initiatives to counterbalance these backlashes, such as YouTube’s Black Voices Fund or TikTok for Good are rarely investigated. Although platform initiatives' content is often not on the top of your For You Page (FYP), such social initiatives can tell much about what values a platform aims to promote. Examining the values promoted through social initiatives of platform companies provides a way to understand what these companies try to center as important or worthwhile. This project investigates the promotion of platform values through “TikTok for Good,” based on an inductive and thematic analysis of TikTok for Good videos (n=180). With this study, I aim to explore how platform values can enhance our understanding of the construction of what a platform counts as $2 , what is worth being visible, and in turn, what is not.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article considers the politics and practicalities of responding to the COVID crisis with ‘an app for that’. It shows how seductive solutionism in times of crisis created political impetus to direct the public health response to contact tracing through Contact Tracing Apps (CTA). Rather than focus on user-based concerns (uptake, privacy, etc.), we’ve investigated how apps interface with complex systems and infrastructures of public health. Our 21 expert informants from five developed nations offered insight into the machinations of contact tracing from ‘the coal face’ up to executive technical and policy decisions including national CTA development and deployment. We learned that beneath the shiny veneer of an app is the messy certitude of Excel and tech-debt, politics, and mundane organizational technique that worked amidst each other to shape public health. Our approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the interfaces of CTA and digital epidemiology than current App narratives allow.\n\nWhile a healthy and critical literature on digital app interventions into COVID-19 has developed, there has not been critical consideration of these apps informed by insights from those responsible for designing, implementing, and making use of these digital tools. We redress this research imbalance by considering how user-centric narratives of the platformization of public health can gloss over what situational analysis (Clarke et al., 2016) might better uncover. This paints a more nuanced picture of digital epidemiology than current App narratives provide to address the contingent promises and failures related to these digital technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Alongside its many advantages, the Internet presents a variety of challenges and risks to adolescents. From a perspective focusing on information flow processes, this study distinguishes between risks resulting from _exposure to information_, i.e. exposure of adolescents to inappropriate content: Harmful, sexual or violent, and risks resulting from _exposure of information_, i.e. disclosure of personal information online, privacy harms inflicted by the user or others, misuse of personal information which can result in identity theft, physical and sexual assault. The study examines gender differences in perceptions regarding adolescents’ online uses, habits and risks, and whether these lead to differences in emphasis of educational messages delivered by parents and teachers to adolescents. Based on a mixed-method study combining survey conducted among 513 adolescents and 50 semi-structured interviews with educators and adolescents, the findings illustrate how a common perception that girls share more personal information online and are (consequently) more vulnerable to online predators leads to more emphasis given on implications of personal information disclosure in messages delivered to girls. On the other hand, boys are considered naughty and nosy, searching for “forbidden”, mainly sexual, content, and emphasis is given on limiting and monitoring their searches and video consumption. Apparently, although parents, teachers and adolescents proclaim to be aware of the similar risks to boys and girls online, there is a message interwoven in internet safety education discourse: Girls are to be aware of others looking to harm them, and boys are to be aware of themselves, their curiosity and evil inclination.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In our work we study practical approaches to internet research ethics with a logitudinal perspective. We have interviewed more than 40 social media researchers in 2013-2014 using a semi-structured qualitative interview approach. From these interviews we gained insights into the challenges of everyday research practices at the various stages of the research process, as well as into motivations for specific approaches and critical reflections on research design and decision making, particularly concerning research ethics. At the end of 2019 we started re-interviewing the participants in our study and will continue to do so over the next months. In addition to questions about the details of everyday data work and the rationales behind (ethical) decision making, we are asking participants what has changed in the way they conduct research with social media. Based on our interviews as well as the ongoing discussions of Internet Research Ethics in the community, this paper focuses on the ethical dimensions of social media research practices and how they have evolved over the past years. Between our two interview periods, the social media landscape has witnessed several changes, including incidents like the \"Cambridge Analytica scandal\", which have also created ethical discussions in the broader public. By asking researchers about their everyday work, our research contributes to a look behind the scenes of \"life as an internet researcher\", as phrased in the list of topics in the call for papers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past years, the use of social media has allowed migrants and other minority groups to communicate, obtain information and build an identity through self-representation and content creation. The possibility to talk about their experiences, connect to other content creators and interact with the platform allows to decentralize the European narrative and offer visibility to other cultures. In this context, TikTok emerges as one of the platforms where traditionally marginalized populations narrate their experiences and enter public debates. In this case we study Spanish-Moroccan mixed couples who must face the cultural stereotypes derived from the geographical, historical, and colonial confluences between these two nations. To carry out the study, a qualitative analysis was carried out by identifying TikTok videos using the hashtags #mixedcouples and #SpainandMorocco in their Spanish and English versions. We then identified other hashtags of interest that appeared together with these and found other videos of interest. We viewed a total of 8,653 videos and identified six profiles of interest from creators that self-identified as being part of a Spanish-Moroccan mixed couple and had more than 10K followers. This analysis reflects the difficulties faced by people who chose more intimate forms of integration and the existing colonial paradigms in terms of mixed romantic partners. At the same time, these creators exemplify the existence of points of encounter between seemingly opposite cultures and nationalities through their (self)representations and discourses on this platform, as well as the increased visibility they are achieving through their content and profiles. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent years have witnessed invigorated debate about the contradictions of identity-concealing public participation and its influence on democratic deliberation and policy-making. Some have documented the exploitation of misrepresented identities for manipulation, including the manufacturing and disrupting of political discourses. Others argue that pseudonymous speech fosters less conformist and more secure public spaces for critical social commentary and political activism. In this study, we extend this dichotomy by approaching pseudoanonymous online action as connective action; as focused and communicative political activism aimed to contest the authorities’ Covid-19 response during the pandemic in Finland.\n\nOur empirical analysis uses the historical Twitter data, over 4.2 million tweets, by pseudoanonymous Twitter accounts predominantly tweeting about Covid-19 (n = 229). Using mention and retweet networks combined with profile metrics and qualitative reading of tweets filtered through the network analysis, we explore the networked activity of these accounts, the strategies they have employed to contest authorities, and their connections to political actors and other more organized forms of mobilization around Covid-19.\n\nThe preliminary analysis highlights the prominence of these accounts in Covid-19 related Twitter discussions, along with their distinct behavioural features. Pseudoanonymous accounts average shorter lifespans and higher deactivation rates. Some accounts have transitioned from named accounts towards identity-concealing action during the observation period. Further, our analysis reveals a symbiotic relationship between the pseudoanonymous accounts and the established Covid-19 movements. We argue that pseudoanonymous participation is an increasingly emblematic form of connective action afforded by social media platforms, particularly fitted to undermine the legitimacy of authorities.</jats:p>",

It is a cynical word of caution from supposedly more experienced and savvy internet users, against a slew of negative, abusive, and unhelpful comments that are usually rampant online, stemming from trolling behaviour (Phillips 2015). “Don’t Read The Comments” has become an internet meme. Alongside parody websites (i.e. @AvoidComments n.d.), trawling through the comments section in search of ludicrosity has become an internet genre in and of itself. This comprises the likes of meme factory ‘The Straits Times Comment Section’ which collates absurd comments from users on a specific newspaper’s Facebook page (STcomments n.d.), as well as internet celebrity troll commentators like ‘American Ken’ M (Know Your Meme n.d.) and Singaporean ‘Peter Tan’ (Yeoh 2018), who post comments on a network of social media and fora in stealthily satirical ways that have even been co-opted for advertorials (Vox 2016). Such vernacular practice has in turn provoked a counter-genre of memes known as “I’m just Here For The Comments” (Tenor n.d.), in which users closely follow social media posts mainly for the resulting discussion and engagement in the comments section rather than the actual post itself. It is on this point of departure that this panel turns its focus to commenting cultures across platforms.</jats:p>",

To do this, panelists reflect on the many forms and political textures digitally mediated visuals can assume (online and offline), and considers the specific role of digital affordances and platform politics in sustaining these practices. Panelists address key questions: 1) how do digitally mediated visuals enact forms of (in)justice?; 2) what potentials or limitations do digitally mediated visuals generate for scholars wishing to understand broader sociopolitical contentions?; and 3) what conceptual and methodological tools should (Internet) scholars employ to study the contentious politics of digitally mediated visuals (and with what ethical implications)? Drawing from media and communication, international relations, cultural studies and discourse theory, panelists address a variety of sociopolitical topics across platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter) and territories, including: US black justice movements, sexual racism in Latin America and Southeast Asia, conflicts over representations of death in the Middle East, and transnational movements for trans rights activism. Panelists engage with Internet research to investigate the contentious politics of digitally mediated visuals by drawing on several perspectives to challenge hegemonic conceptions, Western biases and dominant discourses. They also mobilize qualitative or hybrid methods to track the trajectories of digitally mediated visuals to understand their biographies and sociopolitical productiveness in the context of their emergence, methods particularly interesting for Internet studies considering ongoing critiques against big data approaches.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PODCASTING IN TRANSITION: FORMALIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Podcasting has thrived since its popularization in 2004 as a bastion for amateur media production. Over the past ten years, however, entrepreneurs and legacy media companies have rapidly expanded their interests in podcasting, bringing with them professional standards and the logics of capital. Breakout hits such as 2014’s Serial (with nearly 40 million downloads) and This American Life have demonstrated to both programmers and advertisers the potential for podcasting to emerge as a commercially viable media industry (O’Connell, 2015). According to a recent nationwide survey by Edison Research (2019), an estimated 90 million listeners reported having listened to a podcast in the previous month. Despite the medium’s homespun, DIY roots, this dramatic expansion of the podcast audience and interest from legacy media has begun to transform it “from a do-it-yourself, amateur niche medium into a commercial mass medium” (Bonini, 2015, p. 27). This proposed panel aims to explore the transitions currently underway in podcasting. Specifically, each of the papers on this panel address in some way the process of formalization, or the process by which “media systems become progressively more rationalized, consolidated and financially transparent” (Lobato &amp;Thomas, 2015, p. 27). Formalization is not a monolithic process, but rather one that is responsive to existing institutional, regulatory, and cultural structures. It is also historically contingent. The first paper, entitled “Podcasting as a cultural form between old and new media” utilizes a historical lens to link the current trajectory of the medium’s development to the development and domestication of radio in the 1920s as well as the rise of online streaming services in the 21st Century. In particular, this paper situates podcasting in the context of these earlier technologies, arguing that the medium is best understood as a complex interplay between networks of market actors. This complex interplay of actors is explored in more detail by papers 2 and 3. In the second paper, entitled “Formalising the informal: BBC commissions and the shape of podcasts,” the author explores the powerful role of the BBC in providing an institutional and creative framework for podcasting production via its BBC Sounds online radio platform. Through the efforts of this venerable public service broadcaster to reach new audiences by developing podcast content specific to this platform, this paper argues that the medium’s amateur and informal ethos stands to be re-shaped. The third paper, entitled “Protecting public podcasting: Are U.S. news, public affairs, and learning podcasts at risk?”, takes a macro-level view of the formalization process, focusing on podcasts within the U.S. context. Nothing that the most popular podcasts in the U.S. are either learning or information-oriented, this paper argues that the podcast ecosystem fulfills an important public service function. The introduction of platform services like Spotify as power players in podcast distribution, coupled with the rise of advertising as a means of monetization, presents new risks for perpetuation of the medium as an aural public service resource. The fourth paper expands the arguments surrounding podcast formalization by exploring the introduction of market information regimes within the medium. Specifically, this paper explores the development of audience metrics for podcasting, beginning in the mid-2000’s. This paper makes clear that powerful industry players such as Apple and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) are quickly standardizing the measurement of podcast audiences. These standards create a more transparent market for advertisers, but in so doing they also shift the focus away from the unique nature of podcast content and move it toward notions of audience size. This has the potential to move the medium further away from its amateur roots. Finally, the fifth paper on the panel attempts to reframe the formalization debate by pulling the discussion away from the confining binaries of utopian or dystopian narratives. Instead, this paper situates podcasting within a much broader context by leveraging Don Idhe’s phenomenological philosophy of technology to “speculate on a potential future of reified oral/aural meditation.” This paper considers the nature of the medium itself as a unique “techno-sonic experience”. Here, podcasting is not considered as a medium being shaped by the formalization efforts of institutions or legacy forms of media. Instead, podcasting emerges as a transformational technology that promises a new era of sound integration.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Often hated during its lifespan in product (1996-2006), Clippy – Microsoft’s Office Assistant, became a pop-culture icon in its afterlife. Delving into the plethora of memes featuring Clippy, we ask: why should a questionable character from a software program that has been out of use for well over a decade have so vibrant an afterlife? If Clippy has become a rhetorical resource, what is it being used to do? We propose that Clippy’s dual status as the original natural-language digital assistant, one that fell critically short in its ability to actually assist, makes it an ideal vehicle for critique of today’s ubiquitous assistants. An analysis of 1,148 meme instances collected from five sites led to a twofold argument: First, Clippy humor relies on the contrast between types of intelligence; Clippy is often too good at one kind, while lacking in another. In particular, Clippy lacks interpersonal intelligence: it serves as a disruptive mediator between its user and the world, as well as other human beings.&#x0D;\nYet this failure in “knowing its limits” and adapting to its environment is also what gives Clippy character. This suggests that digital assistants must attend to multiple kinds of intelligences; attending to any one over others may create an endearing character but not an effective digital assistant. Furthermore, the fact that the unbending yet personality-filled character of Clippy remains ungendered or male gives us insight into the pliant and empty characters of the female gendered Alexa, Siri, and Cortana.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PERFORMING DEATH AND TRAUMA? PARTICIPATORY MEM(E)ORY AND THE HOLOCAUST IN TIKTOK #POVCHALLENGES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>TikTok is no longer the short-video platform for “silly dances.” Its transition from entertainment to an interest-based platform increased the visual volume of topics like the Holocaust, especially during August 2020, when a controversial meme-trend emerged under the popular hashtag #POVHolocaustChallenge. In this challenge, TikTokers were encouraged to participate in a point-of-view (POV) performance in which they reenacted fictionalized memories of Holocaust victims. This study draws attention to the unique nature of the #POVchallenge form on TikTok as a series of fictional memes that mediate users’ self-reflections on various social, political, and historical issues. By applying a multimodal analysis to 250 videos from the #POVHolocaustChallenge, we illuminate three imaginative and memetically reoccurring narratives in users’ (re)mediations of memories using POV aesthetics that we name mem(e)ories. (1) Testimonial - TikTokers posing as dead Holocaust victims, testifying from heaven after being murdered by Nazis. (2) Punitive - TikTokers playing prisoners in the present (2020) being sent back to tragic events as punishment for their crimes. (3) Escapist - TikTokers time traveling while merging 1940 with 2020 in a complex temporal interplay. Based also on interviews with fifteen TikTokers who participated in the challenges and five representatives of Holocaust-related institutions, we claim that the #POVHolocaustChallenge enables users’ (re)mediation of knowledge on past events and facilitates personal connections to the memory of the Holocaust via video-memes. The affective influence of multimodal memes on TikTok can spark conversation, interpretation, and reflection among youth while inviting the inscription of Holocaust memory into their (social media) lives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Blunt and Sheringham (2019) call for home-city geographies but do not consider the role of digital technologies in mediating these relations (Koch and Miles, 2021). Digital geographers have largely examined manifestations of the digital city (smart city, platform urbanism, etc.) and the digital home separately. This paper explores the question of the smart home/city by reading it through a series of established analytical frames for reflecting on the relationship between domestic and urban space, namely: governance, domestication, thresholds, and dwelling. The first two call attention to the movement of certain activities, relations, or processes across traditionally understood boundaries between domestic and urban spaces. The third lens, thresholds, considers the ways boundaries between domestic and urban space are not simply transgressed but are actively re-negotiated through the new digital mediations. The fourth lens, dwelling, moves beyond a focus on such boundaries or divisions to instead highlight the ambiguity and indeterminacy of everyday life. Each lens opens a distinct set of questions about the evolving spatialities of digital life and the ways they are enacted, negotiated, and potentially contested.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE UN COMMITTEE ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD’S GENERAL COMMENT ON THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>For too long, child rights advocates knew little about the internet while internet governance experts knew little about children’s rights. In March 2021, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) adopted General Comment 25 (GC25) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment. A General Comment is an authoritative document which sets out how states should implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in specific contexts, such as the digital environment.\n\nLike the Convention itself, General Comment 25 needs to apply in wealthier and poorer nations, to governments of all political stripes, and for all children whatever their abilities or circumstances. It has to balance the provision of guidance on a very broad range of issues with adequate depth, so as to be meaningfully applied. And it has to shore up children’s rights today, while also anticipating the risks of harm and the potential benefits associated with future developments in the technological environment.\n\nA major cross-sector and international collaborative effort was required to ensure GC25 could achieve its aims. To inform the process, the drafting team coordinated an international public consultation, receiving unprecedented numbers of submissions; consulted with 50 experts from across jurisdictions; and conducted consultations with over 700 children in 27 countries. This process surfaced deep theoretical dilemmas and disagreements, as well as diverse practical challenges for implementing meaningful and actionable digital policy.\n\nFor the child rights advocates uncertain exactly how to realize rights online as offline, GC25 provides a mandate and agenda. For policymakers uncertain where children fit into ongoing debates over internet governance, GC25 provides explanation and direction. For the public keen for children to thrive in a digital world, no longer ‘canaries in the coal mine,’ GC25 provides the road map for states to generate improvements. For 1000+ children consulted around the world, and the one in three internet users under 18 for whom they spoke, GC25 reflects their views on a matter that affects them greatly.\n\nBut it is easier to say that rights offline also apply online than it is to achieve this in practice. On publication, GC25 was recognized by OECD, United Nations Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development Goals, ECPAT (the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children), International Telecommunication Union, UNESCO, WeProtect Global Alliance, World Childhood Foundation USA, World Health Organization and the European Commission. However, it is states rather than regional or other bodies who are the primary duty bearers bound to implement the Convention and its General Comments under international law. GC25 landed on the desk of every government in the world, and they must ensure that all duty bearers within their jurisdiction meet their responsibilities to children’s rights – including businesses and others whose activities significantly impact on children.\n\nIntroduced and chaired by members of the GC25 drafting team responsible for the international consultations among stakeholders and children, this panel discusses ongoing efforts to interpret and implement GC25. Conceiving the child as a limit case for policy development, and recognising that, far from abstract legal principles, children’s rights come to life at the level of children’s everyday experiences, the panel will reflect on the difficulties of generating policy guidance to protect and uphold children’s rights in a digital age. It highlights the particular challenges for communication policy and law, including generating the evidence base and meaningful participation from children regarding child online protection policy in Zimbabwe (paper 1), aligning state with regional policies in Europe so as to provide a coordinated and rights-respecting framework for internet governance (paper 2), reconciling parents’ responsibilities with children’s rights regarding privacy in the US (paper 3), and translating child rights-respecting initiatives into designing digital products and services used by children (paper 4). While four papers cannot capture the full range of issues that arise in relation to children’s rights in the digital environment, the panel represents perspectives from three very different continents which contrasting approaches both to children and to internet governance. Through their commonalities and differences, the panel will seek to open a dialogue that represents diverse experiences across cultures and contexts, including the struggles and possible contestation that UN initiatives can occasion. A respondent to all four papers will reflect on the challenges of promoting coordination and implementing child rights-respecting governance in contexts of global inequality and conflict. Building on his role as expert advisor to the United Nations, he will suggest a framework for advancing the recommendations of General Comment internationally, before opening up the discussion for participation among the chairs, panellist and delegates.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses methodological, ethical, and empirical problematics related to forced changes in the research design of a comparative project during the Covid-19 pandemic, and its wider implications for future online audience research.\n\nThe larger project aims to understand media users’ attitudes towards corporate and state surveillance in countries with different historical surveillance regimes: Estonia, Portugal, and Sweden. In a mixed-methods design, comprising an online survey and focus groups (FGs), we sampled participants from two generational cohorts: born in 1946-1953 and in 1988-1995. In each country, we planned six face-to-face FGs with people from these generational cohorts, divided into three gender-balanced groups with different profiles: higher education; mixed education, living in small cities/countryside; secondary education.\n\nThe paper discusses the challenges of conducing FGs online, namely the effects of the technological interface on the group size and interaction, the importance of digital skills, and ethics-related considerations.\n\nAlthough we encountered cultural differences between the three countries, our main methodological lessons and suggestions for further audience studies center on the need to consider the subtle facets of inter-generational differences when planning online research. As we witnessed, not all barriers were rooted in access to technology and connectivity. The level of digital skills and self-confidence in use also played a role in participants' possibilities and willingness for taking part in online research. Further research is needed to explore how age and online methods intersect, and the role online settings play, in the experience of focus group and interview participants with various social backgrounds.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The term _values_ is prominent in political discourse. Yet its ubiquity is matched by its vagueness, especially when considering usage among different cultures. Twitter provides a promising venue for exploring the contested political discourse surrounding this term.\n\nIn this paper, we study the use of the term values on Twitter across different language communities. We ask: _what meanings do users ascribe to the term “values”?_ and _what are the social and political discursive functions of the term?_ For both questions, we will explore cross-cultural similarities and differences.\n\nWe compiled a corpus of around 15 million tweets containing the term _values_ from 2019-2021 in English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean. We use two complementary methods for analyzing the data: 1) a big-data computational analysis, finding the most prominent terms co-occurring with and phrases containing the term _values_; 2) a systematic content analysis of a smaller subset of the corpus.\n\n*Preliminary Results of English and Japanese tweets suggest* fundamental differences in how the two languages frame _values_: while the term in English appears mainly in a partisan political context, Japanese usage is far more personal and apolitical. In the English corpus, the term is often invoked in politically motivated rhetorical attacks, often alleging hypocrisy. In the Japanese corpus, tweeters use the term to promote a societal norm of respecting others’ values and to discuss generational gaps.\n\nOur analysis demonstrates the potential of Twitter-based research for unpacking the meanings and functions of this core concept, across cultures.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, we explore two parallel but related networks of\n        discourse that arose during the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n        (UNFCCC) negotiations of 2019 in Madrid: one produced by news media coverage of the talks;\n        the other by Twitter users who shared news content about the talks. As these networks\n        disseminated information about the UNFCCC’s 25th Conference of the Parties (COP25), we see\n        them as key channels of communication for a potentially transnational public sphere of\n        dialogue and dissent, even if the existence or efficacy of such a transnational sphere is a\n        matter of great debate (Fraser, 2007). Our aim is to compare the internal (within network)\n        and external (across networks) homogeneity and homogeneity of these two networks in terms of\n        structure (e.g., language, geographic groups, etc.), dominant topics, and sentiments. We\n        find that a potential for the emergence of transnational public spheres lies in\n        contradictory currents of homogeneity and heterogeneity in transnational networks related to\n        1) the social capital of certain actors; 2) institutional infrastructures such as U.N.\n        processes; 3) media ownership structures; 4) different cultural practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Community Notes (formerly named “Birdwatch”) is Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program to combat mis- and dis-information. By signing up to be a Birdwatch contributor, a user can add contextual notes and commentary to other tweets as well as rate the contributions of others. User submissions to the Community Notes program also serve as metacommentary on the platform more generally. Beyond their fact-checking role, Birdwatch notes also illuminate how some users perceived Elon Musk’s recent purchase of the platform and how the subsequent changes aligned with their own understandings of what the platform ought to be.\n\nThis paper describes Birdwatch Archive, a project to archive Twitter’s Community Notes program by parsing the data that Twitter publicly releases from the Birdwatch program and displaying it in a searchable and organized fashion that is accessible and useful to researchers. Using the anonymous user identification strings from each TSV file, the website enables researchers to assess how frequently users contribute to the Community Notes program by grouping notes and ratings they have provided.\n\nEven as Twitter continues to devolve and collapse, we can try to learn from how users described and understood the platform. When studying major platforms, we cannot rely solely upon the data made accessible by the platform itself. Instead, we must look for opportunities to create “rogue archives” of online settings, which includes turning sources that are not as frequently viewed by most users.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Sharing of parenthood experiences can be performed by ordinary users,\n        to influencers and celebrities. This paper seeks to understand the digital identity of a\n        child of a global celebrity through their presentation on social media, and to analyse\n        qualitatively the visual formats of children’s representation in a platformised digital\n        environment. It focuses on the representation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s children, especially\n        his oldest son (Junior), through his Instagram account, his wife’s and his mother’s, in a\n        two-year period. After identifying the main forms of representation of the children, we\n        searched for images of Cristiano Junior across image search engines, social media platforms,\n        sites and repositories; then, we used reverse image search for the identified memes.\n        Ronaldo’s children are represented at home and family moments, playing and amidst luxury;\n        10-year-old Junior is presented as the ‘natural successor’ to Ronaldo’s talent for football,\n        and also takes part in social or business events in public places. Visual representations\n        created by Ronaldo’s sharenting are specially appropriated into memes that mock the football\n        celebrity’s narcissism; or the fact that the child doesn’t know how to pose for selfies.\n        Cristiano’s children’s digital identity and Junior’s, in particular, is populated with\n        images as shared by parents and wider family, as well as constructed through participatory\n        culture. An archaeological approach to visual social media content is not without\n        difficulties, but proved to be fruitful to unpack the tensions of this wide visibility and\n        the meanings it creates for the (digital) identity of the child.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on how remote workers experienced their job and\n        everyday life during the Italian lockdown imposed by the national government to contain the\n        spread of COVID-19. Specifically, this contribution focuses on the interdependence of work\n        and everyday life, and the role of digital devices and online platforms during the\n        home-confinement period, and it explores the consequences of social distancing measures on\n        remote workers and on their working and personal conditions. The study draws from 20\n        in-depth semi-structured interviews with remote workers, i.e., individuals which could work\n        from home through digital technologies during the national lockdown. Results highlight that\n        during the lockdown, some participants attempted to cope with the unprecedented triumph of\n        technologically mediated work, others described remote work as liberating and attractive, as\n        it avoids commuting and allow people to organize their activities autonomously, without\n        constraints of space and time. However, their initial enthusiasm decreased after a few weeks\n        of domestic confinement. The experience of remote workers that emerges is a “fractured” one,\n        which appears as a characteristic feature of forced and continuous remote work. Indeed, the\n        coronavirus crisis has accentuated the infrastructural role of digital platforms and\n        intensified the ‘deep mediatization’ of social life and labour, thereby normalizing\n        transmedia work and the ‘extension of already media saturated working\n        conditions’.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the (limited) discussion of climate change within\n        energy debates on Australian technology forum Whirlpool. These discussions are characterised\n        by $2 , which is an attitude that no technology is $2 or $2 than any other because different\n        technologies have different applications depending on the requirement. By completing a\n        thematic analysis of all Whirlpool replies within four threads centred on energy debates (n\n        = 3,101), I observed Whirlpool contributors depoliticise energy technologies by removing\n        climate change as a factor when considering technology choices. Overall, I found that when\n        technological agnosticism was expressed within these debates, it intersected with issues\n        concerning the $2 , $2 , $2 , and $2 of technology and pushed against concerns regarding\n        climate change. I argue that the prevalence of technological agnosticism within these\n        debates is not an example of climate change denial per se but a reflection of Whirlpool’s\n        platform culture which valorises traits of $2 such as rationality and neutrality (Massanari,\n        2017). I conclude by comparing Whirlpool’s platform culture to Reddit and suggest that\n        future research ought to explore how particular platform cultures shape energy debates and\n        ultimately, attitudes and action towards climate change.</jats:p>",

I address the online campaign from\n        the point of view of affect, especially the “feeling of being counted” (Coleman 2013;\n        Papacharissi 2015, 25), in several senses. Through media autoetnography and qualitative\n        content analysis of online material, I address the campaign as the experience of becoming\n        part in the counted people, who come to politically matter.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper adopts the lens of social media rituals to study a new\n        incarnation of ritualized greetings: good morning memes. These are a popular yet\n        under-studied form of ritualized greeting posted every morning by social media users across\n        the global. Such memes feature text with a wish for the incoming day paired with elements\n        such as flowers, food or animals. In this paper, I focus on the ways in which these memes\n        construct values, broadly defined as guiding beliefs about the desirable. My analysis is\n        based on a sample of 414 good morning memes posted to Instagram in English and Italian. I\n        conducted a content analysis examining the posts for content (protagonist and background),\n        the main values conveyed (e.g. achievement and self-efficacy, happiness and positivity), and\n        their stance (serious or ironic). A preliminary analysis revealed strong consistency in the\n        dataset. Overall, good morning memes embed the general mandate for “politeness” that infuses\n        the communicative genre of greetings, transposing it in the meme format through impersonal\n        messages and a saccharine aesthetic. Furthermore, the memes voice a shared core of values,\n        namely: “Happiness and positivity” and “performative kindness.” However, the English and\n        Italian subsets also diverge in significant ways. The English language version of the meme\n        upholds the value of “achievement and self-efficacy,” possibly because of the influence of\n        American values on globalized social media content. Conversely, the Italian-language version\n        of the meme uses humor to pushback against the idea that the morning is a time to be\n        energetic and productive.</jats:p>",

This study draws on in-depth interviews with youth climate\n        activists, along with digital ethnography and surveys, conducted between 2019 and 2021.\n        Findings show that young climate organizers galvanized social media to shift to remote and\n        hybrid organizing tactics. At the same time, inequalities introduced by social media\n        platforms and algorithms became more acute for the youth movement.</jats:p>",

Crucially,\n        governments are leveraging the power of platforms to impose new forms of restrictions on\n        free expression, and engage in surveillance of individuals and online activism. This has\n        profound implications for the rights to freedom of expression, privacy, and data protection.\n        Further, platforms that once refused to cooperate with governments in identifying users\n        responsible for disseminating allegedly illegal or harmful content are now expanding\n        cooperation with authorities, including sharing data about users flagged by law enforcement\n        and other authorities. As civil society organisations warn, this trend is contributing to\n        ‘invasive and unlawful digital surveillance’ (Amnesty International, 2019, p. 24). This\n        paper examines how European governments are leveraging the power of digital platforms to\n        engage in government surveillance online, and assesses the compatibility of these measures\n        with European human rights law. The paper applies a unique interdisciplinary perspective,\n        bringing together law, political communication and surveillance studies. First, the paper\n        examines how platforms’ algorithmic systems shape (and limit) information dissemination. The\n        paper then critically analyses government-platform initiatives that exist to surveil\n        citizens and gather information, including new measures under the EU’s proposed Digital\n        Services Act. Third, it assesses how these measures comply with freedom of expression and\n        the right to privacy, and concludes with recommendations on remedying problematic elements\n        of the role platforms play in digitisation of government surveillance.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ON(LINE) TRANSPARENCY AND THE BLACK PUBLIC SPHERE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past several decades, Black publics have increasingly employed\n        digital technologies to advance Black liberation movements, culture, and joy. This\n        proliferation of Black publics online has prompted many scholars to ask whether the internet\n        as a tool ultimately works to the benefit or detriment of marginal publics. Proponents of\n        internet technology cite the aforementioned growth of these discursive communities online as\n        well as their success in organizing demonstrations and producing independent media. Critics\n        of the internet argue that its construction by powerful institutions forecloses the\n        possibility of it being used to truly challenge those institutions. This essay seeks to\n        contribute to this discussion not by advocating for one side or another but exploring the\n        ways in which these two literatures may be inclusive. It does so by putting the theoretical\n        construct of the Black public in conversation with an oft-discussed digital affordance:\n        transparency. It first outlines the historical relationship between the two, noting both the\n        threats and opportunities that transparency has created for Black publics. It moves on to\n        discuss the forces of the state and the market that built transparency into the\n        infrastructure of the internet. It then synthesizes the histories of Black publics and the\n        internet by discussing how the historical threats and opportunities of transparency are\n        impacting Black publics online. Finally, this paper concludes with some thoughts on the idea\n        that digital technology might simultaneously aid and harm marginal publics, particularly\n        with regard to its implications for digital strategy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How we imagine our place within the structure of sociotechnical-human\n        relationships—specifically, in domains of life affected by data-analytics and the\n        probabilistic bets institutions and people in power make on the future of our credit\n        worthiness, political leanings, shopping habits etc.—is our “algorithmic imagination.” The\n        purpose of this panel is to explore the “algorithmic imagination” as it manifests in\n        particular scholarly, historical, socio-cultural, and technical contexts. The panelists\n        prioritize how social actors, situated in distinct settings, go about constructing an\n        “algorithmic imagination” in conversation/opposition with how computational systems have\n        “imagined” them; they will also reflect critically and self-reflexively on the implications\n        of an algorithmic imagination, so conceived. Collectively, the panelists demure from\n        monolithic understandings of the “algorithmic imagination” while also embracing algorithmic\n        intersectionality. The primary contention of this panel is that the ways in which algorithms\n        have been “thought,” or imagined, have made it difficult to conceive of practicable\n        strategies for transforming algorithmic cultures and, indeed, for delinking them from both\n        state and corporate control. The panel, thus, makes three primary contributions. First, we\n        situate, define, and distinguish the concept, “algorithmic imagination.” Second, the panel\n        provides analyses of key facets of the algorithmic imagination, in specific historical\n        settings and life-worlds defined by intersectionality. Lastly, it aims to contribute,\n        however provisionally, to a political theory that recognizes the deterministic power of\n        computational systems but rejects the notion that power is inherently democratic or\n        monolithically insurmountable.</jats:p>",

Given the complexities of the primary race, with candidates aiming to differentiate themselves within their own party, we ask whether the candidates in both parties engage in creating “lanes” by owning specific policy topics. Use supervised machine-learning and a lexicon approach to classify candidate posts on twelve different political topics, we analyze Facebook and Twitter messages from 17 Republicans and 19 Democrats during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections. We find that Democrats are more likely to post about the issues on social media, and Republicans and Democrats talk about significantly different topics. We also find that candidates of both parties tended to advocate for the issues they cared about, rather than attack opponents on issues.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With the growing centrality of the smartphone in everyday life, the news and public information that young people consume is increasingly subject to algorithmic curation. From the apps and websites of legacy news media to news aggregators and social media, more and more spaces through which young people access news are personalized. Yet, while numerous studies explore algorithms’ influence on citizens’ everyday life, few of these have considered how users themselves perceive and deal with news personalization. This paper considers how young news users experience the algorithmic selection of the news they receive via their smartphones, and how and under what circumstances they aim to negotiate these decisions. Combining walk-through methods with in-depth interviews, it explores young people’s perceptions of algorithms affect their practices on personalized news media and how they aim to intervene in news personalization. The paper finds a variety of tactics through which audiences intervene in algorithmic news selection, arguing that these can be seen as expressions of algorithmic literacy. These practices, however, are far from self-evident: overall, even amongst frequent users of personalized media, algorithmic awareness and knowledge are low. Moreover, such literacy varies considerably between platform contexts. This is problematic, as these deficiencies prevent young people from assessing the completeness, accuracy and balance of the news they are exposed to. Thus, the study stresses a need for media educators to pay more attention to how algorithmic curation shapes the news that users encounter, to further empower young people to navigate an increasingly personalized media landscape.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study seeks to understand the practice of the deletion of tweets by journalists while arguing that these uniquely reflect the contemporary fragility of archiving and journalism – two human enterprises central to societies’ ability to reflexively consider the past and present and democratically chart a future course. From the perspective of journalism as a profession, it argues that the study of tweet deletion is a means of examining the constraints under which journalists operate today including the occupational precarity and polarized public sphere with which they contend. From the web archival perspective, this study methodologically informs scholars who are relying on public tweets as a source for their research as well as other social actors – such as NGOs, activists, politicians, cultural producers – who rely on social media as a web archive in their public activities. It proposes to identify some of the voices that will be removed from this public square as it becomes a public archive and highlights the proactive ephemerality of journalistic social media content. Based on interviews conducted in the winter of 2019 with 17 journalists working in New York City, the study examines how journalists perceive the action of deleting their tweets and how they justify it.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper draws on a study that included two types of materials: firstly, visual and textual analysis of a selection of smart cities’ websites; and secondly, a review of published literature on smart cities and the environment. In both, a celebratory narrative of environmental efficiency prevails. Although ecology is usually not the primary focus of smart cities’ self-promotion, their websites tell a story of how smart cities would ultimately make the environment better, cleaner, and greener. The literature, similarly, talks about “sharing cities”; “green growth”, “green infrastructure”, “progressive urbanisation”, “sustainable urbanism”, “green technology innovation”, “resilient cities”, “smart future” and more. However, despite the overwhelming rhetoric of being environmental saviours, smart cities pose multiple ecological threats, most of which are invisibilised, because they take place elsewhere: the extraction of resources needed to produce the actual devices; the toxicity of their production process and the e-waste left behind; and the rapidly increasing energy demands of data farms, needed to sustain every air pollution sensor, every city dashboard, every smart bus stop, every ‘smart’ communication network. At the heart of my paper lies a troubling, yet crucial question: how to reconcile the rapid and expansive adoption of various smart technologies into environmentally driven initiatives and sustainability projects such as smart cities, with the extensive environmental damages brought on by the digitization itself? How, in other words, can we think about smart cities environmental promises, while taking into account their dirty material politics?</jats:p>",

In three extended phases of ethnographic field work (participant observations) and artefact analyses of digital media in non-formal educational contexts such as youth welfare institutions (e.g. residental groups, pedagogical family assistance and youth-cafés) formal educational contexts (e.g. schools, vocational training etc.) and informal spaces (e.g. family, peer activities etc.) implicit and unplanned as well as explicit and pedagogically planned uses of digital media are focused. The central research question in this paper is what importance (if any) does digital media (such as social media sites, apps, smartphones, learning software etc.) have in the everyday life of young refugees when it comes to educational practices and coping in the everyday life. In this context, practices and their relation to aspects of unequal basic conditions (e.g. level of education) and digital inequalities (e.g. reproduction of disadvantages in media usage, differences in media experiences etc.) are analyzed. This paper presents the empirical work in progress focusing methodological and ethical challenges in research at the intersection of sensitive areas such as forced migration, youth welfare, private life and schooling.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Municipal open data platforms are currently caught in a range of tensions. They rely on an unspecified subject to analyze the data, and yet are surrounded by discourses of \"empowerment\" and \"transparency\". They are often most beneficient when approached with data science skills, yet often entail unremunerated digital labor. And they are often engaged by organizations tacking \"for Social Good\" onto their mandate - the Canada-wide organization Data for Good being a key example. To date, STS research has generated important insights into the political economies of data and platforms that highlight the ways they produce, mediate, circulate, and accumulate surplus and exchange value. Less attention has been devoted to understanding the ways moral values and sentiments are deployed to attract the digital volunteered labor subtending municipal open data platform usage. Those who mobilize these moral economies are deeply situated within capitalist platform economies, and benefit from the free labor of those wishing to improve their communities. In this presentation, we argue that hackathons, datathons, and open data platforms are constituted through moral economies that are entangled within technoscientific capitalist accumulation practices and logics. These moral economies are key ways in which digital labor is procured, and represent a core component of what Boltanski and Chiapello call the \"new spirit of capitalism\". To substantiate our argument, we draw on an ongoing long-term ethnography into Calgary, Alberta's open data ecosystem. We conclude by politicizing the fissures of these moral economies, to identify the new political strategies that they necessitate.</jats:p>",

    "title": "INFLUENCER CULTURE &amp; ALGORITHMIC APARTHEID ON GAY INSTAGRAM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on social media influencers has concluded that influencers’\n        status is always contingent upon meeting followers’ demand for specific\n        “performances-of-self,” as well as making themselves and their content available and\n        visible. However, few scholars have addressed the role that algorithms play in determining\n        which influencers might be made visible, and therefore the manner by which platform design\n        predetermines who may attain influencer status. This project seeks to address this gap in\n        this research by providing critical ethnographic insights into what is colloquially referred\n        to as “gay Instagram.” Throughout a three-year period, I maintained an Instagram account\n        through which I observed trends in the production and consumption of homoerotic content\n        utilizing a variety of methods. Of these, “algorithmic audits” provided the most insight\n        into the manner by which algorithmic and social biases compound one another to\n        hyper-visibilize a small minority of homoerotic content creators. Once Instagram has\n        determined that a user is interested in homoerotic content, that user can expect the\n        overrepresentation of white, mostly American Instagays on their “explore” page, in the\n        promoted content featured on their feed, and so on. In effect, determinations of the most\n        desirable homoerotic content are made through a variety of selection biases that make access\n        to visibility an unequal enterprise on Instagram. Through these biases, white elites in\n        Western metropolises are made more visible to Instagram users, even when others could\n        conceivably fulfill their same representational function, troubling the notion that\n        influencer status can be attained through an individual’s “labor” without algorithmic\n        assistance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Conversation (theconversation.com) represents a unique model for communicating scholarly research to the general public via explanatory journalism. Rather than relying on scholars’ personal networks, the promotional efforts of university press offices, or requests from science journalists for comments on current developments, The Conversation offers a platform for scholars across all disciplines to pitch their own stories, gain support from its in-house journalistic staff to develop those stories for a general audience, and see the resulting articles published under Creative Commons licences, enabling them to be republished by commercial and public service news outlets around the world. The overall success of this model, which may be described as ‘journalism-as-a-service’, is evident: articles from The Conversation are regularly republished by major international news outlets from the New York Times through CNN to The Guardian, as well as by domestic outlets across the eight countries and regions in which The Conversation now operates. This panel provides a broad-ranging and multi-faceted assessment of the status of the Conversation project, in its tenth year of operation. The current COVID-19 crisis has particularly highlighted the crisis of expertise and unevenness of scientific literacy amongst journalists, politicians, and the general public. The panel’s assessment of the successes and failures of one of the leading digital science communication initiatives of the past decade provides an important reality check, and offers new insights on what can be done to increase the visibility and impact of rigorous scholarly perspectives from all disciplines of research in public and political debates.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade online spaces and digital tools have become a central part of scholarly work and research mobilization (Carrigan, 2016). However, the integration and reliance on these technologies into scholars’ work lives have heightened their online visibility, which has opened the door to new experiences of online abuse. Previous research shows that online abuse has negative impacts on scholars’ work, and that they are left to deal with the consequences of online abuse primarily on their own, with little support from their institution (Authors, 2018a; 2018b). Given the importance of online spaces/tools in scholars' lives and the detrimental impacts of harassment, colleges and universities must recognize the risks associated with online visibility and have policies in place that address those risks. In this paper we analyze 41 workplace policies that deal with harassment and discrimination from Canadian Universities and Colleges to understand what these institutions propose to do about online abuse. We use Bacchi’s (2012) ‘What’s the problem represented to be?’ (WPR) approach. This approach encourages examination of the assumptions and conceptual logics within the framing of a problem in order to understand implicit problem representations. Early analysis identified two problems common across the 41 policies that limit their ability to offer protection and/or support in many cases of online abuse: the first limitation focuses on who the policies apply to, and the second on where the policies apply.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 2016 and 2020, Facebook allowed advertisers in the United\n        States to target their advertisements using three broad “ethnic affinity” categories:\n        “African American,” “U.S.-Hispanic,” and “Asian American.” This paper uses the life and\n        death of these “ethnic affinity” categories to argue that they exemplify a novel mode of\n        racialisation made possible by machine learning techniques. These categories worked by\n        analysing users’ preferences and behaviour: they were supposed to capture an “affinity” for\n        a broad demographic group, rather than registering membership of that group. That is, they\n        were supposed to allow advertisers to “personalise” content for users depending on\n        behaviourally determined affinities. We argue that, in effect, Facebook’s ethnic affinity\n        categories were supposed to operationalise a “post-racial” mode of categorising users. But\n        the paradox of personalisation is that in order to apprehend users as individuals, platforms\n        must first assemble them into groups based on their likenesses with other individuals. This\n        article uses an analysis of these categories to argue that even in the absence of data on a\n        user’s race—even after the demise of the categories themselves—users can still be subject to\n        techniques of inclusion or exclusion for discriminatory ends. The inductive machine learning\n        techniques that platforms like Facebook employ to classify users generate “proxies,” like\n        racialised preferences or language use, as racialising substitutes. This article concludes\n        by arguing that Facebook’s ethnic affinity categories in fact typify novel modes of\n        racialisation today.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past fifteen years, the emergence of intermediaries has\n        transformed the circulation of news content. Social media platforms and news aggregators\n        have become main gateways to news content. However, they don't circulate news but snippets\n        of existing news content. This article focuses on why those snippets are identified by users\n        as news. Drawing on social semiotics, this study uses the concept of genre - as a tacit and\n        conventional system of categorisation of texts or discursive practices (Neale, 1980), which\n        provides clues regarding how to interact with a text in a specific cultural situation\n        (Martin, 1984)- to understand the complex nature of the snippet. Using a multimodal analysis\n        of a series of over 150 Facebook news posts, this article argues that the design of Facebook\n        posts uses horizontal and vertical intertextuality, to generate a socially endorsed comment\n        on news. Therefore, Facebook cannot really by defined as a gateway to news content but\n        rather as an intertextual commenter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Today using the Internet implies primarily using digital platforms,\n        that actively participate in the co-construction of social life. In this scenario, users\n        have often been depicted as powerless, subjected to exploitative commercial practices, and\n        as having internalized their condition of surveilled and datafied individuals. However,\n        little attention has been paid to how individuals make sense of algorithms in their everyday\n        life and how exert their agency while using platforms.

Furthermore, a critical pedagogy approach can raise\n        awareness among individuals regarding processes of pervasive datafication and surveillance,\n        thereby being a way to redistribute social value to the public while doing social research\n        and a practice of independence and resistance to algorithmic surveillance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This project explores the potential of creating, sharing and listening to oral stories online to open affectively charged spaces for listening across difference. In a world in which we are increasingly able to tailor the technologies that surround us to echo back our own voices and worldviews, we seem less willing to slow down and listen deeply to the voices of those whose presence risk placing our tidy worlds into turmoil. This project explores the affective political potential of both the processes of production and dissemination of the multiplatform oral history project StoryCorps. Drawing together recent work on affect from rhetorical studies, cultural studies and new media studies, this project uses textual analysis to analyze how the various StoryCorps platforms (NPR segments, the podcast, the StoryCorps me app) generate affective archives that invite different forms of interactivity from listeners. This paper explores the affective power of mediated voice to bring minoritized experiences and calls for equity to the ears of broader publics. It is significant because it highlights the boundaries and possibilities of digital storytelling as a way to connect with others across difference. The boundaries remind us of the persistence of structures of marginality that limit the seemingly democratic practices of storytelling in a digital age; the possibilities gesture to the power of minoritized voices to disrupt entrenched narratives. The significance of these stories rests in their claim to be at once particular and generalizable, and the digital format enables their travel in new ways and to new audiences.</jats:p>",

Yet, a range of socio-technical innovations have contributed to the proliferation of drug markets on the Internet. Due to the illegality of drugs and drug dealing are anonymizing technologies regarded as important socio-technical practices among its participants allowing to mitigate risks of vendors and customers when exchanging drugs. This panel draws together a number of leading scholars in this emerging area of research to explore questions and issues associated with online platforms enabling illicit transactions. The collection of papers in this panel contribute empirical data and theoretical insight on a range of relevant topics in the study of online drug markets, including methodological challenges, social embeddedness, trust production and governance on cryptomarkets. Various papers in this panel propose new concepts for understanding cryptomarkets as social phenomena where relationships enable economic transactions. It also pluralizes trust building on online platforms and, expanding it from merely institution-based mechanisms to include social relations such as interpreting signs and signals or previous interactions between buyers and sellers. They also expand on reliability of data gathered via anonymous online interviews, drawing attention to participation of marginalized communities. The aim of this panel is to bring together new research to further our understanding of the overall impact of online platform emergence upon global drug markets and to better model their impact on drug dealing, online networks and society in general.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>News audiences are increasingly fragmented across different media platforms. Consequently, individual news organizations simultaneously disseminate their content across different media. Each of these media has different user bases, interface characteristics, and distribution systems. Given these substantial differences, the dynamics of the gatekeeping process – and the news values that guide this process – vary across different media technologies/platforms. As audience attention migrates from older to newer platforms (such as social media), it is increasingly important that we understand how the nature of the news that is disseminated – and thus consumed – may be different from the news disseminated through more traditional means. The ramifications of these differences can be profound if the news disseminated on the newer platforms is, for example, more or less substantive, more or less diverse, or more or less plentiful than the news disseminated on older technologies/platforms. This study addresses these issues through a comparative gatekeeping analysis of the New York Times. For this study, a month’s worth of New York Times front page, home page, and Facebook page story output are comparatively analyzed across dimensions such as story quantity, story duplication, hard versus soft news, and content diversity. The primary goal is to determine if or how the nature of the news that is prioritized for news consumers differs between the social media context and older contexts such as the print front page and the web home page.</jats:p>",

    "title": "A DIVISION OF LABOR: THE ROLE OF BIG DATA ANALYSIS IN THE REPERTOIRE OF INTERNET RESEARCH METHODS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, large-scale analysis of log data from digital devices - often termed \"\"big data analysis\"\" (Lazer, Kennedy, King, &amp; Vespignani, 2014) - have taken hold in the field of internet research. Through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and commercial measurement, scholars have been able to analyze social media users (Freelon 2014) and web audiences (Taneja, 2016) on an uprecedented scale. And by developing digital research tools, scholars have been able to track individuals across websites (Menchen-Trevino, 2013) and mobile applications (Ørmen &amp; Thorhauge 2015) in greater detail than ever before. Big data analysis holds unique potential for studying communication in depth and across many individuals (see e.g. Boase &amp; Ling, 2013; Prior, 2013). At the same time, this approach introduces new methodological challenges in the transparency of data collection (Webster, 2014), sampling of participants and validity of conclusions (Rieder, Abdulla, Poell, Woltering, &amp; Zack, 2015). Firstly, data aggregation is typically designed for commercial rather than academic purposes. The type of data included as well as how it is presented depend in large part on the business interests of measurement and advertisement companies (Webster, 2014). Secondly, when relying on this kind of secondary data it can be difficult to validate the output or techniques used to generate the data (Rieder, Abdulla, Poell, Woltering, &amp; Zack, 2015). Thirdly, often the unit of analysis is media-centric, taking specific websites or social network pages as the empirical basis instead of individual users (Taneja, 2016). This makes it hard to untangle the behavior of real-world users from the aggregate trends. Lastly, variations in what users do might be so large that it is necessary to move from the aggregate to smaller groups of users to make meaningful inferences (Welles, 2014). Internet research is thus faced with a new research approach in big data analysis with potentials and perils that need to be discussed in combination with traditional approaches. This panel explores the role of big data analysis in relation to the wider repertoire of methods in internet research. The panel comprises four presentations that each sheds light on the complementarity of big data analysis with more traditional qualitative and quantitative methods. The first presentation opens the discussion with an overview of strategies for combining digital traces and commercial audience data with qualitative interviews and quantitative survey methods. The next presentation explores the potential of trace data to improve upon the experimental method. Researcher-collected data enables scholars to operate in a real-world setting, in contrast to a research lab, while obtaining informed consent from participants. The third presentation argues that large-scale audience data provide a unique perspective on internet use. By integrating census-level information about users with detailed traces of their behavior across websites, commercial audience data combines the strength of surveys and digital trace data respectively. Lastly, the fourth presentation shows how multi-institutional collaboration makes it possible do document social media activity (on Twitter) for a whole country (Australia) in a comprehensive manner. A feat not possible through other methods on a similar scale. Through these four presentations, the panel aims to situate big data analysis in the broader repertoire of internet research methods. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\"This paper examines individual framings and experiences of temporal management via smartphone applications. It asks: to what extent and in what ways do configurations of smartphones and scheduling applications intervene in and restructure the temporality of practices and people’s experiences of time? The paper draws upon in-depth semi-structured interview material with (a) professional urban and suburban householders (N=25), (b) individuals transitioning to retirement (N=20), and (c) university students (N=25) to examine how a range of temporal expectations are being perceived, articulated, and negotiated in practice. Interviews included talking through temporal data of many kinds on personal devices. The analytic questions guiding interviews were: where do identifiable expectations about temporal synchronization, coordination, duration, reciprocity, and productivity come from? What are the relations between institutionally defined temporal expectations and subjective experiences of temporal ordering? Does data produced through daily activities alter the temporal contours of those activities? Are social actors reorienting themselves in-time, in relation to mediatized temporal expectations? In terms of findings, four modes of temporal management are identified and described in relation to demographic information. Following Sharma (2014), these are expressed here as ‘recalibrations’ – managing precariousness; synchronizing (to) the time of others; temporal self-disciplining; filling in future time - stressing the different ways in which temporal demands are perceived and experienced, leading to alternative efforts to coordinate and synchronize different elements of daily life through interconnected smartphone anchored applications.\"</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This proposal is a follow-up of the project “Mapping Italian News Media Political Coverage in the Lead-up to 2018 General Election” (MINE). MINE aimed at creating a comprehensive map of the political news coverage created by the Italian online news media in the lead-up to 2018 general election. The final report of the project highlighted how the populist narrative dominated the news (both in terms of volume of coverage and Facebook engagement), and pinpointed the diverging patterns of Facebook interactions employed by different partisan communities to amplify the reach of the contents aligned with their worldview by sharing the news stories on social media, while trying to reframe, through comments, the negative coverage of the party they support. These insights led to further questions concerning the nature of the observed diverging patterns of Facebook interactions around political news. In particular, we wondered if the observed patterns were the result of a spontaneous grassroots effort or instead of a strategically organised attempt to manipulate the online news media landscape in order to game platforms algorithms in support of specific viewpoints, candidates and parties. Data originally collected for MINE during 2018 via publically available Facebook API proved useful to identify the patterns, but fall short of providing compelling evidence on the nature of these behaviours. In order to shed some light on this question, we thus requested and obtained access to two additional datasets directly provided by Facebook and made available through the Social Science One (SSO) initiative.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the affective and ambiguous dynamics of feminist humor as an unexpected strategy of resistance in connection with #MeToo, asking what laughter may do to the sharpness of negative affects of shame and anger driving the movement. Firstly, we deploy Nanette—Hannah Gadsby’s 2018 Netflix success heralded as the comedy of the #MeToo era—arguing that the uniform viral warmth surrounding the show drives the emergence of networked feminisms through “affective homophily,” or a love of feeling the same. With Nanette, the contagious qualities of laughter are tamed by a networked logic of homophily, allowing for affective intensity while resisting dissent in what is being felt. Secondly, and as a counter force to such sameness, we examine absurd feminist humor trafficking in the unreasonable, illogical, and inappropriate. In considering the unexpected pockets of humor within the #MeToo scandal that ripped apart the prestigious institution of the Swedish Academy in 2018, we explore the emergence of absurdist feminist comedy by zooming in on the figure of the unseemly woman and humor that is knowingly out of tune with both reason and decency. While our first example allows us to argue for the political importance of affective ambiguity, difference, and dissent in social media feminisms, our second example opens up a space for affective release that unpredictable and surprising absurd humour, in combining the illogical with the indecent, affords.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the early days of digital media studies, it has been widely understood that trust in digital technologies has been indispensable for the operation of queer communities. Attaining access to _disinhibition_ is central to queer world-making: not only through coming “out”; and dancing at the gay club, but also by chemically altering your state of mind through alcohol and drug consumption. This panel explores queer ‘digital infrastructures of disinhibition’ through a digitally mediated sexual practice that has attracted significant attention over the last decade: ‘chemsex’, when gay and bisexual men use locative social media such as hook-up apps to organise group sex encounters where certain recreational drugs are consumed.&#x0D;\nChemsex is a socio-sexual practice that to an overwhelming degree is _constructed_, _negotiated_, _enacted_, _maintained_ and _critiqued_ via digital platforms. Hook-up apps are key to facilitating chemsex encounters because they allow for instant access to nearby subjects who can join the chemsex event; porn platforms and video conferencing tools lend their affordances to the visual culture and consumption of chemsex. At the same time as digital media intervenes in chemsex subjectivity, so do the recreational drugs.&#x0D;\nInstead of treating the “effects” of media and drugs on the participating bodies as separated elements, this panel explores what can be achieved analytically if we think of them as co-constituting chemsex. To do so we conceptualize contemporary gay culture as an emerging assemblage depending on _digital_, _chemical_, and _communal_ infrastructures and the ways they are practiced, experienced, policed and transformed.&#x0D;\nThe panel explores both the emergence and practice of chemsex, as well as what kinds of queer futurity chemsex events might offer, what “ways of feeling” emerge, and the subjectivities it produces, including the extent to which they might be considered to disturb, disrupt or, conversely, consolidate homonormative sociabilities and realities.</jats:p>",

The 2018 Facebook and Cambridge Analytica debacles highlighted how data harvested from social media platforms can be used not only for commercial purposes but also for political manipulation. This incident and the widespread discussion around it further demonstrated the following issues: unethical data collection enabled by a platform; unethical use of data for corporate and political interest; and unethical data sharing by an academic.&#x0D;\nResearch needs to be credible to maintain social license. Data is the lifeblood of research. For research to remain credible, research needs to remain fundamentally ethical and research methods comprising data collection and data analysis need to be robust, transparent, repeatable, and auditable. Such methods alone cannot create credibility, but research data infrastructure design and implementation can provide a foundation for credibility by addressing these fundamental processes.&#x0D;\nSocial science research has traditionally relied on data collection methods such as surveys, interviews, and ethnographic observations. However, an increasing proportion of human life is being mediated by online platforms, with approximately 2.3 billion active users on Facebook and 326 million active users on Twitter (Statista 2019). Social media data collection and analysis have become imperative for researchers interested in various phenomena playing out in these new media. This paper discusses the current state and issues of social media data collection and describes the Digital Observatory’s approach to establishing a credible and trusted research data infrastructure.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper aims to better understand the role that problem-solving plays in building the trust necessary to sustain online fan audiences, and so support the careers of influential social media entertainers. Problem-solving in this context means a video, where the theme deals with the problems of modern life experienced by young fans. A mixed methods approach – in this case in-depth interviews, discourse analysis and participant observation at YouTube Creator Day events – is used to better leverage the strengths of each method and triangulate results. Sample size is at least 20 YouTubers at the most culturally significant, artistic end of the spectrum with an average of at least 1mn subscribers, established TV producers and Multi-Channel Network leaders. Preliminary results suggest that leading YouTube creators – including A-listers – use a conscious strategy of identifying the problems fans experience, so establishing trust and building audiences for their videos around their own solutions. Moreover, trust is engendered through two main means say these Australian YouTubers: first, the considerable time creators spend listening to their fans across creators’ YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Patreon channels; and second, via online and analogue interactions with fans that open their lifeworld’s to the creator, and in turn shape the themes of their short video products. This phenomenon of collaborative problem-solving, independent of traditional state, school or family structures, represents an important shift with significant potential for youth agency in an emergent public sphere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The gaming community has been contoured by divisive issues around the exacerbation of sexism, racism, and harassment. These tensions culminated in 2014 in the shape of #gamergate: a decentralised online harassment campaign against women and feminism in gaming. Gamergate continues to intensify a heightened climate of hostility especially felt by women and minorities.This ongoing feminist ethnography has emerged from an imperative to create interventions into the increasing normalisation of online and offline harassment. In it, this research analyses the affective labour of how people navigate and ‘cope’ with discrimination in gaming cultures.&#x0D;\nThis paper will present vignettes of the larger research project of how online harassment has coloured people’s lived experiences, through thick-descriptions of in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with 7 women who play videogames with their romantic partners. These interviews gesture towards a rich complexity of affective relationships at the nexus of gaming, romantic relationships, and the everyday lived experiences of women. To avoid bringing attention to their gender, harassment, and unwanted confrontations, women are hypervigilant. In similar ways to self-defence tactics, women constantly avoid using headsets to communicate with other players, keep clear of conversations about playing videogames, and minimise the performance of their femininity in public gaming spaces.This paper critically examines the dynamics of how the increasing normalisation and public gamification of online harassment impacts women’s engagement with gaming, as well as how ‘online’ harassment may invade into their intimate relationships and domestic ‘private’ spheres.</jats:p>",

From content producers to Uber drivers, digital laborers are particularly adept at appropriating and gaming platforms like YouTube, and Uber (Chen 2017; Duffy 2017; Rosenblat 2018). Often described as “multi-sided markets,” platforms bring together many different kinds of stakeholders, including consumers, workers, advertisers, and regulators (Gillespie 2010; Lingel 2020). However, investigations of working alongside algorithms have so far focused on workers’ relationship to algorithms, and neglected other stakeholders. Extending counterpublics theories (Warner 2002; Fraser 1990), we examine over 3,000 online reviews of a labor platform, Care.com, finding that both workers and clients use gossip to create a $2 that constructs a counternarrative about platform business practices. While previous studies suggest that different platform stakeholders have conflicting interests, we find that platform counterpublics draw both workers and clients together to draw boundaries demarcating acceptable platform business practices. Second, we point to the implications of platform counterpublics for the investigation of platform labor and algorithms. Consumer reviews of platforms are absent from critical literature on labor platforms. By bringing together scholarship on counterpublics with critical literature on labor platforms, this paper offers a relational approach to platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines Mark Zuckerberg’s socio-technical optimistic imaginary of a connectivity of the entire world, focusing on Facebook’s Internet.org initiative. His vision of a connected world can be described as what Jasanoff and Kim (2015) call “sociotechnical imaginary,” which are not limited to nations, or heads of states, but can be conjured by corporations, social movements, and professional societies. The paper examines 50 short promotional videos, first-person narrated by individuals in their target countries. The themes found in the videos map to development discourse: female empowerment, education, entrepreneurship, and natural disaster relief. This paper argues that by merging Internet.org with connectivity, and connectivity with progress, Facebook utilizes the promotional aesthetic and narrative devices usually used by the development sector to position its initiative as a crucial step toward poverty alleviation and economic development.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past two years social media platforms have been struggling to moderate at scale. At the same time, they have come under fire for failing to mitigate the risks of perceived ‘toxic’ content or behaviour on their platforms. In effort to better cope with content moderation, to combat hate speech, ‘dangerous organisations’ and other bad actors present on platforms, discussion has turned to the role that automated machine-learning (ML) tools might play. This paper contributes to thinking about the role and suitability of ML for content moderation on community platforms such as Reddit and Facebook. In particular, it looks at how ML tools operate (or fail to operate) effectively at the intersection between online sentiment within communities and social and platform expectations of acceptable discourse. Through an examination of the r/MGTOW subreddit we problematise current understandings of the notion of ‘tox¬icity’ as applied to cultural or social sub-communities online and explain how this interacts with Google’s Perspective tool.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research in progress explores how political discussion on Indonesian Twittersphere could provide a genuine conversation on debates related to the upcoming 2019 national election in Indonesia. Taking the case of the presidential and parliamentary election in the upcoming April 2019, the author uses social media data on Twitter to investigate whether the discussions are heavily lean into digital public sphere or more dominated by political buzzer and bots. The author examines this by creating Twitter network maps based on hashtags related to the election. Modularity tests are employed to identify the extent of online community developed during the conversations. Most of the hashtags analyzed could attract hundreds of small communities, created mini-publics, which in turn shows the degree of willingness of the Indonesian social media users to participate in this practice of digital citizenship. Qualitative observations on the selection of the most significant actors within the network and the words they posted are employed to understand if the conversations were not led by either dominant political actors or political buzzers/bots, and thus, suggest the citizens’ genuine form of political communication. Despite the limitations of studying Twitter data, the author suggests that by taking a closer attention to how political conversation in non-English/Western political environment, this study might provide valuable insights on the development of genuine utilization of (and trust on) the social media platforms for political engagement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Memes “act as the locus of memory”, says Gabriella Coleman of the peculiar relationship 4chan has to its own history, made necessary by the ephemeral nature of large amounts of its content (2009). Rather than having an on-site permanent archive as such, its collective history and memory is sublated into and through the circulation and production of memes. Taking this as a prompt, this paper makes the case for the (re)production, circulation, and referencing of memes as embodiment of a particular historical ontology: a mode of being constructed in relationship to, and through, its own past. Memes, in other words, are a new way of thinking about, and experiencing (digital) history: they contribute to, and are part of, new “infra-structures of feeling” (Coleman 2017). With this in mind, I use Benjamin’s reading of Klee’s Angelus Novus as a framing device to start to think about how memes encourage and embody certain modes of being-in-the-world. I do so in specific reference to 4chan and its privileging of a certain subject position along lines raced, classed and gendered, although possibilities for other forms and spaces are considered. On 4chan, the New Man of neofascism remakes the world memetically, in his own image.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Technological innovation depends on earthly resources. As such, the drive to continuous growth that has propelled technology forward is also in direct competition with a planet that is reaching capacity. This expansion and consumption model has both supported and neglected the data of the dead, which both proliferates and languishes. For example, as researchers across disciplines have noted, the dead may soon outnumber the living on social media. Questions about digital remains should attend not only to social media profiles but also to the life cycles of data. This paper considers environmental and resource-related questions about the traces we leave when we depart. To do this work, a theoretical methodological approach following the Computing within LIMITS model (Nardi et al, 2018) is employed to consider the accumulation of data that remains after users have departed from their earthly (and digital) lives. LIMITS is a sustainability model that asks researchers to (1) question growth, (2) consider models of scarcity, and (3) reduce energy and material consumption. That is, this paper questions the life of digital data that can be maintained and can even grow after a user passes on. In addition to questions about mourning, memorializing, and archiving the dead, the LIMITS model prompts ethical questions about how to bury our dead data responsibly and sustainably in the face of exponential growth.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is concerned with mapping the socio-material ecosystems of online leaks projects that followed WikiLeaks. The period of initial popularisation/infamy of WikiLeaks (2006-2015) correlates with an emergence of over 90 less-known radical online disclosure projects designed to \"\"Kill Secrets\"\" (Greenberg 2012). We offer the first systematic study of the decentralised and widely disparate ecosystem of leaks projects to build a taxonomy of leaks sites (n:94) from various observable socio-technical vectors. Affordances tied to user and technical practice, vectors such as self-identified thematic focus (issue, region, etc.), and measures of publication efficacy for each site are all open coded to discern patterns and clusters of practice. Analysis then shifts to mapping of visible interrelationships between sites via social network analysis (SNA) for further insight to the ecology of leaks sites. Taxonomy over typology signals observing material practice without predetermined ideal type, and normative links to agonistic democratic theory. At a macro level our findings suggest, an ecology of leaks sites blossomed and died, with only a handful of sites remaining online, or having ever actually functioned. Micro to Meso analysis of practices show how leaks sites' socio-technical materiality helps shape both efficacy and normative goals, from which unique and sometimes agonistic normative governmental functions can be inferred. Discussion of findings then critically assess how digital leaks served (and severed) ties to already problematic equations of 'transparency' and democracy from a frame of agonistic and algorithmic government practices (Heemsbergen, 2016; Ananny and Crawford, 2016) and suggest tentative paths forward.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates how different age groups perceive Facebook as a personal medium and a mass medium, respectively, based on a time series analysis of Danish Internet users. As Denmark for long has been one of the countries with relatively most Facebook users and as Facebook plays an important role in everyday life and the public debate, data from Denmark might give good indications of Facebook’s development in general. This paper is based on five consecutive surveys among Danish Internet users, in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (N between 1200 and 1500 each year). I focus on the use of different parts of Facebook across age groups; the personalized uses like Messenger, private groups and intimate communication, versus “mass media use” like reading news, organizational and political information and taking part in nationwide debates. I also investigate different age groups’ attitudes towards Facebook and whether they see it as a personal or a mass medium. First and foremost, I find notable differences across age groups. I also find that the differences are increasing over the years. In 2015 there were not significant differences in Facebook use across age groups. In 2019 a vast majority of the youngest, aged 18-30, used Facebook dominantly as a personalized medium, highlighting Messenger and private groups as their preferred ways of communication and interaction. The older generations have a much more diversified use, treating Facebook as a personal as well as a mass medium.</jats:p>",

This panel collects four papers exploring especially the legal and ethical dimensions of new technologies, including data collection and storage as public goods vis-à-vis central questions of justice (Paper 1, Towards a Political Theory of Data Justice: A Public Good Perspective); critiques from Western and non-Western positions of the utilitarianism otherwise driving the platforms’ business models and rationales (Paper 2, Google and Facebook VS Rawls and Lao-Tsu: How Silicon Valley’s utilitarianism and Confucianism are bad for Internet ethics); basic tensions between the rule of law vis-à-vis algorithmic “decision-making” processes in jurisprudence and “surveillance capitalism” (Paper 3, The Jurisprudence of Datafied Law); and a taxonomy of the ethics of AI, algorithms and big data based on an analysis of 90 guidelines from 2017-2020 (Paper 4, A systematic literature Review of ethical Code of Conducts in the field of Internet Research). These papers directly take up the central interests shared between AoIR and JICES in the ethical and social dimensions of the internet and internet-facilitated communication.

Against the backdrop of well-founded scepticism regarding exposure to and engagement with political knowledge on social media, we scrutinize the social media usage of protestors with an interest in the formulation and circulation of political knowledge.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I explore the growing trend of posting videos to YouTube to explain the reasons for why an individual has quit their job, detailing a collection of 10 vlogs posted by 11 former BuzzFeed employees to explain their reasons for leaving the company. I argue that the vlogs made by ex-employees are a deliberate attempt to expose the invisible labour that is prevalent in the post-Internet media industry. By posting “Why I Left” vlogs, former employees reclaim their authorship of creative productions previously uploaded without individual attributions and instead credited to the faceless corporate monolith of “BuzzFeed”. Furthermore, these vlogs act as a means to subvert notoriety earned by being a (now former) public face of BuzzFeed to attract hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of viewers to announce their personal pivot and rebranding as content producers now working independently from the company that had launched them into Internet fame. While perhaps not intentional, these vlogs ultimately act as a warning about the uneven playing field between employer and employee. Each year BuzzFeed posts record profits, and yet these vlogs illuminate how employees are actively prevented from being able to grow a personal brand beyond BuzzFeed, stifling future career prospects and additional sources of income. Ultimately this leaves BuzzFeed employees with the option to quit or to stagnate in place, or what Gaby Dunn (2015) stated are ultimately the two options for a BuzzFeed viral video star: “Get Rich, or Die Vlogging.’”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Through in-depth qualitative interviews of four Finnish influencer mothers and online observation of their social media accounts, the presentation asks how influencers negotiate the feeling rules that govern (maternal) femininity on social media and attempt to cope with the emotional weight of precarious social media work. My data do not allow for the possibility of generalization but are rich, nuanced, and offer insight into ambivalent lived experiences and emotional pressures of ‘do what you love and love what you do’ ethic where emotional investment in one’s work encompasses all areas of life. The talk suggests that although anxiety can be considered a negative side effect of stressful social media work, sharing it on social media can also be understood as a tactic that plays a central role in the lifestyle influencer industry. I argue for using the affective practice (Wetherell, 2012, 2014) of anxiety as a theoretical concept to explore the influencers’ routinized emotional behaviour in their attempts to decrease the discrepancy between their emotions and cultural expectations. Drawing on Vik Loveday’s (2018) analysis of the “neurotic academic”, I suggest that the construction of an entrepreneurial influencer self is underpinned by anxiety. This argument is formulated through the figure of the “neurotic influencer” that is the embodiment of the ambivalent nature of gendered influencer work. Anxiety strives the influencers to exceed themselves all the while creating relatable social media subjects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines emerging trends in fact signaling: the performative invocation of the idea of Fact and Reason, distinct from the concrete presentation of evidence or reasoning, as a way to cultivate affective solidarity. Emblematic is the conservative influencer Ben Shapiro’s slogan, “facts don’t care about your feelings”: a paean to the mythological figure of emotionlessly objective truth which may then be weaponised against one’s enemies. Scholars are increasingly attentive to the ways in which what was once popularised as a ‘fake news’ epidemic is not simply a virulent strain of bad information in a fundamentally rational online ecosystem, but rather a broader crisis and transformation of what counts as truthful, trustworthy and authentic (e.g. Boler &amp; Davis, 2018; also see Banet-Weiser, 2012). Our contribution emphasises the affective and habitual dimension of this phenomenon. Through a close analysis of Ben Shapiro’s content and personal brand, we show how the generic invocation of Fact and Reason cultivates a sense of affective attachment not defined by ideological consistency or, indeed, the actual practice of research or logical reasoning, but rather a particularly masculinised and adversarial ideal of Truth. The payoff is the reassurance and pleasure of a stable subject position from which one’s political opposition may be Othered with impunity. Facts may not care about your feelings, but insisting upon this fact is all about building a certain structure of feeling.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In early 2019, Overwatch professional player, “Ellie” quit playing just weeks after having been named to one of the teams seeded into the professional league. The harassment cited as a reason to leave was related especially to whether or not “Ellie” was truly “female”. Not much later, Ellie was revealed (and confirmed by Blizzard, the parent company of Overwatch) to be an account created by a male player. This paper sets out to map the controversy that ensued from a self-styled “social experiment” of playing while female.&#x0D;\nThis paper brings this current “revelation” into conversation with past, more fully embodied/manufactured identities to better understand why this case is particularly important to internet studies. To this end, we begin by briefly describing some earlier, more familiar cases of people revealed to be someone other than, in online spaces, they said they were. Then, we further outline the instance of Ellie: its uptake by mainstream media, prominent Youtubers and Twitch streamers, and its discussion on internet forums like Reddit and 4Chan. Paying particular attention to the ways these discussions frame the “trick” played in disguising Ellie’s ‘true’ identity (singular), we suggest that this kind of case has always been galvanized by an underlying conviction that the best gamers are always and only men, and one contribution internet scholarship can make here is to show how these discursive patterns are unhelpful in understanding contemporary identificatory politics and practices in online spaces.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The breadth of what it means to study intimacies in the context of media has changed significantly in recent years because of current technological, social, and cultural changes. The digital mediation of intimacy - the changing attitudes, experiences, and practices of intimacy performed through digital media - demands that scholars look beyond well-established frameworks for studying intimacy and media, expanding their methodological and theoretical perspectives in order to fully comprehend intimate lifeworlds and the digital. This panel aims to examine the various intimacies - understood here as a range of affects, practices and sociocultural arrangements - that take place through and are reconfigured by digital media infrastructures. In particular, it aims to explore how digital infrastructures and intimate arrangements are intertwined, thereby challenging the assumptions that digital media's reconfigurations of intimacy are associated with either positive or negative outcomes. Through analytical approaches that interrogate the material complexities of digital media in relation to individuals' intimate lifeworlds, this panel's papers uncover the nuances of digitally mediated intimacies. They identify the opportunities that digital media infrastructures facilitate for representation, social connection and sexual excitement while acknowledging infrastructural influences in the reinforcement, commodification, and marginalization of particular expressions of intimacy. Through textual analysis, in-depth interviews, ethnography, and close readings of a range of digital media, from messaging apps to video sharing platforms, these studies generate thick data that exposes the often unseen digital media infrastructures running underneath, through and in the background of intimacies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study uses a combination of multimodal discourse analysis (Bateman, 2008; Holsanova, 2012; Jewitt, 2009; LeVine &amp; Scollon, 2004) and qualitative interview materials to make an initial attempt at understanding the response to the Russian Psyop as it played out on Tumblr. It is critical that we, as technologically-oriented, civically concerned communication scholars, understand the technical and social mechanisms that allowed Russian and other interference on social media platforms to be perpetuated, and not only on the most popular and visible sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, but more niche platforms as well.&#x0D;\nInterview materials originate prior to the announcement, and were conducted from September to November 2017. In these interviews, privacy concerns were discussed at length, as well as Tumblr’s perceived incompetence when coding and maintaining a web platform. Because they maintained relatively little faith in the digital architecture of Tumblr, participants instead largely managed their privacy by carefully considering who they followed and who followed them. This centrality of “knowing” who they followed (while almost never knowing the blogger in a face-to-face context) is key for understanding how the Russian accounts must resemble “real” people, in order to gain followers and thus traction on Tumblr.&#x0D;\nThe posts and reblog chains under analysis either 1) originated with one IRA-linked account, “lagonegirl,” and were reblogged after “her” blog was deleted, or 2) were humorous responses to the Psyop revelation/Russian spies.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this research we ask which role humorous social media images play for the representation of political protest in social media. To do so, we collected tweets (n=678946) based on protest hashtags from the G20 protests in Hamburg July 6-8 2017. With a social network analysis we find that while we can see clusters around user accounts of activist collectives, media institutions, and authorities (such as the Hamburg police), we cannot observe a network centred around user accounts of residents of Hamburg. As seemingly neutral humorous perspectives which do neither take the side of the activists or the authorities, these images seem to be shared across various clusters in the network. Yet, these are among the most frequently shared tweets based on number of retweets and mentions. Through a narrative analysis of the most frequently shared tweets with a particular focus on such humorous juxtapositions of the protests and the everyday life of residents, we find that these seemingly apolitical images and videos shared across communities, still play a disruptive role in the narrative about political protest. We argue that the privileging of humorous content that users are perhaps more inclined to share in social media than political messages, activists’ grievances or violent imagery, might (while not actively taking sides) push activists’ grievances in the background and make their actions appear as disruptive. With these findings, this research contributes to furthering our understanding of how the logics of social media might influence narratives of contemporary protests.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Global political developments – such as Brexit, climate change, or forced migration – are entangled with communication that transcends national publics. Meanwhile, the EU’s integrity suffers, also due to polarised online discourses, which are sometimes actively manipulated. Therefore, an overview of online communication beyond language barriers is essential. However, whether and how online media create a global space that sustains deliberation of national and global interests by citizens, remains understudied. We approach this problem by exploring relations between the Italian and German Twittersphere, while asking: 1) What is the macrostructure of this bilingual network? 2) Are there bridges between these language communities in the form of single accounts and how can they be described? 3) Are there bridges in the form of groups and what are they tweeting about? We build on an innovative network crawling strategy for language-based Twitter follow networks. We developed it further to combine strengths of rank degree, snowball, and forest fire sampling. Thereby, we collect a network sample of the most central accounts in the Italian-German Twittersphere. Preliminary results suggest a bridging quality of soccer and connections between political clusters of both languages by EU politicians. Furthermore, larger network clusters connect mainly with one linguistic domain while smaller communities show a bridging behaviour. The final paper will present results of months of data collection, focusing on the relation between topics discussed within clusters and their connectivity. While it focuses on the German-Italian Twittersphere, our methods open up new avenues of enquiry regarding multi-language public spheres.</jats:p>",

While most previous studies have examined this phenomenon in the context of blogs, forums, and social media groups explicitly devoted to specific _physical_ illnesses, in this study we focus on a \"naturally\" developing, unstructured, a-hierarchical \"community\"-of-sorts that is based on a shared _mental_ disorder – Israeli Twitter users with depression. In-depth interviews with these users demonstrate how the unique affordances of Twitter in Israel – and especially its lack of popularity and its construction as the \"anti-Facebook\" – have enabled it to become a discursive space in which non-hegemonic voices are more prominent.&#x0D;\nWhile Twitter users with depression were cautious in developing trust, once trust was inferred it became a central facet of their perception of Twitter and its supportive role. Users conceived of Twitter as a sanctuary and echo chamber in which people with depression can present their authentic selves to an empathetic, non-judgmental community of similar outcasts. At the same time, the community's expectations for profound authenticity paradoxically led some users to avoid tweeting about positive experiences. In addition, Twitter's marginal status allowed users to link their sense of _psychological_ reclusiveness to their sense of _political_ isolation in a climate in which leftist views are increasingly ostracized.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How to reflexively examine the ways in which the researcher’s own embodied experiences shape knowledge production is a key question within digital and sensory ethnography. Challenges exist around capturing these embodied experiences through conventional reflexive methods, such as voice and field notes. Furthermore, it can be particularly difficult to capture that which is experienced by the researcher as being ‘too intense’ and resultingly shed or refuse/d by the body; (e.g., fleeting, whirling anxious thoughts; spatial suspensions of disorientation; and voids from pushing away difficult feelings). Nevertheless, as examining refuse/d experiences can focus reflexive engagement on the difficult aspects of fieldwork, this methodological area provides a unique niche for inquiry. In this work, I advance knowledge on retaining and reflecting upon too intense experiences. I first draw from phenomenological embodiment theories to put forward the concept of ‘sensorial litter’. I posit that when shed from the body, intense experiences are not lost, but rather manifest materially through digital media as litter (e.g., anxiety filled texts, emails to supervisors, search histories). Retrieving and examining three pieces of sensorial litter from my own ethnographic work, I then demonstrate how this digital detritus may add critical depth to reflexive engagement with embodiment. Specifically, I illustrate how sensorial litter can provide concrete entry points into the ways in which the researcher’s sensing body is perpetually in flux, shaping and re-shaping throughout fieldwork. I argue that sensorial litter can facilitate reflexive engagement that is many-sited, intertextual, resistant to holism, and perceptive ethnographic research’s inevitable shortcomings.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>AI methods and ubiquitous data sensors have enabled a new algorithmic quantification of affect with the possibility to detect or verify users’ identities, characteristics, emotional states, and physical traits. By scrutinizing how transient datasets are produced by user applied pressure on touch-screens (via fingertip commands) this paper showcases how sensory technology creeps into users’ everyday life with potential implementations connected to a series of emerging data issues engineered by a black-box design: one which obfuscates data production and precludes user consent under the disguise of “non-intrusive” features. Thereby, this paper explores the limits of user-based interrogation of black-boxes by researching tactile modes of operation, as a subset of behavioural biometrics, and sensors that register force in touch analysis and haptic technologies.&#x0D;\nPresenting a citation analysis of biometric techniques around the proposed usage of pressure; the authors offer a case-study examination of zinc-based force-sensing materials that are cost-effective and scalable to ubiquitous-computing and a prototype developed using ‘each pixel as a sensor’. By combining these approaches, this paper argues that such developments constitute a phenomenological shift away from users’ perception to data infrastructures working as assemblages of hidden technical sensations, and there is a need to expose these complex networks to afford some grasp, if not direct agency, over their micro temporal operation. This work aims not simply to theorise, but to help reveal ways users may revise, embrace, resist, subvert or even live data practices that operate unlike conventional data harvesting techniques.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel brings together papers that explore digital cultures, platforms, and queer and feminist theoretical and methodological research approaches. The papers in this panel each explore the kinds of approaches suited to researching queer “de/stabilizations” in and of digital culture; that is, to projects of tracing, mapping, and making, queerer worlds via digital cultural research. “Trustworthy” systems are, in one important sense, systems that are relatively stable, reliable, and that work somewhat predictably. But in algorithmic digital cultures “reliability” and “predictability” are not always characteristics to be trusted: digital media scholars have examined how algorithmic systems “build in”, intensify, and thus stabilize a-priori discriminatory practices, cultural associations, and stereotypical representational meanings, thus helping to cement social inequalities via increasingly ubiquitous practices of quantification, as Paper 4 explores in relation to digital extracted data on “gay” genomics and faces. On a different register, ethnographic research on youth, social media, and gender and sexuality has also evidenced the kind of stabilizations of hetero-patriarchal dominant meanings of, for example, digitally shared images of bodies, as Papers 1 and 2 highlight. Important tensions arise in digital cultural research, particularly among scholars concerned with gender and sexuality, around desires to trace, and make manifest stable, strong, and more broadly and inclusively “trustworthy” systems, communities, and meanings in digital cultures, and the associated risks of capture and exclusion pertinent to marginalized groups and bodies (Paper 3). The papers in this panel explore these tensions, and their implications for digital cultural research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Much global attention is given to Bangkok as the “Mecca of transsexual body modification” (Aizura, 2010, p. 2) for both Thai and non-Thai transgender women. Clearly, it has garnered an international reputation as “being culturally tolerant of gender variance” (p. 16), in particular, for transgendered women or ladyboys. However, they are still considered marginalized in Thai society and are not well-accepted for many Thais. Since the rise of networked technology, some Thai transgender women have lived online, formed likeminded-groups, and shared support. This paper argues that their blogs serve as counter-publics for the unheard voices to be publicly visible. At the intersection of technology, identity and online participation literatures, this research extends microcelebrity literature and borrows second-wave feminist value, “personal is political” to examine transgender women beauty bloggers and their blogs and understand how (their) personal is political. For this project, I had in-depth interviews with seven transgender women beauty bloggers in Thailand, taken in 2-hour period each during December 2016 and February 2017. Findings show that, Thai transgender female beauty blogs serve as “social-conscience-style activis[t]” (Vromen, 2006) who build their own bodies, friend their fans (regardless of how many followers they have accumulated), and become inspiring idols. The blogs lend themselves to serve as informational and emotional support to their followers, especially transgendered followers. Bloggers enact micro-political actions to be seen online and empower the marginalized, thus, become a trustworthy source.</jats:p>",

Methodologically, this paper draws from social media analytics, network analysis, corpus linguistics, and discourse-theoretical analysis. The findings show how Twitter users strategically and discursively use the platform’s affordances and choose who and what to trust, what hashtags to use, and what discourse to amplify, in order to both form agonistic networks of discursive alliances and to intensify antagonisms against the rival discourses. In this sense, the paper argues that trust, whether it is trusting the information sources or other users, becomes a discursive strategy employed in the hegemonic struggle over the issue of immigration in the Australian Twittersphere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>AoIR and the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society (JICES) share common interests in critical reflection on the ethical and social dimensions of the internet and internet-facilitated communication, and have begun a collaboration aimed at collecting ethically-focused AoIR conference submissions for presentation and critique at AoIR, with a view towards subsequent publication in a special issue of JICES. This panel collects three papers that address these shared interests as specifically focused on research ethics. Paper 1, Integrating Mobile Eye-Tracking in a Mixed Methods Research Design: Ethical Standards and Practical Requirements, addresses the social and data ethical dimensions of the increasing use of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies in public spaces. Paper 2, The complex balancing act of researchers’ ethical and emotional capacities and responsibilities, takes up these issues from the first-hand experience of a researcher-participant who, as a bereaved parent, was requested to research a closed community for bereaved parents on Facebook. The wide range of ethical challenges here includes informed consent as distinctively difficult in these contexts. Paper 3, Digital Ethics and the Situationist Challenge to Virtue Ethics, evaluates recent applications of virtue ethics in digital media, arguing instead for a pragmatist, situation-based approach. These three papers thus expand AoIR’s signature focus on Internet Research Ethics through two empirically-oriented papers on research ethics/methods in two specific contexts, complimented by a more theoretical exploration of virtue ethics and pragmatism – and thereby dovetail with JICES’ interests in the ethics and social dimensions of ICTS.</jats:p>",

This theoretical framework is chosen as each approach points to constructs that capture at least part of the use-value of these services, yet that have not been examined in combination.&#x0D;\nThe theoretical model suggests that convenience value, monetary value, will to archive, algorithmic value and age predict continued intention to use music streaming services (age negatively). The empirical basis of the study consists of interviews with 26 users of streaming services and an online survey (N=793) with respondents who pay for music streaming services. The survey items were subjected to a principal component analysis, resulting in the five foreseen factors. Items that loaded on each factor were summed and averaged and used in the subsequent hierarchical regression analyses.&#x0D;\nThe results show that monetary value is the strongest predictor followed by convenience value and will to archive. As expected, age is negatively associated with continued intention to use music streaming services. Whereas algorithmic value correlates significantly with all other constructs, it does not predict continued intention to use. The qualitative interviews help explain the results. People who invest efforts in organizing their own music libraries and playlists create added value to their own service-experience. Interviews also provide accounts of how personalized recommendations are considered important by the most avid music-listeners, yet that casual listeners pay little attention to recommendations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Literature on influence operations has identified metrics that are indicative of social media manipulation, but few studies have explored the lifecycle of low-quality information. We contribute to this literature by reconstructing nearly 3M messages posted by 1M users in the last days of the Brexit referendum campaign. While previous studies have found that on average only 4% of tweets disappear, we found that 33% of the tweets leading up to the referendum vote are no longer available. Only about half of the most active accounts that tweeted the referendum continue to operate publicly and 20% of all accounts are no longer active. We tested whether partisan content was more likely to disappear and found more messages from the Leave campaign that disappeared than the entire universe of tweets affiliated with the Remain campaign. We compare these results with a set of 45 hashtags posted in the same period and find that political campaigns present much higher ratios of user and tweet decay. These results are validated by inspecting 2M Brexit-related tweets posted over a period of nearly 4 years. The article concludes with an overview of these findings and recommendations for future research.</jats:p>",

We first analyse a range of public documents in the EU, the UK and Ireland to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around AI and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. We conclude that discourses of ‘ethical AI’ are generically performative, but to become more effective in practice we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to deploy AI in specific societal contexts. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we suggest the notion of $2 to account for the intermingling of socio-technical processes that make online platforms (in this case: YouTube) resistant to stable definitions. It has been over a decade of YouTube studies and yet, a consensus on what precisely YouTube is seems unlikely. Arguably, Burgess and Green began this ontological quest with the first edition of YouTube (2008) in which they set out ‘to work through some of the often-competing ideas about just what YouTube is.” (iv) Snickars and Vondereau (2009) considered the “ontological ambivalence” (2009, p. 28) of YouTube to be an asset since the platform’s success was rooted in its flexibility as a stage for content. Following work attempted to understand YT as a ‘new screen ecology’ (Cunningham 2016); through its platform logics of monetization and viewership (Postigo 2015, Van Es 2020); as a contested space between creators, content and audience (Berryman and Kavka 2018, Bishop 2018; 2019); and as a database, often implementing scraping and other computational techniques to account for its nature as vast graph network of content (Airoldi et al. 2016) with internal algorithmic dynamic - for instance the preference of “YT-native” content over mainstream actors within its search and recommendations (Rieder et al. 2018). We abandon the ontological stability of YT as singular and instead present it from a post-representational (Thrift 2008) and temporally-orientated (Adam 2008) perspective. Using BreadTube as a case study, we refrain from asking what YT is, but rather $2 YT happens.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last few years, smart security and physical identification technologies have grown exponentially; people are increasingly installing smart video devices to monitor their homes and buying DNA kits to collect and analyze their genetics. As the number of users and profits of these businesses increase, so too does the potential for privacy violations and exploitation. To explore these dynamics of privacy in emerging technology, we conducted a U.S. nationally representative survey (N=1,587) and asked respondents for their perceptions of a number of emerging technologies such as facial recognition, DNA collection and biometrics monitoring. We also measured individual-level traits that have been found to influence technology acceptance. The results show that the actor wielding the technology matters for people’s acceptance. Respondents were overall more comfortable with public officials and airlines using more invasive technologies to guarantee people’s safety, as compared to private companies or non-profits using data for research. When keeping the actor constant across privacy technologies, there was an overwhelming preference for less invasive means of privacy data sharing. These findings indicate how the concept of normalization, social context and agents of control play a critical role in the way people accept emerging technology into their lives.</jats:p>",

    "title": "REAL TIME TEMPORALITIES AND MORE-THAN-HUMAN ECOLOGIES OF DETROIT’S\t\t\tPROJECT GREEN LIGHT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>On January 1st 2016, 8 gas stations in the Detroit metro area began streaming from surveillance cameras to the Detroit Police Department’s Real Time Crime Center—the auspicious start of Detroit’s Project Green Light (PGL). Presently, cameras are located in over 680 sites around the city. The surveillance initiative’s rapid expansion has been met with significant pushback from the community regarding its quiet incorporation of automated face recognition technologies. As activists have argued, the use of a technology with a significantly higher error rate for people of color to surveil a population that is over 80% nonwhite risks reproducing and exacerbating existing racial biases within the criminal justice system (Detroit Community Technology Project, 2019). Many of the concerns that community members have raised, including the possibility of algorithmic misidentification and the influence of PGL cameras on residents’ use of public space, speak to the question of what human and nonhuman agencies and relationalities exist in PGL spaces and their impact on the residents and landscape of Detroit. In this paper, I focus on the discursive flexibility of the term real time in PGL to diagram the web of human and nonhuman relations within the space. I trace three narratives of real time mapping the human and nonhuman temporalities they reference. Informed by a theoretical framework of Digital Studies, Critical Race Studies, and Indigenous Studies, I explore the racial justice possibilities of theorizing resistance inclusive of more-than-human perspectives and ethics.   </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platform firms, such as Uber and Airbnb, are emerging economic actors that aim at re-organizing the economic sectors they enter through challenging existing regulatory frameworks politically. While most studies focus on how platform firms’ political playbooks operate in European and North American democratic contexts, we know less about the regulatory and contestatory stories in non-Western and non-democratic contexts. This study aims to fill this lacuna by examining the governance of Uber in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The three diverse political systems provide a comparative basis to how Uber's political playbook works in authoritarian (China), semi-authoritarian (Hong Kong), and democratic (Taiwan) systems, respectively. We introduce the concept of “guerilla capitalism” to describe how platform firms attempt to make a profit through exploiting legal grey zones or openly violating established laws. We present a critical discourse analysis of Uber’s public marketing materials, news coverage about Uber, and government reports about ride-hailing in the three cases. Our analysis illustrates (1) the convergent discursive and political strategies Uber employed to legitimize its business to change the law and (2) the divergent and contextual factors that lead to different regulatory outcomes. We argue that Uber’s operative logic lies at the swift accumulation of a large number of politically mobilizable customers and the formation of political coalitions with their customers; however, governmental responses to Uber's political playbook vary with regulatory contexts. Such an operative logic may re-shape power-relations in different political trajectories. This study affords significant opportunities for thinking about the comparative politics of platformization.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Facebook groups represent an important resource for donor-conceived people to access information, seek advice and share their experiences with their peers. Limited research has considered how donor-conceived people create supportive relationships with peers through social media or how this form of social support contributes to donor-conceived people’s health and wellbeing. This work in progress outlines the ‘search-for method’, a practical user-led tool for discussing instances of participation in Facebook groups. The ‘search-for method’ involves inviting participants to search for their name in the search bar of a Facebook group, thereby retrieving data of all instances they have posted in the group. This paper reports on initial findings from applying the ‘search-for method’ to semi-structured interviews with administrators and members (N=30) of Facebook groups for donor-conceived people from across Australia. The ‘search-for method’ enabled the participant and researcher, as co-analysts, to track and examine specific instances of participation and interaction in the group. By scrolling through content on their own device, participants could decide how to frame their stories of support and whether to disclose sensitive information or omit experiences they did not wish to discuss. Broadly, this approach illuminated how individual and collective donor-conceived identities emerged and evolved with and through online group platforms. In doing so, it provided a framework for understanding sociality between donor-conceived peers longitudinally. This paper contributes to understandings of how digital affinities and peer intimacies develop in Facebook groups over time.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This is an analysis of how Twitter played a significant, agentive and accountable role in the difficult birth and premature unravelling of a government-funded international feminist research network. We situate this case study and this process of initiation and annihilation within the broader context within which social media platforms are a critical site of intensive affective discursive practices through which individual and institutional reputations can be made and unmade, frequently with far reaching professional and or personal consequences. To date there has been little academic study of both the broader implications of the potential benefits of social media for academic networking and the perils. Two data sets are analyzed comparatively, the first, detailed written responses from an in-person workshop designed explicitly to gather feedback on the research network; the second a set of tweets that erupted over a number of days shortly after that event. Content analysis of both data sets shows the impact of a small, localized Twitter event on an international network of researchers, demonstrating the speed and thoroughness with which decades of research and collaboration can be undone, and raising larger questions about the sustainability of culturally precarious trajectories of work -- in this case feminist work -- within Twitter’s increasingly hegemonic media ecology.</jats:p>",

Given the multiple constraints underlying collective formation among digital workers, this panel explores the characteristics and dynamics of emerging forms of collective organisation among digital workers by reflecting on experiences from China, the Philippines, Brazil, and India. Examining experiences of digital labor organisation and challenges to build solidarity across national and even regional experience, the panel hopes to enrich the discussion in terms of the politics, cultural nuances, and local meanings useful for examining digital worker expressions of resistance and solidarity amidst continuing technological development and platform reforms. This close examination of diverse forms of collective organisation, as well as the relational infrastructures underlying them, aims demonstrate how workers challenge the dominant claims of global capitalism while steep in recognition of the opportunities that these offer.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The primary goals of media literacy are laudable: active and critical thinking about the messages we receive and the messages we create. In practice, media literacy standardizes limited ways of knowing and normalizes built-in biases. Subsequently, its narrow emphasis on skill development, particularly the role of fact-checking, content creation, and independent research are all practices that can be exploited, oftentimes leading to the amplification of misinformation. Homogeneous media literacy also assumes that platforms are neutral – codifying a dominant, neoliberal, racist lens as a competency. Social media literacy in particular assumes the norms of proprietary algorithms, arming users with the skills determined by Silicon Valley’s corporate, individualist, white supremacist values. Contemporary high school curricula teaches students to ably brand and promote themselves; adept meme creators are rewarded for racial appropriation and fungible performances of Blackness; vanity metrics foster reputation anxiety in social media’s ‘success theatre’; personal data protection is an arguably futile lesson in privacy that preaches paranoid gated communities; fascist media pundits easily exploit conservative media literacy practice of “doing your own research” to naturalize misinformation. What are the implicitly raced, classed norms of reading \"correctly\"? What are mundane emancipatory reading practices? What alternative literacy practices do users deploy to reject these individualistic, racist standards? What does interpretive media literacy look like? This panel offers a portrait of what’s missing in media literacy and explores visions of interdependent practices that offer alternative methods of active and critical thinking about the messages we receive and the messages we create.</jats:p>",

I build on Goffman’s concept of\n        stigma, Charmaz’ studies on adapting to illness and impairment and use the lens of Markham’s\n        (2020) concept of echo-locating the self through online connection, Based on close readings\n        and interpretations of postings, including pictures, captions and comments, as well as\n        interviews with active community members, two critical antipodes of sense- and self-making\n        in the #strokesurvivor-community emerged: First, mourning the loss of the familiar body,\n        self, and identity and related identity goals. Users seek permission to mourn and also\n        validation for their grief through their postings and comments. Second, and probably\n        oppositional, perseverance, or in its extreme form, toxic positivity - this concept refers\n        to a (more or less forced) attitude of optimism while ignoring valid reasons to actually not\n        be positive, a mindset that seems to be embedded in a “contemporary cult of happiness”\n        (Wright 2014) and cruel optimism (Berlant 2010). In the #strokesurvivor-community, a\n        positive mindset and belief in the possibility of regaining physical and mental functions is\n        a recurring theme and strong imperative. The contribution focuses on the reconstruction of\n        patterns and practices of mourning and perseverance and their relevance to the echo-location\n        of the vulnerable self.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel presents ongoing research into online “live streaming” platforms, which offer the live broadcast of individuals’ activities - primarily but not exclusively digital gameplay - over the internet to potentially massive worldwide audiences. The largest platform in this area (on which we focus) is Twitch.tv, already the 30th most-viewed website in the world, with comparable platforms boasting large viewing numbers in China, Korea, and Japan. Our first talk examines Twitch as the dominant leading live streaming platform, outlining its evolution and historical origins while unpacking some of the fundamental user-platform relationships manifested on the site. The second addresses itself to the sociality of live streaming, which unlike traditional video media formats enables a rapid live exchange of comments and conversation between live streaming producers and consumers. The third paper presents an overview and typology of monetization methods in live streaming, focusing in particular on the gamified and “gamblified” elements of making money through the practice, as well as how these practices have evolved through a three-way dialogue between viewers, “streamers”, and platforms. The fourth paper builds on this by examining the on-platform currency of Twitch, known as “Bits”, and how the platform captured donations from viewers through the implementation of this currency system. The fifth and final paper will then further develop these critical enquiries into monetization methods and platform dynamics by presenting a number of extremely contemporary developments in this area on Twitch, exploring new the routes for capital flow enabled by new platform infrastructures and technological systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent political conflicts in Eastern Europe, including the armed conflicts in Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Belarus have demonstrated that the scope of digitally mediated participation in war-related activities goes far beyond the information domain. In this context, a rapidly emerging sociomaterial practice is the use of crowdfunding platforms to provide aid to the conflict-affected military and civilian populations. Situating the inquiry in this empirical context, we ask: how do crowdfunding platforms constitute relationships between spectators and the hyperconnected battlefield, and what is the role of remote human suffering therein? Drawing on data craft, a theory/method package for critical internet studies, we investigate two sets of boundary objects that mediate the connection between zones of conflict and their remote participants. We find that conflict-related crowdfunding is a new form of identity proclamation with regard to the users’ positionality, which creates the conditions of possibility for post-conflict reconstruction and a future after the military conflict. This suggests that representations of distant human suffering are not the only mediators between spectators and the hyperconnected battlefield, adding a new research direction to our understanding of values that drive remote humanitarianism in the digital age.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The remediation of analog trading card games into digital platforms\n        troubles notions of ownership and highlights the flows of capital through the ecologies of\n        TCGs that previously relied on material artifacts. $2 is a digital trading card game that\n        utilizes Non-Fungible Tokens to address concerns over ownership. However, in the wake of the\n        sale of a $69 Million dollar NFT at Christie's art auction, crypto-art has been embroiled in\n        discourse with respect to artist exploitation, environmental, and other concerns endemic to\n        blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. This paper examines the implications of NFTs in\n        digital card games via the material histories of trading card games and the way digital TCGs\n        accelerate the extraction of capital from player communities by bypassing traditional\n        secondary markets. $2 proposes to solve these issues of ownership and assure players their\n        cards will retain their value. However, the game relies on the continued existence of the\n        publisher's platform, blockchain infrastructure, and player interest. The game also ignores\n        how cards become valuable. Despite mimicking the artificial scarcity associated with TCGs,\n        it does not take into account the impact metagame trends have on the value of cards. By\n        looking at NFT implementations in games such as $2 we can identify several issues with the\n        technology that might otherwise be overlooked in favor of more common critiques. This also\n        highlights several implications remediation and adaptation herald for digital versions of\n        analog games.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic shift in the nature of work and collaboration for our design-led research group. In this paper, we describe the experimental use of the Gather Town platform for a variety of communication and collaboration activities. This alternative to standard video conferencing software uses spatial metaphors and attempts to regain some of the affordances of physical co-location such as serendipity and a sense of presence. In creating custom Gather spaces for our team, we found that it brought positive benefits to informal collaboration in work environment. For teaching and workshop facilitation, it created additional opportunities for flexible small-group working with affordances not available with traditional break-out rooms. We also report initial results of Gather being used in a conference setting not just to recreate the liminal, informal social spaces, but as a novel form of interactive paper presentation. While each of these experimental contexts showed benefits of a spatial digital context, we also highlight some of the challenges identified. Through this work, we question future implications for workplaces, knowledge sharing and the post-pandemic world. We ask whether digital tools and technologies should be used not only to attempt replication of physical spaces and practices, but also to explore new opportunities to work in profoundly different ways, that offer independent ways of being.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Web archives - broadly conceived as any attempt to capture and preserve the Web for future use - are evermore central to discussions of digital access in the public sphere, as they provide tools for accessing parts of the Web that have been subject to neglect, removal or state and platform-based forms of content moderation and censorship. In this paper I discuss the cultural significance of web archiving through the example of Tumblr’s 2018 efforts to remove so-called ‘Not Safe for Work’ (NSFW) posts from the platform. The paper examines the archiving of Tumblr NSFW by Archive Team, a self-described ‘loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage’. Findings are presented through the concept of culture which provides a dual lens through which to understand web archiving practices as contingent upon the cultural worlds which they create and operate within. Here, web archiving as culture reveals the ways that practices shape (and are shaped by) online community membership, the nature of how and why the Web is archived and the reflexive significance participants place on their own web archival activities. The paper contributes to broader discussions of online community formation and raises further questions about the ethics and role of power in the production of web archives, as well as their positioning as historical representations of online cultures.</jats:p>",

Taken together, the papers in this panel discussion engage with novel domains of internet research and shine a light on the unique ethical questions increasingly confronting researchers, while also striving to provide possible guidance on how to start addressing these dilemmas.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper offers a critical exploration of the notion of liveness and, in particular, the production of liveness in the context of hybrid media event of terrorist violence. With Christchurch mosque attacks of March, 2019, as the empirical context of study, the paper demonstrates i) how the perpetrator produced liveness through the live streaming of the massacre in digital media; ii) how this material circulated in diverse digital platforms; and iii) what kind of struggles emerged around visibility and erasure by way of removal as carried out by different platforms (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter). The empirical data collection and analysis is based on a method of digital media ethnography. We posit that live streaming of the Christchurch mosque attacks resulted in the weaponization of liveness (Callahan 2017), accelerating the experience of ‘real time’ witnessing of death on multiple levels. While a relatively small number of people watched the massacre take place in ‘real time’ (en direct), a much larger audience captured the ‘re-enactment’ of liveness through the active circulation and sharing of the video on different platforms. This, the paper argues, shapes the hybrid media events of terrorist violence of today not only as a phenomenon of intensified and accelerated death experienced online, but also as a phenomenon that amplifies the process of disgracing and dishonoring the dignity of human life as unique.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet memes are now part of mainstream media culture. On social\n        media, each day memes are created, consumed, and shared by millions of people. Advertising\n        agencies create their own memes to promote brands and products. However, memes are also\n        integral to subcultures on 4chan, Reddit, and Tumblr, where most memes originate from. These\n        subcultures battle the mainstreamization of memes to protect the independent media making\n        practice of memeing from outsiders, who they call ‘normies.’ Their weapon of choice are\n        so-called ‘dank memes,’ which are self-reflexive internet memes that criticize mainstream\n        memes and memeing. This critique is a form of visual vernacular criticism, which is highly\n        understudied, especially in regard to digital metapictures such as dank memes. The question\n        this paper wants to answer is: how are dank memes made and employed to reclaim the\n        independent media making practice of memeing from mainstream and marketing culture? The\n        focus lies on specific pictorial practices that counteract the popularization and\n        commercialization of internet memes. To explore these counter-practices, the paper proposes\n        a methodology that combines media philosophy with practice theory to stress that digital\n        metapictures themselves such as dank memes hold knowledge about the media practices that\n        mainstream memes are made of, and about how to counteract them. To explore this media\n        knowledge, examples of the meta-meme $2 are closely examined in the context of the subreddit\n        r/dankmemes. The conducted picture practice analysis suggests that dank memes oppose image\n        macros, while being criticized themselves as mere shibboleths to meme culture.</jats:p>",

Beyond these spectacular (and sometimes hypothetical) projects, this paper details how these tech companies are already changing the ways communication networks are managed. It shows that they become a dominant force shaping global connectivity by leveraging the platform logic that granted them their initial success in the web economy, and adapting it to communication infrastructures. Based on interviews with industry experts and network engineers, document analysis, and site visits, this paper offers a model to analyse this platformization of communication infrastructures: it consists of disaggregating existing networks components, inserting a platform which acts as new integrator, and making networks modular and programmable. This model extends scholarship on the platformization of social and economic life and shows how the same platform logic is at the center of the infrastructural expansion of tech giants and at the source of the power they gain over global connectivity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As campaigns use social media to communicate with the public, this study investigates the dynamics of issue and image construction by the U.S. presidential candidates during the primary stage of the 2016 presidential campaign. Using computational techniques to classify candidate posts by message type and topic, we study all posts by the 17 Republican and 5 Democratic candidates from Sept. 1, 2015 through March 31, 2016. We ask whether candidates post more about their image--their character and personality--or on issues, and when they post on issues, does each candidate own specific policy issues. We also investigate which topics the public tends to engage with more. We also ask if there are differences in how the candidates use social media. Our results suggest that candidates post substantially less on the issues as compared with other types of messages. When they do post about policy topics, the candidates are associated with distinct policy positions, suggesting issue ownership as a strategic differentiator. Results also suggest campaigns use Facebook in ways different from Twitter, further reinforcing prior scholarship suggesting that campaigns use their social media for different purposes given different audiences on the platforms. Our findings indicate that campaigns overall are not discussing policy matters, thereby depriving the public the opportunity to engage in discussion of vital issues and what they would do to solve them; instead, the cult of personality seems to be further exacerbated by social media.</jats:p>",

    "title": "‘FAKE NEWS’ AND OTHER PROBLEMATIC INFORMATION: STUDYING DISSEMINATION AND DISCOURSE PATTERNS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Encompassed by the disputed term ‘fake news’, a variety of overtly or covertly biased, skewed, or falsified reports claiming to present factual information are now seen to constitute a critical challenge to the effective dissemination of news and information across established and emerging democratic societies. Such content – variously also classifiable as propaganda, selective reporting, conspiracy theory, inadvertent misinformation, and deliberate disinformation – in itself is not new; however, contemporary digital and social media networks enable its global dissemination and amplification, by human and algorithmic actors (Woolley &amp; Howard 2017), ordinary users and professional agents, outside of, in opposition to, or sometimes also in collusion with, the mainstream media (Shao et al. 2017; Vargo et al. 2017). Various political, commercial, and state actors are suspected to have exploited this ‘fake news’ ecosystem to influence public opinion, in major votes ranging from the Brexit referendum to national elections, and/or to utilise discourse around ‘fake news’ to generally undermine trust in media, political, and state institutions. This panel brings together a number of perspectives that combine systematic, large-scale, mixed-methods analysis of the empirical evidence for the global dissemination of, engagement with, and visibility of problematic information in public debate with the study of the public discourse about ‘fake news’, and the operationalisation of this concept by politicians and other societal actors to downplay inconvenient facts or reject critical questions. In combination, its five papers present a substantive collection of innovative approaches to the ‘fake news’ concept, exploring the dissemination of problematic information itself at larger and smaller scales as well as examining the operationalisation of the idea of ‘fake news’ in pursuit of specific ideological aims. This produces a new and more comprehensive picture of the overall impact of ‘fake news’, in all its forms, on contemporary societies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>QAnon is a right-wing conspiracy theory based on a series of posts (“Drops”) made to the imageboard 8chan by “Q”, an anonymous poster who claims to be a Trump administration insider and encourages their followers (“Bakers”) to conduct research to interpret and find hidden truths (“Bread”) behind current events. In this paper, we argue that QAnon Bakers adopt a “scientistic self” by producing and maintaining specific facts and theories that enable the conspiracy’s social and political cohesion over time. Rather than dismissing Q researchers’ conclusions out of hand, we adopt science studies’ symmetry principle to consider the tools and techniques of Baking. We argue that the institutional character of Baking distinguishes QAnon from other online conspiracy communities, which primarily rely on anecdotal evidence or sow doubt in scientific consensuses. Q, by contrast, research is intended to produce certainty through the systematic construction of alternative facts. In making this argument, we share and build upon other scholars’ critiques of participatory media. Indeed, we conclude that it is precisely the participatory affordances of the social web that have made QAnon so potent.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the age of continuous data collection and algorithmic predictions, children’s privacy seems threatened by the variety of surveillance and data practices in which parents, institutions, corporations and children themselves engage. The vast amount of data routinely collected about children as they grow up include data shared online, whether by children themselves (social media updates, web searches and browsing, data traces of their internet and smartphone use) or their parents (sharenting practices); data shared in the home, like conversations and environmental data captured by internet-connected devices such as smart speakers and internet connected toys; data shared outside the home, including educational and school apps, biometric data in schools and/or airports and stations, health data and medical records, geo-location apps or wearables, etc. Data can be knowingly shared with others, or “given off” as traces of online activities, and even inferred by algorithms that profile, classify and predict users’ behaviour. This panel on the datafication of childhood draws together a number of leading scholars in this area of research to explore questions and issues associated with children’s privacy online as both a protective and enabling right. The collection of papers in this panel contribute empirical data and theoretical insight on a range of relevant topics in the study of the datafication of childhood from the perspective of both children and parents. Based on qualitative and quantitative methods, the individual contributions to the panel illuminate the situated nature of data practices, their embeddedness in diverse contexts and practices of meaning-making through which children and parents negotiate online privacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Technology, including artificial intelligence in im/migration service delivery and migration management have been widely deployed in EuroAmerica (Mongia, 2018; Walia, 2021). In Canada, Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has, in the past few years, secretly piloted an in-house built AI system for triaging im/migrant applications from China, India and the Philippines (Molnar &amp; Gill, 2018). The 2 million immigration applications backlog in part caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has been used as a justification to accelerate the push for the adoption of AI in im/migration affairs stating the need to modernize, optimize and expedite immigration affairs. Building on AoIR 2022’s theme, I take a decolonial approach to the study of AI and im/migration issues. I follow the claim made by decolonial scholars (El-Nany, 2020) that it is necessary to go back in history in order to better understand current power relations, systemic racism and patriarchy, the ongoing dispossession and forced im/mobility of racialized populations located in the global South. I conceptualize the use of AI as immobility to show how populations become testing grounds to decide who is worthy of im/mobility. Methodologically, this conference paper is informed by access to information requests made to the government of Canada to shed light on the use of AI systems within the IRCC. In addition, this paper relies on desk research including newspaper articles, blog posts and podcasts by and with immigration lawyers, and parliamentary hearings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What does it mean to be data literate? The answer to this question is not a simple one, as opinions differ. The majority of definitions seem to lean toward an instrumental framing. Increasingly, definitions are developed that take a more critical stance. However, understanding data is often neglected or underdeveloped. On March 22 2022, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission published a new version of the Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) which is one of the most widely used frameworks.The new version 2.2 aims to ‘(…) engage citizens confidently and safely with digital technologies, taking account of emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), (and) datafication’. In our contribution we aim to critically analyse the DigComp 2.2 framework. We do this by focusing on an analysis of the examples, as they are meant to: ‘(…) motivate education and training providers to update their curriculum and course material to face today’s challenges’. We have selected 84 examples out of the total 259 examples which have any bearing on data, algorithms and AI and have coded them. The main outcome of our analysis is that DigComp 2.2 manages to introduce new themes related to data and AI into its framework, be it with a very strong focus on AI. Much more emphasis is put on Understanding Data than on Using Data. DigComp 2.2. strongly leans towards a social science perspective on data literacy and less on a STEM perspective of data literacy.</jats:p>",

    "title": "SEMANTIC MEDIA: POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVES ON PLATFORMIZED FACT PRODUCTION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Large media platforms are now in the habit of providing facts in their products and representing knowledge to various publics. For example, Google’s Knowledge Graph is a database of facts that Google uses to provide quick answers to publics who use their products, while Wikipedia has a product called Wikidata that similarly stores facts about the world in data formats through which various apps can retrieve the data. Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM use similar fact storing and retrieval techniques in their products. This panel introduces papers that take a political economy perspective on such platformaized versions of fact production and examines the underlying infrastructures, histories, and modeling techniques used in such knowledge representation systems.\n\nKnowledge representation, long a central topic in archiving work in library and information sciences, is a key feature of platforms and practiced by internet companies more broadly. Much of this work has historically centered on metadata models that seek to organize and describe information in standardized ways. In the context of expanding this data organizing and labeling work into the wider web, one of the main facilitators was the “Semantic Web” project proposed by Tim-Berners Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Today, many of the same principles, technologies, and standards that were proposed by those early projects in metadata modeling from groups like W3C are found at companies like Google and Facebook, organizations like Wikipedia, government portals, and beyond.\n\nThese platform metadata models are typically produced by industry professionals (e.g., taxonomists, ontologists, knowledge engineers, etc.) who help structure information for algorithmic processing on platforms and their recommender systems. Such structured information is supposed to add a layer of contextual expressivity to web data that would otherwise be more difficult to parse, though the issue of context control is not unproblematic in relation to statements of facts. In many of these automated systems, metadata models contribute to articulating ready-made facts that then travel through these systems and eventually reach the products that are engaged by everyday web users. This panel connects scholars working in information, media studies, and science and technology studies to discuss these semantic technologies.\n\nThe first paper presents data gathered from interviews with semantic web practitioners who build or have built metadata models at large internet and platform companies. It presents results from a qualitative study of these platform data management professionals (collectively referred to as “metadata modelers”) and draws from unstructured interviews (n=10) and archival research. The paper describes the image of a metadata ecology along with selected work-related contestations expressed by interview subjects regarding some of the difficulties and intractable problems in metadata modeling work. The paper includes a discussion of the political economy of platform semantics through an examination of critical semantic web literature and ends with some policy concerns.\n\nThe second paper translates the method of tracing “traveling facts” from science studies to the context of online knowledge about evolving, historic events. The goal is to understand the socio-political impact of the semantic web as it has been implemented by monopolistic digital platforms and how such practices intersect in the context of Wikipedia, where the majority of knowledge graph entities are sourced from. The paper describes how the adoption (and domination) by platform companies of linked data has catalyzed a re-shaping of web content to accord with the question and answer linked data formats, weakening the power of open content licenses to support local knowledge and consolidating the power of algorithmic knowledge systems that favor knowledge monopolies.\n\nThe third paper discusses building a semantic foundation for machine learning and examines how information infrastructures that convey meaning are intimately tied to colonial labor relations. It traces the practice of building a digital infrastructure that enables machines to learn from human language. The paper describes examples from an ethnographic study of semantic computing and its infrastructuring practices to show how such techniques are materially and discursively performative in their co-emergence with techno-epistemic discourses and politico-economic structures. It examines sociomaterial process in which classifications, standards, metadata, and methods co-emerge with processes of signification that reconstitute and/or shift hegemonic ecologies of knowledge.\n\nThe fourth paper evaluates and examines the ethics of “free” data (CC-0) in Wikidata by evaluating the sources and usage of data from and within Wikidata. From knowledge graphs to AI training, Wikidata is the semantic web platform that is being used across the Internet to power new platforms. Through a consideration of the ways in which Wikidata scrapes Wikipedia’s “share alike” knowledge through scraping metadata and the significant donations and partnerships from large technology firms (Google in particular), this paper addresses ethical concerns within the largest semantic web platform, how these transformations of knowledge alienate donated volunteer labor, and offers some ways in which these issues might be mitigated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper offers original insights into social media audiences’ emotional responses to data visualisations about climate change and how these responses play a role in mobilising participation in different national and geographical contexts. Understanding the role emotions play in engagements with graphic representations of data is important, because there is an increased circulation of data through visual representations in everyday life, and because emotions are vital components for making sense of data and for eliciting engagement. Despite this, sociological research has yet to explore emotional experiences of datavis and where they can lead.\n\nThis paper uses a comparative mixed qualitative methods approach, incorporating semiotic analysis of thirteen datavis about climate change, nine semi-structured interviews with ten data visualisation professionals from six organisations who design, commission and/or disseminate data visualisations about climate change, thirty-four semi-structured interviews and thirteen follow-up interviews with diverse audience participants from the United Kingdom and Poland who responded to these data visualisations on social media.\n\nThe paper argues that datavis can be seen as what I have called an ‘emotional repository’ of dynamic and complex emotional experiences. It can trigger multiple, simultaneous, and often contradictory emotions, relating mainly to the data that is the subject of the visualisation or aesthetic form. These emotions play an important role in mobilising audiences to participate in datafied democracies, more often on an individual and daily level, and less frequently on a collective and public scale. However, they do so in different ways, depending on geographical context and demographic characteristics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How do gendered power structures colonize wearable tech and biodesign practice? This paper contends that it is not just the practitioner’s gender, but the gender of the practice itself, that affects the sense of the body being designed for, as well as design goals.\n\nDrawing on participant observation and interview data from the wearable tech and biodesign communities, this analysis explores the concrete effects of symbolic gender dichotomies on wearable tech and biodesign practices and outcomes. Extending critical race and technology studies’ claim that design settings’ lack of diversity can lead to biased outcomes, it looks at the lack of diversity in design methods, especially regarding gendered design practices, such as sewing or knitting, in the realm of embodied technology. It examines gendered assumptions in both digital wearable tech, and biodesign, which incorporates living organisms into its function, such as weaving conductive protein nano-wires into mushroom grown textiles. The paper shares three key findings. First, gendered meanings in personnel encounters affected who is considered an expert; female engineers and designers told of having to dress and talk like a man to be taken seriously. Second, less value is accorded to ‘feminine’ ways of making such as knitting, even though these practices can create more cooperative, comfortable, less harmful user/device interactions. Finally, mapping feminine and masculine-oriented design concerns and practices onto post-human or trans-human frameworks, reveals how masculine associated techno/supremacist ideals contrast with feminist informed symbiotic interdependencies between user and technology, which produce designs that envision a more equitable technological future.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Among Chinese fans of ‘traffic celebrities’ (liuliang mingxing, 流量明星), to generate excessive data either on digital platforms or in various sales charts so as to inflate certain entertainer’s popularity has become a normalized ritual to demonstrate one’s fan identity. The so-called fandom economy effectively mobilizes fans from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to consume and participate, thus, generates tremendous revenues. However, when some fans could easily satisfy their consumerist desire for being economically powerful and socially successful, many more—who are seduced by the communitas of fan activism and agency as consumers —are unable or not yet fully prepared to afford this lifestyle. Depending on an eighteen-month ethnography, this study unpacks how these fans are seduced, to some extent included, but still exploited in the transitional Chinese consumer society as new poor (Bauman 2005), where digital platforms become new structuring nexus and transform existing power dynamics. </jats:p>",

    "title": "RULE BY DEFAULT: A CROSS-PLATFORM ANALYSIS OF PRIVACY SETTINGS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Privacy settings are a critical space of research. Settings are uniquely positioned at the intersection between users and digital platforms and regulation, providing a visible privacy architecture (unlike backend privacy infrastructure and code) as well as an opportunity for users to interact with privacy choices (unlike terms of service and privacy policy documents which offer only all-or-nothing options). This paper examines the structural power relations and hierarchies inherent within privacy settings. We address the conference theme of decolonizing the internet through a comprehensive analysis of privacy controls, a critical site of power for the “new colonising forces in the form of multinational tech giants who are re-fashioning the world in their own image” (#AoIR2022 CFP).\n\nThis paper applies a theoretical framework of science &amp; technology studies (STS) to analyze the affordances of social media platforms’ privacy settings. Further, we apply Ian Bogost’s theory of procedural rhetoric to examine how platforms apply “the art of using processes persuasively” (Bogost, 2007). We conduct a comparison study of privacy settings across the most popular social media platforms: Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Pintrest, Twitter, and Reddit. The purpose of this qualitative analysis is to examine how privacy is presented to users. How does each platform define privacy? Where do they locate different kinds of privacy settings? What kinds of privacy choices are offered? How do these choices differ? How a platform designs their choice architecture for privacy shapes a user’s understanding of what privacy is and means.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to their internet connectivity and intensive data collection about users and their environments, smart speakers extend the datafication of the domestic environment, while contributing to the normalisation of data relations as an integral part of family everyday life.\n\nOur study extends the analysis of the domestication of smart speakers into the domestic context, family relations, practices and imaginaries. In particular, we provide theoretical and empirical insights into the study of datafication as a diverse, situated and embodied experience.\n\nIn order to analyse the emergent and situated relationships (through and with smart speakers), agencies and power structures mobilised in the domestication of smart speakers, we conceptualise families as communicative figurations comprising actors (family members), culture (including technological and surveillance imaginaries), communication practices, and a specific digital media ensemble.\n\nDrawing on mixed-method data, our findings show that communicative figurations involve a reconfiguration of power and agency relating both to traditional axes (status, class, gender and age) and new forms of power enabled by the progressive colonisation of the domestic environment by data colonialism.\n\nWe propose and discuss a typification of households along a continuum of positions in family relationships with data between two opposite poles: data-resistants and data-normalisers. Households can negotiate, resist and oppose datafication practices and imaginaries by mobilising various strategies, discourses, meanings and practices.\n\nUltimately, our theoretical approach and typification allow studying how data practices materialise – and are (partially) accepted, negotiated or rejected – as a specific communicative figuration in each family.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Much of the professional fact-checking activities that were once conducted by political journalists and news media during electoral periods or political debates, or what Luengo and Garcia-Marin (2020) call fact checking of top-down claims, now focus on assessing dis/misinformation emerging from social media users, or bottom-up claims. Between 2019 and 2021, the number of fact-checking organizations rose substantially in three key regions of the world (Asia: 35 to 75; Africa: 9 to 19; and Latin America: 18 to 38) (Stencel &amp; Luher, 2021). To further address the recognised need for bottom-up fact checking, Meta recently added 28 fact-checking organizations to their funded partnership program (Facebook, 2021) and opened up access to their detection and engagement measurement tools (Full Fact, 2020). This new fact-checking infrastructure has made the geopolitics of dis/misinformation more visible globally because fact checkers can monitor online spread in near real time. This study investigates the Facebook communication of domestically produced fact checks of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation by Meta’s third party fact checkers. Specifically, we investigate the Covid-19 vaccine fact checks that Meta-affiliated fact checkers in the so-called Global South have selected and how they are packaged for dissemination on Facebook.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper will discuss a topic of prioritized importance in contemporary Indigenous research: data sovereignty. In the light of the historical and cultural contexts in which we conduct our research, we need to drastically question and decenter research practices that could contribute to reiterating, maintaining, and amplifying colonial practices and perspectives. Data harvesting is such a practice, and an issue of immediate interest on the agenda of Indigenous researchers and allies. Efforts toward ethically valid and cultural-sensitive modes of data use are taking shape in Indigenous research, calling for an increased awareness about the topic among scholars within the interdisciplinary field of digital research.\n\nThis presentation takes its point of departure in Sápmi, the traditional area of settlement of the Indigenous Sámi people, and in ongoing research and initiatives in the area. The international research context constitutes the framework for contextualizing topical debates and issues in Sápmi. First, I will approach and examine practices and principles of data collection, data management and data curation through the lens of Indigenous research. Second, I will discuss examples of digital initiatives in curatorship of Indigenous traditional knowledge, for instance the labelling of cultural heritage, use of metadata and access to library and archive collections. Current debates and ongoing works about ethical guidelines and about the application of FAIR and CARE principles will be central in this discussion.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the process of radicalization on the alternative social media platform Gab, and the flow of information between Gab and other similar platforms. Corresponding to the socio-political changes and increasing polarization across the globe, some alternative platforms have witnessed a rising popularity among ultra-conservative and/or right-leaning users. Among such platforms, a few have succeeded in surviving the external pressures put on them through “deplatformisation”. Gab, an alternative platform often equated to the far-right copy of Twitter, is one such space (Zannettou et al., 2018). Gab exhibits significant changes in participation and discourse. By analyzing temporal dynamics of posts on three topics—vaccination discourse, music, and food—we trace the process of radicalization on Gab. We also mapped the content from the most shared external sources (domains) across platforms such as BitChute, Odyssey, Rumble etc. to trace the flow of information across the fringe network. We argue that users are overcoming deplatforming or deplatformization by creating sustainable flows of information in a range of services and spaces, all interconnected through their platformized function. We define this as \"alt-platformization\", the systemic and systematic process of creating a self-sufficient, viable alternative to the platformized web, entailing the necessary infrastructure, production, circulation, consumption, and reproduction of discourses. A key differentiating feature of alt-platformization is the ideological, along with commercial logics dominating this process and space. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This year’s AoIR gathering calls us to consider how \"new colonizing forces” are “re-fashioning the world in their own image,” and how we might resist such persistent narratives of destructive domination. Our panel examines various modes of online participatory culture and community building through three different frameworks: undetected semiotic affiliation on YouTube, the participatory religious storytelling of QAnon, and the neoliberal self-colonization of MLMs. Our collective aim is to expose existing colonial structures in online spaces (as well as their offline roots) and break them down in order to offer something new. We offer three interdisciplinary approaches that weave together a story about the desire for community and connection. Persistent narratives of individualism compete with the desire for welcoming spaces and shared values, but a long history of colonized internet threatens to reinforce linguistic and narrative hegemony within these online communities. These papers dive deep into the complex problem of finding kinship through destructive worldviews and alternative histories. Unless we find sustainable ways of recognizing and dispelling these pockets of fringe communities, they will inevitably continue to grow and draw in more participants. In a climate of rising individualism and distrust in institutions, communal spaces will continue to be a place of important contestation. People will inevitably gravitate toward (online) communities, but there is a growing concern about what sorts of communities gain the most traction and participants. This panel asks: How can we create more robust safeguards, more compelling stories, and less profit-driven modes of existing in community?</jats:p>",

We seek to present a conceptualization of trust which we believe, when pursued earnestly by designers, will be most broadly and universally effective in generating trust among users.\n\nIn this presentation, following a review of conceptualizations and operationalizations of trust in a data privacy context, we will present a critique and reformulation of “trust” that centers marginalized perspectives, focusing most of all on disabled experience but also seeking to decenter privileged perspectives and keep experiences of BIPOC, LGBTQ+ persons, and women closely in view. Since power is most visible at the margins, centering marginalized perspectives is most likely to find the outlines and structures of power, and design centered on marginalized experiences is likely to be more universal than is a focus on privileged experiences even when supplemented with post hoc and ad hoc accommodations. We conducted this analysis from the frameworks of disability studies, phenomenology and postphenomenology, and feminist ethics of care.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Self-representation is ubiquitous in digital spaces, but much of the existing literature discussing it is focused on social media contexts. Self-representation involves the creation of media traces that record users’ presence and existence through media, but these traces and the platforms that circulate them do not have to be explicitly or directly social. We study self-representation in alternative digital contexts: lifestyle apps focused on ambient usage behaviors that are generally private, personal, or invisible in online spaces. These apps incorporate social features based on displays of user data—streams repurposing users’ engagement with the platform as social displays to networked friends. The three apps of interest include the payment app Venmo, music streaming app Spotify, and fitness tracking app Strava. We study these apps through a combination of “walkthroughs” of each of the platforms and interviews with users. Our findings suggest that these platforms repurpose individual user behaviors as digital residues in social streams, transforming them into networked self-representations. Within this process, we expect that some users intentionally mobilize their engagement with the apps as social performances. Ultimately, this study raises questions about digital self-making, commodification, and platform sanctioned sociality beyond social media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite being a friendly face for children and an ambassador brand for Japan, Pokémon has always had a strong corporate side. As the Internet and technologies for hacking and communication became more available, players became more disillusioned about the friendliness of Pokémon as a franchise. The controlling nature of Game Freak along with the growing perception of lack of respect for its consumers has created a negative perception of the corporate aspect of the franchise. As a result, a global duality emerged; a corporate, franchise centered component versus a fan based, community-driven culture. In the global nature of Pokémon, where then does the local fit in? How do local Canadian players perceive, negotiate, and resist the corporate and global cultures to make their own play practices?\n\nThis study examines ways in which the global aspect of Pokémon, both the corporate side and the community culture, influence the play practices of local Canadian players. Through one-on-one interviews, adult Pokémon players who have played Pokémon since the 1990s, provide insights into ways the Internet and other communication technologies have impacted the way they perceive and play Pokémon games. By grounding the nebulous idea of metaplay with 3 components, being metagaming, paratexts, and gaming capital, we can better understand contemporary digital play practices by integrating the communicative nature of the tools players use not only to play their games and expand their experience and knowledge, and how this works not only on a global, cultural level, but also the local, individual level.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the role of social media in the definition and organization of lesbian sociocultural landscapes. Building from geographical studies that identify how lesbians’ dispersion across cities counters heteropatriarchal occupations of space, the study is anchored within Montreal/Tiohtià:ke to identify local approaches to visibility and gathering. This angle is combined with digital scholarship that considers how mobile technologies, platforms, and apps give rise to hybrid arrangements that merge physical and digital practices of socialization. These lenses are applied to interviews with representatives from organizations and individuals who use digital technologies to connect lesbians online and across physical space, such as for hosting parties, outdoor activities, and other social gatherings. Preliminary findings show that their use of social media facilitates negotiations of visibility and togetherness while posing definitional challenges. As Montreal’s lesbian networks have become dispersed across the city, multiple modes of communication–from email newsletters to social media–enable meeting across urban space. However, social media pages, events, and accounts necessitate the production of images and text that reflect static definitions of these organizations, the events, and their target audiences. Altogether, we find that social media is a focal tool, among others, to support lesbians’ networked social arrangements but that platforms lack affordances for the fluidity that is integral to ever-fluctuating lesbian/queer identities, locations, and temporalities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Like the broader beauty industry, YouTube’s beauty vlogosphere has historically been dominated by gender- and sexually normative White woman. However, in recent years, a new class of racially diverse, queer-identified beauty vloggers have risen to fame on the platform, garnering millions of subscribers and lucrative brand deals. Previous scholarship has identified the specific type of labor that queer online content creators undertake as “queer immaterial labor,” which recognizes that (1) immaterial labor is not performed in the same way by creators in online spaces, but rather is structured by complex interplay between a variety of social identities; and (2) that queer influencers undertake labor that is specific to the queer community (e.g. performance of the coming-out narrative, employing queer cultural resources) (Homant and Sender, 2019). Our goal is to use a computational approach to measure its two primary facets: amount of labor and unique labor practices. This can be accomplished by returning to YouTube and expanding the sample of queer and non-queer beauty vloggers with broader metrics for comparison. We will use a mixture of comments, transcripts, and video metadata to characterize and contextualize the amount and type of labor performed by a sample of popular queer beauty vloggers (&gt;100,000 subscribers) in comparison to their straight peers. Our goal is to provide a series of descriptive comparisons across this large sample of beauty vloggers on YouTube. Insights will allow us to directly point to areas of potentially inequitable output and differences in labor practices across these two groups.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the key critical questions of our times is the understanding of how data, algorithmic logics and AI are altering our agency as citizens, and what forms of resistance and opposition are emerging on the ground. Some scholars have shown how algorithms both prohibit as well as aid activists’ agency (Milan, 2018; Treré, 2019; Etter and Albu, 2021), while others have focused on how individual activists challenge the power of algorithms and reclaim a sense of agency (Velkova and Kaun, 2021). Although over the last years much research has emerged on the civic and human rights implications of automated systems and algorithmic profiling, little attention has been paid to what was happening on the ground and how social movement actors were actively organising against algorithmic profiling.\n\nIn this paper, we draw on ten semi-structured interviews with actors from civil society or non-governmental organisations in Europe, who struggle against algorithmic decision making, and combine these findings with a qualitative textual analysis of ten campaign websites, both conducted in the context of a wider research project exploring the conflict over algorithmic profiling. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the discourses and practices of social movement actors when it comes to resisting algorithmic injustices. The key question that we are interested in addressing is to explore how – in the everyday resistance to algorithmic profiling – actors rely on three different strategies of action (algorithmic literacy, algorithmic regulation and algorithmic accountability). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the following panel, we add to scholarly challenges regarding the binary distinction between life and death by examining new strategies of making productive the data of the dead. Digital media and tactics of big data collection, storage, and processing blur the boundaries of human lifecycles, allowing the individual to exist as a productive part of sociotechnical apparatuses long after their corporeal demise. Specifically, our presentations on digital data and death focus on the topics of subjectivation, consent and privacy, and commodification. Reanimator: Haunted Data, Streaming Media, and Subjectivity examines the process of subjectivation taking into account the haunted data and digital afterlives of streaming media. Here, the living and bounded subject is challenged by compositions of big data, platforms, infrastructures, and algorithms that offer the possibility of a productive sociotechnical economic subject unbounded from the human body. Grief by the Byte: Constructions of Data Consent, Privacy, and Stability in Griefbots interrogates the data practices and ethics related to the creation of chatbots from the data of deceased individuals. While “griefbots” are framed as helpful to those grieving a lost loved one, there remain questions about consent and privacy that accompany these interactions. Finally, What is Dead May Never Die: The Commodification of Death in Social Media studies how user data maintains economic value after death via networks designed to surveil, collect, and commodify the immaterial labor of the dead. These practices enable a possible economic future largely influenced by the data of the dead.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper takes up the question of how “platform” can be understood when it comes to studies of digital discourse. I posit that this is an empirical and ethnographic question, rather than a purely theoretical one. Regardless of how scholars theorize social media platforms and other technologies, the people interacting with those technologies already have their own emic conceptualizations of what that technology is and how it functions and those understandings shape their social media experiences. This paper aims to explore the stakes of such local conceptualizations. I argue that many of tumblr.com's most active users conceptualize the social media platform as a living actor — a dynamic and agentive entity $2 whom these young people interact, rather than a space $2 which they interact or a medium $2 which they interact. Attending to this particular understanding of Tumblr-as-actor is crucial because it has so intimately shaped the processes by which my research participants have come to take up new political-ethical commitments and identities through their engagement with the platform. However, I suggest that new methodological approaches for the study of digital discourse are required if scholars are to truly take seriously an understanding of platform as agentive figure. To this end, I argue for the use of audio-visual screen capture technologies that concurrently record the content on a screen alongside the bodies of users themselves for analyzing in-the-moment interactions between user and platform.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholars and journalists have noted that Discord, a social application oriented around voice/video chat communities and popular amongst gamers, has a history of harboring white supremacist and toxic groups. Discord has recently undertaken a public rebranding to distance itself from white supremacist, alt-right, and hateful content through a commitment to proactive moderation (Brown, 2020). However, Discord relies extensively on third-party services (like bots and server bulletins), and current scholarship has not adequately accounted for the role of such third-party actors in facilitating hateful and white supremacist networks on private platforms like Discord. This study notes how Discord’s model for curating only popular servers offloads the ethical burden of searchability to server bulletin sites like Disboard, to deleterious effect. This study involves two parts: 1) we use critical technoculture discourse analysis to examine Discord’s blogs, moderation policies, and API (Brock, 2018) and 2) we present data scraped from publicly-available descriptions and tags of 3,600 Discord servers listed on Disboard. Our study finds that thousands of servers on Disboard use overtly white supremacist and hateful tags, often advertising their ‘edgy’ communities as racist, raiding-oriented, and deliberately toxic. These servers exploit Discord’s moderation tools and Disboard’s networked affordances to proliferate within Discord’s distributed ecology. Ultimately, we argue that Discord’s response to hate, as a platform, does not address its reliance on unmoderated third-party services or the networked practices of its toxic communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media have become online spaces where misinformation abounds and spreads virally in the absence of professional gatekeeping. This information landscape requires everyday citizens, who rely on these technologies to access information, to cede control of information. This work sought to examine whether the control of information can be regained by humans with the support of a co-created browser plugin, which integrated credibility labels and nudges, and was informed by artificial intelligence models and rule engines. Given the literature on the complexity of information evaluation on social media, we investigated the role of technological, situational and individual characteristics in “liking” or “sharing” misinformation. We adopted a mixed-methods research design with 80 participants from four European sites, who viewed a curated timeline of credible and non-credible posts on Twitter, with (n=40) or without (n=40) the presence of the plugin. The role of the technological intervention was important: the absence of the plugin strongly correlated with misinformation endorsement (via “liking”). Trust in the technology and technology acceptance were correlated and emerged as important situational characteristics, with participants with higher trust profiles being less likely to share misinformation. Findings on individual characteristics indicated that only social media use was a significant predictor for trusting the plugin. This work extends ongoing research on deterring the spread of misinformation by situating the findings in an authentic social media environment using a co-created technological intervention. It holds implications for how to support a misinformation-resilient citizenry with the use of artificial intelligence-driven tools.</jats:p>",

Book discussion on the web is a field considerably wider than the book blogs and the online reviews on booksellers sites that it is often identified with.

Book discussion takes place on sites as diverse as newspaper sites, online magazines, individual and group blogs, general and specialized social network sites, on traditional discussion boards and book cataloguing sites. This exploratory paper attempts a genre analysis of the Dutch booksphere, the collection of book-related sites on the web. It distinguishes between (i) site genres, which are high-level and necessarily fuzzy concepts, and a number of site facets for more precise site account, between (ii) genre of site and genre of information items on sites, and between (iii) genre of site and of sub-site. These distinctions create the conceptual apparatus for an account of the book discussion landscape and the various sites affordances.</jats:p>",

Our preliminary findings suggest that compared to the general population, techies tend to prioritize openness to change and to value self enhancement. We also demonstrate that when viewed as a single group, the overall makeup of values of the techies is similar to that of other occupational elites. Yet, the dynamics between individual values among the techies differ from those of other occupational elites and when we separate Developers from other ICT specialists, the Developers appear more extreme in their tendency to negatively value conservation and positively value self-enhancement.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how microstreamers either intentionally or\n        unintentionally share their intimate physical spaces with audiences. While most streaming\n        research focuses on larger and/or monetized professional streamers, there is emerging\n        research on ‘microstreaming’—streams whose audiences are often as low as single digits—and\n        their importance as smaller, more intimate spaces. Given their casual nature, microstreamers\n        are much less likely to have invested in professional level equipment, or to have dedicated\n        streaming-specific areas of their homes. Some scholars have argued that streaming from\n        intimate spaces such as bedrooms can be considered performative, yet our current research\n        questions the broad applicability of such findings, especially with respect to\n        microstreamers. One way to understand these shared spaces is through the lens of place.\n        Streaming represents an event in which the barriers around the “first place” are\n        intentionally removed, and spectatorship invited. Professional streamers navigate this\n        knowingly and intentionally whereas microstreamers may not – the shared spaces of\n        microstreamers can be understood as an unintentional “leaking” of one’s privately held\n        backstage, made available for consumption by unknown others. In our observations of\n        microstreamers, we note that 1) their environments are multi-purpose, unstaged, and shared\n        with others, 2) these others often interrupt or modify the content of the stream in ways\n        that leverage the space in generating increased authenticity, and 3) these streamers mimic\n        more professionalized streams in amateur ways that again produce a sense of realism and\n        endearment. These elements coalesce to provide a unique sense of authenticity and charm to\n        microstreamer content.</jats:p>",

Each presenter takes on a different topic: political internet memes, fan subcultures, conscious disconnection from internet platforms, and physical digital waste to consider the consequences of internet life. Using distinct methodologies: case study interviews, ethnography, textual studies and histories, and autoethnography, this panel considers what internet scholars can learn from the unsavory parts of the internet. Working with notions of internet waste, these presentations serve to build out a broad set of perspectives about the potential value in the trash internet, what we can learn from it, and how we can think more deeply about that which has little value or consideration in the internet life of clicks, posts, shares, likes, and follows. Through these presentations, the speakers ask the audience to consider their own views of internet garbage and to think about remedies to the toxic ecologies that impact life - both virtual and literal.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media, as many scholars have shown, can be used to influence political behavior through coordinated disinformation campaigns in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens. With a specific reference to Facebook, a recent study has spotlighted patterns of coordinated activity aimed at fueling online circulation of specific news stories before the 2018 and 2019 Italian elections, an activity called by the authors “Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior” (CLSB). More precisely, CLSB refers to the coordinated shares of the same news articles in a very short time by networks of entities composed by Facebook pages, groups and verified public profiles. The uncertainty related to the coronavirus outbreak is a unique chance for malicious actors to leverage the anxiety of online publics to reach their goals, filling the information void with problematic content. Considering the association between coordination, media manipulation, and problematic information, the entities involved in coordinated online activities represent a privileged perspective on these phenomena. Thus, against the backdrop of the literature and the already conducted studies, this proposal will discuss Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior in the context of the coronavirus outbreak informational void, analyzing network mutations over time and the content strategies used to exploit the ambiguity associated with the topic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Value is fundamental for social media platforms, not only in the\n        economic sense but also in the sense of normative principles like community and free speech.\n        Policy documents are pivotal sites for the expression of values and present a public-facing\n        account of the roles and responsibilities assigned to various actors, including individual\n        users, third parties, governments and social media corporations. While prior research has\n        examined the construction of individual values such as privacy and transparency in platform\n        policies, there has been no holistic account of the values invoked in these documents.\n        Combining a dictionary-based analysis with a qualitative content analysis, we present the\n        first comprehensive study of the values presented in the policy documents of five major\n        social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. Our analysis\n        reveals that policy documents invoke a large number of values that seemingly point to\n        conflicting priorities and commitments. However, these values can be organized in four\n        overarching principles that were consistent across platforms: community, expression,\n        privacy, and improvement. Each principle assigns responsibility for the enactment of these\n        values and by that allows platforms to limit their ethical responsibility for executing the\n        values they publicly promote. Values can thus be described as the “Cheshire cat” of social\n        media platform policies – they look magical, but once touched, may assume a different shape,\n        pop up in an alternative location, or even disappear.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Predictive algorithms are increasingly being deployed in a variety of settings to determine legal status. Further applications have been proposed to determine civil and criminal liability or to “personalize” legal default rules. Deployment of such artificial intelligence systems has properly raised questions of algorithmic bias, fairness, transparency, and due process. But little attention has been paid to the known sociological costs of using predictive algorithms to determine legal status. Many of these interactions are socially detrimental, and such corrosive effects are greatly amplified by the increasing speed and ubiquity of digitally automated algorithmic systems. In this paper I link the sociological and legal analysis of AI, highlighting the reflexive social processes that are engaged by algorithmic metrics. Specifically, this paper shows how the problematic social effects of algorithmic legal metrics extend far beyond the concerns about accuracy that have thus far dominated critiques of such metrics. It additionally demonstrates that corrective governance mechanisms such as enhanced due process or transparency will be inadequate to remedy such corrosive effects, and that some such remedies, such as transparency, may actually exacerbate the worst effects of algorithmic governmentality. Third, the paper shows that the application of algorithmic metrics to legal decisions aggravates the latent tensions between equity and autonomy in liberal institutions, undermining democratic values in a manner and on a scale not previously experienced by human societies. Illuminating these effects casts new light on the inherent social costs of AI metrics, particularly the perverse effects of deploying algorithms in legal systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to imagine alternatives is important in fostering hope for more just futures. However, it is not easy. In fact, it has been argued that the decline of imagination has prevented us from finding effective solutions to urgent planetary crises and alternatives to capitalism. In this paper, I present how the challenge was methodologically tackled and ways to spark imagination searched for in an ongoing research project. The paper presents methodological reflections, observations, and critical considerations from a workshop experiment which an AI image generator was used as a tool for imagining. The starting point was that young people's perceptions, hopes, and fears about the future matter because the future concerns them particularly. Yet, their voices often remain unheard.\n\nThe pedagogical approach was a combination of feminist, critical, anarchist, speculative, and utopian pedagogies. The use of an AI image generator allowed the playful creation of images, simultaneously providing opportunities to critically examine AI’s ethics and sustainability. It fostered the participants’ $2 in creating a collective space in which hopes and fears were voiced and heard, and today’s society and needs for its transformation discussed. Yet, there are issues in using generative AI as a research tool. Proprietary applications prevent researchers from evaluating their ethical foundations and sustainability. With datasets consisting of images harvested from the past and present, the question is to what extent it is possible to imagine something completely new and previously unimaginable with them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past decade, service providers have taken on larger roles in the regulation of violent digital networks. As reactionary platforms like Gab and Parler emerge to cater to far-right users estranged from mainstream social networking sites, their stack suppliers – domain registrars, web hosts, app stores, etc. – may enforce their Terms of Service, revoking access to services, in what José Van Dijck et al. term “deplatformization.” Deplatformization has proven circumstantially effective as in the 2021 destruction of Parler by Amazon Web Services. However, reactionary platforms have responded by building their own service providers, marketing them as “cancel-proof,” and seeding a cottage industry of far-right infrastructure firms immune to deplatformization. In this trend, which I term “replatformization,” far-right networks scale their capacity to fracture and terrorize online publics. This paper investigates replatformization through a diachronic analysis of the stack of Kiwi Farms, a text forum known for its deadly transmisogynistic harassment campaigns, its history as “victim” of service denial by multiple firms including Cloudflare, and its in-house solutions such as DDoS mitigator “KiwiFlare” and web host “Final Solutions LLC.” Anchored by materialist critical theory, I argue that the replatformization of far-right platforms reifies the role of reactionary digital networks within the social reproduction of racial capitalism. I trace an emerging reactionary Stack-consciousness as KF users become a vanguard in digital service provision. Efforts to regulate online hate culture must attend to the fact that the private ownership of the means of mediation empowers reactionary webmasters with inordinate leverage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The panel takes up AoIR’s theme of how industry pre-mediates the future of internet technology and its effects and inquiries into alternatives. Utilising ideas from the study of sociotechnical imaginaries, it aims to locate, map, and critically examine AI imaginaries together with counter-imaginaries that engage with and intervene in those of the AI industry. First, it maps the discursive landscape of Big Tech ‘AI talk’ as a means to study ‘new media concentration’. Which Big Tech AI imaginaries are stabilising? More normatively, do they seek to cement their interdependence both generally but also with respect to the future of internet technology? More specifically, how does the AI industry imagine regulation, sustainability, and the hoped (and feared) AI futures? Recent imaginaries research has emphasised multi-actor, non-linear approaches revolving around the notion of 'public imaginaries'. Along those lines, in the panel we bring together studies of AI imaginaries performed within but also beyond the AI industry. The panel considers the AI industry’s relationships with various actors, such as governments, media outlets, and academia, and the complex interplay that produces imaginaries as well as the issues that come with them. In addressing these questions and interests, the panel also presents various methodological entry points to the study of imaginaries of the AI industry and the larger ecosystem from direct interviews and distant and close readings of (cross-cultural) media coverage to an analysis of online environments such as websites and social media platforms.</jats:p>",

    "title": "CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNICATIVE AI",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Current media coverage surrounding ChatGPT, LaMDA, and Luminous has brought questions about the automation of communication into the mainstream. Artificially intelligent media are no longer merely mediating instances of communication but are themselves becoming communicative participants. This has generated broad public discussion about these systems and others and the challenges they bring to domains such as education, public discourse, and journalistic production. Much of this new “AI hype” revolves around the question of whether such systems will soon “replace” humans as workers in these various domains, whether they will develop “super intelligence” and as a result challenge or even marginalize the human species.\n\nWith this panel, we would like to give this discussion a new twist by asking what a critical perspective on communicative AI should look like. If these systems of “automated media” are not about intelligence, but about communication, what should a critical approach to them consider? Raising this question, we want to present five key critical perspectives on communicative AI.\n\nThe first paper develops a critical perspective on the visions of pioneer communities. It poses the question of whether today's pioneering communities ultimately reproduce basic patterns of the old Californian Ideology in relation to communicative AI. A second paper focuses on the perspective of data colonialism. In essence, it is about showing that a critical engagement with communicative AI means addressing the question of the extent to which systems of automated communication are linked to existing data infrastructures and nexus models of exploitation. The third paper highlights the perspective of economic value production. Since more and more social situations include human-machine communication, more social interactions become possible to monetize. This relates not only to commercial settings, but also in the public sector as it relates to the welfare state. The fourth paper focuses on a material perspective. At its core is the question of how Big Tech procures power for data centres to construct the emerging geography of cheap computational labour needed for communicative AI. The fifth paper deals with the perspective of an eco-political economy of communicative AI.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates how sexuality experts communicate sexual advice on online platforms and how audiences interact with and perceive these experts. Through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics inherent in this communication process, we seek to gain insights into the evolving landscape of sexual advice and health in the digital age. Furthermore, our objective is to address a notable gap in this body of literature by incorporating how audiences engage with this content. We conducted a thematic analysis of TikTok videos and comment sections, combined with in-depth interviews with sexuality experts, to explore how experts build credibility amongst their audience, and how audiences engage with their content and evaluate expertise and credibility. Preliminary results suggest that creators employ various strategies when their expertise is questioned, including responding to comments, crafting replies to videos, and utilizing humor to connect with users. Audience members also play a vital role in validating creators' expertise. We also found that sexual health advice was not solely coming from creators, but also from those engaging in comments, fostering a culture of advice related to the video’s theme, challenging the conventional top-down hierarchy in sexual education where expertise is unilaterally shared. Ultimately, our study aligns with this year’s conference theme – examining the emergence and continuation of industries like sexual health education – highlighting the dynamics that arise within online spaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Prepping for the apocalypse. Fighting for eternal life. Building separatist compounds for like-minded people. Reproducing to fill the world with chosen ones. Manifestos to recruit believers. All these practices are age-old characteristics of religious zealots and sound like the makings of a promising cult docuseries. And yet, they are also increasingly common obsessions of leaders of the American tech industry. From building luxury bunkers to hoping cryonic freezing could make resurrection possible, many billionaire and multi-millionaire founders, engineers, and VCs are investing time, money, and attention into speculative pursuits that are often considered the realm of religious paranoia. Through a conjunctural analysis (Hall, 1978), this research gathers evidence of four key religiously coded practices that are coursing through the Silicon Valley elite and examines the guiding ideologies behind them. By connecting the techno-solutionist practices of today’s tech elite to questions that have historically been explored via religious interventions, I hope to decenter appeals to rationality and expose the underlying values and emotions that drive these decisions. Additionally, this framework requires taking these practices seriously as symptomatic of an underlying belief system—rather than just the quirks of people with too much money on their hands. This research will unpack three core focuses: separatist communities, conquering death, and apocalypse prep.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project examines the life and death of Facebook’s “ethnic affinity” targeted advertising category. The category was the subject of several lawsuits that alleged it violated the Fair Housing Act, by allowing advertisers to exclude protected classes from the audience of an advertisement. It argues that the category serves to negotiate tensions between the supposedly “post-racial” aesthetic of web platforms, and the political economy of targeted advertising online. Using media genealogy as a method, it traces the introduction, transformation and eventual removal of “ethnic affinity” from Facebook’s interface. It reads across several archives that span a variety of stakeholders in the production and circulation of “ethnic affinity” in order to reconstruct how the category is understood, both as a technical object and as a discursive formation. It argues that technical discourse obscures the persistence of racial discrimination in algorithmic targeting by highlighting disparities between Facebook’s instructions to developers, its public-facing statements, and how advertisers understood its technical changes. “Ethnic affinity” is then best understood as a racial technology, one that constructs and enforces the boundaries of race. I argue that this has historical antecedents in the deployment of colorblindness as justification for racial disparity. This project contributes to studies on the relationship between technologies of racialization and platform capitalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>",

Second, it presents a global research project results on how not only to carry on international studies on the topic but also how to use an action-research approach to generate impact through public scoring companies and encourage the adoption of best practices by them.\n\nThe paper’s methods are based on the project’s action-research approach and methodological framework. The project scores companhies based on principles that address the major issues that define labour relations, namely, pay, conditions, contracts, management, and representation.\n\nThe paper presents the result of the assessment of cloudwork platforms conducted in 2023. In addition, it paper will examine labour relations in BPO companies in the AI supply chain using a case study of the company Sama, which is based in the United States and operates in many African countries.\n\nAmong the findings are problems such as non-payment situations, lack of policies to ensure minimum wage, significant rates of unpaid labour, poor measures to promote health and safety, problems in management practices and weak collective bargaining practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary artists using emerging technologies in their work are often positioned as innovators, mavericks, and diagnosticians, who work “outside” of the tech industry and thus bring sorely needed perspective to its developments. However, viewing new media artists as fully independent actors, devoid of any connection to industrial and corporate aims, serves to eclipse the long-standing and substantial ties that the field has to the protocols and priorities of the mainstream technology industry. These, in fact, have existed for as long as artists have attempted to integrate computation, electronics, networking, or other high-tech components into their work—both when these tools are owned and operated by corporations, but also in more diffuse, ideological ways.\n\nThis contribution, which draws from my larger dissertation work, traces the evolution of the cultural imaginary surrounding new media artists, defined in my research as practitioners who expand, reinvent, or misuse technological expression. By explicitly placing archives from three twentieth century “art and technology” initiatives against interviews with new media artists and cultural workers I conducted in the present day, I emphasize the foundational connections that new media artists have to industrial practices—and argue that this relationship can be traced back to the first attempts to place artists into collaborations with industry. As a result, industrial mandates have, to a large degree, shaped the popular conception of the new media art field, guiding both the practicalities of working with digital systems as well as notions of what artists “should” be doing with their work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In an academic milieu in which a lot of critical attention is dedicated to the data-grabbing, algorithmically biased, and asymmetrical power of massive techno-corporations, this panel explores how a focus on situated ordinary practices can provide us with a more complex, nuanced, and even at times contradictory account of what happens when pervasive digital technologies are experienced in everyday life. It does so via a combination of empirical research and theoretical development in a number of platformised and datafied domains: social media, music and generative AI. Juxtaposition of these topics and approaches, and dialogue between the authors and audience, will, we hope, forefront struggles, disputes, and ambivalences concerning what people actually do with the digital systems that they engage with. As feminist scholars established many years ago, the everyday is trivial and yet profoundly politically charged; ordinary experience is always imbued with power dynamics, hierarchies, asymmetries, and emerging modes of governmentality. Using empirically-based case studies, the panel engages with a tricky question: how can we theorise power and agency while making sense of the textures and poetics of everyday life, if the everyday is precisely in the unremarkable, the unnoticed, in that which escapes our grasp?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Drug users use surface, deep, or dark web to enhance their activity. This paper examines the intersection of the digital space and illicit substances and analyzes a Polish drug forum as a refracted public (Abidin, 2021). To illuminate the accommodation of the medical cannabis industry in the social worlds of users, their digital presence below the radar is studied through qualitative thematic analysis of the content of the major Polish surface web drug forum. The study draws on more than 8000 forum posts. The results reveal that there has been a widespread subcultural accommodation of medical cannabis for non-medical use in the form of a backchannel about the quality of the product and ways of obtaining it. We also observed an emergence of self-care and reflexive cannabis narratives, where traditional cultural framing of the substance as source of fun and pleasure converged with medical purposes narrative. Also, complicated self-regulation of use was revealed based on experimenting with tolerance, acknowledging one’s harmful use, and counteracting potential harms. We also unveiled the peer harm reduction potential of this space. Taken together, the forum accumulates knowledge and know-how for the consumers that is otherwise lacking due to the illicit or stigmatized nature of the cannabis market in Poland. Looking at what the digitally enabled discussions reveal sheds light on the possible social accommodation of cannabis ahead of significant societal and legislative transformations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the ways in which companies collaborate with green influencers on TikTok in order to combine sustainable communication with product sponsorship. TikTok, with its highly visual and meme-based communication style, offers companies a channel to align their marketing strategies with green messaging. Green influencers play a central role in this dynamic, blending activism and promotional content to raise awareness about sustainability while endorsing products. However, the actual willingness of these narratives to challenge the capitalist neoliberal logic has been questioned in the literature.\n\nA content and thematic analysis of 45 TikTok videos was conducted to see how companies express their environmental commitment through the affordances offered by the platform, including visual and viral aspects. Indeed, the aim of the paper is to explore the main actors, central themes and recurring narratives in these collaborations.\n\nThe findings reveal that companies from diverse sectors integrate product sponsorship into educational narratives that inform users about environmental issues while positioning the sponsored product as a solution. This approach aligns with the storytelling styles of green influencers, potentially enhancing the credibility of their content. However, there is a predominant focus on individual behavioural changes with limited emphasis on collective action or broader societal responses to sustainability challenges. This reflects a tension that simultaneously critiques unsustainable practices while remaining rooted in neoliberal consumer logics. As a result, these collaborations may promote sustainable consumption but fail to address the social dimensions of sustainability, restricting the potential for fostering a more comprehensive approach to environmental advocacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the tumultuous landscape of the modern automotive industry, once heralded as the epitome of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications through the promise of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The introduction of large language models (LLMs), notably with ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, marked a turning point, casting shadows over the ambitious goals set by major tech and automotive players. Notable failures, including Ford's shutdown of Argo AI and Volkswagen's struggle with electric vehicle transitions, have led to a crisis in the viability of connected and autonomous driving.\n\nThe paper identifies four central types of limitations contributing to this crisis: technical, economic, financial, and regulatory. Technical limitations expose the inadequacies of autonomous vehicles in meeting their promised capabilities. Economic limitations highlight the unsustainable nature of platformizing automotive operations, linked to innovations like vehicle subscription models. Financial limitations point to the speculative investment decisions that underpin technological projects. Regulatory limitations showcase the industry's renegotiation of conditions in response to safety concerns.\n\nBy examining these limitations, the paper establishes a conceptual framework applicable not only to the automotive industry but also to current discussions surrounding LLMs. The lessons drawn from these challenges contribute to a broader understanding of the perils and limitations within AI sub-industries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The 2022 Brazilian presidential elections and subsequent events highlight a significant period of political polarization and misinformation, particularly on social media platforms like Facebook. This study investigates the dynamics of misinformation campaigns on Facebook in the context of Brazil's political shifts, focusing on the period from the 2022 elections to the aftermath of the attempted coup on January 8, 2023. Utilizing a mixed methods approach and an innovative news alert system, we analyzed three months of links shared in a coordinated fashion leading up to the first anniversary of the attempted coup.\n\nOur findings reveal a bipartisan battlefield of political discourse, with a scenario characterized by divergence in accounts’ political alignment. We, in fact, identified two primary networks of political Facebook accounts: one supporting former President Jair Bolsonaro and another backing President Lula. Interestingly, we observed Lula supporters repeatedly share content criticizing or mocking Bolsonaro, his family members, and his supporters within pro-Bolsonaro groups. Moreover, these posts often receive a substantial number of comments and minor reactions and shares.\n\nFuture research will expand on these findings by examining a year's worth of Facebook posts from these networks to explore changes in topics and strategies over time.\n\nThe presentation will thus discuss the study's advancement outcomes in-depth, contributing to understanding how Brazilian political factions’ supporters utilize social media to influence public opinion and the implications for democracy in the digital age.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we explore how AI researchers, situated within university-based research networks, mobilise and resist industry interests. The research question to which this paper is addressed is: how do university-based academics in the field of AI experience and mediate industry influence in their research? We answer this question through semi-structured interviews with research-focused academics (n = 90) affiliated with university-based AI research networks. We find that national research funders and university leadership incentivise and facilitate industry investments in AI research. We demonstrate how AI researchers mobilise this interest to pursue their own research goals, whilst also—at times—subordinating their research goals to the interests of industry. We highlight how AI researchers internalise the commercial logics of technology firms, which become mirrored in researchers' orientation towards generalisable and scalable research outputs that can move between many application domains and local contexts. We argue that university-based AI research networks primarily operate as mediators between industry, government, and university actors, and highlight the role national research investment strategies play in creating an enabling environment for industry influence of AI research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>AI for Social Good (AI4SG) initiatives have emerged in various sectors. However, AI's non-neutral nature challenges claims that the “good” can simply be inferred by association with broad goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The lack of a clear definition of \"the good” or what it entails in practice risks making AI4SG an empty signifier. This ambiguity allows unchecked interventions, undermining societal efforts to align future AI developments with public good. In this article, we adopt a socially situated public good framework from the social studies of quantum technologies proposed by Roberson et al (2021) and use insights from critical AI scholarship to tailor this framework to AI4SG initiatives. Analysing AI4SG initiatives, and building upon existing critical literature, we scrutinize these initiatives with regards to the framings of the research problems, the wider social and institutional context in which AI initiatives are imagined to be applied and used, as well as the wider network of scientists, stakeholders and publics involved in their co-production. We argue that much of the AI4SG literature abstracts AI from social and contextual realities, making it difficult to clarify the ways in which they might in fact have an impact in the world. Outlining our first iteration, we argue that co-creating this framework demands iterative refinement and ongoing dialogue with diverse stakeholders, especially in the Global South.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel argues that social media is a key actor in the health and wellness industries, influencing how users participate in discussions and conversations related to wellbeing, health, and embodied experience. Drawing together interdisciplinary qualitative methods to advocate for a critical, feminist approach, the panel focuses on the influence of health-related social media content on users, as well as the effects of these platforms on professional content creators. The first presentation poses a methodological intervention, using Situational Analysis to map the FemTech industry, contending that social media is an important site of research. The second paper presents a close reading of FemTech influencer advertisements on social media, considering the role of influencers in promoting health and medical products. The final paper considers how everyday social media users are emerging as key actors in shaping understandings and definitions of ADHD. Together, the panel sheds light on how social media platforms have become crucial sites of information about bodily health and wellness for both traditional healthcare industry actors, non-professional users, and content creators. In conversation with one another, the papers present a detailed discussion of the relationships between social media and health, advocating for critical methodological approaches and frameworks. This interdisciplinary and globally engaged panel ultimately highlights the influence of social media on reproductive health technologies, influencer marketing, mental health, and the healthcare industry at large.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Each year, Spotify encourages its users to share aesthetically pleasing data stories ‘wrapped’ and repackaged from their listening behaviour. We approach ‘Wrapped’ as an ‘algorithmic event’, defined as a moment in time in which there is a collective orientation towards a particular algorithmic system and associated data. To examine how people make sense of ‘Wrapped’ as an algorithmic event, we bring together ordinary Spotify users to explore datafication through a series of prompts and creative activities, including a modified version of the ‘walkthrough’ (Light et al., 2018) and a craft-based exercise. These exercises allow participants to tease out how normative assumptions are baked into ‘Wrapped’ and mobilise particular understandings of individuals, their habits, tastes and identities. Importantly, we position our participants as co-analysts, following the work of Robards and Lincoln (2017) and Markham (2021), and in our analysis highlight themes that arise from their contributions. Emerging findings allude to highly ambivalent feelings towards ‘Wrapped’ as an algorithmic event: Our participants both celebrate and critique how Spotify claims to ‘know’ them as individuals. They also contest the way ‘Wrapped’ is framed as revealing the ‘truth’ about music consumption and taste. As such, we argue that algorithmic events like ‘Wrapped’ are useful ways to think through data capture and algorithmic systems. The phenomenon of ‘wrappification’ – by which we mean the repackaging of behavioural data that captures a particular activity throughout the year and the responses to the belief that we can ‘know’ ourselves in this way – speaks to such impact.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The art of Internet Research is always developing, while also firmly rooted in the theoretical frameworks of the past. As technologies have evolved over time, new ways of interacting have become pervasive, and with them, a need for a different means of analyzing such interactions. Through all of this change, internet researchers have discussed and developed effective methodologies to suit the needs of research. Significant work has been done on digital ethnographies, digital interviews, and surveys using online systems. One area not as widely discussed and developed is the use of online focus groups in synchronous video forums like Zoom or Extended Reality (XR) spaces such as ENGAGE or VRChat. This paper describes our approach to methodological systems for better understanding digital interaction through focus group interviews within such media.\n\nSpecifically, we present the theoretical underpinnings and design of an upcoming focus group study we are conducting within a virtual world setting. We focus on questions of how to incorporate different types of virtual avatars for the participants and how to collect observable data in the virtual space, including language and avatar behavior. Finally, we describe how such data can be used to understand questions of communication, power, individual agency, and identity that occur in these group settings.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the nexus between the attention economy and digital disinformation on TikTok, drawing from Esposito's adaptation of Luhmann’s system theory to the digital age and Swartz's exploration of the socio-economic layers of digital transactions. It zeroes in on cryptocurrency scams as a case study to illuminate how disinformation is propagated for economic gain, using TikTok's API for comprehensive analysis. The research employs advanced data analytics to examine how digital platforms, via algorithmic filtering, shape the flow and influence of content, thereby enabling the proliferation of disinformation markets. By thematic clustering of problematic Facebook narratives and identifying scam-specific jargon, this study pinpoints tactics used on TikTok related to the 2024 Bitcoin halving. It scrutinizes how manipulators exploit technical and platform-specific vulnerabilities for profit, integrating Luhmann's double contingency theory to elucidate the feedback loops that enhance content virality and algorithmic dissemination. This theoretical framework illuminates the complex interplay between user interactions and algorithmic preferences, which, in turn, feed into the economics of disinformation markets. The research underscores the strategic manipulation of digital platforms to foster disinformation, spotlighting the role of algorithms and user engagement in the commodification of attention within these markets. Through this lens, the study aims to provide insights into the operational dynamics of disinformation markets, offering a nuanced understanding of how digital misinformation is not merely a byproduct of technological advancement but a structured market leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities of digital platforms and their users.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For its global popularity and market expansion, K-pop idol culture has been integrated into child peer culture on social media, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. This is particularly noticeable in the form of K-pop dance challenges on short-form platforms/functions like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, where people replicate choreographic moves from latest K-pop songs and post short-form videos with hashtags. Children casually join the trending challenges for fun and post videos by themselves, their parents, and even third-party companies, including child influencer agencies and K-pop training companies. This paper interrogates how this phenomenon has evolved into children’s new peer culture within the context of the influencer and K-pop culture industries. I discuss how children are positioned and presented in the evolving landscape of culture industries in the Asia Pacific region. I argue that this genre serves as a new version of ‘child pageant programs’ where childhood is performed and presented as a mixture of cuteness, innocence, immature maturity, and prodigious skills for the adult gaze. Pertinent issues surrounding children’s agency and wellbeing are also discussed, such as children’s everyday digital labor and the subsequent normalization of commodified childhood innocence in the industries. Crucially, the virality-centered algorithms of social media platforms underpinned in K-pop dance challenges further normalizes children’s seamless labor of cute, with the myth of instant internet virality, stardom, and K-pop dream. This study is based on a 4-year ethnographic observation of children’s K-pop dance challenges in the Asia Pacific region.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents findings from a national-scale project that worked with disadvantaged communities across Australia to examine digital inclusion in low-income families and the role of social infrastructure (e.g., schools, libraries, charities, government services) in supporting digital participation. Drawing on data collected in interviews and community workshops in an outer urban community with significant socioeconomic challenges, we illuminate the digital labour of community sector workers who routinely act as digital mentors. These workers support family members who often lack access to digital devices and services along with the requisite skills to use digital technologies to perform everyday tasks, such as helping families to contact telecommunications providers, access government apps, and apply for jobs or rental leases online.\n\nIn light of our results, our study extends the concept of digital labour to include work undertaken in the service and advocacy of digital inclusion in community contexts. Specifically, we articulate the activities, challenges, frustrations, and costs (in time and resources) that characterise digital inclusion support of low-income families, often beyond role expectations. In doing this, we seek to expand understandings of digital labour both as a category and concept. Overall, the paper demonstrates that digital inclusion initiatives must not only accommodate the intersecting socio-cultural needs of low-income families, but include appropriate support and resourcing for community workers performing critical digital mentoring work.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a novel approach developed in collaboration with the Australian Red Cross, focusing on community-centred data practices for disaster resilience. Recognising the limitations of traditional digital humanitarianism, which largely relied on crowdsourcing and social platform data, our project shifts the paradigm towards empowering communities with data capabilities. We developed a Community Resource Mapping Pipeline, and a prototype platform to map community resources and strengths, emphasising community-led processes and local data capability development to improve local disaster preparedness and response. Our organisational participatory approach involved workshops with stakeholders to co-shape research questions and platform design within a human-centred framework. Our prototype demonstrates the potential of community-led data capability building in enhancing disaster preparedness, underscoring the importance of involving communities in both data collection and decision-making.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Though discursive shifts signal increasing enthusiasm for children's digital play when instrumental educational outcomes are evident, limited attention has been paid to its possible wellbeing benefits or the reasons that children engage with it. The time that children invest in digital game play presents an opportunity for the global digital games industry to contribute positively to children’s well-being. Empirical research must first examine the diverse relationships between children’s digital play and their wellbeing.\n\nThis paper reports on an international, ecoculturally and ethnographically informed and semi-longitudinal study in collaboration with a children's digital game industry partner and a global child's rights organisation to consider: what drives the digital play choices and practices of a diverse cohort of children?; and how do these findings contribute to understanding the relationship between children’s digital play and their wellbeing? This paper draws on a subset of UK data (20 families) amongst a total 50 case study families who were involved across four countries.\n\nThe study provides diverse examples of digital play supporting dimensions of children’s subjective wellbeing. However, children’s digital play choices and practices were influenced by diverse and often intersecting factors, most compellingly, by different deep interests, desires and needs, understood in the present study as ‘digital play drivers’. The findings offer an empirically grounded expansion of past ‘needs’ approaches and foreground the mediating role played by digital play drivers in the relationship between digital games and children’s subjective wellbeing. Implications for the children's digital game industry are discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The advent of deepfakes has raised widespread concerns among researchers, policymakers, and the public. However, many of these concerns stem from alarmism rather than well-founded evidence. While research has begun discussing deepfakes’ potential harms and whether existing law is sufficient to counteract them, there is a lack of consolidated knowledge regarding the empirical evidence supporting these concerns as well as the specific regulatory measures developed in response. To bridge these gaps, our methodological approach is two-fold: (1) we provide a systematic literature review to consolidate what is currently empirically known about deepfakes, and (2) a qualitative content analysis of the evolving regulatory landscape. This is to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the deepfake phenomenon and to provide directions for future research and policymaking. The findings highlight gaps in our knowledge of deepfakes, making it difficult to assess the appropriateness and need for regulatory action. While deepfake technology may not introduce entirely new and unique regulatory problems, it can amplify existing problems such as the spread of non-consensual pornography and disinformation. Effective oversight and enforcement of existing rules, along with careful consideration of required adjustments will therefore be crucial. The dynamic nature of deepfake technology also calls for adaptive policy approaches that aim to mitigate harm while protecting individual rights and addressing larger societal issues. Altogether, this highlights the importance of more empirical research to navigate and comprehend the regulatory challenges raised by deepfakes and to develop evidence-based countermeasures.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the impact of Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots, specifically in the context of political information retrieval, using the 2024 Taiwan presidential election as a case study. With the rapid integration of LLMs into search engines like Google and Microsoft Bing, concerns about information quality, algorithmic gatekeeping, biases, and content moderation emerged. This research aims to (1) assess the alignment of AI chatbot responses with factual political information, (2) examine the adherence of chatbots to algorithmic norms and impartiality ideals, (3) investigate the factuality and transparency of chatbot-sourced synopses, and (4) explore the universality of chatbot gatekeeping across different languages within the same geopolitical context.\n\nAdopting a case study methodology and prompting method, the study analyzes responses from Microsoft’s LLM-powered search engine chatbot, Copilot, in five languages (English, Traditional Chinese, Simple Chinese, German, Swedish). The findings reveal significant discrepancies in content accuracy, source citation, and response behavior across languages. Notably, Copilot demonstrated a higher rate of factual errors in Traditional Chinese while exhibiting better performance in Simplified Chinese. The study also highlights problematic referencing behaviors and a tendency to prioritize certain types of sources, such as Wikipedia, over legitimate news outlets.\n\nThese results underscore the need for enhanced transparency, thoughtful design, and vigilant content moderation in AI technologies, especially during politically sensitive events. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring high-quality information delivery and maintaining algorithmic accountability in the evolving landscape of AI-driven communication platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In striving for equity, it is key to understand enabling and impeding factors of educational and digital participation of (marginalised) youth. Even though formal education is often focused on in the discussion on educational inequalities, non-formal and informal education need to be further considered, especially with regard to digitalised societies (Jeong et al. 2018; Spanhel 2020). Applying a broad understanding of education as a transformation of self-world-relations (Jörissen/Marotzki 2009), non-formal educational arrangements that revolve around digital media activities potentially contribute to educational and digital equity among youth by enabling processes of learning and experiences of self-efficacy.\n\nTherefore, this paper focuses on investigating the accessibility of educational participation from a marginalised youth perspective: Do non-formal digitised educational arrangements recognise (marginalised) youth realities? Our research aims at identifying conditions that enable resp. limit participation of (marginalised) youth in relation to their orientations within two non-formal educational institutions that specialise in digital media activities.\n\nGroup Discussions are implemented with youth who take part in the researched educational arrangements and with youth who belong to the potential target group but do not participate. In Group Discussions, depictions and narrations are unfolded by the participants. Analysing Group Discussions with the Documentary Method allows for the reconstruction of collective patterns of orientations that influence everyday practice (Bohnsack 2010). Based on data extracts presented at AoIR 2024, conditions of participation in non-formal digitised educational arrangements from a (marginalised) youth perspective will be discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how the figures and imaginaries of hegemonic masculinity are co-produced and contested among a reactionary influencer fandom. It assumes an intersectional masculinities approach to the question of how Andrew Tate and his social media audience(s) articulate and mobilise anti-feminist and anti-LGBTQIA+ discourses online. Affective intermediation is proposed as a concept that situates relational labour within the influencer ecosystem in terms of the affective production of masculinity as a cultural and economic category. Data consist of a 15-month sample of Andrew Tate’s posts on the video-sharing platform Rumble (n=213) and a purposive sample (n=17) of Tate's posts on X (formerly Twitter). The dataset includes all user responses to posts on Rumble (n=112,656) and X (n=14,796). The methods used are constructionist thematic analysis, which orients towards the sociocultural contexts of discourse and computational discourse analysis, including topic modelling. Incorporating perspectives on fandom, labour, and the manosphere, preliminary findings suggest three key points of tension. First, the tension created by audience directives about who Tate should interact with and how he should conduct himself in order to avoid collaborations with creators who appear “gay’. Second, the tension between “simping” and support that fans and followers must navigate when expressing approval of Tate whilst trying to avoid being seen as “gay”. Third, the tension between demands of cultural and economic production, including how audiences articulate their expectations with regard to the production of masculinist content.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital twins are characterized as NextGen smart cities, part of cyber-manufacturing processes and as industry 4.0 systems. They are digital replicas of ‘real’ world physical assets, with real-time information interchanges via sensors between digital replicas and their material assets. They can be immersive 3D environments of cities rendered in game engines and engaged with via VR headsets. Uncritical, enthusiastic and technologically solutionist rationales are generally offered for their creation in IT, engineering and vendor literature. Digital twins are often touted as a system to predict, preempt, prevent and plan for the impact of climate change and for emergency preparedness scenario planning. This paper discusses preliminary observations from a transdisciplinary archival and AI research project of an urban digital twin in the architecture, engineering, construction and owner operated (AECOO) sector, theoretically framed by critical data studies, archival digital diplomatics, digital records forensics and social and technological assemblage theory. A hybrid methodological approach combines a technological walkthrough with twin developers mapping data flows and technological processes, guided by a semi-structured interview instrument to identify what constitutes a record of automated and AI/ML actions that affect social and material outcomes. Preliminary observations identified a complex set of technopolitics, myriad procurement and contractual arrangements where data and technology ownership remains with vendors. It has become clear that digital twins are very messy and poorly governed infrastructures of infrastructure, which are mostly proprietary, lack interoperability and standards. The aim is to understand urban digital twins so that they may be governed in the public interest.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitch is the largest social live-streaming platform in the Global North, and has historically been an important advertising and community hub for the gaming industry (Johnson &amp; Woodcock, 2018). Twitch’s owner, Amazon, demands increasing growth and profit (Yin-Poole, 2024), so the platform must continue attracting new streamers, viewers, and advertisers. However, these new audiences may be at odds with Twitch’s core base of white, Asian, cisgender men (see Cote, 2020). This means many of Twitch’s policies and attempts at platform governance are often implemented inconsistently or in an ad-hoc manner, leading to greater confusion about what is and isn’t permissible on the platform (Winslow, 2024). Platform governance, also known as content moderation, harkens to how “platforms don’t make content, but they will make important choices about that content; what they will distribute and to whom, how they will connect users and broker their reactions, and what they will refuse” (Gillespie, 2018, pp. 254-255). As Twitch struggles to grow its audience but remains faithful to its core base, questions emerge as to who may be experiencing unfair moderation practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines how the drama interpretation industry on video-streaming platforms influences the transnational reception of Korean TV series in China. Combined with new background music and the creators’ interpretations, drama interpretation videos extract drama clips from the long episodes and reproduce hours-long TV series into 3-5 minute short-form videos. With the rise of this industry, a lack of studies has noticed the phenomenon and its influence on transnational audience reception. Thus, this study is pioneering research to address how interpretative commentary videos affect audience reception of international TV series in China, how Chinese audiences engage with Korean TV content on user-generated platforms, and whether dissemination of clip-sharing on user-generated platforms benefits or detriments Korean TV series. Adopting the Korean drama Glory as a case, this study used qualitative content analysis, augmented by semi-structured interviews, to examine these user-generated interpretive videos and their associated comments on Douyin and Xiaohongshu. This study found that video creators replaced obscure terminologies with other terms familiar to audiences within a Chinese cultural context, and viewers mainly discussed characters in the Korean drama Glory without mentioning Korean culture or cultural differences. Therefore, this study argues that interpretive videos can be regarded as a form of user-generated localization of international TV series, making foreign dramas understandable to local audiences and helping with the dramas’ dissemination, while this re-production of TV series, which eliminates cultural differences, is detrimental to the spread of foreign culture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Standardized manual content analysis is an important methodology to capture the messages in journalistic and social media. Specifically, for supervised machine learning aproaches, human-generated training data is needed. The process of coding as well as the selection of suitable coders is crucial for obtaining good data quality. However, little research has been done on how the coding process should be designed and how personal characteristics of the coders might influence data quality. This blind spot becomes even more crucial because coding is nowadays increasingly performed with the help of crowdworkers. When working with such anonymous coders, the process of coding can then be less controlled by the researchers, which can lead to loss of quality.\n\nIn our comparative mixed-methods study we compare data from a content analysis on the topic of legalizing abortion (n = 300 tweets). We conducted this in two ways: Firstly, with a team of four student coders who also received training and secondly with 150 crowdworkers. All coders had to complete a short survey on their socio-demographics and personality traits.\n\nThe results show that both validity and reliability are higher for the student coders, especially for tricky coding tasks. Further, multivariate (logistic) regression analysis reveals that personal characteristics such as formal education and emotional sensitivity also have an impact on coding quality. Hence, with a reflective selection of coders as well as a thoughtful design of the coding process and the codebook, the quality of data collection can be increased—even when relying on crowdworkers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Amidst calls for public accountability over large data-driven systems, feminist and indigenous scholars have developed refusal as a practice that challenges the authority of data collectors. However, because data affects so many aspects of daily life, it can be hard to see seemingly different refusal strategies as part of the same repertoire. Furthermore, conversations about refusal often happen from the standpoint of designers and policymakers rather than the people and communities most affected by data collection. In this paper, we introduce a framework for data refusal from below—writing from the standpoint of people who refuse, rather than the institutions that seek their compliance. We characterize refusal strategies across four constituent facets common to all refusal, whatever tactics are used: autonomy, or how refusal accounts for individual and collective interests; time, or whether refusal reacts to past harm or proactively prevents future harm; power, or the extent to which refusal makes change possible; and cost, or whether or not refusal can reduce or redistribute penalties experienced by refusers. We illustrate each facet by drawing on cases of people and collectives that have refused data systems. Together, the four facets of our framework are designed to help scholars and activists describe, evaluate, and imagine new forms of refusal.</jats:p>",

    "title": "TRENDING RESISTANCE: A STUDY OF THE TIKTOK #DEINFLUENCING PHENOMENON.",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Starting from January 2023, a new trend gained momentum on TikTok: It is called #deinfluencing, and it collects a series of videos which criticise the consumerist logic of the influencer industry and its tendency to overconsumption, as well as the platforms’ architectures that further fuel these processes. This contribution aims at investigating the #deinfluencing trend on TikTok to analyse to what extent it represents a form of resistance to issues of overconsumption and consumerism. I argue that the deinfluencing phenomenon is an example of how forms of resistance are becoming “trending”, that is, not only currently popular or widely discussed online, but also increasingly intertwined with the affordances and algorithmic nature of TikTok. The empirical research is based on a digital method approach and qualitative data analysis techniques. After collecting data from hashtags such as “#deinfluencing” and “#antihaul”, a content analysis aimed at highlighting the emerging themes in the trend has been performed. The results show that the deinfluencing trend is composed of three main categories of content: resistance; consumerist reappropriation; and trend-surfing. Ultimately, the analysis of the deinfluencing trend shows the different ways in which resistance becomes “trending”, meaning intertwined and progressively mitigated by the logic and architecture of TikTok. It is exactly in the trending nature of these forms of resistance that lies the highly controversial and potentially problematic nature of deinfluencing: a form of resistance to and through the platform’s logic, as well as to and through consumption.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Coding bootcamps are intensive training programs that aim to turn adults with no computer programming experience into professional software developers in as little as 12 to 16 weeks. In both the US and the UK, coding bootcamps are positioned as an alternative pathway into the tech “pipeline” for groups who are traditionally excluded from computing careers (Schnell, 2019; UK Digital Strategy, 2022). Framed as a form of “coding equity”, bootcamps are said to provide “transformative access” for participants and have even been characterized as a form of social justice activism (Rea, 2022). However, our ongoing comparative study about coding bootcamps in the US and UK indicates that the benefits of attending a coding bootcamp accrue disproportionately across different groups. Drawing upon ethnographic, interview, and survey data, this work-in-progress paper focuses on the bootcamp experiences of people with disabilities, who were more likely to experience unfair bias and/or exclusion and are less likely to have experienced employment-related benefits than people without disabilities. This paper discusses some of the contributing factors to these outcomes and explores the impact that these experiences have on bootcamp students with disabilities. In doing so, it casts some doubt on the “transformative” possibilities of bootcamps for marginalized groups. Although some bootcamps declare their “support” for “people with disabilities and neurodiversities” (Northcoders, n.d.), our study indicates that even if and when this support exists, it falls short of what people with disabilities need to thrive in a bootcamp setting.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>‘Social media’ represent a dynamic technological environment, in which emerging platforms make use of comparisons to existing apps to construct their own reputation. This is the case of BeReal – a platform that allows users to share pictures once a day, and only when triggered by a notification. In this paper, I combine digital technography and the platform walkthrough method to examine how BeReal deploys antagonistic discourse towards dominant media to promise a more authentic experience. In so doing, I frame the platform as evoking, appropriating, and remediating (Bolter and Grusin 2000) notions of mediated liveness – not only when it comes to a promised ‘real-time’ connection but also referring to particular ways of ‘being there’, sharing experiences, and having ‘real’ experiences through technological mediation. This discussion matters because it demonstrates how claims of immediacy and of a direct access to ‘reality’ are manifested and negotiated in contemporary sociotechnical practices. In this context, BeReal’s version for “platformized authenticity” – the co-option of ‘the authentic’ to advance platforms’ growth and commercial goals – is a process marked by a recursive, cyclical negotiation between technical mediation and claims of liveness.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Gambling games are composed of risk and contingency - the gambler stakes their bet on the spin or a reel or a roulette wheel completely dependent on forces outside of their control, uncertain of the outcome. This potent combination is not only being used to fuel the nearly $500 billion USD global gambling industry, but also to organise the current app economy. Digital platforms, their complementors, and their users are brought together by risk and contingency into a dynamic political economy, with the platform accruing the most advantage (Poell et al., 2021). Unpacking these unequal and sometimes precarious relations requires studying a “representative commodity” (Kline et al., 2003). Social casino apps, a niche, but still significant digital game commodity, embody how risk and contingency manifests in the app economy (Nieborg &amp; Poell, 2018; Zittrain, 2008). In particular, when other industries interface with digital platforms, they become subject to their institutional imperatives (Gorwa, 2019). Social casino apps are representative of how platforms have been able to influence and shape even niche genres of digital leisure, but also the constraints and resistance to these techniques. In this paper, as a political economist of communication, I conduct a structural and critical analysis of the social casino industry, using institutional analysis as my methodology.</jats:p>",

Users can post only once per day, in a random two-minute window controlled by the app. Posts consist of an image that combines photos from a smartphone’s front- and back-facing cameras. While these individual features aren’t novel, the app packages them as an overt response to current cultural frustration with fake-ness. How persuasive is this marketing tactic, especially among a generation that has grown up with social media? To explore this question, we are interviewing young adult BeReal users about how they use the app and to what extent they experience BeReal as a space for authenticity. Our ongoing analysis suggests that while participants find BeReal to offer forms of real-time and spontaneous authenticity, on a deeper level, they question whether social platforms can ever act as vessels for authenticity. These initial findings indicate that young adults may recognize social media claims to authenticity as the marketing tactics they often are.</jats:p>",

While these apps have been criticised for lacking privacy and for enforcing normative ideals on women, they are often marketed in terms of female empowerment. In this presentation, we present our analysis of the empowering potential of menstruation and pregnancy apps. We ask: How do these apps represent reproductive health? What kinds of empowering qualities are present in them? Are there any aspects of the technology that (inadvertently) counteract the empowering purpose? We investigate this through a comparative design investigation using what we call critical app-walkthrough methodology together with researcher use-diaries. We show in our analysis that there are three critical ways in which these apps represent reproductive health events to users through design. We analyze; 1) interface metaphors used to represent temporality, 2) datafication of reproductive health through input and output for intimate data tracking and 3) finally the ways predictions convey certainty over uncertainty and the implications of this. From our results, we present four design sensitivities meant to inspire designers to design for other types of period tracking experiences that might better empower bleeders; support lived temporalities, embrace uncertainty, empower the self, and design less.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The proposed presentation explores the ways in which developers use the notion of privacy in their GitHub biographies. Initially a code-sharing platform, GitHub has become in recent years a major recruitment site. In that environment, a valuable potential worker is one who knows how to extract and make the most of users’ personal information. At the same time, in an open source platform, “privacy” maintains its romantic allure as a worthwhile endeavor. How do developers manage this tension? And what may its negotiation imply for the production of privacy? Analyzing the 2025 GitHub bios in which developers use the word “privacy,” we explore two articulations of privacy in developers’ self-presentation: privacy as a profession, and privacy as a passion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For more than a decade, digital advertising has been the primary means of funding online content and services. The evolution of digital advertising towards algorithmically targeted advertising, believed to be highly personalized and tailored to the individual, has presented new challenges for public oversight. Whereas previously, public concern centred on the content of ads and their exposure to audiences, the rise of platform-based advertising means focus has shifted to the distribution of ads and how they reach us. In response to public concerns and regulatory pressures, companies such as Meta (the parent of Facebook) have introduced transparency tools for researchers and consumers to ‘explain’ the function of advertising on the platform, including the Ad Library and the “Why Am I Seeing This Ad” feature. Despite being a central feature of Meta’s response towards increasing external scrutiny, little is known about how the WAIST feature works, or how it operates at a population level. In response we offer a description of WAIST data collected at scale, informed from a nationwide citizen data donation project of Facebook advertising. We analyse this data with a view to better understand Meta’s algorithmic advertising system, and to inform questions regarding the sufficiency of WAIST as an algorithmic explanatory mechanism for users.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DIGITAL LABOR AND RENTIER PLATFORM CAPITALISM: REFORM OR REVOLUTION?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital labor has become an umbrella term for describing a range of digitally mediated practices from paid work in the gig economy (Srnicek 2017) to cultivating a personal brand online (Scolere, Pruchniewska, and Duffy 2018). This wellspring of activities now referred to as labor has muddied the waters, making digital labor an ambiguous concept at best (Gandini 2021; Goodwin 2022). This framing of user activity as labor also has limitations, as it necessarily produces reformist, rather than revolutionary, political ends.\n\nFollowing Sadowski (2020), this paper challenges the conceptual framework of digital labor by re-theorizing the user/platform relation as rentier capitalism. Engels (1970) explained how tenants confront landlords not as sellers of labor-power but buyers of a commodity, and we argue that typical social media users confront platforms in an analogous way. Platforms thus only circulate existing value rather than create it, and this distinction matters in understanding their role in economic crises.\n\nBecause the digital labor concept misidentifies the user/platform relationship and concedes the commoditization of communication, reformist demands emerge from this discourse, like “Wages for Facebook” (Ptak 2014 as cited in Jung 2014) or data ownership as compensation (Chakravorti 2020). Capitalist data relations (Couldry and Mejias 2020) and the profit motive of corporate platforms cannot be addressed by renumerating users. As platforms attain infrastructural status (Plantin et al. 2018), our politics must reflect the need for their transformation into public utilities with democratic accountability, a revolutionary demand that has been displaced in the turn towards digital labor.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Coordinated online disinformation campaigns are by nature difficult to detect. In response, communication scholars have developed a range of methods and analytical frameworks to discover and analyse disinformation campaigns. The use of social network analysis (SNA) to find and map coordinated behavioural patterns has become increasingly popular and demonstrated effective results. However, these methods are designed for text and behavioural but miss an important aspect of disinformation campaigns: coordinated image-sharing. This paper examine this gap by analysing a large-scale dataset of tweets using advanced SNA to map coordinated retweeting behaviour and coordinated image-sharing. We show that coordinated image-sharing is both more widespread and different in structure to other forms of coordination. This is important because it highlights a major gap in research, where computational methods are not suited to detecting and analysing the scale and scope of visual disinformation on platforms like Twitter. To address this, we suggest new methods to complement existing approaches, using machine learning to detect image similarity. The paper concludes with a reflection of limitations and suggestions for the next steps.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet users face privacy threats when using online services. Privacy protection behaviors, such as adjusting privacy settings, can alleviate some of these threats. Research shows that individuals’ privacy protection behaviors (PPBs) depend on their socio-demographics characteristics, digital engagement, privacy concerns, and online privacy literacy (OPL). In addition, it has been suggested that due to the complexity of privacy issues online, an adequate level of OPL is required to translate privacy concerns into protective actions. Although previous research examined the antecedents of PPBs at a general level, it has rarely made a clear distinction and comparison between PPBs aimed toward the practices of institutions (vertical level) and those aimed toward other internet users (horizontal level). This is somewhat surprising given that many scholars underscored the importance of context in online privacy-related matters. Therefore, this study compared the antecedents of PPBs at the general, vertical, and horizontal levels. To this end, we tested three models to examine how socio-demographic characteristics, digital engagement, privacy concerns, and OPL influence PPBs at the general, vertical, and horizontal levels, and assessed whether OPL moderates the relationship between privacy concerns and PPBs at different levels. The models were tested using linear regression on a nation-wide sample of 1,015 internet users aged 18+ from Slovenia. The analysis revealed important differences between the levels in case of gender, age, and privacy concerns, but not OPL.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Women were excluded from financial independence historically, causing a significant gender gap in financial literacy. Financial decision-making was based on households where women were deprived of contribution, as they were not allowed to act as the main account holder and were seen as dependents in the formal financial system. However, informal communities were formed, sharing intimate knowledge in alternative ways of personal finance. In the online Web 2.0 environments, social media platforms, namely Instagram, could serve as new forms of learning environments for financial literacy through informal peer-to-peer learning and therefore become a virtual extension of existing 'saving communities' in real life. The paper highlights the existence of a small but thriving personal finance community on Instagram and provides evidence of the volume of content related to personal finance, debt, and saving money on the platform.\n\nThe emergence of female financial influencers created a sense of virtual togetherness where women felt safe to seek peer support and share personal stories. This paper proposes four-phase research using netnographic immersion journals (Kozinets, 2022), an online survey, and semi-structured interviews and will present the early findings from data collection beginning in March 2023. It proposes a networked perspective addressing technical, social, and cultural components (Selbst et al., 2019) in relation to the formation, expansion, and evolution of female financial influencing on Instagram. This study responds to the wider conference themes of revolutions by examining social barriers to seeking financial support at the intersection of feminist studies, the digital divide, and financial literacy.</jats:p>",

My paper enters this discussion by suggesting a \"small data\" approach for studying the early digital presence of the men’s rights movement, and its transition from print to digital media. I compare two unique data sets involving print and digital archives to map out the geographical locations of men's rights groups and adherents in the early 1990s. I demonstrate how: 1) there is significant overlap between the print organizations and early digital spaces for men's rights activists; and 2) men’s rights communities in North America were often concentrated in areas like Southern California, the Pacific Northwest, and the North Eastern Seaboard. Ultimately, I argue that print materials, “small data,” and non-computational methods are still valuable tools to study social movements and their early digital histories.</jats:p>",

Demands that adult merchants incorporate these tools are not proportional to instances of harmful content, but a response to the widespread conflation of pornography with harm and risk online.

Following this, I detail financial firms infrastructural influence in platform co-governance. Next, a close reading of adult merchant terms identifies specific clauses calling for algorithmic moderation. Concluding this issue mapping, I provide a taxonomy of moderation tools in place on Pornhub.\n\nI close with an issue discussion to consider AI's positioning as a regulatory solution, CSAM data ethics, moderator labour, and the many technical problems obscured by promises of safety through automated content management systems. The resulting review of algorithmic measures enforced by financial firms offers a detailed case of the opaque governance conditions imperilling sexual expression across porn platforms.</jats:p>",

Four randomly formed groups ideated ways these technologies could be applied to earlier identified hopes and fears for the future of aging. Creative technologists then created prototypes of these ideas over two weeks of feedback and iteration with participants. Participants wrote and performed performances incorporating these prototypes, which explored cybersecurity and cyberharm (Agrafiotis, 2019). Six participants also partook in post-workshop semi-structured interviews. Methods developed in this research scaffolded critical thought concerning the ethics, trustworthiness, security and privacy of age oriented IoT, and associated DDT, regardless of experience or existing knowledge. Participants found it easy to interrogate the ethics, privacy and security of their speculations because, while they may not have been technically scalable or feasible, they understood them. </jats:p>",

The project relies on complementary methods to approach the senses of what news is and how young people get in touch with the world. We developed a representative online survey in Portugal (N=1300) where we explored how young people reach their notion of the world. The survey reflected the existence of several nationalities, such as Angolan, Cape Verdeans, Mozambican and Brazilian (official Portuguese-speaking countries), and also Ukrainian. It also included two open research questions about how respondents build their views of the world and how they see the future of news. In this presentation, we will rely on these identified nationalities and their answers to these questions. Data points to the envision that technology will continue to have a paramount sophistication and intervention in the production of news in the coming future (they predict evolutions such as a futuristic technology in the form of an intraocular device for searching news), but they also reveal negative feelings towards the speed at which information is produced and circulates, opening way for the increasing of manipulative, and untrusty information production (they claim for more trustworthy news while at the same time they see a pathway for the news that has no salvation).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What happens to internet communities after a global media event puts them in the public spotlight? Does the flood of new members change a given community's practices, structures, and discussions? Do things go back to normal? These questions lie at the heart of our research project, which examines how a local subcommunity on the popular website Reddit changed as its matter of focus became a global discussion subject.\n\nSpecifically, this study analyses changing posting practices on /r/hongkong, a local subreddit whose popularity skyrocketed in 2019, with the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement garnering worldwide media coverage. Now, with global attention shifting away from the protests and the 2020 Hong Kong National Security law, the subreddit no longer exhibits the same level of activity. But what can be learnt beyond simply looking at the numbers? Can a qualitative change be observed on /r/hongkong?\n\nIn this extended abstract, we examine the existing research on subreddits as a community, consider the potential significance of media events and subsequent influxes of new users for community practice, outline our methodological approach, and highlight some preliminary findings.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Entering “best online yoga classes,” into Google Search returns lists from fitness websites like VeryWell Fit, Yogi Times, Prevention, Self, and Shape—most of these sites will include Gaia.com, a subscription-based streaming video platform, in their recommendation lists, labeling it variously as “best for the whole family,” “best intermediate/advanced,” and, most notably, “best for delving into yogic philosophy.” None of the blurbs written about Gaia in these articles mention its thousands of videos about conspiracy theories. These articles also fail to mention the connection between Gaia and Gaiam, one of the largest global yoga equipment brands. Formerly GaiamTV, Gaia.com offers videos and articles about yoga alongside videos and articles about UFOs, extraterrestrials, alternative archaeology, and universal consciousness, among a variety of other topics related to conspiracy theories, the paranormal, and new age spirituality. This paper examines Gaia, Inc., as a case study in conspirituality capitalism. The blatant obfuscation of the connection between Gaiam yoga equipment and the Gaia media empire functions to strengthen the mechanisms of conspirituality capitalism: not only are supporters of conspiratorial and alternative content financially contributing to its production through subscriptions to Gaia, but yoga practitioners who purchase Gaiam equipment may be unknowingly supporting Gaia’s conspiritual content. Using qualitative, grounded-theory-informed content analysis of video and textual content hosted on the site, as well as participant observation at two Gaia conferences held at the GaiaSphere Event Center outside Denver, Colorado, this paper, which is exploratory in nature, will introduce the term conspirituality capitalism and examine Gaia as a case study in it.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Li Wenliang, an eye doctor at Wuhan Central hospital and one of the first to raise alarm about the outbreak of COVID-19, was summoned by the local police and forced to sign a statement reprimanding his message as a groundless rumor as well as a disturbance to the public order in late December 2019. Two months later, Li died after contracting COVID-19 at his workplace, aged 33 years. This caused shock and outrage across China and Li’s Weibo (China’s equivalent of Twitter) homepage soon became an online “wailing wall,” where people mourned, condoled, and commemorated the whistleblower and complained, questioned, and protested the overstrict government policies relevant to COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that Weibo offers a place for users to see the mundane life of Li Wenliang, express grief and frustration, and interact with each other to remember Li, whereas another super-powerful Chinese social media, WeChat, allows users to synthesize information about Li, provide analysis and criticism, and circulate the memory of Li through their social networks. Together, these two platforms helped stabilize Chinese internet users’ memory of Li as a whistleblower, a civilian hero, a martyr, and a supporter of free speech and diverse voices, distinguished from the official version. This study contributes to recent scholarly interest in understanding how the technological affordances of social media shape memory work. It also shows that even in a politically constrictive environment, such as China’s media ecology, the space for questioning and protesting still exists, though more nuanced and precarious.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Historically-situated accounts of the Web have a long history within the field of internet studies. Drawing on diverse methodologies and forms of data, web histories of platforms, cultures and communities of practice have illuminated the rich, but often transient and shifting nature of life online. Many web histories rely upon researchers capturing, collecting, and generating their own data through time, though some have also engaged with web archives as a means for studying the past online. However, web archive data have never fulfilled the requirements of positivist ideals such as ‘representativeness’ or objectivity, and the methodological consequences of this observation currently do not go far enough.\n\nThis panel aims to shift and reframe current discussions of the ‘promise’ of web archives for web historiography, towards identifying what underlying logics or ideals drive and motivate various actors engaged in this work. We argue that not only do the logics underpinning the practices of collecting and archiving the Web deserve further attention, but also the practices of internet researchers who aim to use these materials for studying the Web. Each paper contribution in this panel builds on web archive criticism by situating archived web material as fundamentally tied to the logics of practice. These underpinnings affect not only the formation of web archives, but also the methodological approaches researchers take. We therefore suggest new ways for conceptualising the ‘doing’ of web histories, tying them to an assemblage of people, practice and data that shape how we can come to understand the Web.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary digital health research, policy and practice often engage young people in voicing their opinions with a participatory approach. Simultaneously, young people organise themselves on peer-led platforms like Reddit to talk about health without adults. Peer-led discussions on platforms like Reddit gives us access to a new perspective on how young people understand and experience health. This study investigates youth voices on health in teenagers’ subreddits on Reddit and responds to three research questions: how youth voices about health matters are represented in peer-led discussions; how the platform supports plural voices; and how the Bakhtinian dialogical account of voice can offer an alternative of non-unified, heterogeneous voices of young people to shortcomings of some participatory research, service, and policymaking. This study used unobtrusive digital ethnography and extant data collection methods to sample 50 posts related to physical, mental, and sexual health. Thematic analysis was conducted with grounded theory principles. Youth plural voices revealed different conceptualisations of health and diverse narratives about actors like parents, teachers, healthcare professionals and technologies involved in health experiences. Redditors engage in humorous and factual discussions equally and share both positive and negative health experiences. There is no unity in youth health meanings, but plurality and heterogeneity deserve more recognition and support. Analysing Reddit allows us to know what and how young people talk about health with their peers. Learning from the Reddit environment, adults may redefine their ideas of youth health to be more youth-centred and better align with young people’s needs.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>During COVID-19, countless dashboards have served as central media where people learn critical information about the pandemic. Varied actors, including news organizations, government agencies, universities, and NGOs created and maintained these dashboards, conducting the onerous labor of collecting, categorizing, and taking care of COVID data. This study uncovers different forms of data practices and labor behind the building of these dashboards, based on in-depth interviews with volunteers and practitioners across India and the United States who have participated in COVID dashboard projects.\n\nSpecifically, we are interested in projects that have focused on underrepresented or missing COVID data such as COVID cases in prisons and long-term care facilities, racial/ethnic breakdown of cases, as well as deaths due to COVID enforcement. These data builders employed sometimes creative, sometimes mundane and laborious data practices to not simply collect, but to produce these data that are often invisible in the official COVID dataset. In this process of data production, dashboard builders grappled with the questions of how certain data is collected, who/what is missing from the dataset, and how these data voids shape and manipulate our understanding of the pandemic. Interviewing 74 data builders who participated in COVID dashboard projects, this paper demonstrates the range of underrepresented and messy COVID data that these data builders have identified, fixed, and maintained to render them useful: disappearing data, lumped data, and absent data. Such critical engagement with messy COVID data reveals different data injustices that have tremendous potential to affect future pandemic preparation and management.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As children grow up immersed in digital environments, scholars and policymakers emphasize the importance of helping children learn how to navigate privacy online. Prior work has found that educators recognize this need for privacy lessons but do not always feel equipped to teach them. Indeed, the term “privacy” has many meanings and the concept of privacy does not easily fit in a specific subject, intersecting with social studies, computer science, media literacy, digital literacy, and digital citizenship. Scholars have begun developing frameworks for privacy education, but such efforts will have a higher chance of success if they can be integrated into existing educational standards. Thus, in this study we are analyzing U.S. K-12 educational standards to understand whether and how they address privacy literacy. Our initial analysis has found that 44 of the 50 U.S. states have implemented educational standards related to privacy, largely as part of library, computer science, or social studies. The main privacy-related topics in state standards include being careful about posting information online and managing passwords. These preliminary findings suggest that while privacy is part of many state education standards, there are opportunities to help educators bring a more nuanced approach to privacy into their classrooms.</jats:p>",

Some of these challenges could be addressed to some extent with technology. In this paper I examine the world of trans technology design through interviews with 115 creators of trans technologies: apps, games, health resources, and other types of technology. I demonstrate that trans technology design processes are often deeply personal, and focus on the technology creator’s needs and desires. Thus, trans technology design can be empowering because technology creators have agency to create tools they need to navigate the world. However, in some cases when trans communities are not involved in design processes, this can lead to overly individualistic design that speaks primarily to more privileged trans people’s needs.</jats:p>",

We subsequently test the penetration of this playbook on members of the Brazilian National Congress during the campaign trail and the transition of power to the opposition candidate, when pro-Bolsonaro protesters attempted to overthrow the Federal Government. Our analyses lend support to the hypothesis that the coup d’état was not successful due to the dwindling support beyond the hard-core Bolsonaro base. Our results also show that the insurrectionist playbook, largely centered on the blueprint of false claims of electoral fraud, can be monitored through the public statements of elected officials.

Analysis of how these artifacts respond to issues related to identity, privacy, security, and connectivity revealed that the majority amplify Meta’s corporate messaging, empowering its elite discourse and solidifying its social power. While certain artifacts attempt to confront the prevailing narrative related to privacy, such discourse is often ineffectively rooted in cyber-libertarian ideology. In order to more effectively challenge Meta’s social power, future critical discourse should be 1) more holistically deployed and 2) cognizant of the logics of surveillance capitalism and user exploitation. Ultimately, this paper considers the rhetorical strategies and functions deployed in the circulation of elite discourse, while also acknowledging the dynamism of sociotechnical imaginaries.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DARK DESIGN PATTERNS AND GAMIFICATION AS THE HEART OF DATING APPLICATIONS’ BUSINESS MODELS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dating applications represent a paradox: on the one hand, they provide a monetized platform for people to form relationships, yet on the other hand, the more people who find partners, the less revenue goes to the company. With this paradox as a backdrop, this extended abstract examines the business model of dating applications by address the following research question: What characterizes the business models of dating applications? To provide a nuanced picture of this, we conducted a 2022-study combining data about dating apps and app users: (A) 22 in-depth interviews with current and previous users (aged 24–49 years) of Norwegian dating applications users; (B) a systematic analysis of 30 serious dating apps in Google Play and Apple’s App Store; and (C) a diary study of four of the 30 dating applications. The findings reveals that dating apps follows a business model that creates revenue through a mix of an in-app purchase-model and subscription fees. The apps typically market themselves as free, yet they use several dark design and gamification features to create and spark emotional curiosity and engagement that in turn brings in revenue to dating app companies. Several of the users stated that they have experienced the apps as manipulative, emotionally exhausting and that they created the same kind of “addiction” or “cravings” they experienced in social media. Clearly, design is not only power, design gives the dating app companies power where designing for emotional engagement is a key value-creating element in their business models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, major social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have announced efforts to counter \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour.\" However, scholarly research continues to provide evidence that coordinated human and automated accounts covertly seek to undermine and manipulate public debates on these platforms. Given the difficulties in obtaining data from these platforms to study these influence operations, and the significant challenge of identifying covert malinformation operations, further conceptual and methodological innovations are required. This panel brings together a selection of recent studies that advance the methods available for the forensic, mixed-methods, in-depth, and large-scale analysis of inauthentic information operations: Paper 1 investigates the arson disinformation campaign during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season. Paper 2 investigates the distribution and content monetisation strategies of junk news sources across a selection of five major social media platforms during the 2019 European Parliament campaign. Paper 3 explores whether Facebook's microtargeting advertising functionality allows political parties to promote conflicting narratives to different groups of people. Paper 4 studies the experience and engagement with malinformation by users of Facebook and WhatsApp, focussing on the current political environment in Brazil.</jats:p>",

    "title": "IS IT (MICRO)CHEATING? HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CONFOUND ASSUMPTIONS IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media have changed the ways we communicate, meet others, and form intimate relationships. However, technology can also mediate intimate partner surveillance and abuse (Muise, 2009; Tokunaga, 2010). One of the most explicit ways to understand these shifts is through the transgressing of relationship boundaries, defined and enforced by settler-colonial notions of compulsory monogamy (TallBear, 2020). Anxieties around cheating have evolved along with our technologies, as evidenced by ambiguous new terms like “microcheating” and “emotional cheating” (Lusinski, 2018). In this in-progress, mixed-methods study, we examine new definitions of cheating through analyzing discussions about potential transgressions on Reddit. Specifically, we investigate 1) which behaviors cause uncertainty in emerging forms of social media-enabled infidelity and 2) the degree to which relationship discourse online naturalizes the extension of compulsory monogamy into online space. For our pilot analysis, we used computational techniques to elicit common subjects within subreddit posts to then analyze qualitatively. We began with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised natural language processing tool, to organize Reddit posts and comments by topic (Blei, 2012). Then we qualitatively analyzed Reddit discourse by using critical discourse analysis. Our pilot analysis suggested a belief that proof of (in)fidelity can be found on a partner’s smartphone, such as by reading texts. This orientation toward evidence then justifies surveillance and hacking of a partner’s phone and computer presence, construing the invasion of privacy as the right to truth. This preliminary finding suggests that discourse around transgressive behaviors on social media likely reiterates compulsory monogamy and settler sexuality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although mythologized as a fringe or deviant behavior, ‘lurking,’ or passive participation in an online group, has become a regular part of the way we lead our lives online. My IRB approved dissertation research, which will be completed by AoIR 2020, will examine ‘lurking’ in neighborhood Facebook groups. Through community mapping and interviews of Facebook users enrolled in the same neighborhood Facebook group, this study seeks to describe both the ‘lurker’ literacy practices of Facebook group users and to understand if and how the features of the Facebook social media platform encourage these literacy practices. Given that neighborhood groups are intended for people who live in the same geographic area, there is a likelihood that many members of the group may know one another offline and in real life. Since ‘lurkers’ are groups that are typically not included in academic studies, this research will have broad appeal to scholars across the social sciences. When scholars only examine the role of active contributors and ignore the literacy practices of the silent majority of ‘lurkers’, their findings present an incomplete portrait of the way people engage in participatory culture and how these online experiences influence our offline lives.</jats:p>",

    "title": "LOCATING AND THEORIZING PLATFORM POWER",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel locates and theorizes platform power through five case studies, focussing on: 1) video sharing platforms, 2) app stores, 3) programmatic advertising networks, 4) labor staffing intermediaries, and 5) cloud computing. Each case study starts with the question: where do relations of dependence take shape on the examined platform(s) and how are these relations organized? Addressing this question, the panelists hypothesize that platform power is exerted, codified, and operationalized around particular infrastructural platform services, which enable specific economic activities, such as advertising, content sharing, data analysis, labor staffing and management, cloud hosting, and so on. Examining these services, the panelists specifically focus on the evolution of platforms. Infrastructural services, such as Facebook Reels or the Apple’s App Store each set standards and provide gateways for complementors–content and service providers, advertisers, data intermediaries, talent agencies–to access other institutional actors, data, and end-users. Yet, such services are also constantly adapted to local regulatory frameworks, to retain end-users and complementors, and to respond to competitors in platform ecosystems. In turn, such changes force complementors to adapt their own operations to continue offering their products and services through the platform. It is in these moments of change, when relations of dependence are reshuffled, that platform power becomes most visible. In combination, the five case studies will provide more detailed insights into how and where relations of dependence take shape in the platform ecosystem and how these relations evolve over time.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>New media artists—and, more broadly, those who consider themselves to\n        be “creative” technologists—increasingly find themselves questioning whether or not to use\n        tools that are owned or administered by companies that engage in activity that they consider\n        to be problematic, such as surveillance, cooperation with discriminatory law enforcement\n        practices, or toxic work cultures. However, it is difficult to conceive of a tech-based art\n        practice that functions without utilizing $2 of the dominant technologies that we find\n        ourselves surrounded by on a regular basis. As a result, artists who work with technology\n        are inevitably thrust into perpetually shifting situations or environments, controlled by\n        the tech industry, which then directly impact the creation of their work; its longevity;\n        and, often, their own perceptions of it. This paper represents the beginnings of an\n        investigation into the relationships between new media artists, the tools they use for their\n        work (including data sources and APIs, hardware and software, operating systems, and project\n        storage), and those who control these technologies.

Artists are thus forced to constantly\n        adapt their processes to the demands of those who control the technology, ultimately\n        reinforcing the authority of these dominant systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how platform power is operationalized in the specific case of the iOS App Store. We take a first step in developing an analytical framework that critically examines the infrastructural power relations that constitute online platform ecosystems. Building on a relational understanding of power, we propose an analytical vocabulary to systematically interrogate the material power relations among the three main actors active in platform ecosystems: platform operators (e.g. Apple), third party institutions (e.g. app developers, businesses, governments), and end-users (i.e. individuals). To better differentiate among these three different actors in platform ecosystems, the paper proposes to study platform power at five expanding levels, similar to those of ecological ecosystems: individual actors, infrastructural platform services, company platform ecosystems, geopolitical platform ecosystems, and the global platform ecosystem. Studying infrastructural platform services, such as app stores, offers relevant insight into how globally operating platforms are able to set, steer, and bend rules and norms that impact individual actors on the local and national level. In the case of app stores, the paper shows that platform power is not casual or discursive, but highly strategic, uniform, and centralized. By interrogating the operationalization of platform power at the platform service level, the paper demonstrates that platform power is not a property of one platform itself, but a corollary of a platform’s function in the context of other platforms and actors in a dynamic ecosystem.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper details a qualitative investigation of human factors\n        relating to adoption of digital agricultural technologies on Australian farms. We employed\n        an ‘ecosystems’ approach to undertake a case study of a cotton farm’s transition to digital\n        farming. Interviews and participant observation were conducted across the farm’s supply\n        chain to understand how the experiences, perceptions, and activities of different\n        stakeholders constituted a community-level orientation to digital agriculture, which enabled\n        and constrained on-farm adoption. Technology providers installed a variety of\n        data-generating technologies – remote sensors, automation, satellite crop imagery, WiFi/4G\n        connectivity, and a customised data dashboard on the farm. However, the farmers lacked\n        digital and data literacy skills to access, manage and use data effectively and\n        independently. Specialist expertise for data translation was required, and support and\n        resourcing for the farmers to acquire data capabilities was limited. This ‘data divide’\n        between the generation and application of farm data was complicated by broader issues raised\n        by participants about data ownership, portability, privacy, trust, liability, and\n        sovereignty, which have been observed internationally. The paper raises questions about the\n        level of expertise farmers should be expected to attain in the transition to digital\n        farming, who in the ecosystem is best placed to fill this ‘data divide’, and what\n        interventions are necessary to address significant barriers to adoption in rural\n        communities. It also highlights a tension between farmers’ $2 as decision-makers on their\n        own properties and their $2 on digital technologies – and the ecosystems that support uptake\n        of digital AgTech – to inform on-farm decisions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its release in 2017, the video sharing app TikTok has been downloaded 1.5 billion times. While its popularity has been attributed to the abundance of celebrity users, its interactive features, and its short, palatable video length, it has been the subject of relatively few academic studies. This project employs the walkthrough method to examine TikTok within the context of identity negotiation and self-representation on social media. More specifically, it seeks to understand whether TikTok follows a precedent set by other Social Networking Sites which support users self-representing via sociability “to the network, via the network”; i.e. by interacting within the affordances of the platform, which may include sharing, liking, commenting, etc (Papacharissi, 2013). This model ostensibly offers users a stage where they may display their individuality and curate content that reflects their personal interests. By regularly using the app for a period of a month and collecting extensive field notes, screenshots, and video recordings, we found that TikTok’s version of sociality differs from that offered by other SNSs. While other sites purport to be a tool with which users may represent their identities, TikTok does away with this conceit by engendering a mode of sociality (through its design features and affordances) in which the crux of interaction is not between users and their social network, but between a user and what we call an “algorithmized” version of self. This finding has the potential to enrich and complicate the discourse surrounding online identity formation and sociality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors that disproportionately disadvantages the underrepresented, marginalized and unheard. In response to this there has been significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. Considerations of ‘bad data’ practices often only provide critiques rather than engaging constructively with a new vision of how digital technologies and data can be used productively and justly to promote social, economic, cultural and politically progressive goals. In this paper we consider the fundamentals of Good Data to increase trust. We begin by conceptual considerations of the nature of ‘data’ and ‘goodness’. We align our principles with the Data Information Knowledge Wisdom (DIKW) model and use the term ‘data’ as a proxy for the whole DIKW model. Given the limits of our knowledge of moral facts (should they exist) and in light of colonial and post-colonial data practices we assume a hybrid moral theory—where we allow that some moral facts may be objective (e.g. ‘tolerance’ or ‘openness’) and others relative. We advocate an ethic of active seeking, openness and tolerance to diverse views on ‘the good’ particularly consultation with the underrepresented, marginalised and unheard. We go on to defend fifteen principles of good data under four banners: Community, Rights, Usability &amp; Politics in order to ultimately progress a more just digital economy and society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital media research commonly explores the use of social media platforms and dating/hook-up apps separately, implying distance between social and sexual communication practices. By exploring how friendships enfold into LGBTQ+ young people’s use of dating/hook-up apps, this paper troubles that delineation. In 2018, we ran four workshops with LGBTQ+ young people (18-35 years) about negotiating safety in dating/hook-up apps. Discussion of friendship featured in all workshops, mostly related to four key themes: the safety of having mutual friends with prospective dates/hook-ups; friend-making through apps; friend-involvement in safety strategies; and friendship advice on app use. Through analysis of these data, we highlight how friendship is an organising force in LGBTQ+ young people’s dating/hook-up app practices, and argue for greater attention to the porousness of media sites commonly defined as social (e.g. Instagram) or sexual (e.g. Tinder). Participants demonstrate that trust in friendship is far greater that their trust in apps, and so this is called upon, at many levels, to negotiate app use. Notably mutual friends (‘mutuals’) offer greater feelings of safety. An overlap between friendship and sexual connections is also apparent in these data, as per discussion of 'sliding into DMs'. Participants who were not cisgender men had greater concern for safety, and thus more knowledge on how to negotiate apps (and dating) safely, particularly through friendship support networks.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous scholarship has examined how conspiracy theories spread online; addressed the question of what conspiracy theorists believe and why; asked whether or not conspiracy theorizing is a reasonable form of sense-making; and characterized the socio-cultural effects of conspiracy theories. Yet, the research practices of those who explore topics that have been labeled “conspiracy theories,” remain under-examined and under-theorized. Existing at the convergence of three interdisciplinary areas of scholarship—the study of conspiracy theory/ies, information seeking and behavior (e.g., research practices), and archival studies--this project will present preliminary dissertation research. The data will come from in-depth, qualitative interviews with individuals who regularly conduct research into one of three topics: the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico, and the Missing 411 phenomenon. Interviews are semi-structured, addressing participants’ experiences of different modes of research: within a research community, in isolation (by themselves), and with the help of a reference archivist or librarian, among others that may emerge. This paper will also feature reflexive grounded theory analysis of my own feminist standpoint as a researcher and interviewer.</jats:p>",

Empirical data reveal participants offered little about their own racial and class identities and the impact of those on life getting better but were forthcoming in discussing how their gender and sexual identities impacted their childhood victimization. Concurrently, participants made gross assumptions about viewers’ racial, class, gender, and sexual identities, projecting an overly simplistic message of life improving regardless of viewers’ circumstances or intersectionality. Findings contribute to online participation research concerning how the internet is used for social change and how social inequalities are (re)produced in online projects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we analyse data gathered through facial recognition\n        tradeshow ethnographies and interviews with members of the biometrics industry, as we\n        consider recent shifts in industry discourse towards promoting the ‘ethical’ use of\n        biometric technology. As the biometrics industry increasingly moves towards a ‘Video\n        Surveillance as a Service’ (VSaaS) model, the study of facial recognition infrastructures is\n        becoming a crucial aspect of the interrogation of the Internet of Things. We demonstrate\n        that the facial recognition industry is acutely aware of critiques of facial recognition\n        cameras and biometric technologies as enabling social harms related to intrusiveness and\n        bias (see Stark, 2019), and that members of the industry are keen to promote a more\n        prosocial public image of the technology. Towards this end we find that biometric monitoring\n        of children has gained a prominent place in the promotion of facial recognition technologies\n        as a mode of ‘careful’ surveillance. We identify three key ‘use cases’ in which the face of\n        the child takes on a prominent role as justifying and legitimating the use of facial\n        recognition technologies – in the auditing of humanitarian food supply programs, in the\n        detection of so-called ‘staging’ of family units at the US border, and in the detection of\n        underage gambling in Australia. We argue that the immanent ‘ethical’ framing of the child’s\n        face in this context serves to obscure the political ramifications of the extension of\n        facial recognition and of biometric surveillance tools more broadly.</jats:p>",

Recent work has pointed to\n        the complicated relationship between maps and the spaces they purportedly depict,\n        interpreting maps as simulacra that are intimately intertwined in the ideology and design of\n        gaming. In the presentation, we develop a semiotic walkthrough method that allows us to\n        identify four representational practices of these widely used navigation apps: the map is\n        personalized and adopts the perspective of the user – in Waze the arrow represents the user\n        rather than e.g. the North; the map is commercial in that it is informed by the economic\n        model of the app, e.g Waze presenting only those gas stations that pay the company; the map\n        offers a visual depiction of time – arguably, time rather than space is its raison d’être;\n        and lastly, the map is reflexive, incorporating users’ data both to regulate their behavior\n        (speed alert) and to seemingly subvert surveillance (police alert). In this cartographic\n        regime, the map user adopts a “self as business” (Gershon, 2017) logic in which navigation\n        must constantly create value, as the map becomes less a tool for regulating behavior and\n        more, a tool for producing it (Zuboff, 2019).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past three decades our media ecologies have changed substantially, not at least changing the ways in which we get in touch with the news. These changes have led both to high hopes for more equality in news access and a better-informed electorate, as well as fears of news avoidance, filter bubbles, and increasing knowledge gaps, with recent empirical evidence leaning towards rather pessimistic perspectives. However, most of the research to date focusses on one specific kind of news access, e.g., news consumption via social media, and its effects, neglecting the fact that users combine several ways to access the news throughout their daily lives, creating their individual media use repertoires. In order to disentangle these variances within our daily lives from differences between users, we need to analyze access to news on a situational level. Being meta-media, mobile media constitute an excellent microcosmos to study situational variability in news access. Hence, we investigated the situational types of mobile news access in young adults’ daily lives as well as their mobile news repertoires based on the previously identified situational access types. To do so, we conducted an experience sampling study among young adults in Germany. Our results highlight that differences within (mobile) news use should not only be studied as differences between people, but also as variances within users’ daily lives. For example, we see that no mobile news repertoire in our study solely relies on news access via intermediaries such as social media.</jats:p>",

Recognising this cross-medium migration of virtual celebrity—from anime, video games and blockbuster cinema to the participatory web—this paper adopts a platform-specific lens to highlight the affordances, cultures and vernaculars of specific social media as essential to virtual influencers’ aspiration to, and attainment and maintenance of, attention and fame.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Half a decade ago, social media platforms were widely perceived as revolutionary devices for maximizing political expression around the world. By opening the floodgates to expression, however, the same platforms were also accused of opening the floodgates of hate – allowing, for example, the self-claimed “revolutionary” return of ideas, speech and actors long thought to be relegated to the dustbins of history. This panel examines a three-fold revolution, namely: populist revolutions (on the right) facilitated by agnostic content moderation philosophies; the internal revolutions that platform content moderation underwent to address the political violence of the former; and the adjustments that digital methods research needs to adopt to facilitate content moderation research in a “post-API” environment. The first paper of this panel examines how Twitter’s content moderation has undergone several arbitrary changes before reaching a form of “normative plasticity”, with reinforcement techniques such as demotion and other forms of conditional content obfuscation. The second paper looks at how, despite making profound changes to prevent furthering political violence during elections, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram have tended to moderate the Brazilian elections in a dislocated fashion, turning a blind eye to Brazilian militaristic content and focusing instead on what it primarily moderates in a US context. Finally, the third paper offers a set of methods for empirical researchers to capture and study content moderation metadata over time. All three papers aim to contribute to attempts at archiving and studying speech moderation as a public good, in an international context.</jats:p>",

Yet it differs from #OccupyWallSt in its scope, which critiques capitalism as a whole rather than money in politics; its scale, with 2.7M members globally on Reddit alone; its longevity, ongoing for ten years; and its varied demographics whereas Occupy protesters tended to be educated white men. As Occupy sought collective mobilizations at government buildings, Antiwork fosters individual, less public forms of resistance to capitalism. James Scott referred to such ‘infrapolitics’ as weapons of the weak, as the lack of capital of the oppressed in all its forms often precludes more direct forms of protest. In this paper, drawing from digital ethnography and interviews, I examine the potency of r/Antiwork for impacting workplace behaviors among community members who are managers in their professional lives. In doing so, I explore the possibility of a broader class consciousness with an historically unlikely ally that transcends the traditional Marxist proletariat-capitalist binary and portends greater efficacy for the American labor movement than in the past 50 years.</jats:p>",

    "title": "GROUPS ARE EASY, FEDERATING IS HARD",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>When Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022, many users sought a place of refuge, and Mastodon was seen as an early candidate. Mastodon is part of the Fediverse, a decentralized network of social media services. But people arriving in this network were confused, a problem that many chalked up to a clunky interface and a confusing user experience. Such a reading of the situation misses something much more fundamental. This reaction to Mastodon signals something important about a narrowed network imagination amongst some users, a narrowed imagination that is not shared by all. On Mastodon, users engage in labor-intensive federating practices – they manage both the internal dynamics of their home server and that server’s relations to other servers. Groups are relatively easy to create, but federation can be quite difficult. Federation faces a number of obstacles, but some groups, including far-right political activists, have effectively responded to those obstacles. Researchers should study not only federated social media but also the federating practices used by groups both online and offline, practices that move past the easy labor of group formation into the more difficult work of federation.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Will the Revolution Be Tweeted? Mapping Complex Data Patterns from Sites of Protest",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Can Twitter really bring a dictator to his knees? Does Youtube stream information that is more influential than traditional news providers, such as New York Times? In the mainstream media debate between Clay Shirky and Malcolm Gladwell about whether or not “the revolution will be tweeted” both pundits make confidently totalizing arguments. In contrast, this panel looks at the radical rhetorics of activism alongside digital practices of the everyday by mapping specific data patterns and discursive conventions across time and space in networked media technologies.\n\nSpeaking from theoretical perspectives of the international Feminist Technology Network, these papers use textual explication, concept mapping, and media visualization to expose the rich polyvocalism of heterogeneous Internet discourses, full of affect and agency, even if the imagined community to which these utterances appeal is not necessarily realized in embodied interactions of protest at the town hall, city square, or national capital. The flux of configurations of collective and personal expression that constitutes online political speech in North Africa, the Middle East, and India is also often difficult to reduce to linear and predictive trends, and even earlier models of “smart mobs” (Rheingold) and “tactical media” (Lovink) do not always neatly map on to user behaviors in situations of political crisis.\n\nIt may be difficult to make direct correlations between the rise of revolutionary movements made manifest through large-scale street actions and the adoption of new distributed communication practices around information technologies, but researchers can examine how speech acts of protest can be conceptualized, facilitated, staged, ignored, negated, or thwarted in a culture of accelerated mediation and acknowledge the potential fragmentation of publics, the seeming disappearance of the civic, and, possibly, the dissolution of the nation state in the shift of globalization.\n\nThe three speakers examine how digital status update services, such as Twitter, not only disseminate links, images, and video that spur political protest but also allow for new forms of political discourse around key terms that function as metadata.\n\nSpeaker one describes the use of proper names in Twitter hashtags that reference key actors, concepts, and slogans in recent protests against sexual violence in India. Although American NGOs involved in the global women’s empowerment movement may want to see legal, medical, and social privacy practices that mirror those in political institutions in the West, the problem of rape may actually be more forcefully addressed if the victim is given a proper name that can function as a keyword for shared online discourse. Even if it is only a pseudonym, such as Damini or Amanat, as in the recent Delhi gang rape case, naming the victim serves a key informational purpose.\n\nSpeaker two examines how recent theories of copresence and of networked publics help understand the integration of “human narratives” and “data narratives” that unfold turning times of accelerated political change. This speaker examines how it was not merely the dissemination of graphic images of a self-immolated protester that spurred the overthrow an oppressive Tunisian regime, but the way that the violence against the body of Mohamed Bouazizi was understood through a hashtag with his name. Using the framework of object studies, this speaker will examine how the “body at risk” can be mapped across networked publics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On TikTok, users’ self-presentation is based on interaction and communication with and through short video content rather than on profile information or messaging. TikTok users commonly display awareness for how content is customized and develop strategies and video creation practices. Our qualitative interview study examines the practices of deleting videos and making videos private as forms of impression management online.\n\nWe generally find that TikTok users deleted videos because the content or message did not represent their views or attitudes anymore or because they feared it would negatively affect their impression in offline reality. More experienced users also deleted videos in case they failed to achieve the desired feedback. We specifically identified impression management strategies related to participants’ algorithmic literacy. Participant’s assumptions of how the TikTok algorithm works influenced their decision to set videos to private instead of deleting them even if they only have small numbers of followers and likes or only occasionally post or interact with content. A main motivation to set a video to private was that deleting would mess up the users’ personalized algorithmic video feed and ultimately lead to missing trends they are looking for. Many participants also mentioned deleting videos would affect the impression the TikTok algorithm has of their profile and eventually push their videos to the wrong audiences. In this context, our results provide new insights into the effort and thought that users put into making short content on TikTok and how they manage this content to create online identities.</jats:p>",

Drawing on our findings of an\n        ongoing digital ethnography (Pink et al. 2016; Hjorth, Horst, Galloway, Bell, 2017) among\n        Instagram profiles devoted to disseminate contents related to sustainability and climate\n        change, our aim here is to explore some controversial issues regarding how they understand\n        independence in relation to activism, lifestyle, consumption and work. We named these\n        environmental activist eco-influencers as these profiles develop similar strategies as those\n        that, according to Leaver, Hihghfield and Abidin as influencers are characterized by: 1)\n        applying positive self-branding strategies, 2) managing their visibility 3) cultivating\n        their community of followers adopting storytelling techniques consistent with their\n        lifestyles (Leaver, Hihghfield, Abidin, 2020: 106).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper engages with feminist political economists to explore questions of affective labour and value-production in self-tracking technologies designed for the female body (‘femtech’). Self-tracking femtech is largely characterised by smartphone applications and smart devices that track user data relating to menstruation, fertility periods, sexual activity, ovulation, hormones, and health and wellbeing. This data can be collected through self-reporting or through automated transmission from sensory devices attached to the body. By reflecting on my own experiences with these technologies, this paper argues that users of self-tracking femtech perform the labour of reproducing our bodies and our affective relations in ways that are amenable to both capitalist and patriarchal structures of power. Situated within the broader shifts of care and social reproduction, self-tracking femtech can be understood as affective infrastructures that re-stabilise gender norms and continue to unevenly push the burden of reproduction onto a class of unpaid women. I explore the ways that affective experiences are shaped and modulated by self-trackers to (re)produce and discipline the fertile and sexual female body to be $2 a productive labouring body and heterosexually attractive feminine subjectivity. The labour of reproduction is further intertwined here with the labour of producing data for digital media industries that generates profit in the advertising marketplace. By examining co-constitutive and paradoxical forms of value at play, I dually situate self-tracking femtech within broader political struggles and locate the spaces of agency in our everyday entanglements with digital media technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The academic literature has arguably never been more accessible. Through the internet, academics - and the wider public - are presented with an increasing array of platforms which offer sources of academic literature and information sources. Large-scale platforms – such as Google Scholar – often utilise algorithms in order to manage how search query results are prioritised and presented to searchers. This ‘sorting by relevance’ introduces an opaque layer to how readers engage with the literature, with potentially important implications for academic rigour and equity. Academic publishing and citation practices often serve to preserve privilege; in turn, there is a risk that algorithms which draw upon data sources such as these will compound biases. There is a need to interrogate how such algorithms work, and academics’ assumptions about the mechanisms behind them. This paper starts a critical discussion of the issue of algorithm-mediated academic literature searches. First, it draws upon the existing literature – primarily related to Google Scholar. This is followed by a mapping of the use of algorithms across a sample of major academic databases. Algorithms are found to be used extensively, although how they operate varies and is often not clear. The paper concludes with next steps for this project. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With active shooter drills as a normal part of student experiences in the U.S., the threat of a school shooting has become commonplace and institutionalized. Within a context of cultural trauma, it is no surprise that teens are using digital media to create spaces for sense-making, placemaking, and as a way to respond to the constant threat of violence. Focusing on the mediated memeification of school shootings, there exists an entire genre of #darkhumor videos on TikTok in which young people create and circulate irreverent humorous media texts as a response to the constant threat of – and perceived political inaction to - school shootings in the U.S. Through a content and discursive analysis of 200 #darkhumor #schoolshooting videos on TikTok, this paper asks: what can we learn about how young people understand cultural trauma through an examination of their playful and memetic social media practices? Videos are categorized into three groups: $2 (which address media stereotypes, tropes, and transactional survival), $2 (which address the absurdity of school violence and the failure of neoliberal responses), and $2 (which depict dance and movement as celebratory distractions). While the playful and irreverent videos can be read through a lens of critique, satire, or parody, the memetic, social, corporeal, and performative nature of TikTok affords related yet distinct practices and modes of playful social engagement that I refer to as the mediated playful body.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With Chinese rural village videos and their followers proliferating exponentially on YouTube, these influencers have been empowered by digital technologies. Hence, it is important to scope the genre of Chinese rural YouTubers and analyze rural Chinese videos because the genre has aroused cultural, economic, and societal influence. At present, the most popular and globally prolific Chinese rural influencer on YouTube is Liziqi (李子柒). The Chinese government has sought various collaborations to leverage on the global scale of her internet celebrity. This article aims to map out the emergent genre of Chinese rural influencers on YouTube and consider how they empower themselves with internet technologies and use the internet to gain independence on YouTube. While independence is frequently assumed to be about progressive politics, in the context of China, it can also reveal an attachment to individualization. This study relied on YouTube’s algorithmic recommendation of videos to understand how the platform ‘categorizes’ and ‘promotes’ related content to viewers.We manually amassed a corpus of 3480 video links from 205 channels in February 2021.Guided by grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss 2017), we closely surveyed various elements of 5 videos from the top 5 subscribed channels. We present three preliminary findings in this abstract. First, the genre of Chinese rural YouTube videos is constituted by some necessary elements in the video content.Second, we found these YouTubers engaged with themes of rurality, nostalgia, orientalism, exoticism, and commodification in the videos.Third, we found that Chinese rural YouTubers use digital technologies to empower themselves.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms are widely lauded as bastions for entrepreneurial self-actualisation and creative autonomy, offering an answer to historically exclusive and hierarchical creative industries as routes to employability and success. Social media influencers are envied by audiences as having achieved ‘the good life’, one in which they are able to ‘do what they love’ for a living (Duffy 2017). Despite this ostensive accessibility and relatability, today’s high-profile influencer culture continues to be shaped by ‘preexisting gendered and racial scripts and their attendant grammars of exclusion’ as Sarah Banet-Weiser (2012) argued in the early days of socially mediated entrepreneurship (p. 89; see also Bishop, 2017). In Western contexts only a narrow subset of white, cis-gender, and heterosexual YouTubers, Instagrammers, TikTokers, and Twitch streamers tend to achieve visibility as social media star-creators, and celebratory discourses of diversity and fairness mask problematic structures that exclude marginalized identities from opportunities to attain success. A key aim of this panel is thus to draw attention to marginalized creator communities and subjectivities, including women, non-white, and queer creators, all of whom face higher barriers to entry and success. More broadly, by taking seriously both the practices and discourses of social media influencers, the panellists aim to challenge popular denigrations of influencers as vapid, frivolous, or eager to freeload. We locate such critiques in longstanding dismissals of feminized cultural production (Levine, 2013) and argue, instead, that we need to take seriously the role of influencers in various social, economic, and political configurations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2011, artist Andrew Norman Wilson was working as a subcontractor doing video work for Google at the Mountainview California Googleplex. He’d noticed that the workers entering and exiting the building next door had different working conditions to the majority of the workers at the site and discovered they were working on the Google Books mass digitization project. One day he took his camera down to film them leaving the building at the end of the shift and the next day he was fired. Wilson used the footage to create a video he calls “Workers Leaving the Googleplex” (2011), and projects such as Krissy Wilson’s “The Art of Google Books” destabilise the fictional veneer of smooth clean surfaces that the Google Books project projects into the world. The growing field of critical infrastructure studies helps us to unpack and understand the multiple dimensions operating This paper argues that notions of the particularities of digital labour of all kinds are central to developing a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of digital cultural objects, both born-digital and digitised. The paper considers the often invisible, contingent, omitted or assumed labour involved in digitization projects, using thinking from critical infrastructure studies, new media, media archaeology and creative labour.</jats:p>",

    "title": "BRINGING THE PANDEMIC HOME: MEMES AS LOCAL POLITICS AT TIMES OF GLOBAL\n        CRISIS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>It was late February 2020 when part of Northern Italy entered the\n        first Covid-19 lockdown of the West. While stories of people fleeing quarantined areas soon\n        made national headlines, the international news was suddenly reporting of coronavirus\n        patients connected to Italy all around the world. Against this background, Italian social\n        media started thriving with Covid-19 humour. On 9 March the lockdown turned nationwide and\n        became one of the strictest in Europe. By focusing on Covid-19 memes of quarantined Italy,\n        this article explores the local - and mundane - appropriation of memetic practices, in both\n        its cultural and political dimensions. We combined digital methods and netnographic\n        techniques to generate and analyse a dataset of Covid-19 Twitter memes produced by Italian\n        publics during the first national lockdown. This allowed us to follow the circulation - and\n        evolution - of memetic practices, explore how cultural fabric contributed to different\n        dimensions of meme production and categorise the emergence of political expression. Our\n        findings show that Italian pandemic memes had a primarily affective function fed by past and\n        present pop culture, local or sub-local stereotypes and popular public debates. Where\n        political expression did emerge, it was never particularly innovative or new because it was\n        there to mark previously established communal belonging driven by populist narratives more\n        than to initiate contentious practices. Ultimately, this work suggests that memetic\n        practices can highly intertwine with the geographically or linguistically local and point to\n        the need for contextual approaches able to enhance our understanding of digital practices as\n        shaped by local publics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For queer men, sexual imaginaries have come to accomodate hybrid physical and digital location-based cultures (Miles, 2017). In short, what is possible in terms of intimate connections with other queer men has opened up in exciting, sometimes scary, and radical ways. However, this expanded imaginary of what is possible can also lead to an existential questioning of what an individual person wants—simply and nothing more than sex, a fleeting summer fling, a new group of friends, to fall in love? More? Less? A combination of all of these things at different moments in time? In the face of such uncertainty, we argue that queer men develop a range of practices as they negotiate their shifting relationships to sex and romance as mediated through virtual intimacies (McGlotten, 2013).\n\nIn this study, we explore how queer men learn about, interpret, and reproduce sexual and romantic norms on two dating and hookup platforms, Grindr and Scruff. Our approach builds on Sharif Mowlabowcus’s (2016, pg. 60) notion of cybercarnality concerning the “erotic economy of gay male corporeality” and Pym et al. (2021, pg. 399) study of queer community “imagined as an affective sense of shared ethics” on intimate platforms. Drawing on our digital ethnographic and speculative design data, we develop the concept of _multivalent intimate interests_ to capture the ambivalent socio-cultural context and situated nature of queer men’s sexual and romantic practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research shows that “algorithmic radicalization” and “echo chambers”—the idea that recommendation algorithms on social media have a strong independent effect on radicalization and silo people into ideologically homogeneous communities—are not as prevalent nor influential as once feared. Yet, online political discourse is as toxic as ever while political misinformation continues to plague social media platforms. This begs the question: If algorithms aren’t encouraging radicalization, then what is producing it? Drawing from church-sect theory, this study interviews politically active Reddit users to better understand _how_ they arrived at their current media use, online engagement, and political beliefs. Results show that participants have a deep mistrust of mainstream media, leading them to seek alternative sources of political content. Reddit participation is also driven by a desire for “earnest” political discussions with like-minded individuals and cross-partisans, in part to “reject” partisan polarization. Despite engaging on more extreme subreddits, participants said their beliefs were unchanged, but that other Redditors had moved to more extreme beliefs over time. And, participants perceived their Reddit participation as necessary to _prevent_ radicalization and partisan polarization. Collectively, these results provide preliminary insight into the media and social/psychological pathways that could lead to online radicalization, providing an alternative explanation to algorithmic radicalization. This study also underscores the importance of interrogating the ecological pathways to radicalization for researchers and policy-makers; future interventions should account for attribution bias and the individual-level factors related to radicalization. </jats:p>",

    "title": "DRAWING TO DISRUPT: ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVES TO THE MANOSPHERE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Content calling out everyday sexism on social media has grown in prominence in recent years through the work of feminist Instagram accounts such as @theequalityinstitute, @disbonjoursalepute and @vulgadrawings. At the same time, materials associated with the so-called ‘manosphere’ on forums that promote the narrative that men are victims of women’s empowerment have proliferated. Intersecting with colonial, far-right and white supremacist views, this content promotes traditionalist gender norms that eschew feminism and are imbued with misogyny.\n\nPopular feminist influencer and cartoonist Lily O’Farrell’s (@vulgadrawings) memes about sexism began to engage with the nuances of the manosphere in 2021 when she decided to talk to young men who were trolling her Instagram account. These men had become aware of her account after it was shared in a men’s rights subreddit group. Concerned that the group was made up of young men predominantly aged 16-23, O’Farrell decided to investigate the movement by joining Incel (involuntary celibate) subreddit groups.\n\nFollowing these investigations, the cartoonist produced a series of meme drawings titled: ‘Everything I’ve learned about Incels’ (2021), which illuminates the dynamics of the phenomenon for her mostly feminist 266 000 followers. Instead of demonising Incels, her drawings provide an anatomy of the movement that allows viewers insight into its logics.\n\nO’Farrell’s drawings 'call people in' within a context of calling out everyday misogyny. Through a multimodal content analysis, this paper considers them as a possible alternative narrative strategy that disrupt gender assumptions through empathetic engagement with young men at risk of violent misogynist radicalisation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cryptocurrency has attracted widespread criticism for its exploitative logics that consume resources and trap unwitting investors into highly volatile, unregulated markets with worsening wealth inequality. A key factor in the rise of crypto trading is social media, where an ecosystem of spammers, grifters, ‘crypto influencers’ and celebrities such as Elon Musk amplify hype and generate public interest. While platforms moderate orchestrated platform manipulation through the opaque concept of ‘coordinated inauthentic behaviour’ (CIB), here we argue that Twitter is largely ignoring widespread crypto-related CIB on its platform– because it is profitable. Informed by a study of 1.8 million tweets about the top five crypto coins, we develop a neocolonial perspective of CIB that highlights how Twitter exploits it strategically to turn a blind eye to financial exploitation and techno-utopian subjugation on the platform. While the line between authentic and inauthentic coordinated activity is not always clear cut, we suggest that platforms construct the problem in such a way that strategically obfuscates its distinction. This raises critical questions for content moderation and platform regulation that will require us to think outside the compromised nomenclature that platforms have invented for their own ends.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Understanding creativity from a decolonial perspective means removing the focus from the individual as innovator (as well as its profit-oriented goal), and instead highlighting the ongoing networked relationships among people, technologies, and spaces that often occur with creative practices. This creative process is not concerned with the creation of new things. Rather, it is about the mobility and networking of resources that can improve lives and facilitate survival strategies. In order to understand how creative practices occur in non-traditional contexts outside the colonial Global North perspective, we have developed a PubPub repository to crowdsource examples of creativity. PubPub is an open-source, web publishing platform that prioritizes community-generated and knowledge sharing. It is a low-barrier entry method to share information and knowledge within one's community of learners—in our case, individuals interested in creative practices that occur outside traditional corporate and profit-oriented domains.\n\nIn this presentation, we will describe the conceptualization and development of our online repository, focusing on how open science knowledge and crowdsourced information can help decolonize creative processes. Our project will accomplish four main goals: (1) explain this concept of creativity for a broad and non-academic audience, (2) share previous research and materials about this topic, (3) ask the audience to contribute to the collection, and (4) display the crowdsourced examples from the audience. In building our PubPub housing, we were especially interested in collecting publicly-identified instances of creativity to support the development and accessibility of a broad collection of examples found across the world.\n\n</jats:p>",

With social media regulation in Nigeria as a case study, it gives attention to debates drawn from postcolonial thinking, structural imperialism, and platform power, presenting new research on the concept of the matrix of dependence. To do this, I gather data by interviewing 19 stakeholders on what they perceive as credible alternatives to social media regulation in Nigeria, given their opposition to the proposed formal approach represented by the 2019 Internet Falsehood Bill. Analysis was done using Braun and Clarke’s (2021) reflexive thematic analysis. Findings point to four alternatives/themes: copying Western nations, platform self-regulation, governance built on trust, and digital media literacy. I expand on these findings to show that underlying each suggested alternative is the notion of subalternity under which Nigeria functions as it pertains to new media governance. I further argue that this construct can be applied to the wider African continent, suggesting that postcolonialism shapes the use and regulation of new media technologies in what can be understood as the matrix of dependence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Networked devices, sensors, and the algorithmic processes that power them pervade nearly all facets of daily life. These systems are designed by an elite class of experts and powered by data extracted from populations of people. Many people remain unaware of what data these systems extract and how systems and institutions use data, raising significant questions about privacy. One response to such concerns is to call for educational efforts that increase people’s understanding, or literacy, of digital data flows. Literacy is often regarded as an end in itself, an unquestionably good thing. Yet literacy does not operate autonomously. Teaching someone to understand something does not automatically improve their life. Privacy literacy efforts thus need to be explicit about what they seek to accomplish. In other words, what is privacy literacy for? I argue that privacy literacy efforts should harness education to mobilize people toward changing the technological _and_ social conditions that discipline subjects toward advancing institutional goals. To avoid perpetuating oppressive power dynamics, I advocate that privacy literacy efforts embody a critical pedagogy where teachers and students learn from each other about what privacy means, how data-driven systems do and don’t afford privacy, and what needs to change to create worlds where people can flourish. I also recommend that privacy literacy efforts align with social movements whose visions identify paths away from extraction and toward relations that respect the inherent humanity of data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Immigration is deeply rooted in colonial structures that define who migrates and where, through a hierarchized perspective of the representations, knowledge, and ideas. It is possible to extrapolate these societal requirements to the digital space of social media platforms, where a combination of human and algorithmic moderation systems determine what is available, visible, and viral. Thus, colonial structures of dominance are perpetuated through coded biases and algorithmized oppression systems. The internal functioning of these moderation infrastructures is obscure, although we can glimpse at them through the contents and discourse of creators who describe their experiences with the platform, its algorithm, and the moderation policies that shape and affect their content creation practices. In this paper, we illustrate the different vernacular and platformed practices of immigrant content creators who portray the ways in which they negotiate their visibility with TikTok and its algorithmic system. The examples were extracted from a larger study that comprises 57 Latin American immigrant tiktokers who reside in the US and Spain. We use the concept of algorithmic (in)visibility as the basis for the study. The initial findings suggest that these creators deploy platformed practices such as the (re)use of audio tracks for visibility and protest; the use of TikTok vernaculars such as humor and sarcasm to convey controversial ideas; and partial deplatforming to protest the blockage of their profiles on TikTok. These practices provide insights about the decolonial negotiation of algorithmic (in)visibility taking place on social media platforms today.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on the digital-material hybridity of the contemporary feminist activist, particularly the problematic and progressive potential offered by the technological affordances of the Internet and digital social media. In addition, the paper highlights the associated anxieties for feminists of being online and engaging in what is often, in this “age of surveillance capitalism” (Zuboff 2019) and toxic masculinity, a hostile, commodified and misogynistic milieu. Furthermore, the digital affordances enabled through the proliferation of Web 2.0 technology inform the nature of feminist online discourse and campaigning, which has, at times, contributed to the moral panic that surrounds attempts at centering marginalized voices, particularly members of the trans community and sex workers.\n\nThe paper will explore the relationship between online tools and platforms adopted by mainstream contemporary feminists and the role they have played in constructing ‘othering’ hierarchies within feminism, as well in enabling the intersectional critique of these narratives. Avoiding either cyber-utopian or dystopian arguments, or a techno-determinist or utilitarian stance, this paper accounts for the complex and contradictory environment that the Internet offers to feminism. The paper also recognizes the enmeshed nature of feminists with their digital tools and platforms as well as the problematic and progressive feminist activism taking place online. </jats:p>",

    "title": "GEOGRAPHIES OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY: PROTOTYPING EXPLORATION, EXPERIENCE, AND ACCESS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scrolling through Google Maps application or website, it is difficult to avoid Google Maps’ hallmark promises of explore and experience. From calls to “explore and experience the world”, “discover new experiences”, “find places for you” or “have the confidence to explore, access to experience”, explore and experience (and their iterations of discover, find, and access) command imaginaries of unrestricted entitlement and complete control over one’s personal domain. This Google Maps rhetoric reifies exploration and experience as desirable mobilities without acknowledging the politics they enforce and the relations to space they enact. This paper asks: in these projected geographies of self-assured navigation, who is the prototype that fulfills the fantasy of seamless mobility and unrestricted claims to space?\n\nI divide this paper into three sections— Explore, Experience, and Access— to analyze what these modes are, what they are contingent on, who they prioritize and the harms they reinforce and reproduce. In the final section, Access, I address the limits Google Maps claims to space and present a necessary reorientation. I argue that Google Maps’ imperatives to explore, experience, and access space are based on a colonial raced, classed, and ableist prototype—the self-sufficient user. In organizing space around the self-sufficient user, Google Maps extends and entrenches settler colonial dispossession and ableist gatekeeping. Ultimately, Google’s imaginary of untethered exploration— the experience and access it engenders— carries a heavy weight.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE EMERGENCE OF NETWORKS ON FACEBOOK MEMORIAL PAGES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Facebook Pages is an essentially public sub-platform that allows users to reach an audience, create a large network of followers, and become admins. Pages’ official aim is to serve businesses, communities, and public figures, yet they are commonly employed in different aims: to memorialize and publicize ordinary people. This paper examines these practices through an in-depth qualitative analysis of eighteen cases, combined with a digital ethnography conducted between 2018-2021. Findings illuminate the role that these memorial Pages serve as social capital resources and reveal how admins negotiate Facebook affordances when creating, designing, and maintaining such Pages. Admins use the Page and its network of followers to run an extensive memorial activity, both online and offline, and to turn the deceased into a public figure. They discursively position the deceased as a special person whose story carries social significance and collective moral value, hence worth public remembering. Acts of engagement with the Page emerge as socially valued actions, and the followers, who are otherwise strangers, are framed as vital partners in this process. Admins use the followers to accumulate various resources: money donations, physical attendance in events, emotional support, and more. These amount to the social capital that admins generate. Finally, users form a causal connection between visible and measurable online engagement (Like, Share, Follow) and cognitive or emotive implications – public memory, recognition, and esteem. Together, these findings provide fruitful insights into social capital processes on social media sites, memorialization practices, and public remembrance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes trends and shifts in internet policy focus over time through a cross-country comparative lens. We employ computational and qualitative methods to map patterns in internet regulation across Brazil, Chile, and the United States over 24 years of data on proposed legislation (1997 to 2021). The study analyzes (1) What issues are lawmakers discussing in their proposed Internet-related legislation? (2) What are the cross-country thematic trends and patterns in Internet policy over time? (3) Can we identify national/transnational turning points in such trends? The cross-country historical analysis of internet-related bills helps us understand how responsive the lawmakers in the American continent are. By contrasting the bills’ policy themes with endogenous and exogenous events and forces in the region, we identify if lawmakers are anticipating future problems and then proposing regulation to meet those ends or if they are reacting after problems occur. More than that, we compare the lawmakers’ responsiveness between the North and South divide. Further, by contrasting the volume of bills per policy theme, we identify what issues are more salient to the lawmakers from the different countries. This information helps us analyze if the drivers for internet regulation in the region differ, and how different are the responses to similar issues between countries and between lawmakers from different ends of the political spectrum.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Together, our projects pose the question of what else can be possible as a way to rearrange the power relations that have contributed to the asymmetric flows of information and resources to some instead of others. We are inspired by indigenous scholars’ claim that “decolonization is not a metaphor” because liberation should not be a metaphor: it should be a possibility.\n\nWe, panelists, hope to engage conversations that address the future of the internet, especially the future of mobile communication with the lessons learned from studies. Panelists offer a close reading of four scenarios: in South Korea among residents whose locative data tell a story about their comings and goings, among International Exchange Students mobile media use during the on-set of travel bans, in China among rural-to-urban female migrant workers, and in Brazil among those who used the Unified Slum Dashboard to called attention for proper government intervention. Among our research methods are interviews, observations, content analysis, and case study to bring attention to and make institutional space for voices and accounts of community engagement that have been marginalized or overlooked. Our findings share a common theme that mobile media simultaneously can liberate and complicate our mobility choices, especially during a global pandemic, but that it can be a civic media in which liberation can be possible through more careful policies that take minoritized experiences into consideration for future policies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The social media and short video streaming app TikTok has grown exponentially in the past four years. This exploratory research project outlines and defines a new kind of viral phenomenon taking place on TikTok: that of the targeted theory. Targeted theories are amateur investigations of an individual creator based on an—often mundane—activity recorded in a TikTok video. Targeted theories are often undergirded by mini-moral panics, charging targets with being kidnappers, killers, fakers, cheaters, etc. Targeted theories are related to online harassment; in many cases they constitute a type of harassment. They are also related to conspiracy theories, but are distinct from them in that targeted theories accuse an individual, rather than a group, of duplicity. How do TikTok’s platform affordances create an environment that is (or is not) especially hospitable for targeted theorizing? How are the identities of targeted creators who are marginalized exploited and even weaponized as part of targeted theorizing? This project tackles these questions by tracing the rise and fall of three case studies of targeted theories on TikTok, and the normative and critical discourses that emerge around them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ‘experience’ – and how social media guide, frame, appropriate, and exploit it – is the topic of this paper. In this theoretical-methodological intervention, I start from a close reading and a digital technography of Mark Zuckerberg’s presentation of the idea of the ‘Metaverse’ (in which the term ‘experience’ is repeated more than 60 times) to argue that a critical-phenomenological disposition is urgent for unpacking the struggle for ‘the experience’, and for examining how certain platform-centric ideals of ‘the experiential’ become incorporated and habituated in everyday life. The growing interest in platform capitalism and data colonialism foregrounds how human experience is central not only to social media’s rhetoric but also to their business models, which favor continuous exposure and repeated movements so as to harvest human experience and the data footprints it generates. The central argument of this paper is that the colonialist inclinations of mainstream social media are manifested not only in their data-driven operation, but also in how they manage to normatively configure the conceptions and imaginaries of human experience that are available to us. I focus, in particular, on the conceptions of ‘active experience’ and ‘embodied experience’. A critical phenomenology of mediation, I argue, would address and unpack how those extractive framings become habituated, naturalised, and taken-for-granted, and offer a less ‘platform-centric’ vocabulary for examining the incorporation of certain power dynamics into everyday lived experience.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media enable the formation of unprecedented numbers of ties, and allow for communication at an unprecedented scale. Features such as unfriending and muting on the one hand, and favoriting and “close friends” on the other, enable users to manage this abundance, allowing them to silence certain voices and to enhance certain others. These features create situations that sometimes cannot be mapped onto familiar offline scenarios. We argue that these new, sui generis situations instantiate a set of social architectures and imaginaries that we describe collectively using the term, synthetic sociality. We analogize these synthetically social situations with Derrida’s concept of écriture, through which written language is understood not as a derivative reflection of orality, but rather as a self-contained set of communicative capacities that precedes and surrounds oral communication. To exemplify the concept of synthetic sociality, we present three forms of “born digital” social transactions: the “block” feature in Facebook (which can create a situation in which not all parties to a conversation see the entirety of the conversation), the “restrict” feature in Instagram (in which a user can respond to a post though, unbeknownst to them, they have no audience), and “favorite” contacts in address book apps (which allow for their messages to rise to the top of the inbox). In none of these cases are the resulting social architectures easily analogized to those achievable in a physical social environment, crucially because at least one party to these synthetically social situations lacks full knowledge of it.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade, social media became an indispensable tool for political campaigning for populist political leaders, who successfully used social media to circumvent traditional media elite and establish a seemingly direct relationship with their constituents. Based on this premises and adopting the lens of “digital populism”, our study presents a visual analysis of the portraits and candid shots posted on Instagram by two Italian populist party leaders: Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Renzi. Specifically, we explore a corpus of 424 images featuring the two leaders and posted on their respective profiles during 2020 (266 for Meloni, 158 for Renzi). Our analysis mostly focuses on a crucial semiotic feature of these images: setting. Recognizing that digital photography contributes to the mutual construction of self and space, we argue that the Renzi and Meloni strategically use setting to negotiate the inherent tension between their status as celebrity politicians and the “claim to ordinariness” typical of their populist political style. Thus, we claim that the two leaders navigate this tension by selectively posting images set “on stage” (e.g., while being interviewed during a talk show), “behind the scenes” (e.g., while working in their office), or on an “intimate stage” (e.g., on a day hike with their family). In our conclusions we reflect on the notion that populism is endemic in Italian politics, suggesting its digital manifestations take different shapes depending on political narratives that charismatic leaders construct for themselves through different mixes of celebrity and micro-celebrity practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This research is about an inclusive, participatory methodology for smart city research: walking in the ‘datafied’ city. So-called walkshops facilitate experiences of and discussion about the environment in which social challenges arise, together with urban dwellers who may perceive them in different ways than decision-makers. We are investigating if walkshops provide a low-threshold methodology for meaningful involvement of all urban dwellers in technological decision-making, with a specific interest in the involvement of societal groups that are vulnerable.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and control of all technology users over the processing and use of their personal data. This includes so-called vulnerable data subjects. In smart, datafied cities, personal data protection provisions and rights could contribute to empowering urban dwellers. However, taking self-determined decisions regarding legal provisions and complex technical systems is often difficult, and nigh impossible for some. Despite the legal efforts to empower all data subjects vis-à-vis the processing of their personal data, inherent power imbalances remain, and the provisions hardly reach some groups. An important aim of the walkshop methodology is therefore to be inclusive and attractive for anyone.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we describe how the methodology was tested, and evaluated during eighteen walks in the cities of Brussels, Gent, and Leuven. Evaluations by researchers, participants, and partner organisations, showed very promising results despite some methodological challenges (e.g. participant recruitment). Walkshops show the potential for socially relevant empirical work that creates win-win situations for researchers, public partners, and citizenries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Search engines serve as information gatekeepers on a multitude of topics dealing with different aspects of society. However, the ways search engines filter and rank information are prone to biases related to gender, ethnicity, and race. In this paper, we conduct a systematic algorithm audit to examine how one specific form of misrepresentation bias, namely, sexualization, is manifested in Google's text search results about different national and gender groups. We find evidence of sexualization of women, particularly those from the Global South and East in search outputs. This is amplified by contextual advertisements pushed by Google in response to different search queries.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While Asian American food bloggers constitute an overrepresented racial minority within the predominantly white food blogosphere, food blogs rarely constitute productive spaces for discussing or building community around Asian American experiences even when published by Asian American bloggers. This study addresses the need for further intersectional analyses of food blogs that specifically take race into account as it explores the racial discourses generated by Asian American food bloggers participating in Instagram conversations around #BlackoutTuesday and Black Lives Matter in 2020. I find that #BlackoutTuesday authorised the discussion of race in a way that was not previously visible in the food blogosphere – for instance, Asian American food bloggers used Instagram posts in these conversations to identify with the politicised identity term ‘Asian American’ which, in turn, inspired solidarity and action amongst the Asian American community in support of Black Lives Matter. However, Asian American food bloggers also perpetuated elements of the model minority myth, distancing the microaggressions they had experienced from the ‘more serious’ racism and threats faced by Black Americans rather than acknowledging their joint and precarious structural oppression. This data demonstrates that the racial experiences of Asian American food bloggers continue to be silenced or diffracted, largely due to the ways that Asian American participation in this digital culture is structured through assimilation and racial commodification. Yet, despite these limitations, this conversation has value in contributing to visibility around minority allyship within the Black Lives Matter movement while also challenging the premise of political silence by minority bloggers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The rapid development of data-driven technologies has led to manifold concerns on how to protect citizens from the effects of massive data exploitation, especially when “personal data” are at stake, since they are the object of a fundamental right. Personal data are legally defined as any information “relating to” an identified or identifiable natural person, the right holder. However, it is unclear in which particular sense personal data relate to a person: which is the specific type of direct connection between them. In our view, this is a crucial question both from a conceptual and a normative point of view that the academic literature has not yet addressed in enough depth. In light of this, our paper aims at advancing knowledge towards a more accurate conception of our relationship with personal data. To do so, we firstly discuss the main recent conceptions on the issue: data as property, data as raw material and data as labour. Secondly, we argue why none of them seems to be accurate from a conceptual point of view or desirable from a socio-political perspective. Finally, we propose to understand personal data as _part of oneself_ and our relationship with them as the one we have with our bodies or their parts, with _our data bodies_. We end up discussing the implications of the proposed conception, both from a conceptual and from a normative perspective.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet governance institutions embrace a multistakeholder approach, which calls for civil society organizations (CSOs) to represent community interests. How well do digital rights CSOs fulfill these expectations of “community representation”? Through a case study of the Internet Freedom Foundation, an Indian digital rights organization, this paper evaluates community engagement mechanisms through the lens of equity and democratization, and identifies a gap between expectations and observed practices. It concludes that evaluating representation in digital-native CSOs should account for both socioeconomic and technological dynamics in both transnational and national contexts. This paper offers a contribution to an emergent understanding of civil society’s role in internet governance, grounded in a postcolonial critique of representation and legitimacy, in order to understand whose voices are heard, and whose are still excluded, from internet governance processes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Prior literature has suggested that it is through popular music that the social, professional and technological aspirations of Black youth often come together. Nowhere is this more evident than in the context of Hip-Hop music, where Black youth inventiveness with digital tools is celebrated and valued far more than any other genre of media entertainment. Though many scholars have theorized on the centrality of authenticity and masculinity to the communication of Hip-Hop artists in digital spaces, little academic work has paid very little attention to artist perspective of how this relational labor and visibility strategy helps them cultivate viable careers as influencers. Using interviews with artists, artist managers and independent label executives, I detail the career potentials for Hip-Hop artists engaging in social media self-branding strategies. I explore the content and character of their work on social media toward acquiring “clout”- a digital form of influence rooted in Hip-Hop that allows marginalized youth to leverage digital tools in build social status, maintain authenticity, cultivate connections with fans, connect to friends and other cultural producers. In this study, I detail examples of three relational strategies that our respondents utilized to acquire “digital clout:” a) Corralling b) Capping and, c) Co-Signing. To conclude, I argue Chicago’s Hip-Hop scene provides an example of why formal institutions need to rethink how race, class, gender and geography influence the digital practices of young people and how their practices add significantly to the understanding of the cultural and communicative diversity arising from globalizing social media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This cross-platform digital ethnography examines the nuances of how\n        emotions are expressed and who they are directed towards within social media in order to\n        better understand the phenomenon of affective polarization and the increased emotionality\n        online. As part of a larger three-year SSHRC-funded comparative study between the US and\n        Canadian elections, the focused dataset for this project draws on grounded theory (Charmaz,\n        2006) and our exploration of 1800 social media posts from the political left and right\n        across social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, and Gab. By examining how social media\n        users discursively construct representations of self and other through expressions of\n        us/them dichotomies, this project seeks to better understand polarized political identities\n        and how social media users emphasize that their morals and values are similar or distinct\n        from others. How do people on the left and the right feel victimized by the other? What are\n        the moral and emotional injuries as well as the identity politics upon which they base their\n        claims to victimhood and simultaneously place blame on the other? How do social media users\n        rhetorically express their indignation through us/them dichotomizing, to justify their\n        negative affect as well as enactments of revenge as moral duty? In addition to presenting\n        key findings, this talk highlights our innovative approach to affective discourse analysis\n        developed over the past two years of iterative, grounded theoretical qualitative\n        study.</jats:p>",

In this study we focus on the profound re-negotiation of mediated personal boundaries in times of mass lockdowns and social distancing. To understand how these new social conditions might be playing out in the field of privacy, we interviewed 90 faculty in higher education in Estonia, France and Israel. Participants were asked about changes in their ICT use for personal and work purposes, with the practice of distance teaching serving as a common experience for the discussion of possible changes in their views and practices of privacy. Our findings point to the precedence of $2 considerations of privacy over $2 considerations. In other words, interviewees had very little to say about the broader forms of data collection by their employers, the state, or commercial companies that are enabled by the adoption of new ICTs. They did, though, have much to say about their mediated relations with students and colleagues, and were very much concerned with self-presentation and impression management as well as with sustaining meaningful teaching situations. In general, the prism of privacy unearths the hidden social structures of teaching and interacting online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper demonstrates an ethico-methodological approach to\n        researching archived web pages created by young people throughout 1994-2005 that was\n        collected and stored by the Internet Archive. Rather than deploying a range of computational\n        tools available for collecting web data in the Internet Archive, my approach to this\n        material has been to start with the person: I recruited participants through social media\n        who remembered creating websites or participating in web communities when they were younger\n        and were interested in attempting to relocate their digital traces. In a series of\n        qualitative, online semi-structured interviews, I guided participants through the Wayback\n        Machine’s interface and directed them towards where their materials might be stored. I\n        adapted this approach from the walkthrough method, where I position the participant as\n        co-investigator and analyst of web archival material, enabling simultaneous discovery,\n        memory, interpretation and investigation. Together, we walk through the abandoned sites and\n        ruins of a once-vibrant online community as they reflect and remember the early web. This\n        approach responds to significant ethical gaps in web archival research and engages with\n        feminist ethics of care (Luka &amp; Millette, 2018) inspired by conceptual framing of data\n        materials in research on the \"right to be forgotten” (Crossen-White, 2015; GDPR, 2018;\n        Tsesis, 2014), digital afterlives (Sutherland, 2020), indigenous data sovereignty and\n        governance (Wemigwans, 2018), and the Feminist Data Manifest-No (Cifor et al, 2019). This\n        method re-centers the human and moves towards a digital justice approach (Gieseking, 2020;\n        Cowan &amp; Rault, 2020) for engaging with historical youth data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media fuel a sense of constant updating to encourage uninterrupted connectivity and generate quantifiable engagement. This paper is concerned with the habitual character acquired by these platforms, and with how this is paradoxically constructed by prompting a permanent state of anticipation. The aim is to explore, with a phenomenological sensibility, the experiences that emerge in settings of continuous connectedness from the perspective of the people who use these technologies in the context of everyday life – i.e. the ‘users’. Theoretically, the entry point is to revisit the claim of liveness and to position it as a central resource in this process. Empirically, I draw from the thematic analysis of data collected through the diary-interview method with people who live in London and use a range of social media to examine both how this urge of continuous connectedness operates and the ambivalent experiences it generates. I discuss, in particular, the finding that the use of social media is often described as aimless and pointless – which means that, in a research centrally concerned with liveness (with what feels animated, pulsating, injected with life), one of the most commonly observed experiences is that of deadness, lifelessness. This lack of life of social media is described both as a result of the presence of too many potentially interesting things, and as the platforms’ incapacity to deliver anything interesting at all.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I discuss my doctoral research-creation project: the design of an online archive of the community materials of a Mexico City-based queer cabaret collective active between 2006-2012, called Burlesquimeras, which I was a member of. While digital photographs and social media certainly existed in the years Burlesquimeras was active, it was before the two were seamlessly integrated (at least in the Mexican context) through the ubiquity of smartphones and unlimited data. That is, an online search of Burlesquimeras does not yield a significant collection of photographs that can be potentially culled or scrapped from social media. Most of the digital photographs and other ephemera, have been stored by its members in the mess or clutter of the homes and hard drives of the community members. Moreover, I explain a concept I coined: “stor(y)ing”. It is influenced by theoretical structures and praxes that challenge and expand notions of evidence, sources and the possibilities of historic narratives, such as Hartman’s Critical Fabulation (2008, 2019), Cowan’s Cabaret Methods (Forthcoming) and Navarrete Linares’ use of Mesoamerican myth and cosmohistoria (2011, 2018). I propose that the very act of caring for these materials by their queer creators, albeit in a messy way, and precisely because it is in a messy way, is already an act of story-telling. I refer to this practice as stor(y)ing: a storage of materials that itself articulates a story.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study attempts to delineate $2 when they use social media, shop\n        online, and make electronic payments using WeChat Pay and Alipay. It is part of a book I am\n        writing on perceptions of privacy and surveillance in China and is grounded in an inductive\n        content analysis of 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews I conducted late 2019 in Beijing,\n        Shanghai, and Chengdu. Privacy is written with two different words in Mandarin: $2 (a\n        personal thing you do not wish to disclose in public akin to Western definitions) and $2\n        (hiding a shameful secret). Most of my interviewees used the latter meaning: $2 . Privacy,\n        thus, was $2 , understood as $2 (moral face - e.g., purchases of personal medicine,\n        underwear and sex-related products, or weapons) and $2 (social face - eg., financial\n        information). Moreover, they perceived the need to hide shameful information $2 : parents\n        and supervisors, or hackers who would disclose personal information, but less so an abstract\n        entity such as the government. For instance, several interviewees felt they could “hide on\n        Weibo” using a pseudonym, despite the real-name registration policy. These findings on\n        privacy may shed slight on how Chinese citizens view the digitalization of surveillance\n        through facial recognition monitoring and the building of the social credit system, and\n        contribute to culture-sensitive surveillance research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) community is currently one of the\n        largest creative content communities on Pinterest (Hall et al., 2018), a social networking\n        service (SNS) that encourages users to both share information about creative processes and\n        attempt projects in real life (IRL). Pinterest users share ongoing projects by creating\n        Project “Pins”, which consist of images, videos, and text descriptions of creative content.\n        And yet, while several studies have investigated user behavior in relation to everyday\n        ideation and creativity on the site (Linder et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2018, Mull and Lee,\n        2014), little is known about the characteristics that lead users to prefer some DIY projects\n        over others. Thus, this paper introduces the Pinterest-DIY data set, which consists of text\n        data mined from 500 DIY project Pins on Pinterest. Using a custom sampling approach, we\n        created a taxonomy of DIY characteristics related to each Pin’s project type, function,\n        materials, and complexity. To measure user preferences on the site, we also conducted a\n        sentiment analysis on user comments for each DIY project Pin. This paper introduces the data\n        set and presents two use cases for the internet research community using both exploratory\n        and confirmatory statistical methods. In our view, the Pinterest-DIY data set will provide\n        further opportunities to examine whether, and to what degree, participation in online DIY\n        communities promotes everyday creativity and increases engagement with physical\n        matter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the summer of 2020, dozens of high-profile influencers in videogaming entertainment were accused of sexual harassment and predatory behavior. Among these, popular gaming YouTuber Craig Thompson (username 'Mini Ladd') confessed on Twitter to grooming minors but resumed uploading content to his YouTube channel one month later, resulting in public outcry. Thompson’s return to YouTube provides a case study in how predatory influencers can manipulate affordances across platforms, especially on YouTube, to insulate themselves from accountability and maintain their platform. Using scraped data from Twitter (34k tweets) and YouTube (62k comments and video network data), this article uses a mixed-methods social network analysis (Burgess and Matamoros-Fernández 2016) to map the public effort to deplatform Mini Ladd. This case study raises questions about cross-platform insulation and audience manipulation, by demonstrating how a predatory influencer 1) censored keywords in his comments to obfuscate criticism 2) gamed YouTube’s video algorithms to avoid references to his scandal and 3) redirected harassment onto his own fanbase. Ultimately, I argue that predatory influencers manipulate YouTube’s platform affordances to insulate themselves from accountability in the absence of moderation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Rivendell, a free and open source software suite for automated radio\n        broadcasting, has brought several groups with clashing stances on technology, communication,\n        and cultural politics into cooperation. This paper treats Rivendell as an opening onto the\n        politics at play when the liberal ethos propelling free and open source software (Coleman,\n        2013) meets the autonomy-prizing traditions of independent broadcasting within an automation\n        system. Complicating this already tense juncture, Rivendell has drawn users and code\n        contributors from drastically opposed political groups within American\n        broadcastings—right-wing Christian talk radio networks and progressive community\n        stations—and has sustained a difficult terrain of working compromise that the activist push\n        for low-power FM broadcasting inaugurated (Dunbar-Hester, 2014). In this paper, analysis of\n        Rivendell's open source code base sheds light on its development and helps connect it to\n        longer histories of media automation and its attendant social frictions. Interviews with\n        lead Rivendell developers complete the picture of the project's trajectory, of its relation\n        to the religious right context where the project began, and of the negotiations that have\n        played out among its developers and its community of users in terrestrial and internet\n        radio. The ongoing compromises and tensions threaded through Rivendell can offer insight\n        into an issue that becomes larger and more pressing as media become increasingly complex and\n        networked: how artists, activists, and media technologists who prioritize independence have\n        reckoned with their reliance on socio-technical infrastructures whose connections may strike\n        them as far less than savory.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents two findings from 50 in-depth interviews of\n        daters using OkCupid, Tinder, and Bumble. The first finding shows that respondents began\n        using dating apps like Tinder and Bumble because they wanted to engage in dialogical\n        exchanges to get to know their matches, something they felt the elaborate essays on OkCupid\n        rendered redundant. The second finding shows that the intimate exchanges they sought on\n        dating apps were hard to find. Instead of intimacy, they encountered anxious text games\n        exacerbated by the widespread practice of ghosting. These findings indicate how the distinct\n        algorithms employed by OkCupid, Tinder, and Bumble cultivate particular feelings, moods, and\n        modes of subjectivity. While OkCupid’s algorithm cultivated entrepreneurs of themselves\n        seeking to optimize their intimate relationships, dating apps cultivate the digital unbored:\n        users compelled to swipe away the angst-inducing boredom of waiting for texts that always\n        may never come. Dating apps render searches for intimacy fraught with anxiety and\n        substantial connections hard to find. But they are well calibrated to the exigencies of\n        platform capitalism, where social relations are as likely to be sold as things, especially\n        when they vanish as quickly as they appear – like ghosts.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Information and communication technologies occupy a central position\n        in the Covid-19 pandemic. Public response has been deemed extremely important, with social\n        media platforms playing a key role in both institutional and bottom-up information sharing\n        processes. The emerging field of platform studies has shown that platforms increasingly\n        influence how society works; however, such studies often adopt a highly Western-centric\n        approach. By developing an exploration of Twitter and Weibo use in the early stages of the\n        pandemic, this study provides a comparative investigation of the role of platforms in\n        societies. Our findings indicate that during the Covid-19 outbreak, Weibo worked as a\n        propaganda tool to unite the Chinese people and promote public policies under the control of\n        the government and the guidance of the mainstream media. Twitter functioned more like a\n        public discourse platform open to personal expression, often showing the influence of\n        defined partisan political discourses. We argue that the participatory dynamics\n        characterising Weibo and Twitter conversations at the outbreak of the pandemic at least\n        partially mirrored the different ‘platforms societies’ currently developing in China and the\n        West.</jats:p>",

We followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews\n        to collect and screen results, and a coding scheme based on methodological and substantive\n        questions to analyze them. The preliminary results show, among others, that research on\n        COVID-19 misinformation reproduces a well-known trend of differentiated attention to social\n        media platforms based on both popularity among users and ease of access to data by scholars,\n        that online survey distributed via social media has been a very popular approach, and the\n        presence of a wide range of perspectives, and sometimes diverging point of views, on\n        problematic information, in terms of prevalence of misinformation, countermeasures, and the\n        role of social media communication.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, various claims of cyberspace sovereignty, including\n        'data sovereignty', 'digital sovereignty' and 'technological sovereignty', have attracted\n        widespread attention. In this research, we examine the various academic positions and\n        governments’ policies on different \"sovereignty\" concepts in cyberspace, and to explore the\n        controversies, evolution and future development of these concepts. Research questions are:\n        1) what are the definitions of the academic community on these concepts including ‘cyber’,\n        'digital', 'data' and 'technology’ sovereignty ; 2) what are the positions and claims of\n        major governments on these sovereignties; and 3) what are the overlaps, differences and\n        conflicts between those positions and the underlying reasons? Methodologically, this paper\n        will use a historical documentary analysis approach. The types of documents used include two\n        categories: (1) Primary sources: Initiatives, laws, regulations, drafts, ordinances and\n        strategic proposals issued by governments on sovereignty in cyberspace; 2) secondary source:\n        academic literatures related to various concepts of sovereignty in cyberspace, including\n        journal papers, academic conference reports and books. In this paper, government policy\n        documents from China, the EU and the US for the period 2010-2021 will be chosen as the main\n        subjects of study. There has been a major conceptual and position differences among these\n        countries/region on the \"sovereignty \" in cyberspace, they represent the focus of the\n        debates.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For years, academics and journalists have proclaimed a crisis of gameswork, detailing the ‘destruction’ of the lives of those in this creative workforce, and wondering when the ‘breaking point’ of professional game design, premised on crunch, work limbo, and churn, would come. Still it was only at the March 2018 Game Developers Conference, typically a heavily corporatized event, that a large-scale discussion of unionization was staged, leading to the formation of Game Workers Unite. While collective organizing in games is going global, with branches forming from France to Australia to South Korea, these developments are outpaced by increasingly transnational dynamics of outsourcing and automation, threatening to devalue and even eliminate already highly-competitive jobs in ‘cool industries’ of ‘passionate’ workers. This paper considers these global contradictions and tensions through analysis of a group heavily implicated in visions of the future of gameswork- students in formal games education. While within game studies there has been sustained interest in the production of this form and labour relations therein, the shape and role of games higher education remains underexplored. The existing scholarship indicates that these formal sites of training tend to cultivate the still-largely young, male, and passionate fan-workforce on which games depend. Furthermore, these contexts are vital in the formation of future gamesworker identities that are conservative, uncritical, and risk-adverse, despite pervasive discourses of creativity and innovation linked to them. Vitally, however, the question of how these norms relate to shifting work realities has yet to be explored.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper sheds light on the hidden interdependence in unboxing videos by examining brown cardboard boxes and the mechanism of “brown-boxing” through one extravagant unboxing video by makeup influencer Roxette Arisa on YouTube. I use brown boxes to illustrate the entanglement between digital influencer media and supply chain. Brown boxes are integral sites to explore the operating mechanisms and aesthetics of digital capitalism. Similar to how black-boxing signals the practice of hiding information/labor, and masking operation in technology, brown-boxing points to the mechanisms of concealment across capitalist sectors along the supply chain. Although supply chain is rarely discussed, logistical labor and/as infrastructure do unexpectedly show up in influencer media. These linkages sometimes unintentionally seep into audiovisual media. Perhaps the most unexpected scene takes place when Arisa’s filming of the unboxing video is interrupted by a doorbell ring with the delivery of more boxes by a UPS worker. From the off-frame interaction captured and remain visible briefly in this unboxing video, we feel the presence of the delivery worker. Examining brown boxes and the process of brown-boxing is to think through the containerization of supply chain capitalism. Brown boxes and black boxes are typically discussed in separate spaces, with the former attracting scholars of logistics/supply chains whereas the latter appealing to scholars of digital media/communication. My analysis of the materialities of unboxing video adds to the conversation around the overlapping of infrastructures and the labor that sustain the operation of these infrastructures.</jats:p>",

However, it is unclear how APIs tie into the power of, and governance by, large digital platforms. This paper traces the relationality between Facebook’s APIs, platform governance, and data strategy based on an empirical and evolutionary analysis. It examines a large corpus of (archived) developer pages and API reference documentation to determine the technicity of platform governance – the technical dimension and dynamics of how and what platforms like Facebook seek to govern. It traces how Facebook Platform evolved into a complex layered and interconnected governance arrangement, wherein technical API specifications serve to enforce (changes to) platform policy and (data) strategy. Finally, the paper discusses the significance of this technicity in specifying the material conditions for app and business development on top of platforms and for maintaining infrastructural and evolutive power over their ecosystems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper argues that existential-materialism is a useful generative tool for feminist games, media, internet, and cultural researchers to investigate how people cope (or do not cope) with the hegemony of the new gaming public as it crucially apprehends the medium of videogames as part of people’s lifeworlds embedded in materiality rather than separate from everyday life. Contributing to the emerging field of Feminist Game Studies, this research seeks to intervene into the hegemonic culture fostered and maintained by the ‘new gaming public’ which has become tied to the persistent imaginary of ‘Gamers’ as predominantly young males. Using qualitative mixed-methods to gather empirical data through fieldwork, surveys, and semi-structured interviews, this research presents a sociological examination of everyday struggles within (and against) hegemonic systems of oppression, reporting on how people are coping (or not coping) with exacerbated forms of sexism, racism, and homophobia pervasive across their digitally entangled and materially embedded lifeworlds. In the discipline of Game Studies, the methods of investigation are frequently configured around the study of play, players, or the creation of play; however, we must take greater stock of people’s lifeworlds, including non-players, non-play relationship dynamics, and non-play centric spaces in our intersubjective relations to videogames and beyond the hegemonic new gaming public.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Within a patriarchal, caste-based and restrictive family setup, how do gender and class work together to shape adolescent girls’ access to mobile phones in Mumbai, India? How do adolescent girls mediate their own independent aspirations and desires to variously fit within or subvert these frameworks of class stability and social morality? This paper addresses these question by using a mixed-methods study of 59 group interviews and 278 surveys with adolescents aged 13-15 in Mumbai. Taking an intersectional analytical framework, the findings show how gender and class together, create varying standards of respectable femininity and class distinction that families aspire to and cultivate in adolescent girls. The mobile phone can be seen as both a threat and a necessity to the maintenance of these standards of respectability, resulting in families variously enabling or constraining access to mobile phones by girls. Rather than interpreting the findings through binaries of lower-class/upper-class or empowered/constrained, I instead consider how classed ideals of respectable femininity create different aspirational conditions for girls belonging to each class group, and form the cultural frames of everyday life. I explore what implications this might have for adolescents girls’ understandings and enactments of independence, and how they use the site of the mobile phone to make these enactments.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE PROMISES, PROBLEMS, AND POSSIBILITIES FOR ALT-NETWORKS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Promises, Problems, and Possibilities for Alt-Networks Introduction Social media has become a central facet of contemporary life and that centralization has narrowed our perspectives and lessened our possibilities (Pariser, 2011; Vaidhyanathan, 2018). This centralizing of social media networks happens for their individual users, but also at the level of how social media informs our discourses through journalistic practice, government institutions, industry sectors. Because of the role that social media now play, we have become acutely aware of their shortcomings. Their platforms not only host but actively cultivate toxic and abusive environments for many of its users. In addition to their functions of interaction, they also provide avenues for increasing governmental control through surveillance or gatekeeping. Given the lack of adequate response from tech companies to these long standing issues, it was inevitable that something had to happen. In response to these conditions, tech advocates, activists, students, and scholars have launched numerous alternatives to mainstream social networks. These networks rethink what social media can and should do in times of over reliance on monolithic digital platforms. Some networks redesign the user’s experience to lessen or eliminate harassment; some networks focus on data privacy responsibilities; some create spaces where non-centralized networks can persist even against oppressive governmental regimes. Given the rise and differentiation of alt-networks, there is a need to study and examine the proliferation of alt-networks. This panel offers four presentations varied in objects, different in methodological approaches, and diverse in their claims. In examining alt-networks, this panel will explore how these redesigned digital platforms respond to demands of scalability, how political activists develop and deploy alt-networks for protests, how researchers could cultivate a games theory approach to studying alt-networks and, finally, how the lack of certain features in alt-networks may doom their survival. The methods being explored will include critical theory, social science research, methodological discussion, and critical analysis through a rhetorical lens. Ultimately, our panel hopes to join in on emerging conversations about the ecology of networks and contribute valuable insights for internet research. A Network of Alt-Networks These papers have been carefully assembled to represent a substantial spectrum of the promises, problems, and possibilities for Alt-Tech today. In the first presentation, the paper develops a games theory approach to studying alt-networks, in this case, Mastodon instances. This is an important development as mainstream social media networks have benefited from years of research approaches, new networked objects create new networked questions requiring new methodological considerations. Related to this problem, the second presentation examines how and when alt-networks engage or resist the inevitable need to scale their operations. Such a study is important because mainstream social media impose a will to scale in ways that make it seem natural and unstoppable. The third presentation engages activists and how ad hoc alt-networks allow for platforms that avoid and leverage themselves against oppressive regimes. Finally, the fourth presentation will explore why alt-networks have so far failed alt-right political actors. This argument will look at how micro-interactions on platforms inform and drive a dangerous cycle of political antagonism. As a set, these presentations will give AoIR attendees a comprehensive survey of sites, methods, and sources for engaging and analyzing alt-networks. While the papers all draw heavily on critical theory and analysis, each differs in how they approach their objects of analysis. Using technical approaches, social science methods, speculative means, and rhetorical analysis the papers also demonstrate a wide swath of ways to encounter the alt-network. Finally, the sourcing and discourse engaged by each presentation activates multiple academic discussions while also sticking close to shared themes and concerns. The Possibilities of Alt-Networks This panel builds on recent work concerning the disappointment with mainstream social networks but also the promise of alternatives (Gehl, 2015, Tufekci, 2017). The adherence to tech industry’s unfair labor practices, the inability to respond to users’ needs, the lack of clear and consistent privacy responsibilities, the weak submission to governmental control— these concerns with social media have all been written (Noble, 2018; Roberts, 2019). The rise and proliferation of Alt-Networks is an important development for internet researchers because those innovations rekindle the earliest aims of the internet itself. Namely, the construction of a system whose topological configurations resisted centralization and allowed for its users to develop multiple ways of communicating knowledge to one another.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>My forthcoming book (MIT Press), Virtually Amish, is an ethnographic study of the adoption, design and use of digital communication technologies among members of Old Order Amish communities. This paper explores a section of the book focusing on Amish strategies for internet management. These strategies are in place to protect Amish communities from perceived negative impacts of technologically mediated connectivity. Today it is increasingly common for the Amish to adopt computers, the internet and mobile devices in calculated ways to remain competitive in business. Often the use of these devices blends into the personal sphere as well. This research is notable for its empirical observations that show shared values are key to determining patterns of technology use in Amish communities. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with thought-leaders (business and religious leaders) in Indiana Amish settlements. Findings show that the Amish consider their own cultural, social, political and religious autonomy in deciding how to engage with a broader social and economic system as technologies are essential to the mediation of these relationships.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contextualizes an alternative perspective to a common\n        academic discourse that ethnic media in the West provide a voice for the marginalized from\n        the original bourgeois public sphere. The paper investigates an emergent industry –\n        news-focused WeChat Official Accounts (hereafter WOAs) in Australia. The WOA is an\n        information broadcasting feature launched on WeChat in August 2013 and then adopted by\n        Australian-Chinese media entrepreneurs to produce and circulate the ethno-specific news\n        stories among the Chinese diaspora in Australia and even beyond. From 2019 to 2020, I\n        interviewed 24 media professionals to understand the internal working of news-focused WOAs\n        in Australia. I argue that the anatomy of these Chinese-language digital media organizations\n        reveals their financial independence from the nation-state in contrast to Australian\n        hegemonic taxpayer-sponsored media. Contrary to many media scholars have argued,\n        news-focused WOAs do not completely represent antithetical voices to Australian English\n        media. The commercial imperative does not translate well into agonistic pluralism.\n        News-focused WOAs are attached to the hegemonic journalism and internalize interethnic\n        racism alongside white supremacist discourse against black people in order to be part of the\n        dominant media structure.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Initiated by Greta Thunberg and carried by students who skip school\n        every Friday to call for climate justice and the safeguarding of their future,\n        FridaysForFuture emerged and proliferated along with both recognition and criticism. This\n        study analyzes diffusion dynamics and connectivity formation in the German-speaking\n        #FridaysForFuture network from its emergence to its expansion. Based on a diffusion network\n        and cascade analysis (N = 238,458), it presents how different diffusion dynamics facilitated\n        the emergence of #FridaysForFuture on Twitter. According to findings, FFF activists and\n        organizations are the leading intermediaries and activators for movement diffusion. Most of\n        the tweets in #FridaysForFuture are about activism, introducing the movement, and calling\n        for action. During the development, news, liberal left, and right-wing actors joined,\n        bringing discussions about the movement, the youth, and leading activists to the\n        Twittersphere. While cascades by FFF clusters were more likely to gain attention and spread\n        farther, faster, and deeper, cascades activated by right-wing actors were greater, but not\n        broader, faster, or deeper. In contrast to the reciprocal reposting activities between\n        left-wing and activist groups, right-wing actors are relatively isolated, expressing\n        criticism of the movement. This study shows that the German-speaking #FridaysForFuture\n        network serves as a facilitator of offline movements and features a public arena of\n        political discourses. Through the mobilization endeavors of FFF clusters, engagement of\n        left-wing hubs, and the counter-public of right-wing actors attacking the movement, it\n        gained continuity and momentum to flourish.</jats:p>",

Such an acknowledgement is foundational to a decolonialist ethical point of view from which I argue for an understanding of space as relational practice, as resource, and as source of identity. A genuinely decolonized cyberspace that promotes the independence of colonized peoples is one that is subject to Indigenous spatial practices including territorial claims and treaty rights and so is one that is recognized as existing within space in a material way.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores how Danish citizens experience digital health\n        data and how these in turn affect their understanding of digital health data and their\n        self-understanding as a patient. Previous research on digital health data examines primarily\n        opportunities and challenges as well as structural effects concluding that having access to\n        one's medical data is generally beneficial for patients but also comes with literacy\n        challenges. The aim of this research is to look deeper into personal experiences with\n        digital health data in order to understand what is at stake when people become digitally\n        mapped patients and how experiences of empowerment, independence, perplexity, and doubt\n        intermingle when reading one’s own health data. Taking a user’s view, the paper draws\n        theoretically on the concept of ‘assemblage’ understanding digital health data as a complex\n        nexus of user-data relationships. The empirical analysis draws on 16 in-depth purposefully\n        sampled interviews that have been coded thematically. The primary analysis shows that\n        digital health data creates unique, deeply emotional experiences that lead towards a variety\n        of existential questions. Combining the theoretical lens with the empirical analysis this\n        paper contributes with what we call ‘health assemblages’ that highlight the emerging\n        relationships and personal emotional attachments users make with their digital health data.\n        In conclusion, it can be stated that seeing oneself mapped in data creates unique\n        experiences, often challenging the self-understanding of the patient.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the algorithmic imaginaries associated with\n        Uber's surge pricing, a central mediator of Uber drivers' labor experience. Surge pricing\n        can be described as an algorithmically driven mechanism that uses price adjustments as\n        financial incentives to redistribute the workforce on a territory. Inspired by Critical\n        Algorithm Studies, we argue that this mechanism of governance is not passively incorporated\n        by drivers and that their everyday encounters with surge pricing algorithms are productive\n        of imaginaries and valid forms of knowledge that orient their practices. We approach this by\n        mapping and analyzing how popular Brazilian Uber drivers on YouTube (the “UberTubers”, as we\n        propose) discuss surge pricing in their channels. Based on 59 videos about surge pricing\n        posted at the seven most popular Brazilian Ubertuber’s channels, we outline three main\n        topics approached: (a) What is surge pricing and what does it do?; (b) Tactics to benefit\n        from surge pricing; (c) Algorithmic Labor as a laboratory. Among our findings, we identified\n        that some Ubertubers produce and share their own visual inscriptions to explain how surge\n        pricing works. Through the engagement with their audience, Ubertubers collectivize their\n        experiences and imaginations potentially transforming how various other drivers incorporate\n        surge pricing into their own tactics and daily routines. These channels provide us with\n        something similar to an “archive” of surge pricing’s many versions and facets and offer us\n        the opportunity to learn how algorithms are perceived and how they shape labor on a\n        micropolitical level.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on content\n        moderation by focusing on its practice in relation to localized social media contexts, an\n        area which remains under-researched. It makes two key contributions. Firstly, it presents\n        the results of a study on moderation practices in relation to place-named Facebook groups\n        across Greater London. Drawing on in-depth interviews with administrators and moderators\n        from 16 Facebook groups, we focus on exploring how such administrators and moderators\n        negotiate an apparent ‘orientational’ tension between ‘translocality’ and ‘locality’. On the\n        one hand, we explore how administrators and moderators oriented partly to what might be\n        understood as the 'translocal' space of Facebook as a platform. On the other hand, we also\n        sought to understand how such administrators and moderators orient to the localised\n        situation surrounding the place-named Facebook group. Our second key contribution aligns\n        with the conference theme on co-dependence and social media, outlining a conceptual approach\n        for researching the geographical contexts or ‘place’ of content moderation more broadly. We\n        emphasize the inherent, practical locality of content moderation. Drawing on a long\n        tradition of relational approaches in human geography, cultural anthropology and philosophy,\n        we conceptualize ‘locality’ as something produced through practical action, rather being\n        pre-given, specific geographical locations. Approaching the place or context of content\n        moderation relationally, rather than via geographical scales such as local or global, might\n        not only provide a more context sensitive approach, but also, underline the limits of\n        large-scale moderation, whether by platforms or governments, or through human or algorithmic\n        interventions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines Google’s green discourse in relation to the\n        ecomodernist movement and $2 . In recent years, tech companies such as Google have taken a\n        more explicit position as actors in the ‘fight’ against the climate crisis. Tech companies\n        often suggest technological innovation as a necessity to deal with the climate crisis,\n        thereby attempting to develop a form of ‘green platform capitalism’ that presents us with a\n        better, greener version of its business model. This paper presents a rhetorical analysis of\n        a selection of the corporate discourse (2019-now) in which Google presents its environmental\n        efforts, in order to understand how the company frames the relation between technology and\n        nature. It argues that technology-nature relations are framed through ‘decoupling’, a term\n        derived from the ecomodernist movement that functions as a rhetorical strategy to highlight\n        positive connections between technology and nature and obscure uneasy connections. Through\n        decoupling, Google is able to present its wish to save ‘nature’ without discussing its use\n        of nature, thus legitimating green platform capitalism. Decoupling, the paper concludes,\n        thus allows Google to create a narrative of green growth as the only logical way for\n        humanity to move forward. While this narrative might be attractive, it does not question the\n        feasibility of decoupling and conflicts with resolutions that centralize degrowth as answer\n        to the climate crisis.</jats:p>",

I argue that the desire for networked photography that animates the\n        assemblage of installations, artists, visitors, curators, camera technologies and social\n        networking sites, alters ideas of space and place, and object production and meaning making.\n        I approach the selfie and everyday networked photography as a form of self-expression,\n        labour (Abidin 2016), locative media (Hess 2015), embodied socialisation (Frosh 2015) and a\n        mode of photography that collapses binaries of subject/object, spectator/operator and\n        curated image/curator (Frosh 2015, Senft and Baym 2015). I use qualitative digital methods,\n        interviews, audiovisual documentation and autoethnography.

    "title": "MANAGING BOUNDARIES WHILE WORKING FROM HOME, 1960-PRESENT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been heralded as a watershed moment for remote work, an exodus of the American workforce that will never fully reverse. As major corporations debate returning to the office full-time, and other workers press or are pressed into returning to the office, this panel situates the present realities of remote work within telework’s long history. From the paperless office to the electronic cottage, much of the focus in mainstream discourses surrounding telework has been on demonstrating the technological feasibility of leaving workers at home and workforce adaptability, with secondary celebrations of ecological soundness and potential for employment growth. Discourses around the benefit of telework also frequently draw on blanket statements about what remote work affords workers—from wellness and eschewing commute times, to increasing flexibility—but do not directly take up the lived quotidian experiences of doing labor in this configuration. This panel intervenes by yoking the politics and fantasies of remote work with worker experience during work from home, especially of self-management of both individual affect, group and power dynamics, and environment. Within this frame, this collection of papers suggests that, while remote work suggests a dislocation of office and home and the creation of a third space, the overlays of work and home are always top of mind for individual workers, whether in their homes with children or while traveling as “digital nomads.” The panel suggests that navigating this collapse creates a “third space,” and is a site of ever-present negotiation for workers, both individually and in social dynamics across organizations. This panel works across a number of methods including ethnography, archival research of both born-digital and traditional objects and draws on interviews and survey data. The panel points to not only how workers act in front of the screen, but what is supporting remote work off and behind it: domestic architectures, impression management, and paid and unpaid forms of domestic labor. The panel opens with a pair of papers that look at the historical development of work from home in order to situate the COVID-19 pandemic and its use of remote work as both a form of rupture and as a continuation of the logics, fantasies, and environments that pre-date this massive and rapid expansion into remote work. In “Home/Work: The Long History of the Future of Work,” Devon Powers reads the history of progress and futural narratives attached to telework, and the renovations both material and ideological to the spaces that are enfolded into remote work: home and the office. Powers pays special attention to the collapse of work and home, and the creation of a third space that is actually only an expansion of an existing one—the everywhere office. In “Make It Work: Hiding Children in Telework,” Hannah Zeavin takes up the feminization of remote work, which is subtended by the fantasy that, by working from home, women might “have it all”: they can do childcare and paid labor at once. Zeavin examines how workers have negotiated this collapse of waged and unwaged labor by disappearing and hiding the visual and sonic evidence of children during work from home. Nancy Baym et al look to the management of the worker’s own visibility in “Video On/Off: Managing Visibility in Remote Videoconferencing” with 44% of American workers suddenly home in the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors ran a five-month longitudinal diary study of meetings at a large technology company between April and August 2020, comprised of 849 employees. The paper looks at reasons for (dis)comfort with appearing on camera during work and how workers negotiate the contradictions of on and off. In “Abruptly Online: Public Employees’ Adaptation to Virtual Communication in Times of Crisis,\" Sierra Bray and Cynthia Barboza-Wilkes consider the special category of public employees and the challenges and benefits of work from home in a group of workers who had a novel relationship to working online. Andrea Alarcon, in “Outsourcing the Home: the Digital Nomad Tactic ” looks at the apotheosis of work from home in the rise of the “digital nomad.” Alarcon intervenes by pointing to the unacknowledged support and costs of “nomadic life” in the city of Medellin and the workers who travel and collapse the identities of tourist and laborer, and vacation with work.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data journalism (DJ) fosters audience independence. It encourages\n        content exploration through visualizations, storytelling, and direct access to data sources.\n        DJ assists the audience to be well informed, cognitively active, and contribute to the\n        public sphere. Achieving this objective indicates the audience's independence. How\n        independent is the audience of DJ? This question is answered based on the level of\n        engagement of the audience. A low level of engagement prevents the audience from helping\n        each other to interpret the dominant meaning and to identify its deficiencies. When the\n        audience is engaged, they are able to reframe the message from a new perspective,\n        challenging their understanding of the message. By analyzing the audience engagement levels\n        and comparing different types of journalism we gain insight into audience behavior. We found\n        a significant correlation between DJ audience engagement and time. This trend may be\n        explained by the steep learning curve of DJ, which requires a special set of skills, in\n        addition to the willingness to analyze and discuss interpretations with others. On the basis\n        of the trend, we can conclude that over time, the audience became familiar with DJ and\n        adopted it. Results could contribute to the realization of the internet's original promise\n        to make the general public independent by providing free access to information.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study addresses the complex matrix of gendered visual interdependence/ independence of Arab women social media influencers, defined as micro-celebrities generating digital incomes. It takes Instagram and TikTok, image and video sharing platforms, as a case to illustrate examples of Arab women’s curated visual identities. The study synthesises feminist transnationalism and visual inquiry. Transnationalism refers not only to the movement and exchanges of consumer items, languages, practices and peoples across national borders, but it is also a research agenda concerned with the situated perspectives of social actors backgrounded by mainstream scholarship. Feminist transnationalism is synthesised with ‘inquiry graphics’ as a semiotic move to ask critical questions about images. This offers a unique contribution to feminist visual social media scholarship, both contextually and theoretically. The study reveals Arab women’s positionalities as occurring in simultaneously interdependent and independent relationships to commercial Western practices. Examples include the influencer @amyroko, from Saudi Arabia with 1.5 million followers, who wears a niqab (facial veil) as she promotes make-up brands while never showing her face online. @amyroko’s posts are mediated via TikTok and Instagram’s affordances for synthetic embodiment and involve remixing American rap, hip-hop, reggaeton beats, her own dance moves and defiant stance of Arab feminist positionality. However, this is not a form of cultural appropriation but a reconfiguration of localised subjectivities. Overall, theorising reveals Arab women’s curatorial identities as consecutively interdependent/ independent within broader hyper-inequalities, systemic and local patriarchal oppression. This disrupts fixed conceptions of Arab women’s positionalities and goes beyond theoretical essentialism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With early-childhood mobile media device use on the rise, online\n        video content plays an ever-increasing role in children’s lives. Of the wide variety of\n        content available to children, user-produced videos on YouTube seem to be most popular.\n        However, due to the platform’s size and the overwhelming number of child-targeted videos\n        found on YouTube, scholars have been struggling with how to approach and study this topic.\n        This study aims to address the gap in research by analyzing prevalent user-produced\n        children’s videos on YouTube, with research questions focusing on video genres, their\n        features, and content themes. Drawing on YouTube’s popularity-measurements and video\n        recommendation algorithm, a corpus of 100 user-produced videos targeted to children was\n        assembled. A content analysis of these videos led to the identification and\n        conceptualization of 13 distinct genres of user-produced children’s videos: unboxing,\n        surprise eggs, finger family, play-doh, nursery rhymes, kids songs, learning, pretend play\n        (enactment), pretend play (toys), storytelling, arts &amp; crafts, entertainer in character,\n        and process repetition. Furthermore, the findings indicate that there are often unique\n        interplays between genre type and the content, the production format, and the overall\n        quality and educational rating. In addition to shedding light on the importance of studying\n        child-targeted content on YouTube, this study’s main contribution is a typological map of\n        the user-produced children’s video ecosystem that future studies from various fields can\n        draw on.</jats:p>",

Latinas in the United States\n        have traditionally worked in blue-collar information technology sectors characterized by\n        repetitive labor and low-wages, such as electronics manufacturing and customer service.\n        Latinas information service workers, though fundamental to technoscience, have been largely\n        invisible in histories of computing. Latina virtual assistants mark a shift in this labor\n        history by relying on the strategic visibility of Latina identity in/as the technology\n        interface.

We find continuities between the ways Latinas have historically been\n        positioned as “ideal” information workers, and the use of Latina identity in the design of\n        virtual assistants. We argue that the strategic visibility of Latina virtual assistants is\n        linked to the oppressive structures of invisibility that have traditionally organized Latina\n        information service workers.</jats:p>",

We examine the media coverage around the project, which includes the online\n        blogs of the project’s participants. Using critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA)\n        as a guiding methodology, we consider simultaneously the feminist, activist framing and the\n        influence of material and digital platforms on the cultural influence of the work (Brock\n        2018).

Analyzing Reddit’s moderation structure shows that both the human moderation and the algorithmic moderation reinforce a form of anti-politics which leaves users feeling like they have no input and thus no interest in the well-being of the subreddits in which they participate. Online governance structures are largely top down and authoritarian in nature, despite often being couched in democratic rhetoric, reflecting what Jacques Rancière describes as a hatred of democracy. By looking at the example of how r/Canada came to be widely disparaged on Reddit as a bastion of hate, I make the argument that the key to rooting out online hate is not through more human moderation or by giving algorithms more control, but by creating a democratic culture of buy-in through which users are empowered with responsibility for the quality of content in a discussion space.</jats:p>",

This exposition is facilitated by collecting, categorising and analysing selected comments from Rhaze’s top videos. The comments were analysed through discourse analysis, paying special attention to the factors that influence digital media practices. The findings reveal that competing comments are shaped by postcolonial views on a gendered, racialized and class-based body in an interracial relationship. We then coin the term ‘online sisterhood’, reflecting the shared support that women nurture with other women through online practices. Ultimately, online sisterhood displays how Filipino women married to a white foreign national generate and negotiate spaces of mutual support in a neoliberal state. Paradoxically, a neoliberal government benefits from such cross-border and mediated mobility of Filipina migrants through the commodification of their everyday life. It is through this point that we argue for a closer evaluation of the role of ‘online sisterhoods’ in the construction of female subjectivity and imaginaries of mobility in the Global South.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over 700 million people worldwide are socializing and spending time, sometimes significant amounts, in online multiplayer games, and these social spaces can be important sites of community. Unfortunately, levels of civility, aggression, and mutual helping can vary significantly between game spaces. Given their ubiquity and importance in so many people’s lives, it is critical to understand how a prosocial community can be created and maintained over time in these spaces for those who want them. This research uses virtual ethnography and interpretive phenomenological analysis to examine how moderation and community development strategies, game design elements, and player behaviours are experienced and can be influenced by players in prosocially-oriented online multiplayer Minecraft servers. It is clear that it is the prosocial orientation of players and the commitment, social skill, and integrity of server moderators that is most key to creating and maintaining a prosocial gaming environment and that although game design can support prosociality, game design factors appear to be much less important overall. Attracting the right players—and refusing entry to the wrong ones—is the most important concern.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper offers an analytical framework to critically examine the power relations that structure the online platform ecosystem. Following a relational understanding of power, it focuses on the connections between the five leading platform corporations - Alphabet-Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft (GAFAM) - and the many other digital properties (i.e. platforms, websites, and apps) that populate the online ecosystem. Exploring these connections, we notice that a growing number of digital properties are integrated with, and increasingly dependent on the infrastructural services offered by the GAFAM platforms. These services include: advertising networks, login services, cloud hosting, app stores, payment systems, data analytics, video hosting, geospatial and navigation services, search functionalities, and operating systems. Such infrastructural services allow a wide variety of companies to make their products and services available online, attract and target users, analyze their activities, and generate revenue. It is through the ubiquitous integration and consistent use of these infrastructural services that platform power emerges and is consolidated. To demonstrate how such power relations can be analyzed, the paper highlights two key infrastructural services: app stores and ad networks. For each service it discusses two levels of analysis that can be pursued to gain insight in the workings of platform power. Ultimately a systematically analysis of the key infrastructural services will need to be developed to arrive at a refined taxonomy of platform power relations. Such taxonomy is essential to establish guidelines for governing the platform ecosystem in correspondence with key public values.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the United Kingdom, there are over 150 individual YouTubers with &gt;1 million subscribers. A significant proportion of their audience are aged between 13-18 years. The content they produce is often: commercially sponsored, unregulated and both purposefully and accidentally touches on a whole range of health topics including: mental health, alcohol, sexual health, body image, healthy eating and physical activity. YouTubers could represent a particularly relatable source of health information for young people as a magnified version of young people’s own searchable and replicable online socially networked lives. The aim of the research is to explore the role that professional YouTubers play in young people health behaviours and identities in the UK. The study was a four stage, sequential mixed methods design. The first stage, a school based questionnaire (n=931, 13-18 years) quantified young people’s YouTuber engagement and provided a sampling frame for the later qualitative stages. An online analysis of 7 UK YouTubers examined the health content they produced. Focus groups (n=7, 85 participants) with 13-18 year olds explored the impact this content had on young people’s health behaviours and interviews with professional YouTubers ( &lt;1 million subscribers, ongoing) explored their perceived role in health promotion. YouTuber produced health content appeared to be a recognized source of health information for young people in this study. Young people appeared able to critique the accuracy and commercial influences on YouTuber content. However, this content still appears to be a relatable way of sharing health experiences, giving advice and communicating social norms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This presentation examines the social media campaign #SupportIslandWomen that was undertaken by reproductive rights activists in Prince Edward Island (PEI). The initiative gained popularity in 2016 due to both the off- and online circulation of posters throughout PEI landmarks depicting the Green Gables-like image of a young girl (“rogue Anne”) wearing red braids and a bandana. These posters showcased specific hashtags that encouraged debates on various online platforms. For this study, we underline how human actors invoked the symbolic ‘figure’ of rogue Anne to give weight to their own arguments by speaking or acting in her name. By ‘figure’, we mean any symbolic entity that is materialized through interaction and that possesses agency, or the ability to make a significant difference in interaction. Hence, our study examines the processes through which rogue Anne was made present in interaction, the role of digital (online) and physical (offline) affordances in the materialization of this figure, and the differentiated effects that these invocations generated. To do so, we build our dataset by performing non-participant observation on social media platforms and by exploring Canadian blogs and newspapers. Drawing from organizational discourse theory, our results show that invoking the figure of rogue Anne allowed for pro-choice collectives to assert their authority in abortion debates by labelling the fictional character as a modern feminist icon. They also underline the importance of studying the intervention of symbolic figures, their effects, and their materialization within political initiatives that incorporate and go beyond the practice of ‘hashtagging’.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this panel we consider how social actors situate uses of technologies within systems of moral norms and values while at the same time compelling the creation of new ones. Popular discourse tends to present dualistic thinking of the positive and negative impacts of technologies. Scholars have engaged with the internet and digital media, emphasising emancipatory subcultures (Coleman 2014; Gehl 2016, 2018) or presenting a critical view of the constraining aspects of networked technologies (Fish &amp; Follis 2019; Fuchs 2014; Lovink 2016). These approaches are complimented by scholarship that considers technological practices and how they are embedded in social and cultural cosmologies (Burrell 2012; Horst &amp; Foster 2018; Miller et. al. 2016). We argue for a closer integration of these bodies of scholarship through an examination of the contentious moral economies operating in emergent social spaces. The panel interrogates the relationship that social, political and economic actors have between their own ideas about what is good, appropriate and right and the diversity of orientations towards trust in techno-bureaucratic systems. We draw attention to immaterial systems and consider the social relationships and individual and collective imaginations that shape the production and experience of networked technologies. Through the papers, we articulate the forms of negotiation, resistance and refusal that occur when diverse moral universes, techno-regulating systems, and the conditions in which people find themselves collide.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been a rise in predictive algorithms that focus on individual preferences and psychometric assessments. The idea is that an individual social media presence may give off unconscious cues or indicators of a person's personality. While there has been a growing body of research into people's reactions, perceptions, and folk theories of how algorithms work, there has been a growing need for research into these hyper-personal algorithms and profiles. This study focuses on a company called CrystalKnows, which purports to have the largest database of personality profiles in the world, many of which are generated without an individual's explicit consent. Through qualitative interviews (n=31) with people after being presented with their own profile, this study explores how people perceive the profiles, where they believe the information is coming from, and what contexts they would be comfortable with their profile being used. Crystal profiles also contain predictions about how people will communicate and potentially work together in teams with people of other personality dispositions, which also raises concerns about inaccurate assessments or discrimination based on these profiles. The findings from this study and how people rationalize these algorithms not only builds on our understanding of algorithmic perception and folk theories, but also has important practical implications for the trust in these systems and the continued deployment of hyper-personal predictive algorithms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As opposed to technocratic and top-to-bottom smart city discourses, open data has been deployed to transform these into “citizen-centric” ones. London is one of the prime examples of such positioning of open data in pursuit to create an alternative to corporate-driven smart city narratives. Prior to this, open data was already a governmental strategy in the UK in their pursuit of Transparency Agenda due to the assumptions that having access to governmental data would automatically yield transparency and accountability. However, shortly after, the economic value in open data displaced the social impact to periphery. As a result, the Open Data Institute (ODI) was established to unlock the economic value in open data. Located at the heart of London’s tech-scene, the ODI has attempted to contest what they referred to as “corporate-driven smart city”. Nevertheless, born out of a discourse in which lucrative potential usurped democratic aspirations, the ODI has subsequently been an environment that materialised, contributed and reiterated the prevailing smart city discourse. By way of a close observation of the ODI’s activities between late 2014 to mid-2017, as well as an analysis on the transformation of UK government's open data discourse, I argue that once advocated as tool for accountability and transparency, open data is mostly promoted for its monetary value.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Media frauds often lead to lively public discussions about journalism’s professional identity and its social mandate. The paper uses the so-called Relotius case as a starting point for a systematic analysis of the responsibility of narrative journalists in an age of “fake news” and post-truth politics – and the question of how they can be held to account in the online realm. Claas Relotius counted as one of the most talented journalistic storytellers in the German-speaking world. In December 2018, however, the news magazine Der Spiegel revealed that he had fabricated many of his texts, either completely or partly. This revelation developed into one of the biggest German media scandals of the recent years and triggered a massive outcry, also in international media. A multi-method research design allows for a differentiated assessment of the Relotius case in particular and web-based media accountability processes in general: A literature review and problem-centered interviews with senior reporters demonstrate that stylistic devices of fiction have a long history in German narrative journalism – also in Spiegel magazine. A discourse analysis focusing on the public debate following the revelation of the scandal points out that many journalistic commenters, including Spiegel’s editorial board, displayed a clear lack of self-criticism in their discussion of the case, while non-professional watchbloggers broadened the scope of the analysis. The paper reflects the empirical results from a normative perspective, in order to illustrate the potentials and shortcomings of professional journalistic self-observation as opposed to external public control in online discourses.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The past decade has seen the accelerated growth and expansion of large-scale data centre operations across the world to support emerging consumer and business data and computation needs. These buildings, as infrastructures responsive to changing global economic and technological terrain, are increasingly modular, and must be built out rapidly. However, these conditions also mean that their paths to obsolescence are shortened, their lifespans dependent on shifting corporate strategies and advances in consumer technology. This paper theorises and empirically explores material, infrastructural abandonment that emerges in this process of data centre construction across different geographical contexts. To do so, we analyse the socio-material construction of an international network of large-scale data centres by global telecom giant Ericsson, and the abrupt abandonment and suspension of one of its nodes in Vaudreuil, Québec in 2017 after only nine months of operation. Employing autoethnography, site visits, and qualitative interviews with data centre architects and staff in Sweden and Canada, we argue that the ruins of abandoned 'cloud' infrastructure represent the disjunction between the 'promise' of digital infrastructure for local communities and the market interests of digital companies. With its focus, the paper takes ruination and discard as perspectives through which to understand the complexity of emergent datafied futures and the socio-technical reshaping of internet infrastructures.</jats:p>",

What are the implications—for us, for our society—as we enter the age of AI writing systems, an era moving rapidly toward a world in which writing is produced mostly by machines rather than humans? What are the ethical implications of these developments? Our research on AI-based writing systems is based on (1) critical analysis of the systems themselves and on (2) interviews with the designers and users of these systems. Our analysis draws from the field of machine ethics, as well as communication/language theory. In our presentation we will discuss several AI-writing systems (e.g., GPT-2, Persado, Quill, Google Compose), focusing especially on the language model or \"informational framework\" (Russo, 2018) that supports their operation. What our research reveals, so far, is that, not surprisingly, these systems are more effective (and ethical) handling well-defined tasks in bounded spaces, with well-established genre conventions, clearly identified audience needs and expectations, and predictable interaction scripts. What we also see is that too often the language models employed are based on a reductive, formalist model of text generation. AI-writing system designers need to move beyond formalist, linear input/output models to more complex social models that account for the broader contexts, including the ethical codes, in which communications arise and circulate.</jats:p>",

    "title": "MASS MEDIA AND THE LEGITIMATION OF INTERNET CONTROL IN RUSSIA: THE CASE OF TELEGRAM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's hyperconnected world, states are confronted with the global challenge of responding to potentially disruptive online communications, such as terrorist propaganda and fake news. Formulating effective internet regulation to address these threats carries the risk of infringing upon media freedom and constitutional rights. In the case of Russia, ostensibly sound legitimations have been instrumentalised to bring about a dramatic decline in internet freedom. Controlling public opinion may well be decisive for Russia's \"success\" in expanding its system of internet controls without arousing popular resistance. Scholarship thus far, however, has neglected to critically examine how the Russian government legitimates and cultivates popular support for restricting online freedom of speech. This paper aims to address this crucial aspect of internet censorship by studying how restrictions of internet freedom, freedom of expression and the right to information and privacy are framed in political and media discourses. The paper presents a case study examining the legitimation of user data storage, surveillance and restriction of online anonymity, on the example of messaging application Telegram. To justify legal measures in these domains, policymakers have framed their proposals as anti-terrorist, or claimed the need to protect personal data from foreign states. Typically, anonymity and privacy are recast as secrecy indicating criminal (e.g., drug dealers) or morally derogatory intent (e.g., paedophilia). The paper analyses how frames are produced by policymakers; how they are translated and disseminated in state and (semi-)independent media; and how they resonate in online debates and social media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The black box around online platforms’ internal governance practices makes it difficult for users to trust that their expression is moderated in ways that are free from arbitrariness and bias. This paper proposes a black box methodology for examining content moderation in practice when only parts of a platform’s regulatory system are visible from the outside. The proposed methodology, which uses content analysis and innovative digital methods to investigate how discrete inputs (i.e. images) produce certain outputs (i.e. whether an image is removed or not removed), is explained through a topical case study into whether like images of Underweight, Mid-Range and Overweight women’s bodies are moderated alike on Instagram. Overall, results show a trend of inconsistent moderation: specifically, up to 22% of 4,994 coded images were removed by Instagram or by the user and are therefore potentially false positives. Moreover, the odds of removal for Underweight, Mid-Range and Overweight images differ. These results suggest that concerns around the risk of arbitrariness and bias on Instagram, and, indeed, ongoing distrust of the platform among users, might not be unfounded. In outlining the proposed methodology, this paper evaluates the methodological, legal and ethical challenges to studying Instagram, many of which are due to the significant lack of transparency around platform governance more broadly. By evaluating these challenges, we can better assess the efficacy of using black box analytics and digital methods to examine important questions around content moderation at scale.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How do users come to trust VPNs? How do they understand end-to-end encrypted messaging technologies? This paper aims to answer these questions by considering VPNs and e2e encryption as boundary objects of the internet pertinent to study (dis)trust in the system. Our aim is to follow Star’s clarification of boundary objects as entities that people act towards (or with) in relation to their own communities of practice via a feminist approach to technology studies, which for Star, linked lived experience, technologies, and silences in ways that proved political. We add to the literature in three ways: empirically unpacking VPNs and e2e encryption as boundary objects that tack back and forth between the technical and abstract, which is novel for the literature; an exegesis of boundary objects ‘on’ the internet to consider conceptualizing objects ‘of’ the internet, which opens a fruitful reconfiguration for internet research; and shedding light on the ways that symbolic registers of technology have profound implications for socio-material practices. Our work suggests the back-and-forth ‘tacking’ of abstract to concrete does not manifest as universal and singular, but is made manifest from multiple community vantage points. This complexification shows how digital objects of the internet feed and are fed by multiple use cases and relational practices across commercial, security, rights based, and identity practices that they underpin, undercut or act upon. Users trusting the politics of one case may miss a need to police the other; we conclude by contextualizing these concerns for future research ‘of’ the internet.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On U.S. Election Day 2016, thousands of people gathered at Susan B. Anthony’s grave in Rochester, NY. They were there to commemorate Anthony’s women’s suffrage activism over a century prior and to celebrate the presidential candidacy of Hilary Clinton, the first woman nominated by a major U.S. American political party. A thirteen-hour livestream of the gravesite by a local journalist captured the unprecedented crowd at the cemetery and drew a much larger crowd online. In the hours before election results were announced, the livestream gained millions of viewers and thousands of comments. While existing research has begun to examine the complex relationship between personal and collective memory, memorialization, and social media, less attention has been devoted to the ways that history and politics become tools for users and professionals to represent themselves. I examine the gravesite livestream as an illustrative case study of the ways that actors with different levels of access and control over a media event use commemoration as a vehicle for political self-representation. I conducted a textual analysis of the entire livestream, including the video and comment feeds. Through the analysis, I traced how four actors built upon a shared collective vision of U.S. American women’s history and future to contribute to the livestream and find themselves within it, including the city mayor’s office, gravesite visitors, the journalist who captured the stream, and commenters. Ultimately, I suggest that in commemorating women’s historical political action, these self-representational narratives present livestream creators, viewers, and subjects as political actors.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Instagram is the place for the visualization of everything, from travel and food to abstract concepts such as compassion or freedom. While visualizing the abstract is not new, the platform has introduced a bottom-up process where users co-produce image repertoires that shape the boundaries of the imaginable. In this paper, we address an unexplored question about this process: which visual repertoires are associated with value-related terms on Instagram? We studied twenty widely used value hashtags, sampling the top 100 posts for each of them (N=2000). A combined qualitative-quantitative content analysis revealed that 19 of the 20 hashtags possessed a distinct visual footprint. These watermarks shared an orientation towards the self and an emphasis on consumption. We conclude by discussing three implications of our findings: the power of images to narrow the imagination of values, the distinction between “internalized” and “externalized” value depictions, and the meta-value of “aestheticized consumption” on Instagram.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper identifies different layers of “networked privacy,\" expanding the original concept's focus on (1) networked relations (Marwick and boyd, 2014) to further include (2) networked technologies, (3) networked institutions, and (4) networked data. It teases out various moments of “collision of information norms” or “context collapse” (Marwick and boyd, 2014, p. 1054), which complicate privacy and regulations thereof in recent years. As we are at a critical juncture where information norms are being enshrined in different parts of the world including the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the U.S., understanding complex layers of context collapses can shed light on the legal grey areas that would need further examination. This study investigated the U.S. news coverage on digital privacy between January 2018 and June 2020 to explore any layers/moments of “context collapses” with regard to privacy. I conducted a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (Fairclough, 2013), closely examining 300 samples out of 5,874 articles. Rethinking the framework of “networked privacy,” I argue, can help us ensure the \"similar minimum levels of privacy\" (Regan, 1996) across networked relations, technologies, institutions, and data in the current digital era.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over social media’s first decade, we as users grew to trust that platforms play a role as memory machines: they enable us to share and store our media traces to look back on later, as we remember and make sense of our lives. But not all platforms last forever. What happens when social media platforms are, to borrow a business term, sunsetted? This paper investigates how platforms end, and how people remember them after they are gone. I first conducted a thematic analysis of 20 sunset posts: the final declaration of what a platform has been. I discovered that this genre of communication is designed to spark a sense of loss for the platform that was, and trust in the people who are moving on to new projects. This opened up further questions about if people remember dead platforms, and if so, how they remember them. Responses to a survey of social media users about a platform they used to use that no longer exists will undergo a thematic analysis to identify common themes and patterns in terms of online remembering, nostalgia, archiving, and forgetting. As social media platforms are a relatively new form of media, this research project aims to gain an understanding of how people shift from platform to platform, and how media traces and platforms are remembered and forgotten.</jats:p>",

The concept speaks to and critically builds upon notions of ‘networked individualism’ (Rainie &amp; Wellman, 2012), ‘network sociality’ (Wittel 2001) and ‘mediated mobilism’ (Hartmann 2013) to conceptualize productive ways of studying the social lives inherent in digitally mediated structures, subjectivities and practices of mobility. The four ethnographic papers on this panel develop this emerging concept through important topics including migration, experience, temporality, and precarity. In addressing the phenomena of people on the move and the role (or not) of mobile media in everyday instances of mobility and sociality, this panel contributes to a broader understanding of differing types of ‘mobile figures’ in networked times.</jats:p>",

A preliminary analysis of the data finds participants engage in narrative rationalizations to help them navigate the cultural expectations of online engagement within a surveilled environment.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we trace the rhythmicities of activity tracking by applying the method of technograhical collaborative autoethnography (cf. Bucher, 2012; Chang, Hernandez &amp; Ngunjiri, 2012). The focus is on on proactive self-tracking that has become a proliferating digital media practice involving the gathering of data about the body and one’s everyday patterns of being outside the context of clinical health care. In the paper, we address the gap that still exists in research of exploring the mechanisms by and through which the human-technology attachments operate in practice. Drawing from a new materialist understanding of media technologies combined with Lefebvrian rhytmanalysis, we focus on the rhythmic aspects of self-tracking by asking how specific self-tracking devices and interfaces attract and prescribe repetition, rhythms, beats, pulses, and cycles into everyday lives. In so doing, we elaborate how human bodies and technical systems of self-tracking interact rhythmically. The analysis sheds light on the rhythms and beats that we interpret as illustrations of the ’technological unconscious’ (Thrift &amp; French, 2002). We bring our observations in dialogue with the contemporary critical arguments pointing to the design of products that are made as addictive as possible in the race for ‘hijacking minds’ and capturing attention. Our research contributes empirically to the lack of research that has systematically examined these seductive and yet controlling properties of software, and complements the theory of rhythmanalysis with theorization on the hierarchical organisation of rhythms and related power dynamics in the digital context.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The increased digitalisation of society has profoundly changed the circumstances for people with a sexual interest in children to engage in the production, distribution and consumption of child abuse material. In addition, digital technologies enable contact and communication with other like-minded individuals sharing the same sexual interest in children and also facilitate new forms of getting in contact with children (potential victims). Child abuse material (sometimes also referred to as child pornography) refers to documented material depicting the sexual abuse and/or sexual exploitation of a child (or children). The overall purpose with this study is to explore the practices where crime investigations of child abuse material occur within the Swedish police authority. This research in progress paper will reflect on what challenges and opportunities police officers do encounter when investigating child abuse material in relation to digital technologies? The involved technology will be investigated in relation to technological affordance and empirically the study is based upon qualitative interviews with police officers.</jats:p>",

    "title": "RACING THE PLATFORM/PLATFORMING RACE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Race and racism are enduring structural forces that have a hand in virtually every aspect of society; the internet and its vast array of platforms, applications, devices, and cultures are well within their grasp (Nakamura and Chow-White, 2013; Brock, 2020). The papers on this panel trouble, question, and reorient notions of how race comes to matter in our contemporary digital landscape. We build on scholarship that explores how content creators make sense of their relationships to audiences, their contested digital labor, and the centrality of identity to their (im)material work (eg: Baym, 2018; Abidin, 2018; Senft, 2008). Indeed, as critical internet researchers interested in “the lively, animated machines of today’s internet”, we argue that an examination of influencers, microcelebrity, and virality that explicitly attends to race and racism is sorely needed. This panel brings together a diverse group of interdisciplinary (anthropology, sociology, media and communication, game studies, queer studies, and feminist studies) scholars working in the United States and Australia, who engage in empirical and theoretical research on microcelebrity and influencer cultures. The papers in this panel employ a broad range of methods - including qualitative discourse analysis and digital ethnographic research of YouTubers, OnlyFans creators, TikTok users, and Facebook groups - to offer a multifaceted analysis of how race and racism function across social media platforms and within microcelebrity/influencer cultures. The first paper takes the broadest approach in their digital ethnographic work and attempts to flesh out the workings of race, gender, and political economies of influencers on YouTube. Particularly, Paper 1 analyzes the Pokémon GO phenomenon and the influencers who came to fame through building relationships with their fans, discarding conversations of race and racism, and engaging in unequal, gendered forms of private work. Key to its argument is an examination of how particular social locations of race and gender and the neoliberal project of entrepreneurship affect the clout, visibility, and well-being of Pokémon GO influencers. The next three papers focus explicitly on how race operates within microcelebrity and influencer circles as well as the effects that racism has on influencers across various social media platforms. Indeed, Paper 2 examines how race and racism mediate the experiences of gay porn microcelebrities in order to flesh out the differing, racialized relational work that occurs on OnlyFans and within its attendant social media subcultures. Most crucially, it destabilizes the often unnamed ‘white default’ of porn studies, while accounting for how race, racism, and sexuality shape online microcelebrity. Paper 3 studies the TikTok platform to think about how young influencers navigate race and racism and pose social justice stances on a burgeoning and ephemeral platform. In particular, engagement with American racial and cultural politics are explicitly linked to notions of platformed citizenship norms on TikToK. Finally, Paper 4 introduces the term “platformed race” to interrogate how Asianness is commodified, circulated, and microcelebrified within Subtle Asian Things (SAT), a private Facebook group. The paper interrogates how dominant narratives on SAT tend to leverage diasporic Asianess in the generation and circulation of memes, which in turn provoke socio-political debate and incite culturally relevant discourse amongst its distributed global community. To summarize, our analyses explore the intersections of microcelebrity and influencer economies, cultures, and labor demands by looking at how creators and their audiences experience race and racism across several platforms. Our various approaches contribute different examinations of race and racism to existing literature on the everyday experiences and structural hurdles that microcelebrities and influencers must endure in order to sustain their livelihood in a shifting platform(ed) landscape (eg: Abidin, 2018, Baym, 2018, Duffy, 2017). As internet researchers working with qualitative methods, we can never know in advance what contexts might be most meaningful for our work, and so we remain critical of how we make sense of both our own judgements and those of our participants (Markham and Baym, 2009).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In digital cities, urban space integrates physical and digital worlds. Information and communication technologies, often controlled by private companies, become ubiquitous, not least to capture and process (personal) data. While private governance can reconfigure public values and relations between public institutions and citizens, the question arises who decides what cities become, whose interests they serve. This paper presents ongoing research about the Right to the City (Lefebvre, 1968) and the right to personal data protection, guided by a social constructivist perspective and the methodological framework of actor-network-theory. As part of a four-year research track, we conducted an empirical cross-case analysis of urban data processing projects affected by the GDPR. The aim was to answer the question of how ‘users’ of cities can be represented meaningfully in processes that shape cities by means of those two rights. To do so, we interviewed people directly involved in Belgian ‘smart’ city projects. The main results of this research show that the two rights can be complementary in fostering agency and protecting citizen interests in technologically enhanced, citizen-centric cities. Data protection impacts smart city developments, but true agency of citizens as in the Right to the City remains limited. We will discuss why especially interdisciplinary research is required to further understanding in this complex, cross-domain environment and to lower barriers to citizen inclusion in practice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this presentation, I will share key findings from my dissertation research on femme internet culture. Following the conference theme, this presentation will focus on the use of online methods for documenting subcultural life, and online subculture’s ability to make life more liveable for marginalized subjects. In this project, I define “femme” as a queer identity that is marked by a critical and political engagement with femininity that manifests through one’s style and values. I used Ulrika Dahl’s (2011) femme-inist ethnography methodology to conceptualize a study of “one’s own community.” In this presentation, I will focus on key findings about femme memes and online femme networks. My research demonstrates that through a study of a subculture’s memes, we can come to learn much about the group’s values, norms, and boundaries. Memes allow individuals to see one’s self, identity, or experiences reflected, or be “in on the joke.” Femmes recognize the experiences specific to femme subjectivity (ie. femme invisibility) communicated through memes and feel a sense of connection with one another. In addition, my research offers further evidence of the value of online communities for marginalized subjects. The femmes in my study used online connections to combat geographical isolation, create intergenerational bonds, and even find a reason to stay alive. My research shows that the technological affordances of Instagram continue to make online communities valuable. In addition, online methods are valuable tools to develop deeper insight into existing subcultures, especially those that are marginalized in more mainstream and/or public arenas.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary mobile media affords new insights into the social, critical, cultural and creative practice methods. With the continual rise of social practice in art which sees the “social” and “experience” as the medium, smartphones have become an increasingly important device for information dissemination, collective dialogue and poetic expression. This paper considers these insights through the lively and multivalent discussion of participatory art project entitled $2 (2020) as case study. It is situated within the community of **** University international students, local students, staff and friends during the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, a global health event that has had significant socio-cultural, economic, and political impacts. It employs one of the most pervasive barometers of popular culture today, the selfie. Moving through related topics such as facial recognition and digital parenting, the $2 team recognise that now more than ever, we need transformative work to engage in collective care. In essence, this project has created an affective listening network to make the unheard heard, to voice personal concerns, and to show empathy for the broader community affected by this global health crisis. $2 openly supports international students caught in the crossfire of strict new travel restrictions imposed by the Government. We critically reflect on how art is a socially transformative process, through its messages of care alongside messages from Chinese students suffering anxiety and isolation, waiting for the travel bans to be lifted, a tempering of the stigma and racism accompanying the coronavirus event here in $2 .</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In an open online discussion forum, where there is no fixed structure or a facilitator like a course forum without any assigned themes, every participant is a facilitator shaping the direction and depth of a conversation. How can we as designers then make sure it leads to an engaging learning community that learners keep coming back to beyond the given course period? This paper reports on sequential analysis of 172 posts in 32 threads and close reading of two threads from an open online discussion forum in a free open online course, specifically looking at the impact of participant actions as facilitative moves, to gain better understanding of the types of actions that lead to deeper and sustained engagement with the ideas of interest. Sequential analysis is an approach that estimates which types of sequences of posts or interactions are most likely to occur in a threaded discussion. The results showed that sharing personal experiences attracted most responses, implying that it is important to encourage participants to share questions or cases connected to their personal experiences. In addition, somewhat paradoxically, we found that posts acknowledging responses tend to conclude and close down the conversation while posts that ask diverging questions tend to attract more discussion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>According to dominant theorizations of contemporary society, many people’s daily practices now occur within, and reproduce, a social world where media are the fundamental reference and resource for the development of the self (Couldry and Hepp 2017:15). Although previous research has revealed the mutual shaping of technologies, interaction, and identity in the broader contexts of economic and social change related to ‘millennials’, we know little about the precise ways in which these practices occur and how the self is being differently constructed over time. Using a multi-method qualitative approach, this work in progress paper explores three key questions: 1) What happens when visuality becomes a part of youth’s everyday practices of interaction? 2) What roles are images playing in routine interaction among youth? 3) How and in what ways does the maintenance of a visually ‘mediated presence’ in social media shape youths’ views of the self? This paper elaborates on findings within three categories that illustrate youth’s visual practices and how they are differently understood over time: (1) images of the self in the moment; (2) images of the self over time; and (3) images of the self under surveillance. The preliminary findings of this research suggest that although youth’s technological practices may not all be new, there are significant aspects of visuality that alters some of the key factors shaping young people’s use and understandings of new media technologies.</jats:p>",

By centering either non-white or non-male characters as leads in roles traditionally dominated by cisgender white men, both films became centers for toxic discourse and targeted campaigns aimed at disrupting their commercial success.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The website and platform Twitch.tv is the overwhelming market leader in the live broadcast (“streaming”) of user-created videos over the internet, known primarily for the streaming of video game play. In both 2016 and 2017 over two million people regularly broadcast on the platform, resulting in over a million years of video content in total viewed by over one hundred million people (Twitch, 2017). The deep newness of this phenomenon, alongside the many elements that constitute it, make it an important site for studying digital labour, co-production, and gaming culture. In this paper we focus on three elements of the conference theme: the shifting political and creative economies of streaming media, in our case Twitch; social media, platforms, podcasts, and actors in online networks; and the materialities of data, in our case a million years of video content. Specifically, we consider the entangling of the technical and social dimensions of the Twitch phenomenon: how these elements shape the labour of Twitch streamers, audience engagement with the platform, and Twitch’s wider position in contemporary media production. To do so we draw upon semi-structured interviews with over one hundred professional streamers on the Twitch platform, lasting between ten minutes and one hour, alongside at least one hour of ethnographic observation from over two hundred Twitch channels and ethnographic work from almost a dozen gaming events in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany and Poland in the past two years.</jats:p>",

As against the backdrop of several mostly quantitative studies of Palestinian Arabs in Israel, we analyze our respondents’ discourse in order to outline the intricate relationships between mothers and fathers; between siblings; between parents and their children, and the children’s imagined peer group; and between the interviewees and their extended family. We complement this analysis with a focus on religion, describing a range of Muslim mobile apps that allow our interviewees to practice their religion, as well as widely used apps – mostly WhatsApp groups – which afford virtual gatherings for promoting charity, pilgrimage and Quran reading. The analysis highlights the particular tensions that are woven into our interviewees’ uses: they are concerned over their participation in social media, the authenticity of the texts they encounter, and their relationships with local and trans-local religious authorities. These questions are implicated in Muslim doctrines and in the predicament of Palestinian Arab families in Israel – and in the affordances of social media and online mobile phones.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The pervasiveness of social media has resulted in the establishment of a new career sector to manage the digital marketing, communications, public relations and advertising activities for businesses, nonprofits and high-profile individuals (McCosker, 2017). Consequently, the lines between work and personal lives have blurred, when constant connection and working across time-zones can be job requirements for workers providing social media support. Studies investigating digital labour, boundary management and Post-Fordism have explored technology’s impact on working conditions, but few have specifically examined the perspectives of social media professionals within the context of 'digital well-being', defined as \"...the ability to look after personal health, safety, relationships and work-life balance in digital settings\". This pilot study provides an insight into the perceptions of 15 social media professionals from six continents, to examine if current working conditions have impacted their health and well-being. Results indicated that most participants perceived the responsibility for digital well-being to be equally shared between employer and employee. However, the majority of the sample reported experiencing the inability to disconnect from work during their personal time, feelings of stress when managing live events/campaigns, including live-streaming, and being exposed to negative comments and messages when managing online communities. Only three out of the 15 social media professionals interviewed identified measures implemented at their workplaces to promote digital well-being, suggesting employers may perceive their duty-of-care ends when social media professionals leave work for the day even though their responsibilities can follow them home.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an empirical investigation of the concept of ad hoc issue publics, through a mixed-methods analysis of a year of debate over a contentious topic in the Australian public sphere. Following two controversial racial discrimination cases in 2016, a number of Australian conservative politicians called for amendments to a specific section of the Racial Discrimination Act (Section 18C), which they claimed restricted freedom of speech. Similar proposals had been put forward and shelved in 2013. The issue was discussed widely on Twitter and other social media platforms. Eventually, the Australian Senate voted down changes to section 18C. Using a range of network analyses, examining the various network structures created by Twitter’s affordances, this study identifies the publics and communities involved in the debate. The discourses of these communities are then qualitatively analysed. The findings show that different—and sometimes antagonistic—discourse communities are involved in the debate, and while all of these use the same hashtags and keywords, they have contrasting discursive positions. This paper argues that in this case, the publics created as a result of the affordances of Twitter cannot be regarded as ad hoc issue publics, since the discourse communities involved were formed as a result of a priori ideological affinities. Broadly, the findings of this study help in the theorisation of online publics and communities, particularly the necessary elements involved in the formation of ad hoc issue publics and/or online discourse communities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates web browser extensions as an under-researched media object for their capacity for activism. “Activist extensions” disrupt a webpage’s intended use and redirect users’ attention to social issues by modifying textual, visual, or auditory elements of the web user interface. The relevance of the study stems from the ubiquity of the web browser as a communication tool and the potential of browser extensions to counter its power in shaping how web content is delivered to users. Based on the notions of transduction and affordance, the critical vocabulary of the Situationist International, and the conceptualization of platform governance through the provision of infrastructural services, this paper asks: Through what mechanism do activist extensions redirect users’ attention to social issues? What are the potential implications for users? And, how can browser platforms affect the creation and distribution of activist extensions? The study adopts a mixed-methods approach that includes discursive interface analysis of the extensions’ modification of the browser interface, critical discourse analysis of user comments on these extensions, and semi-structured interviews with extension developers. Major findings of the study include: 1) the redirection of users’ attention from the webpage to social issues is achieved through the mechanism of $2 , 2) activist extensions function as $2 that provides users with a coping mechanism against certain online rhetoric, and 3) the creation and distribution of activist extensions are conditioned by an $2 imposed by the browser platform on extension developers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Self-tracking applications (apps) like Endomondo, Runkeeper and Strava have made it effortless for laypeople to measure their exercise activity and turn it into detailed data on running time, distance, average pace, calories burned etc. The users can share the exercise data with personal networks of users (often named friends) on the apps’ internal social network sites (Ellison &amp; boyd, 2013) or external social network sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Few studies, however, have shed light on how people use self-tracking in their everyday lives (Lupton, 2016) – e.g. why people share exercise data on social network sites. Some people feel uneasy by exercising with – or in the presence of – people. In this paper, I provide a thick description of people that bypass their struggle with social exercise by sharing exercise data on social network sites. I utilize the lived experience of two female newcomers to exercise, Amanda and Dorte, to illustrate this. Firstly, using the philosopher and medical doctor Drew Leder’s phenomenological investigations into embodiment, I analyze how the females’ bodies dys-appear (Leder, 1990) when they exercise near/with people. Secondly, I examine how their networks of friends function as a beneficial form of exercise sociality that encourages Amanda and Dorte’s exercise activity. My empirical data originates from an exploratory, interview study of 12 Danish, recreational athletes’ experiences with exercise-related self-tracking apps.</jats:p>",

Sexuality is a critical component of adolescent development, and to aid in sexual development, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adolescents globally have access to comprehensive sexual health education because it contributes positively their future sexual and reproductive health (UNESCO, 2018). In the United States, starting in 1981 with Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA) sexual health education has relied heavily on Abstinence-Only curricula, with the goal of teaching adolescents to reduce risky sexual behaviors, such as having unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners and young age of sexual debut by remaining sexually abstinent until marriage (Dixon-Mueller, 1993; Saul, 1998). Looking over time and across online platforms, the goal of this study is to determine; 1). How is sexual health education online structured and what topics are covered? 2). How has online sexual health education over time responded to government mandates on sexual health and sexuality in general? 3). How does the presentation of sexual health information change across the different platforms? and 4). How do online sexual health education handle topics such pleasure and desire for underrepresented groups?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In studying how fans live their lives online, a common lens has been to consider fandom as fan community (e.g. Sullivan, 2019). Modern digital social networks appear to be complicating this picture, with some scholars suggesting that online fandoms are fragmenting (e.g. Coppa, 2014). In this work, we report on a variety of case studies carried out using ethnographic and survey methods. These examine examples of fans whose networks span both online and offline spaces (for example fan tourism to Scotland initiated through membership of Outlander fan Facebook groups), and who may move between different micro-fandoms either consecutively or concurrently (for example Doctor Who fans watching via Twitch). Though this we demonstrate how individuals form networks around themselves which extend into multiple online and offline spaces, creating a multilayered personal interaction space. Building on the work of Rainie and Wellman (2012) we provide an alternative viewpoint of fan-centered rather than community-centered networks, and discuss how activities within a single person’s network may manifest differently depending on the affordances and policies of different digital platforms. We propose that future work should interrogate how policies related to such communal digital spaces, both written and socially constructed, impact upon individual and community behavior online and offline.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>It is only in the past few years that the public has had much access to embodied, immersive, social virtual worlds through consumer virtual reality hardware. While these new experiences are still restricted to those who can access the proper equipment and have sufficient network connectivity, academics and others have rushed to explore and explain them. A rich history of experimental research scaffolds our understanding of what the experience of embodiment in an avatar brings to social experiences in immersive virtual reality. However, properly understanding these phenomena will also require a deep understanding of the history of social virtual worlds. Historically, platform constraints and affordances have influenced how people experience and express the social self in virtual worlds, and this has resulted in different “places” having different cultures, norms, and behaviors. We discuss how these cultures and norms may affect what users expect from an embodied experience, and how these expectations in turn will affect their concerns about privacy and identity. Specifically, different virtual cultures will result in different forms of “identity economies” in which users will either pay or exchange data to achieve embodiment. To illustrate, we discuss two models of embodied virtual reality worlds. We propose that this framing will help us to better understand how virtual worlds have evolved and are experienced now; how they may be studied, and how they may continue to evolve in the future as VR technologies create new experiences, affordances and limitations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Researching everyday media practices is a messy and tricky business fraught with uncertainty. In this panel the authors ask how stories of failure, especially during fieldwork, can be rethought as a meaningful emergent method and approach. How can we productively reframe failure as a core part of the research process that cannot be subsumed into the telos of a success story after the research has been completed? How does does failure work in research? Our approach takes a different stance from dominant stories in the tech industry and geek economy, where failure is often represented in linear, heroic, gendered and individualistic ways, retrospectively rendering mess as instrumental to success. Similarly, within academia there are many research processes in which failure is instrumentalised or obscured—from writing up fieldwork into neatly packaged case-studies, to causal accounts of effective intervention. Progress narratives of knowledge production have been subject to much debate and criticism. What has been less discussed is how failures work as sometimes uncontainable aspects of research praxes—how they are endemic to the process of data collection and analysis, materializing while in the field. In this panel we suggest that these experiences are core to the thickness of fieldwork—they disclose the messiness and dynamics of the social, and should be included in the stories we tell. This panel aims to liberate discussion about failure to render it visible and core to understanding the politics and ethics of fieldwork and the research process. Through a series of stories from our fieldwork, we seek to further critical understanding of methodologies and techniques of failure, and argue for our obligations as researchers to talk about what happens when things go wrong.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel brings together research into the cross-platform relations between radical Web subcultures and how they are constitutive of “hyper-antagonistic” politics in broader Web discourses. The papers share a concern with vernacular practices of “fringe” platforms favoured by an insurgent far-right movement and their relations to more “mainstream” social media. They engage with the concept of “transcoding between milieus” (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1987, 322) as a means to empirically describe multiple transversal processes across different strata of the Web in which “one milieu serves as the basis for another” (313). All papers ground their conceptual analysis in data-driven empirical approaches using historical datasets ranging from “mainstream” platforms like YouTube, to more “fringe” spaces like 4chan. The papers furthermore all use 4chan’s far-right /pol/ board as a reference point for a vernacular “hyper-antagonistic” style that emerged out of this period – a style that has often been related to the “alt-right”. Together, the four papers in this panel offer insights into the apparent insurgency of far-right subcultures within broader online discourse in the Anglo-American context over the course of the last half decade. Each does so with a particular focus, ranging from subcultural conflict between Tumblr and 4chan, the transcoding of the “Kekistan” meme between 4chan and YouTube, the emergence of far-right vernacular in the comments of Breitbart News, and the robustness of hyper-antagonistic discourse after deplatforming measures.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how professional practices of software developers forge global assemblages in the oil and gas industry by shedding light on the implementation of cloud technologies within a Norwegian-based digital service company. Delivering digital solutions to oil and gas extracting corporations, this company primarily develops proprietary software providing engineers with business intelligence dashboards that assist in managing the assets involved in the extraction of resources. This extended case study seeks to gain a better understanding of the materialities emerging in cloud environments by illuminating transnational divisions of labor within global assemblages. Committed to a holistic contextualization, this mixed-method investigation is primarily based on ethnographic fieldwork, including participation in industry events and a three-month secondment in a small-scale digital service company. Drawing from a materialistic approach to internet technologies, the study provides a comprehensive account of the digital service company since its founding in 2001. Based on evidence from industry events and a long-term immersion in the working lives of software developers, I suggest that the implementation of cloud technologies in the oil and gas industry prompted new digital divisions of labor and replaced the physical travel of professionals with a remote control system facilitating an enhanced circulation of data. The findings of this investigation imply that cloud computing continues to restructure the global economy and accelerates the migration of data through internet technologies.</jats:p>",

    "title": "A DECADE OF SOCIAL MEDIA ELECTIONS – A CROSS-NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this panel we combine longitudinal and cross-national studies of social media in election campaigns, expanding the time span as well as number of countries compared to former studies. The four papers present longitudinal studies, covering multiple election cycles from four different countries: Australia, the United States of America, Denmark and Sweden.&#x0D;\nBy including these cases we focus on countries considered to be “first movers” when it comes to the digitization and internetization of the political life. As such, they are “most similar cases”. However, they also have different political systems: the US and Australia are characterized by a Westminster system dominated by a few large parties and a tradition of strong confrontation between government and opposition, whereas Denmark and Sweden are multi-party systems with a tradition of collaboration and coalition governments. Further, the countries’ media systems, as defined by Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), differ significantly; the US is characterized by a commercialized American media system with little role for public service broadcasters, Denmark and Sweden have very strong public service media, and Australia has elements of both these systems. Technologically, the four countries might be similar, but politically and in terms of media systems, they differ. Thus, studies of the four countries form a diverse yet solid set of cases for exploring the growing (and changing) role of social media in national elections.&#x0D;\nThe papers address such issues by various methods and perspectives, from large-scale big data analyses of tweets to content analyses of Facebook pages and surveys among citizens. From different angles, the four papers circle around the same topics: do social media contribute to narrowing or widening the often-discussed gap between citizens and politicians? Does the increasing use (and changing character) of social media in election campaigns facilitate increased trust or rather a radicalized and more negative discourse? And do citizens feel more empowered and enlightened in a democratic sense?&#x0D;\nThe Australian case study is based on a comprehensive analysis of interactions around candidates’ Twitter accounts, drawing on state-of-the-art methods. It stretches across three election cycles. It presents new evidence both on the use of Twitter in political campaigning in Australia, and on the public response to this use, not at least in the light of the overall context of a decline in trust towards the political system, in Australia and elsewhere.&#x0D;\nThe US case study examines negativity, incivility, and intolerance expressed by candidates running for governor in 2014 as compared with 2018. In between those two election cycles, the United States had the remarkable presidential campaign of 2016, with an unprecedented volume and style of negative campaigning unseen in modern campaigning. This study thus asks whether the 2018 candidates were more negative and uncivil than their counterparts who ran in 2014. Results will illuminate the nature of political incivility and whether there is a coarseness of political discourse in the United States.&#x0D;\nThe Danish case study is based on surveys of citizens’ Internet use / social media use across four elections, covering a time span of 12 years. It adds to an understanding of the growing use of social media but more importantly it investigates how citizens experienced effects of social media as tools for agenda-setting and efficacy, the latter understood as increased reflection and enlightenment.&#x0D;\nThe Swedish case study covers three Swedish national elections, in 2010, 2014 and 2018. The research question is: how are viral posts from political parties on Facebook changing over time? By answering that question, the author can track the consequences of increased platformization of politics as well as an increased targeting towards the needs and wants of the audience, through what some will call populism.&#x0D;\nThe studies all cover more or less the last decade. This represents a time span during which social media have matured and have come to play an increasing role in citizens’ daily lives. The contributions are interesting country-based case studies in themselves, but through this panel we seek to engage the audience in a discussion of the developments expected for the coming years.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Smart speakers are one the latest products of platforms and have the capability to quickly connect platforms, algorithms, people, and households together. The frame of $2 was developed to understand the agency of platforms (corporations based on technological infrastructures guided by algorithms) that have influence on the whole society itself. We can argue, thus, that smart speakers can be conceptualized as devices that objectify the logics of platform society into households because they are produced and programmed by a platform that provides also the operating system and the personal assistant installed, becoming an extension of the platform itself. Due to the fast diffusion of smart speakers, there is the need to investigate their adoption process and user’s perception of algorithmic selection and data processing. The research here presented was one of the first about the subject in Italy and studied the diffusion of smart speakers in Italy with a multi-sided methodology. It let to investigate also the role of smart speakers in reproducing the power of algorithms into households. Research results showed that users were taking for granted some algorithmic logic and appreciated it (like for basic information search or for music selection). They indicated also that the mechanisms of voice interaction made clear some limits of the algorithmic customization and led users to start to be more conscious of it (for example about news selection or vocal search for purchases) and to elaborate strategies to reduce its influence.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE HIDDEN BLUEPRINT: A DISSECTION OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT ON        LIVING SYSTEMS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The proliferation of technological systems which permeate, and often dominate, human sociological systems is ripe for critical exploration. The purpose of this panel is to investigate the myriad ways in which technology has encroached upon—and, arguably, engineered—human behaviors, once considered the domain of psychological and biological outcomes. Additionally, this panel will offer critical insight into how disproportionate and otherwise ethically skewed technological influence may be mitigated at the point of creation in order to restore balance between tech consumer and tech creator. Topics in this panel span human migration, algorithmic encoding, human-machine communication, datafication of the human subject, glitch technology, and AI-based prediction. This panel will investigate ways in which technology has converged with human systems, often unquestioned, and offer analysis into the potential consequences of this convergence, as well as potential solutions for alleviating the omnipresence of technical sovereignty on living systems. Specific panel presentations discuss: • The inorganic digital footprint that mitigates the tangible human footprint of human migration. • The pitfalls of cybernetic prediction and the corrosive nature of AI-based prediction. • The nature of human-machine communication, as documented by interactions with Amazon Go. • Normalization of gender, as evidenced by algorithmic determination in Spotify suggestions. • The emancipatory power of “breaking” the black box of participatory technology. Each panel topic identifies technology as the basis for living systems at the socio-cultural level. For example, multiple papers investigate how algorithms seek to manage, mitigate, and encourage human behavior, while others look at the physical technological infrastructure which guides the flow of human migration. The overarching goal of each paper encourages the end-user to take a deeper look at the symbiotic relationship between digital infrastructure and living systems in order to critically examine the consequences of convergence without critical oversight. Each paper in this panel also identifies a humanistic concept that interrogates the blurring between natural and artificial, human and machine, agency, and autonomy. Dissection of the hidden blueprint of techno-socio systems requires scholars to reconsider what it means to be human and forces a critical inquiry about why, how, and under what circumstances machines can or should engineer or augment human actors, and the extent to which machines can be made to act responsibly. For example, as displaced populations are forced from their nation-states, the ethical implications that those migrants of diaspora may tailor their migratory routes to current technological infrastructure must be considered. As we evolve towards engineering more scalable communication networks capable of harnessing the allegiance of a wide swath of the population based on geographic proximity, we mustn’t neglect to consider that these networks are driving human behavior as much, if not more, than they are supporting it. Similarly, when considering the hidden philosophical blueprint that prescribes predictive artificial intelligence, we mustn’t neglect to consider the assumptions which belie this philosophy, nor the impact of systems derived from such philosophy which claim to predict the patterns of our human behavior. These research topics identify the importance and relevance of scholarship in the area of human-machine communication and advocate for their inclusion in the conceptualization, prototyping, and creation of ethical robotic and AI technologies. Increasingly, humans find themselves socializing with intelligent agents and robots at home, in schools, and at work. Further, humans often do recognize the extent to which technological systems drive human behavior. This panel offers a glimpse into the necessary, provocative, and timely discussion about HMC and the role of critical scholarship in shaping technologies of the future. As technology progresses, we find ourselves on the precipice of social and cultural evolution in which the illusory real disguised as “user-friendliness” becomes more and more ubiquitous in design theory. In many respects, the trajectory of the modern-day Internet suggests that rather than heading towards emancipation (what user-friendliness promises)--we are headed closer to invisibility. Each of these panels reveals a mechanism by which we may peek into the constructs of our techno-social reality, as so that we may mitigate the dangers of such invisibility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reviews the evolution of Chinese academic social media in the past twenty years or so, with an analytical focus of trust and openness. It examines and compares the communicative models in scientific blog, Weibo and WeChat, and explores how academic social media co-evolve with academics’ changing demands, as well as broad social and institutional contexts in China.&#x0D;\nThis research employs multiple methods and combines data collected at different periods of time including 20 interviews, participatory observation of about 200 social media accounts, and document/discourse analysis. This research identifies transformative changes of Chinese academic social media practices, particularly the shifting focus from open sharing of knowledge in public sphere to semi-closed and semi-public grouping based on acquaintance networking. While Chinese academics believe acquaintance grouping enables more reliable and rewarding communications, this raises issues regarding a “closed” and “exclusive” approach to building trust in scholarly/scientific communications.&#x0D;\nPotts, et al. (2017) theorize “knowledge club” as an entity where members form self-constituted groups, endeavoring to create new knowledge, and balancing the positive externalities of commons against the negative externalities of crowding is key. This paper understands the evolution of Chinese academic social media as a process of “clubization” of digital knowledge systems and further discusses the reasons and impact in the Chinese contexts.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is derived from a larger project that examines the experiences of women who live-stream video games on the Twitch.tv platform. To date, much of the research that has been done in the area of streaming is concerned with streamers who have a large following and/or derive their main source of income from streaming. Rather than directing more attention to those streamers who have attained ‘success’ as Twitch would frame it, this study is centered around a group of streamers unique from those who are typically the focus. First, I discuss the ways monetization influences community building. Second, I discuss some of the implications of paying for attention. Third, I discuss the pressure streamers feel to perform a particular kind of authenticity around monetization. Finally, I will discuss how monetization creates friction and competition between streamers. This work contributes the perspectives of 5 women whose experiences have been largely overlooked by existing research about streaming, as well as the analysis of another 50 Twitch channels run by women from diverse backgrounds and streaming interests. These findings demonstrate that the monetization features available to streamers and the everyday practices that have emerged through Twitch centered around monetization have a lot of influence over how people relate to each other, even for those streamers who are not trying to monetize their channels.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Hostility in video games has been a cause for concern since multiplayer gaming began gaining popularity. Many of the studies conducted on this topic have highlighted negative behaviors as particularly aggressive toward women, but relatively limited in the broad context of general audiences or in contrast to positive multiplayer encounters . This study uses interviews with 54 people and approximately 1900 online forum posts to further investigate player experiences with and understandings of hostility in video game play. Overall, it appears that female players do experience particular kinds of harassment, but that players have been negatively influenced and affected by these types of behavior regardless of gender. Largely, players have begun to feel like they cannot feel comfortable in these spaces or necessarily trust other players to behave in positive ways. For both male and female players, this has led to many avoiding certain types of game or specific titles all together. Additionally, players lack confidence that companies are doing what is necessary to shift the culture and have come to understand toxic players as something to be expected in the community. Because of its frequency, toxicity has become understood as a part of gaming culture and something that, perhaps, is immutable.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the consolidation of works on the heterogeneous nature of the so-called Manosphere, a lot of these studies consider masculinity as an overall governing force of men’s behaviors. This is has led to overlooking how subject positioning is always negotiated in multiple and contradictory discourses that are not easily captured by structurally oriented frameworks such as hegemonic or toxic masculinity. By focusing on the recent third development in men’s critical studies of masculinity, this work seek to investigates the discursive construction of masculinity in digital environment, in order to identify the various resources, in the form of established repertoires, that men use to position themselves in relation to conventional discourses of the masculine, and how masculinity both impinges upon and is transformed by those practices. Using a qualitative methodology, we analyze the content of two Facebook Pages dedicated to men's rights issues, called Antisessismo (Antisexism) and Diritti Maschili – Equità e Umanità (Men’s rights – Equity and Humanity). Our findings suggest that in these groups, masculinity is rarely negotiated or discussed but it is assumed as a common sense, providing a basis for shared social understandings. However, there is no unitary meaning to this common sense of masculinity, on the contrary, it contains many contradictory or competing arguments. Individuals are positioned by discourses, but, as our data demonstrate, these identity positions are by no means stable and consistent: users can shift between different modes of masculinity and actively re-create positions for themselves, especially in response to “trouble”.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the ethics and motivations of online identification—how and why people collect and publish identifying information about others online. In seven interviews, activists, Internet users, advocates, and journalists were asked about their investigative practice and how they viewed the ethics of deanonymization. Using ethnographic interviewing techniques and a thematic analysis inspired by grounded theory, I describe respondents’ investigations and compare them to existing theories in surveillance studies, online anonymity, and digital vigilantism. Respondents often struggled with making their work accessible and impactful in an ethical manner. They obfuscated irrelevant information that might incite online harassment and took care in who they collaborated with. The respondents also debated what to do when people misinterpreted their work or thought that they had acted unjustly. The precautions they incorporated into their publications are examples of how people navigate online ethics when there isn’t a clear standard for moral decisions. Ultimately, the interview results did not follow models of digital vigilantism and doxxing, and I caution against using those terms to apply to cases like those described in this study. I also make suggestions for how these results could augment theoretical models of anonymity, particularly how respondents’ investigative techniques and backgrounds lead them to different moral commitments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel introduces and critically examines the concept of \"digital\n        placemaking\" as practices that create emotional attachments to place through digital media\n        use. As populations and the texts they produce become increasingly mobile, such practices\n        are proliferating, and a striking array of applications and uses have emerged which exploit\n        the affordances of mobile media to foster an ability to navigate, understand, connect to,\n        and gain a sense of belonging and familiarity in place. The concept of digital placemaking\n        is both a theoretical and applied response to the spatial fragmentation, banal physical\n        environments, and community disintegration thought to have accompanied the speed and scale\n        of globalization—the implications of which include suggestions that our collective sense of\n        place has been disrupted, leaving people unsure of their belonging within conditions and\n        boundaries that seem increasingly fluid. While it is imperative to attend to the shifting\n        social, economic, and political conditions that give rise to such concerns, it is also\n        necessary to recognize the many ways people actually use digital media to negotiate\n        differential mobilities and become placemakers. Papers in this interdisciplinary panel\n        consider digital placemaking through a range of perspectives investigating lived experiences\n        of assorted communities with disparate social and economic power to demonstrate how digital\n        media can facilitate social and geographic boundary crossing while encouraging new ways of\n        placing ourselves—symbolically, virtually, or through co-located presence.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The last years have seen a proliferation of research on the social ramifications of algorithms (Eubanks 2018; Noble 2018) and the power of algorithms was insightfully theorized (Gillespie 2016; Bucher 2018). At the same time, scholars have begun to examine the ties between algorithms and culture (Seaver 2017), describing algorithms as products of complex socio-algorithmic assemblages (Gillespie 2016, 24), with often very local socio-technical histories (Kitchin 2017). However, the spatial trajectories through which algorithms operate, and the specific sociocultural contexts in which they arise have been largely overlooked. Accordingly, research tends to focus on American companies and on the effects their algorithms have on Euro-American users, while, in fact, algorithms are being developed in various geographical locations, and they are being used in diverse socio-cultural contexts. That is, research on algorithms tends to disregard the heterogeneous contexts from which algorithms arise and the effects various cultural settings have on the production of algorithmic systems. This panel aims to fill these gaps by offering four empirical perspectives on algorithmic production in three prominent tech centers: China, Canada, and Israel. We will ask: How do cross-cultural encounters construct notions of privacy? How is algorithmic discrimination understood and acted upon in China? What symbolical and material resources were invested in making Canada’s AI hubs? And how Israeli tech companies use their algorithms to profile their Other? Hence, this panel offers to think beyond the Silicon Valley paradigm, and to aim towards a more diverse, culturally-sensitive approach to the study algorithms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What does digital piecework have in common with laboring in the warehouse of a large online shopping platform? How is data cleaning related to digitization work and AI training in prisons? This panel suggests bringing these diverse ways of laboring in the digital economies together by considering these practices as infrastructural labor that takes the shape of shadow work (Illich, 1981) and ghost labor (Gray &amp; Suri, 2019). Work and labor in modern, capitalist society imply power, authority and possibility for resistance, and these dimensions are crucial for understanding why and how infrastructures are realized and how they work. Infrastructure labor is ambiguous. It is both visible and invisible depending on the specific tasks and their inherent power relations (Leigh Star &amp; Strauss, 1999). It includes both manual and cognitive labor. It is geared towards innovation as well as repair, maintenance and servitude. The panel aims to paint the contours of infrastructural labor at the margins of digital economies pointing towards forms of alienation and resistance that have for long been part of labor relations, but that are renegotiated in the context of emerging technologies within digital economies that need human labor to be sustained and further innovated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Videos are among the most widely used media formats on Facebook. Yet little research has been done on their aesthetic and formal attributes, and especially on how they operate within the frameworks of attention, interruption and embodied interaction specific to social media interfaces. This paper examines recipe videos published on Tasty, one of the most popular Facebook pages in the world. We analyze these videos through a novel three-dimensional model that integrates their semiotic characteristics (visual, auditory and textual), their interactive and haptic qualities, and their invitation to perceptual engagement and sensorimotor response. We conclude that Facebook recipe videos are exemplary of a broader category of social media videos which we call $2 : these create heightened multisensory experiences that take precedent over informational use or narrative involvement, revealing the deeply physical character of our connections to social media and a yearning for embodied presence in what we might call our online-life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>TikTok has created new strategies that has impacted the music\n        industry through visual effects, stickers, filters, augmented reality, split screens, and\n        transitions in videos no longer than 60 seconds. TikTok posts presents a mode of\n        interdependence where users demonstrate the cultural value of music through challenge and\n        audio memes. This study focuses on a popular social trend on TikTok known as ‘music\n        challenges’. We focused on the significance and cultural meaning of music challenge memes\n        through five key elements – image, audio, text, story, culture – to understand what\n        comprises a ‘challenge’ on TikTok, how storytelling constitutes music challenges, and what\n        cross-cultural in-group affiliations are identified in this trend. For this purpose, we\n        developed a ‘TikTok music storytelling codebook’ informed by grounded theory, and selected\n        150 music challenge meme posts via manual scraping the ‘#MusicChallenge’ hashtag on TikTok\n        1–3 April 2021. Through a pilot analysis, we identified new modes of storytelling through\n        audio memes related to nostalgia, fandom and humour. Beyond “put a finger down” challenges\n        and “I know the song/I don’t know the song” lists, we found a broader significance in\n        telling stories grounded across cultures: sharing a childhood memory, relating to a\n        lifestyle type, and fanning after a musical genre. We noted a musical-peer group belonging\n        trend that brings out a mixture of urban tribes and experiences via creative song-mixing\n        that lasts seconds. To sum up, we understand that TikTok music challenges emerge as a\n        vehicle for interdependent groups to showcase their in-group identities through playful\n        audio-visual creations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As access to news is increasingly mediated through social media platforms, there are rising concerns for citizens’ ability to evaluate online information and detect potentially misleading items. While many studies have reported on how people assess the credibility of information, there are few reports on processes related to evaluating information online and people’s decision to trust and share the information with others. This paper reports on the first part of a three-phase study which aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of citizens’ practices and needs in assessing the credibility of information shared online and co-create solutions to address this problem. Data were collected from three European countries, through a survey on misinformation perceptions, focus groups, follow-up individual interviews, and co-creation activities with three stakeholder groups. The data were analyzed qualitatively, using, primarily, a grounded theory approach. Results from the citizens’ stakeholder group indicate that personal biases, emotions, time constraints, and lack of supporting technologies impacts the credibility assessment of online news. Study participants also discussed the need for increased media literacy actions, especially in youth. Based on preliminary findings we argue that we need a diversified approach to support citizens’ resilience against the spread of misinformation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I explore economic and inclusion opportunities for people with disabilities and mental health issues afforded by ‘live streaming’ ‒ the live broadcast of one’s activities over the internet to a globally dispersed audience. In both 2016 and 2017, the leading live streaming platform Twitch.tv broadcast over 500,000 years of video, which were produced by over two million regular broadcasters (‘streamers’), and consumed by an audience of several hundred million viewers. Streamers can profit, up to and including a full-time living ‘wage’ for those at the highest levels. Numerous successful streamers with chronic health issues have discussed the personal and professional benefits streaming brings them. Utilising data from a research project with 100 interviews, alongside approximately 500 hours of ethnographic observation, this paper examines the experiences of live streaming for broadcasters with disabilities, mental health issues, or physical health issues. Firstly, I explore the positive elements of streaming for these broadcasters, focusing on the many conditions represented in this demographic, and the benefits streaming gives for inclusion and community. Secondly, I consider the negative experiences of these streamers, focused on entanglements of health and technology that make their streaming lives potentially more challenging than their colleagues. Thirdly, I focus on the economic opportunities, and the potential for entrepreneurial activity, the platform affords. I conclude the analysis by exploring how these aspects make live streaming a potentially exemplary emancipatory and entrepreneurial space for these individuals, but not one without challenges.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the development of digital subcultures and microtrends in a social media landscape increasingly driven by algorithms. We explore the increasing proliferation of subcultures defined by aesthetic categories which we refer to as “microtrends. In this paper we draw from a combined mixed-methods exploration– a visual discourse analysis taken in conjunction with critical technoculture analysis (CDTA) – of content shared to the popular hashtag #aesthetic across three different algorithmically driven social media platforms: TikTok, Instagram and Youtube. We aim to extend scholarship on digital subculture formation by examining the intersection of identity formation, algorithmic capitalism and user practices surrounding microtrends through the lens of user engagement and self identity guided by three central questions: (1) What tactics and practices constitute user participation in microtrends? (2) How does user engagement with microtrends function as an act of relational self expression? (3) What are user discourses surrounding microtrend participation? Three novel user practices are identified - aesthetic consistency, aesthetic anxiety, and aesthetic creation- which when taken together comprise of a process that we term “self-discretization” wherein users “do the work” of abstracting and fragmenting their identities for the sake of attaining visibility within a datafied digital environment. Ultimately this paper argues that in an increasingly algorithmic cultural landscape users begin to internalize not just the messaging, but also the logics of algorithmic capitalism and regimes of datafication.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, scholarly attention has indicated the increased enmeshment of the political and entertainment media spheres, a change that has happened so gradually that it has not been as remarked upon as it should be. This is perhaps most observable in studies of community dynamics around both $2 and $2 . The backdrop of digital surveillance capitalism, and the specific platform affordances on which these communities exist and interact, exacerbates both. Furthermore, beyond these inverse scenarios whose distinctive boundaries grow blurrier by the day, there is a third domain in the overlap, of the exploitation – or compensation – of fans, fandoms, and fan labor for political and financial gain. This, too, exists in a reactive feedback loop with the always-on conditions of our contemporary digital political economy. As consequence, there are prominent recent streams of work explicating what exactly the fields of fan studies and political sociology can offer each other for researching communities online in such contexts.\n\nResponding to both the current landscape and recent exemplary and novel scholarship in the field, our panel presents four papers which each delve into an intersection of identity, community, and their ideological and affective ties. They investigate online affective community practices in reaction to fractured sociopolitical polarization, and contribute to the expanding picture of interdisciplinary frameworks and methodologies available — and increasingly, required — to comprehend the motivations, justifications, and trajectories of community dynamics under such drivers.</jats:p>",

Of growing importance and use is TikTok, an application with a multi-modal curation structure that enables users to share content of various interests.

Using a semiotic analysis approach, this study explores TikTok’s role in crisis communication by examining the process of collective sensemaking of the Port of Beirut, Lebanon explosion on August 4th, 2020. The preliminary findings reveal intersemiotic dissonance obscuring crisis discourse, thus negatively influencing the process of collective sensemaking. The results of this study motivate further research that examines tacit guidelines for crisis communication on TikTok and similar applications.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ONE HUNDRED NAZI SCREENS: INTERFACES AND THE STRUCTURE OF U.S. WHITE NATIONALIST DIGITAL NETWORKS ON TELEGRAM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The “Alt-Right,” a white nationalist online coalition, has collapsed amidst a revolution in digital governance termed the “regulatory turn.” Nevertheless, the regulatory turn remains incomplete because white nationalists utilize graphical user interface (GUI) design to subvert public stewardship. Why have some former Alt-Right platforms collapsed while others have grown despite increased scrutiny? The field’s account is currently limited to social media networks and rooted in positivist methods, lending a static conception of white nationalist networks that is slow to recognize cultural shifts. This paper fills the gap by comparatively critiquing the interfacing affordances of Telegram, an instant messaging app that functions as an \"ideological safe harbor\" for U.S. white nationalists with content aggregation, blogging, and activist use-cases. I apply interface critique to index how the manipulation of graphical user interfaces allows white nationalists to frame their browsing as a technology of mastery over and against the regulatory turn. I argue that Telegram networks coopt the enclave public, exploiting an ideology of decentralization to mystify the leverage held by white nationalist developers over their users. This occlusion redirects white masculine anxieties against publicity to justify an intensified racist fanaticism and the exportation of violence against racial, religious, and gendered outsiders. White interfacing frames GUI design as a capitalist technology that weaponizes the racist and sexist logic of the “average user” to secure the reproduction of reactionary platforms. This project furthers Internet research by developing a theory of the interface as an ideological mirror of production.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND VISIONS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental media scholars have long drawn attention to the physicality of digital systems, situating their work as part of the infrastructural turn (Larkin, 2013; Parks &amp; Starosielski, 2015; Star, 1999). Contrary to the prevailing “cultural imagination of dematerialization” (Starosielski, 2015), digital supply chains – from data centers to AI systems to consumer electronics – depend on minerals, water, land, labour, and energy (Crawford, 2021; Cubitt, 2016; Hogan et al., 2022). This growth-based model of digital technology is based on assumed access to resources, implicating it in the extractive global economy shaped by ongoing colonial violence (Liboiron, 2021; Spice, 2018).\n\nTransdisciplinary scholarship on the intersection of digital technologies and the environment has looked at online organizing and digital climate change action (McLean &amp; Fuller, 2016; Pearce et al., 2019), indigenous resistance and data sovereignty (Duarte, 2017; Kukutai &amp; Taylor, 2016), the environmental impacts of large-scale data centers (Hogan, 2015; Velkova, 2016) and alternative social media (Laser et al., 2022), and what \"responsible digitalization\" could look like (Dwivedi et al., 2022). Building on already existing work that critically examines the material implications of digital infrastructures, this panel asks what environmental justice means in relation to digital technologies.\n\nTurning against the language of revolution that too often gets leveraged by Big Tech to describe the latest \"disruptive\" technology that is allegedly going to solve the world's problems (Geiger, 2020; Tabel, 2022), we foreground subversive practices, regulatory interventions, and grassroots organizing and vision building as emancipatory alternatives to a for-profit, monopolized internet. From a theory of change that seeks to understand and challenge the extractive nature of digital technology production from all angles, we shed light on reform, repair, refusal, and resistance as paths for transformation.\n\nZooming in on Southeast Louisiana where hundreds of petrochemical processing and manufacturing facilities are located, the first paper examines how Internet access can be reimagined in landscapes shaped by extractive economies. The paper analyzes the challenges that activist and research groups face when using Internet of things (IoT) devices for real-time environmental sensing of air quality due to underdeveloped Internet infrastructures in a region that is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change.\n\nThe second paper engages with the material footprint and environmental implications of computing hardware production. It looks at the \"Right to Repair\" as one approach that challenges corporate control over design and obsolescence of electronic devices. By comparing examples of recent legislation in the EU, India, and the US, and analyzing them through the lens of design justice and discard studies frameworks, it argues that Right to Repair needs to be complemented by a substantial change in industry norms and practices rather than simply attempting to delay the disposal through repair by consumers.\n\nThe third paper examines community resistance to data centers in the United States. In the past years, activists have framed their resistance to data centers along three critiques, namely noise pollution, resource consumption, and lack of public input to permitting processes. The paper investigates how environmental justice activists use formal legal and regulatory processes such as public meetings, petitions, lawsuits, public records requests to organise against new data center developments, and the challenges they meet as part of their organising.\n\nThe fourth paper presents a \"feminist principle of the internet on the environment\" that was developed over several years in transnational collaborative work by practitioners. It addresses the interconnections between gendered online violence against land and environmental defenders on large social media platforms and on-the-ground resistance to extractive industries and outlines a new emancipatory vision for a different internet that centers planetary care and justice for communities and ecosystems.\n\nThe fifth paper presents an analysis of the Internet Architecture Board's (IAB) workshop on \"Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems\", held online in December 2022. It uses an infrastructural lens to analyze which politics are embedded and missing from industry responses to the sector's environmental harms. While international regulatory bodies are slowly coming to terms with the environmental impacts of distributed digital networks, the paper argues that the proposed sustainability solutions are as of yet too narrow in scope.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1976, Joseph Weizenbaum argued that, because “[t]he achievements of the artificial intelligentsia [were] mainly triumphs of technique,” AI had not “contributed” to theory or “practical problem solving.” Weizenbaum highlighted the celebration of performance without deeper understanding, and in response, he articulated a theory mode for AI that could cultivate human responsibility and judgment. We suggest that, given access to Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, Weizenbaum’s performance and theory modes offer urgently-needed vocabulary for public discourse about AI. Working from the perspective of digital rhetoric, we explain Weizenbaum’s theorization of each mode and perform a close textual analysis of two case studies of Open AI’s ChatGPT shared on Twitter to illustrate the contemporary relevance of his modes. We conclude by forecasting how theory mode may inform public accountability of AI.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the release of sex robots in 2017 by RealDoll, they have been marketed as companions and sexual fantasies. Social media platforms provide RealDoll and its affiliates the opportunity to justify and celebrate the creation of a responsive sex robot directly to the public and potential consumers. To expand the fourth level of abstraction of mass media within the social construction of technology theory, this paper investigates the Instagram and Twitter pages of the technological segment of RealDoll, Realbotix, and the most prevalent RealDoll affiliate, Brickdollbanger. Framed by Fairclough’s (2012) perspective of critical discourse analysis, I reviewed a combined 1,016 Tweets and Instagram posts to analyze the process of enrollment by key actors in relation to the design of sex robots and the sex robot industry. Results indicate humor and explicit images are utilized to market the sexual capabilities of the sex robots versus ideas of love and companionship. This paper adds to human-machine communication literature on the design of sex robots by exploring the sex-forward messaging not fully present in other marketing materials of Realbotix.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to hinder attacks on democratic norms and processes in digital public venues, designing strategies of exclusion is a pressing concern. Nevertheless, we lack systematic studies of how digital public venues should be governed to protect – rather than undermine – democratic values through exclusion. The purpose of this contribution is to offer a systematic theorization of the concept of democratic exclusion in the context of digital public venues. I will in particular draw on two strands of literature within democratic theory which have contributed greatly to the normative theorization of democratic exclusion, but have done so in relation to other types of political settings: the works within feminist political theory on exclusion of dominant groups within parliaments (e.g. Dovi 2009; Murray 2014) and the literature on hate speech regulation and democratic self-defence against (primarily) antidemocratic parties (e.g. Müller 2016; Invernizzi Accetti and Zuckerman 2017; Malkopoulou and Kirshner 2019). First, I will analyze if and how these previous contributions can be applied to the specific context of digital public venues, where special conditions of access and visibility apply. I will then assess to what extent the platforms’ existing governing strategies and policies concerning the exclusion of problematic content or accounts are compatible with the relevant exclusion principles formulated in these works. Building on this analysis, in its final parts the study will move on to carve out more specific suggestions for how exclusion on digital venues should be governed, and what principles should guide this governance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data quality facilitates data interoperability for optimal decision-making in smart cities datafication. But there are few studies on how technologists (e.g., data scientists), governance people (e.g., municipal workers), and third-party collaborators (e.g., smart city services vendors) assess data quality together in smart cities datafication. This paper offers a response to this knowledge gap, using interviews (n=10) with municipal workers, data scientists and smart city services vendors, and data structure documents (n=8) in a situated case, the Stavanger (Norway) smart city. Implicit the paper’s results is that data quality is a floating signifier – comprising the different articulations of data scientists, municipal workers and services vendors in assessment. This generates friction with implications on data interoperability. This paper therefore posits that assessing data quality in smart cities datafication is ambiguous, but not empty. It fluctuates between the articulations of data scientists, municipal workers, and services vendors, with implications on data interoperability through the friction this generates.\n\nKeywords: data quality, data interoperability, floating signifier, frictions, smart city datafication</jats:p>",

Our results shed light on which content is prioritized by TikTok on a global scale, and introduces the notion of ‘platform-mediated proximity’ - i.e., the clustering of countries according to patterns of co-recommendations promoted by the platform. Preliminary results obtained on a subset of the data suggest that TikTok’s cross-national content prioritization patterns generate forms of platform-mediated proximities that, in most cases, follow geographical lines of clustering at the regional level, with notable and interesting exceptions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cloud infrastructure platforms underpin most of today’s internet, functioning as the operating system of the internet and representing the most important source of revenue for Big Tech companies. While most of the current hype around (“generative”) AI is focused on specific successful products and initiatives like OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E 2) and Stability AI (Stable Diffusion), they would not have been possible without the significant infrastructural support and investments from Big Tech companies. This paper critically examines what we call Big AI, or those types and deployments of AI that simply would not be feasible or even possible without the infrastructural support, partnerships, or investments provided by Big Tech companies. To account for this, we articulate the key components of AI and how they are connected. By focusing on Big Tech’s own products and service offerings, third-party applications, and models, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of what Big AI is, or looks like today, and what it may become in the years to come—for which the infrastructure is being made right now. Further, we make a distinction between the cloud platform products and service offerings from Big Tech (i.e. the cloud as an infrastructure for AI) and Big Tech as the host or provided of marketplaces for diverse (AI-based) products and services from third-party businesses and developers (i.e. the cloud as a marketplace for AI). Overall, this research provides the basis for a better understanding of the critical political economy of (Big) AI.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have critiqued the care-less legal and technical aspects of governments’ data disclosure of COVID-19 patients’ information. Yet, while there were many reported cases of public shaming of COVID-19 patients, not many studies have examined citizens’ usage and engagement with publicized data. In our study, we direct attention to citizens’ care-less engagement with COVID-19 patients’ data through the case study of the “Itaewon outbreak.” In May 2020, the gay community in South Korea became the target of public surveillance after it was revealed that a person who tested positive had visited a gay club in Seoul’s multicultural district Itaewon. Using the anonymized demographic and location data disclosed by the government, the news media sensationally reported on the data by highlighting the visitors’ presumed gay sexuality. In response, citizens widely circulated the data across social media by drawing on social media's popular culture of surveillance and call-outs. We describe these processes of interpreting and shaping pandemic data through social media’s participatory culture as data pop culture. To analyze data pop culture, we first examine the dominant data imaginaries cultivated through news media and government reports on pandemic data disclosure and how they inform the public’s understanding of data. Then, we examine how these dominant data imaginaries create power relations between people on social media as data owners and data objects. Lastly, we illustrate how these data imaginaries and relations become reproduced through social media popular culture and their implications.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rise of Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs), Chinese digital creative industries are no longer a realm of self-entrepreneurship but are dominated by professional service agencies and platforms. At the same time, the Chinese-style market economy and state-led platformization have spawned a unique platform ecology, shaping Chinese digital creative industries and labor subjectivity in its own unique way.\n\nThis study contributes to digital entrepreneurship in a non-Western context by exploring the characteristics and risks of Chinese digital laborers amid state-led platformization. Through a qualitative analysis of 203 recruitment advertisements of major MCNs in China, the finding reveals that Chinese digital laborers are trapped in a state/capitalist duopoly. On the surface, recruitment advertisements posted by MCNs create a low-threshold, flexible working environment. But in essence, they reflect the precarious working conditions of contemporary digital laborers under MCNs’ systematic business model. In a crude way, MCNs transformed digital entrepreneurs who previously relied on self-promotion into aesthetic laborers in front of the camera. At the same time, laborers behind the camera are a group of playful workaholics at great risk of being exploited for free. They are compelled to involuntarily internalize the pressures of hyper-productivity and undertake trivial emotional labor. Beyond the risks of the platformed digital economy, I argue that digital laborers of MCNs have become a form of state labor that is expected to contribute to national development agendas while embodying the national character that the state promotes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Much scholarship and public discourse alike focus on TikTok’s widespread uptake by young people, including LGBTQ+ youth. However, LGBTQ+ people on the platform often experience challenges relating to visibility and censorship. As users of a variety of ages have joined TikTok’s youthful population, this paper explores the sociotechnical practices of older LGBTQ+ TikTok users as they emerge from, and are shaped by, the platform and its user cultures. It does so through an analysis of older LGBTQ+ TikTokers’ videos and metadata, gathered through novel methods for configuring research accounts to serve up this content to the For You page. Once the accounts were trained to deliver this content through TikTok’s personalized algorithmic curation, videos were collected for one hour per day over a duration of approximately 4 weeks for each account. Preliminary visual and textual analysis of videos indicates recurrent themes related to constructing identities that intersect age with sexual identity, giving advice, sharing about personal experiences and queer history, and circulating counter-discourses against homophobia and transphobia as well as messages of solidarity with targets of discrimination. Analysis of how these users negotiate TikTok’s affordances also indicates that platform’s features, policies, and dominant user practices permeate and shape older LGBTQ+ TikTokers’ self-representations, such that the platform and modes of paying attention to it have become a central element of their content.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous studies have shown digital platforms commodify social reproduction labor. How social media platforms and the influencers’ activities intersect with the field of social reproduction has received scant academic attention. This study explores platform capitalism's expansion to the domestic sphere in the semi-peripheral socio-economic context. Fifty semi-structured interviews with influencers, their business partners, and other stakeholders in Slovenia were conducted. Results show that social media influencing intersects with the social reproduction sphere in two different ways, depending on whether the household is time- or money-poor. Time-poor households employ influencing to find an optimal temporal equilibrium between influencer activities and household responsibilities. Money-poor households employ influencing as a side hustle besides regular employment to have one household expense less. These two groups converge as they all create content \"on the go\" while completing social reproduction tasks. Influencing is peering into the cracks between work and leisure, creating a novel dimension of time: monetized leisure. Under the traditional 8-8-8 rule (work, leisure, sleep), only 8 hours were paid. With influencing activities on social media, leisure gets monetized, resulting in more hours of work and passive income. Our study shows that influencing activities on social media in Slovenia are less about getting paid to do what you love, as demonstrated by Duffy (2017) and more about getting paid to care for those you love. The study contributes to the varieties of platform capitalism and to the de-westernization of platform and creator studies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Like, Comment, and Share are ubiquitous features and central elements of engagement on social media platforms. Yet the values promoted by such features remain an open question. We propose the concept of value affordances, defined as the set of ethical, aesthetic, and relational principles that emerge from the interaction between different stakeholders and technological infrastructures. We develop a novel method for studying value affordances through focus groups to explore the engagement features of Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Across platforms, our participants agreed that engagement features promote expression, care, and community, aligning with how companies promote their platforms. They also agreed that engagement features hinder privacy, mindfulness, peace, and safety, echoing public concerns about the harmful consequences of social media. Their accounts typically downplayed the role of technology, instead emphasizing user agency and responsibility. We discuss how users navigate tradeoffs in the value affordances of social media through creative strategies to negotiate, downplay, or even resolve these tensions. These include using features antagonistically, avoiding using specific features, or using features in more limited contexts like groups or direct messages. Users also negotiate value tradeoffs through how they assign responsibility for promoting or hindering particular values. While our participants consistently emphasized the agency of users, they differentiated responsibility into categories of \"us\" and \"them,\" identifying with positive actions that promote values and blaming others for negative actions that hinder values.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Whilst the internet’s development can be traced back to the 1940s (Turner, 2006; Flichy 2015), the rhetoric of a digital revolution primarily emerged during the early 1990s and mid-00s and was often produced by the US-based academic community which has been intrinsically involved with the advancement of the internet. The dominant conceptualizations put forward in their popular, scholarly writings about the technology’s past and future, became authoritative in our academic understanding of the internet’s social impact and significance. Subsequently, notions like ‘the electronic highway’ were adopted in legislative and popular discourse which, in turn, influenced how the internet was understood, designed, and used on a broader, societal level.\n\nNotable authors of these influential texts - Howard Rheingold, Nicholas Negroponte, Sherry Turkle, and Geert Lovink - wrote their findings based on their own experiences with internet initiatives and from their particular theoretical backgrounds and positionality. Most importantly, these texts present valuable information as if coming from a time capsule; often framed with a rhetoric of transformation, the writers themselves contribute to the idea of a revolutionary internet following optimistic notions of digital utopianism and technological solutionism, situated in a particular Zeitgeist. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of how these revolutionary notions developed over time and what their grander impact was on our contemporary conceptions, in and outside the influential American context. This is achieved by conducting a critical, historiographical analysis of canonical, intellectual literature about the early internet and thus re-contextualizes it as historical traces itself.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent research, video games have been implicated as vehicles for feelings of nostalgia. Retrogames present a unique context in which to explore the elicitation of nostalgia, especially historical nostalgia among younger gamers who may lack first-hand experience with older games and gaming technologies. As part of a larger study investigating nostalgia and retrogames, n = 102 younger individuals wrote briefly about their thoughts and feelings after playing the game Double Dragon II, a video game representative of the “Beat ‘em Up” genre popular in the 1990s. Via a thematic analysis, we identified eight themes clustered into three groups: retrogames as unique experiences, retrogames and important others, and retrogames and the self. Players connected their feelings of nostalgia to distinctive features of retrogames and the experience of playing them, social thoughts, and recollections (mostly involving close friends and family), and their own personal identities via autobiographical memory. The present findings align with previous research on nostalgia more broadly and illustrate some unique aspects of nostalgic experiences evoked by retrogames. Our data have implications for how younger players take up and experience video game history through replaying retrogames of yesteryear, and might explain the enduring and increasing popularity of retrogames among myriad gaming cohorts. Furthermore, this research adds conceptual refinement to historical nostalgia (nostalgia for bygone eras), and introduces the notion of vicarious nostalgia as a perception of how others (such as parents and older siblings) would experience and make sense of older media content from their respective generations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital platforms have modified conspiracy theory communication as they enable users to publicly share their support, to circumvent traditional gatekeepers, and to form like-minded communities. However, the impacts of conspiracy discourses differ greatly between platforms. By drawing on critical platform studies, this article introduces a theoretical and analytical framework to investigate the interplay and mutual shaping between “alternative” platforms and conspiracy theory communication, which we describe as the _platformization of conspiracism_. Along the four interconnected dimensions of our framework – _infrastructure_, _economic model_, _governance_, and _user culture_ of platforms – we examine _BitChute_ and _Gab_ in the context of conspiracy theory communication. To investigate the platforms' technological features, business model, and governance practices, we conduct a documentation analysis of media reports and the platforms own news updates alongside an in-depth examination of each platform's functionality and interface. To gain insights into the user culture, i.e., the key characteristics and monetizing strategies of conspiracy theory propagators, we analyze 20 prominent conspiracy theory channels and profiles from BitChute and Gab, respectively. Findings from our study shed light on how both platforms have positioned themselves as technological equivalents to their “mainstream” counterparts by offering similar features and how they differ from their counterparts by presenting themselves as defenders of free speech. At the user level, our findings suggest that both platforms provide conspiracy propagators a fertile refuge through which they can maintain their presence and connection with their followers – which also allows them to profit from their visibility by receiving monetary rewards.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the majority of Augmented Reality (AR) scholarship is based in Computer Science disciplines, it is nevertheless important to consider emergent trends in AR discourses as research and development shifts from technology labs to media markets. While technical understandings of AR are necessary, they are insufficient to understand how networked spatial computing is augmenting everyday life. In response, this paper maps and compares two specific AR discourses for nodes of power and authority. First, it systematically reviews how AR research citations are shifting from science and technical foci to applied uses of AR via a systematic scientometric review. That work allows, among other insights, consideration of the extent disciplinary boundaries shaped how AR is understood and innovated. Second is contrasting these evolving patterns with current consumer exposure to AR via a critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) of the presentation of phone-based AR apps available on the iOS App Store and Google Play. Comparative discussion of these inquiries adds to understandings of how AR is conceptualised in research and commercial discourses, and how these data might inform future research and practice in the socialisation of AR systems, media, and experience.</jats:p>",

    "title": "SUCCESS AS ANTITHETICAL TO SAFETY: RESEARCHING THE FAR RIGHT IN AN ACADEMIC CONTEXT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Academics are increasingly understood as a ‘vulnerable population’, with researchers being exposed to networked harassment, threats, attacks to credibility, and vicarious trauma. However, protection measures from these risks are often antithetical to the neoliberal emphasis on individual responsibility, production, and success metrics. Prioritising public scholarship, publications, and digital presence, academics increasingly understand the need to build a profile to have an edge in an incredibly competitive job market. However, the more visible a researcher, the more at risk they are from networked harassment and attention from the broader far right. Whilst attention is increasingly being paid to the issue of researcher welfare and safety, it tends to be either focused solely on individual practices or institutional structures. This paper critiques the broader environment researchers of the far right operate in, particularly focusing on the impact of digital presence and the job market on researcher safety and wellbeing. Drawing from 21 interviews with researchers of the far right, this paper situates their experiences within the broader environment that renders emotional and physical protection inaccessible to most. Situating lived experience within literature on the neoliberalism of academia and the libertarian internet, the results indicate that risk and harm are embedded in the practice of researching the far right with available mitigations experienced as incompatible with success. Those working at the intersections of marginalisation and precarity report making choices that may harm their career in order to safeguard themselves; broader issues in both academia and the online environment are magnified at this intersection.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contributes to the growing body of literature that interrogates the modalities of nostalgia afforded in, by, and through digital media technologies with a focus on its performative dimension within one social formation of nostalgia – the TikTok aesthetic. Drawing on a fine-grained, qualitative artifact analysis of the most viewed video in #nostalgicore on TikTok, this paper asks how the platform’s socio-technical affordances enable and/or constrain Boym’s “restorative” (regressive) and “reflective” (progressive) modalities of nostalgia as a basis for action. Drawing on performance studies and emotion theory, I conceptualize nostalgia as “emotive” to foreground its performative dynamics and allow for further study of nostalgia as a performance or “narrative event” that articulates time, space, and affective feeling. Through the interplay of TikTok’s temporal and spatial affordances, I find that TikTok permits the feeling of the \"thick present\" to emerge, encouraging liminal, fever dream-like performances of nostalgia in which young people imaginatively construct nostalgic worlds. I argue that this practice constitutes a form of digital placemaking that resists normative assumptions of nostalgia operating on a linear temporal horizon of action (i.e., backward/past vs. forward/future) as it is made, remade, and algorithmically circulated. Contributing to recent work on “algorithmic nostalgia,” these findings suggest that creative and mnemonic practices are entangled in algorithmically structured aesthetic social formations of nostalgia and invite further consideration to how TikTok encourages the “mnemonic imagination” through performance.\n\nKeywords: nostalgia, TikTok, performance, temporality, affect, social media affordances</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In Israel and Palestine, as in many countries, the majority of journalists operate an account on Twitter for different purposes, from news gathering and reporting to attracting new audiences and maintaining a relationship with their readers (Hanusch &amp; Bruns, 2017). Many studies of Twitter’s journalistic role have examined journalists’ tweeting practices and the ways in which Twitter serves as an organizational and individual branding tool (e.g., Molyneux, Holton, &amp; Lewis, 2018). However, only a few studies have examined the patterns of tweet deletion among journalists. Ringel and Davidson (2022) conceptualized the practice of tweet deletion as an instance of “proactive ephemerality, a social media phenomenon that occurs when users intentionally remove their own content from their social media profiles manually or with the aid of mechanical tools” (p. 1218). In this study, we examine the motivations of Arab-Palestinian journalists who operate in Israel for deleting their tweets. Based on semi-structured interviews with Arab-Palestinian journalists working in Israel, we seek to understand why they proactively erase tweets. Further, we wish to consider the implications of such an act for Twitter’s functioning as a public record.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF AI AS PLATFORM: INFRASTRUCTURES, POWER, AND THE AI INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The artificial intelligence (AI) sector is experiencing rapid growth, with a projected market size of $1.3 trillion by 2032 according to industry reports. The landscape shifted significantly with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, prompting major players like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, alongside popular apps such as TikTok and Snapchat, to make substantial investments in AI. There has been an influx of new AI products and updates, reshaping the industry’s structure and scale. Additionally, there has been a surge in acquisitions and investments in AI startups, particularly by Big Tech firms. Furthermore, partnerships between AI and major tech companies have proliferated, solidifying their dominant positions. In fact, as Kak and Myers West succinctly state, ‘There is no AI without Big Tech’, raising critical issues around industry concentration and the political economy of AI.\n\nThis panel posits that the driving force behind these transformative shifts is the evolution of AI as a platform. This evolution effectively propels the platformisation of AI, facilitating the integration of AI across diverse industry sectors. The resultant ‘industrialisation’ of AI marks the expansion of AI systems across various sectors and industries, triggering investments in necessary computational resources and posing challenges for governing AI. In short, this underscores that AI is much more than just a standalone application or tool, such as ChatGPT; it is a foundational technical system that underpins a broad array of apps and services.\n\nIn this context, the panel recognises the recent ‘infrastructural turn’ in media and internet studies, deliberately steering away from speculative discussions about the future impacts of AI. Instead, the emphasis shifts towards a focus on the ‘mundanity and ordinariness of existing systems’. This highlights the importance of studying the foundational infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that shape AI development. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of the associated supply chains, investments, acquisitions, forms of ownership and support, control mechanisms, and the broader political economy surrounding AI. Such perspectives have been developed, for example, to study AI’s industry relations in healthcare, the global digital marketing and advertising industries, journalism, or the automotive industry.\n\nThe panellists examine how AI may be viewed as a platform, presenting critical perspectives on the platformisation of AI and its implications for industry relations and the media landscape. Through four distinct studies, they highlight: (1) the influence of platforms on the emerging AI ecosystem and their consolidation of power through reliance on cloud infrastructure, (2) the evolution of cloud infrastructure in the political economy of AI, (3) the actualisation of AI as a platform with ‘general-purpose’ applications, and (4) how challenges in machine vision shape innovation in AI. Each contribution revolves around a central question: How is AI, particularly within the AI sector, evolving under the influence of platform logic? In doing so, the panellists offer valuable insights informed by platform theory and methodologies, exploring their relevance for a comprehensive examination of AI and the broader AI sector. Furthermore, their perspectives provide methodological insights into understanding the material conditions and critical political economy of AI as a platform.\n\nCollectively, these studies seek to advance the critical discourse on AI and its political economy, with a specific emphasis on the AI industry. They shed light on the evolving landscape of AI industry relations and dependencies within the platform ecosystem, tracing how these relationships have transformed over time.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces reciprocal digital methods, a novel research framework tailored to the exigencies of studying social media in what has been called a post-API landscape (Bruns, 2019; Freelon, 2018). In this paper we build on scholarly discourse on the epistemology and ethics of social media data (Lomborg &amp; Bechmann, 2014; Marres &amp; Gerlitz, 2016), and the current debates about the future of social media research (Bruns, 2019; Freelon, 2018; Ohme &amp; Araujo, 2022; Tromble, 2021). We propose a model that is intended to push the field forward, merging approaches to social media that have been largely disparate, and combining computational analysis of user-level digital trace data and interviews with the same users.\n\nWe argue that user perspectives and digital trace data should not be considered as separate methods but as part of a reciprocal exchange and a broader methodological pluralism (Danermark et al., 2019). Digital data, while rich in potential insights, often lacks the context necessary to interpret user behavior and platform interaction accurately. Conversely, interviews provide depth and narrative but are generally not reliable for capturing use patterns. By combining these two elements, the proposed methodology enables researchers to bridge the gap between narrative and pattern, and between media use and media practice. Moreover, we propose that inviting users into the quantitative analysis process can help correct for the noted lack of agency users have had in big data studies (Bishop &amp; Kant, 2023).</jats:p>",

In this panel, we examine some of the ways digital childhood is mediated through Industry. In particular, we explore the ways that children, their families, policymakers and the wider public all contribute to the construction of, what can be thought of as, the ‘digital childhood industry’. This panel is concerned with the myriad ways that digital industries both benefit and are challenged by practices of children, their families, and policymakers. The papers in the panel are purposely diverse to showcase the breadth of the digital childhood industry. Each paper has a focal point on children, the internet, and the industry that often mediates the relationship between the two. From critically examining children’s play on Roblox, surfacing policymaker discourses about children's social media, exploring children’s perspectives on video games, showcasing the digital labour of contemporary parenthood, and investigating children’s digital play and wellbeing, this panel highlights the digital childhood industry from several starting points.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, X and TikTok are the “new governors” or “custodians” of the Internet (Klonick 2018; Gillespie 2018). How they moderate global speech online affects the communication practices of billions of people and it can make or break social movements and political resistance, and generally be a critical risk factor for human rights violations. These platforms are increasingly joined by states, international organizations, civil society, journalists and others in defining and interpreting the limitations of speech online, be it through legislation, guidelines or by helping platforms to distinguish misinformation from legitimate content. In parallel, researchers ponder questions concerning the legitimacy of various approaches of content moderation (Haggart &amp; Keller 2021; Suzor 2019), which must extend to the question of which actors ought to fulfill which function in the moderation of content. A legitimate content moderation constellation (and potentially division of labor) is arguably one that is perceived to be legitimate by the “governed” themselves (for whatever qualities are appraised by them). As of today, however, we have little empirical knowledge about what users actually think about content moderation. The current paper presents novel empirical evidence on how users perceive platform content moderation and how they perceive content moderation roles of different governors of speech. The quantitative analysis is based on a survey of more than 15,000 Facebook and Instagram users in 33 countries in the Global South and Eastern Europe, which was conducted in six languages in late 2022 and early 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>New forms of facial recognition, aggression detection systems, bus routing optimization software, generative AI detection, and online exam proctoring: the edtech industry is rapidly increasing its influence over schools and universities by introducing new AI-powered products and services. As the ubiquity and complexity of AI systems intensifies, deliberation among practitioners about immediate and long-term risks is becoming ever more challenging.\n\nTo help education practitioners and administrators critically explore these systems and deliberate about their consequences, this paper presents the prototype of an edtech assessment toolkit. The toolkit is embedded in a body of work aiming to make technical democracy a key feature in the design, implementation, and use of public sector AI systems. This prototype brings awareness to the potential of participatory design to explore the accountability, transparency, and governance of AI-based systems through collective forms of experimentation.\n\nThe paper itself consists of four parts. First, it puts forward a framework for technical democracy to govern AI systems through shared uncertainty. Secondly, it presents how the toolkit has been co-created to encourage collective learning and experimentation. Thirdly, it highlights three tools that have emerged from a series of workshops, collaborations, and dialogues: the counter-archive, the issues register, and the possibilities matrix. The paper finishes by discussing how this methodology produces an exploratory tool for enacting technical democracy design experiments to interrupt the design and implementation of AI into the public sector by making spaces that value dissensus over consensus in an age of automated decision-making.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Webcam sex platforms have grown into a multi-billion industry over the past few decades and host large populations of performers. Success on these platforms is often framed in terms of appearing higher in the algorithmically ranked performance list on their homepage. However, among webcam performers, focusing on a smaller, niche audience is a recognized strategy. This suggests that financial success on these platforms takes a variety of forms and manifests beyond merely ‘ranking higher’.\n\nTo better understand the different ways the platform affords financial success for its performers, we collected public ranking, viewership and tip data from Chaturbate, one of the largest camming platforms, over a two-week period in July 2022. We use an array of analysis techniques and arrive at three preliminary findings. Firstly, we find a pronounced winners-take-all distribution of tips on Chaturbate, strongly correlating with viewership and homepage ranking. Secondly, we identify low-ranking performers with substantial earnings, suggesting viable paths to sustainable income beyond seeking front-page visibility. Thirdly, we uncover niche-visibility areas linked to specific labels and tags, where performers often rely on small numbers of generous tippers, or 'whales'.\n\nOur findings reinforce previous academic observations concerning the competitive environment in webcam sex as well as creator industries at large. Yet, we also discern alternative income-generation strategies beyond high homepage ranking. However, the strong reliance on whale tippers within more niche areas of content underscores the precarity in the industry, and the fact that performers ultimately remain dependent on a combination of platform affordances and viewer attention.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to theorize the parasocial relationships between podcast creators and listeners, but with a unique focus on the perspective of the creators themselves. While parasocial relationships are typically studied from the perspective of the audience, understanding the creator's viewpoint can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of these relationships and the modes of addressivity they evoke, particularly with the emergence of intimacy as a keyword in podcast studies (Swiatek, 2018; Spinelli &amp; Dann, 2019; Euritt, 2020, 2023). Through in-depth interviews with prominent podcasters in the Israeli podcast scene, we explore: How do podcast creators imagine their listeners? How are these imagined listeners shaped by the creators’ personal dispositions, their own experiences as podcast listeners, their assumptions about podcasting as a medium, and their actual interactions with their listeners? We argue that the starting point for the postulated intimacy between podcasters and listeners is an imagined addressee whom the podcaster conceives as similar to themselves. Just as authors imagine their audience as they write novels, we assume that the creator’s imagined audience impacts the actual audience that emerges. We also argue that this addressee is brought into being through a shared understanding of intimacy as authenticity, even though only the notion of intimacy actually implies some form of relationship. In making these arguments, we propose a typology of different kinds of imagined relationships with perceived listeners, contributing to a more complex understanding of podcasting and its cultural meaning.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The widespread collection of vehicle data poses many privacy and justice issues. With the increasing datafication of vehicles, new questions are emerging, which are troublingthe imaginaries of different actors. This paper asks: How does the future-oriented imaginary of datafication relate to current practices in vehicle data, particularly for policing? At the same time, how is this imaginary unfolding as privacy/justice concerns for activists and regulators? It draws from semi-structured interviews with over 30 people working on algorithmic surveillance—including police officers and surveillance manufacturers, but also activists and regulators. It also builds on fieldwork conducted at policing/traffic conferences, particularly sessions on “the future” or “emergent technologies”.\n\nIt finds: 1) In direct relation to Gekker &amp; Hind’s (2019) concept of “infrastructural surveillance”, that vehicles are already imagined as connected computers, constantly generating surveillance data. Among activists and regulators, this future leads to anxiety around function creep, as manufacturers may decide to change their policies, or new forms of analysis may be enabled for policing; 2) How concern over a future of data excess exists, particularly for policing institutions. This is responded through increased efforts of data integration and a techno-solutionist narrative of AI, but also smaller interventions. For activists, this relates to wider fears over \"predictive policing\" and its injustices.\n\nThe paper thus contributes to critical data studies literature, supporting renewed considerations for privacy and justice frameworks in a world where vehicles act as infrastructures for constant surveillance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cloud providers, by creating and owning massive computing assets, produce new internet infrastructure. Large-scale data centres that aggregate hardware resources are an important element shaping the expansion of platform economies. The impact of this configuration of hardware on the dynamics of software development is still unclear. There is growing scholarship on data centres, however the aggregation of a highly scalable hardware system has a profound impact on industry dynamics. Cloud computing lowers the upfront cost of using and owning computing systems. The wide-ranging impact of platforms is explained at least in part by cloud infrastructure: the scalable provisioning of computing resources via the internet. I identify virtualized hardware, modularity, resource sharing, and externalisation as generative of a new internet-based infrastructure. I show these coalesce to form a new industry dynamic, with hardware centralisation on the one hand and decentralisation of cloud users and complement developers on the other. Scholarship in this area is beginning to examine the relations between dominant technology corporations and their networks of users and third-party companies. I contribute to this by examining changing organizational and market dynamics introduced by cloud computing. The findings and analysis are derived from two related studies of changing industrial practices. I focus on the anatomy of the infrastructure and how it activates a new set of relations between start-ups, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors. What is the techno-organisational structure of cloud computing? In answering this, the presentation will offer a view into cloud ecosystems from an industry level and organisational level.</jats:p>",

These include strategic data storytelling to confront bias and stigma from industry leadership, triangulation of data through multiple methodologies and sources to combat skepticism around qualitative data, using ethnographic analysis as an engine for synthesizing data across different models, maintaining the fast-paced operational speed required in the industry, and working within the tension between leadership and their publics.\n\nOur insights are primarily based on our own research experience. However, we also connect our experiences and methodologies with scholarly theory on ethnographic definitions/key concepts, informal discussion ethnography, ethics in digital ethnography, and triangulation of varied sources and perspectives in ethnography.\n\nWe have been conducting digital ethnography for almost two decades. We draw from this extensive body of work, including perspectives on how online behavior and platform changes have influenced our research methods.\n\nWe not only bring scholarly ethnographic theory into industrial arenas but also have extensive experience operationalizing these theories in live settings due to the fast pace at which we complete projects for clients.\n\nOur work continues with a diverse client base across government, healthcare, education sectors among others.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Indian women activists are increasingly integrating digital strategies in their fight against the burning issue of sexual violence. Their digital strategies help them navigate the Indian socio-digital landscape, which is an extension of the sociocultural context they live in. There are limited studies in the area of digital feminist activism emerging from the Global South, especially from the context of post-colonial India. There is a concerning gap in the literature on this topic when it comes to understanding the factors that shape women's digital activism against sexual violence. Therefore while addressing this gap, this paper investigates digital activism by Indian women against sexual violence under the overarching question of; what are the rhetorical practices of digital feminist protest by Indian women activists against sexual violence? Anchored in the framework of postcolonial feminism, I examine the journey of the local Indian women to digital activism; to understand their motivation and access to digital technology. My interviews with 20 Indian women activists from diverse backgrounds within the Indian landscape reveal the factors that shape their journey to digital activism. This paper contributes to understanding the role class, status, and geographical location play in women's journey to digital activism against sexual violence, within a post-colonial Global South country as India.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel focuses on the relationship of emerging creator economies to conditions of precarity, as they have come to develop in several distinct yet partially overlapping social, historical, and geographical contexts, including: Dalit mobile street performances in Haryana, India; YouTube street interview videos recorded in China, Japan and South Korea; the digital circulation of ethnonationalist themes and tropes surrounding the 2024 parliamentary elections in Uttarakhand, India; the resurgence of New Age beliefs and practices on CrystalTok; and, the rise of motivational speakers as political intermediaries in rural areas of neoliberal India. Across these various contexts, emerging creator economies, and the media practices and technologies which constitute them, appear as often attached to various contextually situated promises—of social mobility; political empowerment; cultural recognition; fame and wealth; or healing and relief from systemic forms of harm. This panel considers how various individuals, social groups, and organizations have, through participation in and strategic engagement with emerging creator economies, sought to achieve at least one (and in some cases, multiple) of the above listed goals and objectives. Utilizing a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches that collectively prioritize ambivalence and contextual nuance over sweeping generalizations, each of these five papers in some way balances an interest in the unique social and political potentials that emerging creator economies have helped (or might help) to realize, in a given context, with a critical awareness of the systemic forms of inequality, political disempowerment, and social and psychological immiseration that creator economies have both contributed to and intensified.</jats:p>",

The project will utilize a critical framework of algorithmic literacy to consider avenues for empowering so-far overlooked stakeholders of AI tool use in this creative industry sector.\n\nThe paper presents findings from a survey of 1,074 PR and communications content writers and their managers/ employers and from 21 follow-up interviews with the same stakeholders. It will explore the realities of automated authorship and the opportunities and limitations that algorithmic literacy might bring in enhancing smaller stakeholder algorithmic empowerment and expertise. Findings suggest that a) generative text AI is increasingly being used by content writers in ways that challenge speculative forecasts of generative text use and that b) these tools are useful for saving time, idea generation and synthesising existing text, but cannot (yet) be used to replicate or generate authorially convincing tone of voice or brand identity. Such findings suggest that critical algorithmic literacy could be used to create dialogues in workplaces that foreground the problems related to automated authorship - especially in terms of promoting human expertise, challenging algorithmic power and reforming the boundaries of creative subjectivity.</jats:p>",

We can look at digital media as environments that offer young people agency and spaces where they can construct and perform their identity (boyd 2014) through bricolage practices (Willett 2008) and by experimenting with their own selves, also with regard to gender and intimacy (Ferreira 2021; Metcalfe &amp; Llewellyn 2020; Scarcelli 2015; De Ridder 2017; Livingstone &amp; Mason 2015). Studies have also devoted attention to communicative interactions (e.g.,“sexting”), investigating both the incorporation of and resistance to specific gender and sexual ideologies (Ringrose et al. 2013; Scarcelli 2020).\n\nThe aim of our paper is to analyse how Italian teenagers (aged 15-18) (re)define their understanding of gender and intimacy by engaging with digital media and incorporating it into their daily lives. In the first step of our research we are conducting six focus groups with students (15-18) from secondary schools in six cities located in three Italian regions. In the second step, we will carry out in depth semi-structured interviews with teenagers. The combination of these methods will allow to explore topics such as teenagers' digital practices in relation to performing gender identities and sexual orientation on different platforms; teens’ interaction with others in relation to intimate practices; the use of specific platforms for homosocial interaction; use of digital resources to seek information about gender; digital media representations. Results cover a wide set of digital practices, organised along three (interrelated) dimensions: gender, sexuality and intimate relationships.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Indian state’s move towards the digitalisation of the health sector has serious implications for how health care is availed and experienced by the people, especially the poor. When biometric identity systems are established for authorisation and verification, people are forced to meet the demands of technical systems for accessing healthcare. What kinds of relations are formed through these biometric-based information assemblages? What are the materialities of patient data and experiences within these information assemblages? How health data is organised, accessed, and controlled within the territorialities of the digital? This paper will look into the rise of datafication of health information and the making of biometric-based Unique Health Identification Number (UHID) in India with the case of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and the subsequent Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). The ABHA number is a 14-digit identifier distinguishing individuals within India's digital healthcare system. It is a unique identity linked to Aadhaar, facilitating enrolment in Personal Health Records (PHR), and the public insurance scheme -Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). With a case study of the South Indian states of Kerala and Puducherry, the paper investigates the norms of governmentalities in datafication by looking into the requirements and conditions of enrolment into the databases for accessing healthcare. The paper looks at datafication as a technique for population management and problematises how enrolment into health identity systems becomes a condition for citizens' rights to access healthcare.</jats:p>",

    "title": "“THE ALGORITHM IS YOUR MOM”: PLAYFUL ALGORITHMIC AGENCY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC FELLA ORGANISATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores playful engagement with algorithmic systems among members of the North Atlantic Fella Organisation (NAFO). NAFO are an international social movement that emerged on Twitter in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We use a combination of textual analysis and semi-structured scroll-back interviews, to understand how NAFO members make sense of the algorithmic environment of Twitter, and how their understanding of algorithms affects their daily participation in a social movement. We examine the community’s practices, or allegorithms, through the prism of playful activism.\n\nOur findings reveal that NAFO understand Twitter’s algorithm as both an instrumental and an antagonistic entity. Their self-professed status as an algorithmic actor reclaims power in a fragmented and increasingly hostile environment of Twitter. Instead of seeing algorithms as adversarial or omnipotent, NAFO members engage in playful vernacular practices to reclaim their agency over the information ecosystem.\n\nNAFO do not succeed in fully understanding or rewriting the “rules of the game”, but achieve their objective of propagating civic ideas to ever-increasing international audiences. With the growing interest in harms that arise from online humour and memes, our paper highlights a contrasting and complementary aspect of online humour - the civic nature of playful practices in digitally mediated collectives.</jats:p>",

As research engages multimodal platforms, representing their content (including text, audio, image, and video components) increasingly becomes both important and complex. The AoIR Internet Research Ethics (IRE) 3.0 guidelines stipulate that “we need to elaborate an ethics addressing the distinctive issues clustering around the production, sharing, and thereby research on visual images” (franzke et al., 2020).

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the apparent paradox of hackers engaging in both invading and safeguarding privacy. Drawing on digital materialism, which posits that code holds a material presence and cultural significance beyond its functional role, the research aims to illuminate the hackers' ethical dilemmas embedded in privacy code. To gain insight into the cultural logic behind this seeming contrast, we conducted qualitative content and code analyses on both malicious and non-malicious code projects from the open-source platform GitHub. We have narrowed down a list of 2500 hackers to 52 who own both malicious and non-malicious projects, with a reference to privacy. We found that these hackers justify their malicious projects as educational tools, often cautioning other users against illegal use. The hackers' logic asserts that those possessing private information are responsible for its protection, be it the end-user or the software owner managing the information post-collection. This logic is translated into code using two privacy approaches: a formal privacy-by-policy and a technically-oriented privacy-by-design. The hackers' polar approach to privacy materializes both in violating privacy when crafting breaching code and in writing code that expertly protects it. From this individualized, privatized standpoint, this duality makes perfect sense.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PLATFORMS ON TRIAL: MAPPING THE FACEBOOK FILES/PAPERS CONTROVERSY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Big Tech has been involved in several controversies in recent years. Data leaks, whistleblowers, and social experiments have raised alarms about the dubbed toxic and unaccountable power of platforms and, more broadly, about the increasing crisis of accountability in digital societies (Cooper et al., 2022; Khan, 2018; Marres, 2021). At the intersection of digital sociology, media studies, and STS, this research explores how different actors make and unmake connections between social media platforms and societal harms. The study focuses on mapping a specific platform controversy: the Facebook Files/Papers, a leak in 2021 of internal documents from Meta by the former employee Frances Haugen. The disclosures partially exposed what Meta knew about the consequences of its interface designs, data, and algorithms (Hendrix, 2021; Horwitz, 2021). By combining digital and ethnographic methods, I followed the disclosures across different media settings to analyse how they were made public and which actors, issues, and framings gained prominence during the controversy. As I will show, journalists, advocacy groups, and critics promoted a ‘strategic causalism’ to strengthen the connection between Meta platforms and specific social harms. This was contrasted by the ‘strategic ambiguity’ mobilised by Meta spokespersons to undermine such claims and disperse their responsibility to other actors (e.g. users, malicious actors). The analysis highlights a US-centric theatre of accountability that overlooks crucial issues from the actual disclosures, revealing the asymmetries and displacements when platforms are put on trial.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Text-to-image generation (AI art) has become a mainstream phenomenon since the introduction of DALL-E by OpenAI in January 2021 (Nast, 2023). ). On the one hand, AI art challenges definitions of creativity that center on anthropocentric values and discredits the contributions of artists in the training of these AI models (Knibbs, 2023). On the other hand, it blurs the line between artists and non-artists by enabling new ways of creating art (e.g., prompt engineering: an iterative and experimental text-based process to interact with text-to-image generation models). Regardless of one’s ethical stance, practitioners of AI art, including artists of various skills and non-artists, form and participate in online communities to showcase their wares, share practices and resources, and learn from each other.\n\nThis study uses a topic modeling approach to examine topics within three subreddit communities centered on three text-to-image generation models (r/StableDiffusion, r/midjourney, and r/weirddalle). The analysis, based on the top 500 posts from each subreddit over one month, reveals distinct community foci: r/StableDiffusion emphasizes technological innovations and technical learning, r/midjourney showcases AI art and prompt learning, while r/weirddalle is more competitive, focusing on creative or entertaining results. The study further derives topics from prompts extracted from the images, revealing preferences for popular media characters, high photorealism, and surrealist styles, with a notable emphasis on portraits of women.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) burst into media industries as a cheaper, easier, and faster alternative to produce texts, images and videos. Social scientists are already starting to show how GenAI reinforces stereotypes and discrimination, partly due to gender, race and origin biases in the data used for machine learning. However, less has been said about ageism in GenAI. This is probably because ageist depictions are the norm, and ageism is widely disregarded and deprioritised in research, industry, and society. Building on ageist depictions, the media industry might be reinforcing stereotypes and harming self-perception. In this exploratory research, we analyse whether GenAI produces significant ageist outputs (or not) and to what extent GenAI reinforces age stereotypes through the analysis of 808 images generated with Midjourney. We compared older people's depictions with those of the general population. We employed computer vision and visual analysis to assess if Gen AI falls into associating ageist prejudices with older people. Preliminary results show that generative depictions not only fall into age stereotyping but also exploit mainly harmful tropes, disregarding all the diverse experiences of ageing. Thus, while the media industry has been moving towards an inclusive discourse, the ease of GenAI has burst as a threat to the inclusion of diverse perspectives.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Large-scale automated content moderation on major social media platforms continues to be highly controversial. Moderation and curation are central to the value propositions that platforms provide, but companies have struggled to convincingly demonstrate that their automated systems are fair and effective. For a long time, the limitations of automated content classifiers in dealing with borderline cases have seemed intractable. With the recent expansion in the capabilities and availability of large language models, however, there is reason to suspect that more nuanced automated assessment of content in context may now be possible. In this paper, we set out to understand how the emergence of generative AI tools might transform industrial content moderation practices. We investigate whether the current generation of pre-trained foundation models may expand the established boundaries of the types of tasks that are considered amenable to automation in content moderation.\n\nThis paper presents the results of a pilot study into the potential use of GPT4 for content moderation. We use the hate speech decisions of Meta’s Oversight Board as examples of covert hate speech and counterspeech that have proven difficult for existing automated tools. Our preliminary results suggest that, given a generic prompt and Meta’s hate speech policies, GPT4 can approximate the decisions and accompanying explanations of the Oversight Board in almost all current cases. We interrogate several clear challenges and limitations, including particularly the sensitivity of variations in prompting, options for validating answers, and generalisability to examples with unseen content.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>One recent trend in social media platform practices as well as in proposed policy and regulation for online data rights is a turn towards parental controls. While concerns over children’s safety online and complaints about problematic settings are not necessarily new (Horne, 2021; Horne, 2023), there may be an emerging trend in some countries to try to address growing concerns about the impact of social media platforms by setting regulation on parental controls. To that end, more research is currently needed to study parental controls and age-specific settings for teens and children, as these are comparatively newer developments and a topic and platform feature in flux. This paper contributes to this needed research area by focusing on specific definitions and understandings of privacy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is two-fold. Many social media platforms offer both age-specific privacy settings to children under certain age, as well as parental controls to manage the account of their children. As a result, this study will examine which parental controls are available and how they are offered across some of the most popular social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Discord, and YouTube. The dataset for this study will consist of each social media platform’s: 1. default settings of teen and children’s accounts and 2. parental control options. The analysis will broadly consider how each platform defines parental controls via privacy options.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The body positive and fat activist community is an extensive online network crossing many social media platforms, particularly active on Instagram and TikTok. Social media platforms provide “offer opportunities to support, community and practical solutions to issues” (Kyrölä, 2021, p. 113), and a space for resistance (e.g. Puhakka, 2023) for the body positive and fat acceptance movements.\n\nEven though there is not a commonly agreed set of rules for body positivity or fat activism, the idea of intentional weight loss has largely been rejected by the fat community in favor of encouraging health promoting behaviors without the need for weight loss. However, the previously unified activist front has started to crack as prominent figures within the fat community have taken a sharp turn from #bodypositive content to documenting their #weightlossjourney.\n\nDrawing from heory on master narrative, counter narratives and narrative resistance (Bamberg, 2004; Bamberg &amp; Wipff, 2020; Hochman &amp; Spector‐Mersel, 2020; McLean &amp; Syed, 2015; Meretoja, 2020; Ronai &amp; Cross, 1998), as well as fat studies, I explore online social media weight loss narratives of members of the fat community, as well as the responses from the fat community. More specifically, using digital ethnographic methods, I examine how the weight loss narratives on Instagram and TikTok negotiate between hegemonic narratives and narratives emerging from the fat community.\n\nThe analysis of #weightlossjourney narratives shows how online activist communities can be splintered when versions of the master narrative the communities have collectively resisted become adapted by members of the community.</jats:p>",

In some cases, they have tried to craft more formal arrangements like creator unions, but these have failed to find stability in the platform economy, which operates differently than traditional labor-employer relationships. We point to a different form of collaboration that casts creators as economic rivals that often have directly competing interests rather than as workers with shared interests. To this end, we propose the concept of creator cartels, understood as contingent alliances between creators leveraged to produce beneficial policy and economic conditions. Taking up a critical media industry studies framework, we analyze the struggle between competing creator cartels invested in Twitch’s policies regarding gambling streams, especially the events that played out in September 2022 as anti-gambling streamers threatened a boycott, pro-gambling streamers leaked damaging information about their rivals, and Twitch ultimately decided to curb the forms of gambling creating conflict between many of its highest profile creators. The gambling saga shows that creators ally and collude with each other to produce mutually desirable outcomes, leveraging audiences and advertisers to influence the platform economy. We contend that creator cartels represent a novel organizational practice that both responds to and harnesses platform power, representing a promising area of inquiry for researchers interested in community governance and the conditions of platform labor.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Grounded in a participatory action research (PAR) framework, this project examines how queer individuals experience datafication and surveillance in their daily lives and respond to it. Building on existing literature on both datafication and LGBTQ+ digital practices, we address the tensions around visibility, invisibility and hypervisibility that emerge in queer people’s encounters with the datafied gaze. The research is based on three focus groups and a zine-making workshop, conducted with a small group of LGBTQ+ participants in Glasgow (UK) and involving different creative and participatory activities. We find that participants are aware of the amount of data that is collected about them, and they think that ‘opting out’ is largely unrealistic; they remark on how much this data collection renders them heavily visible online and specifically visible as queer. They highlight two paradoxes: first, that the enactment of safety policies by corporate digital platforms renders queer communities more visible, but not safer; second, that these platforms are sites for the development of queer knowledge but are also extracting it. Further, participants explain the tactics of invisibility they adopt to set boundaries to protect themselves; while they had not previously necessarily thought of them as responding to datafication, they became aware of this connection by participating in our research. Lastly, participants’ experiences show how knowledge about visibility and invisibility circulates within queer communities, leading to mutual learning. By adopting a PAR approach, our project not only documents participants’ experiences but also invites them to co-create empowering knowledge about datafication and surveillance.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper addresses the job experiences of expatriate and remote workers in the Czech game industry through their evaluation of its negative and positive features. The Czech game industry is divided between the video game field of smaller indie teams and the dominant industry incumbents, drawing from the same indie ethos. By using the push-pull migration model, both positive and negatively perceived qualities of the Czech game industry are discussed, complemented by the concept of boundaryless careers to address virtual connections to this production environment by remote workers. Method of repeated semi-structured interviews was employed to cover industry developments in a state of constant flux. 28 participants, mostly belonging to the triad of programmers, artists and designers were interviewed, with 14 from Eastern Europe and 14 from the West (i.e., Western Europe and North and South America). Respondents were pulled to the Czech game industry due to it being highly diversified into many mid-sized companies. However, they were met with shock factors, pushing them to move to other industries. Among them were discrepancies between indie and industrial qualities. Many studios had long-existing live service products, using outdated proprietary engines. Higher company structures were inaccessible due to being occupied by local leads. Similar contention appeared with remote workers, undermining the notion of boundaryless careers void of cultural influences. The Czech game industry was, likewise, evaluated as non-developed concerning labour inclusivity or diversified portfolios of games, with the risk of falling behind in the highly competitive and transnational video game field.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In Drill music, Chicago’s subgenre of Gangsta rap, Black male gang-affiliated recording artists (Drillers) often distribute content on social media platforms to solidify the authenticity of their song lyrics and music videos and validate their own embeddedness in gang territories. Using content analysis of two prominent Drillers’ vlogs, this study examines how YouTube channels serves as important intermediaries to not only circulate one’s music but provide Drillers a valuable reputation management tool. Results of this analysis suggests there are three primary ways that Drillers relate audiences: “signifying” (using humor to discredit a rival’s accusations and appear unbothered), “calling bluffs” (threatening or challenging a rival to retaliate by inviting them to their physical location) and cross referencing (calling attention to private information that contradicts one’s public image through storytelling). These findings show that though publicly crafting violent personas remains central in Black male youth gaining visibility in the corporate rap music industry, through social media entertainment, there are newer and riskier labor practices required for Black male youth seeking to self-authenticate street reputations, monetize, and create community around personas communicated within their music.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In September 2020, the Indian government passed a set of farm laws, which have a pro-market leaning. While the nature of the passing of the bills is debated, largely it is seen as a controversial move, as the bills were passed without proper consultation with the farmers' community. The farmers' community, to create a sympathetic narrative to their own cause, set up a Facebook page called $2 in November. The Facebook page has around five hundred thousand followers and gives daily updates via photos, statuses, and videos about the farmers' protests. This paper looks at digital sites of protest and platform affordances, through which un-informed or unaware hyper-individualised publics are brought in by the protest community to help construct a collective identity. It examines the ongoing farmers’ protest in India and a Facebook page that was specifically created by the protest community called, $2 , and how it is able to create a common collective identity despite the cultural and linguistic differences in India. Using textual and visual analysis, the paper focuses on audio-visual posts on this page with extended captions describing personalised experiences of the farmer protests and helping in the construction of the collective identity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Responding rapidly to extraordinary developments in early 2021, this panel examines the background, development, implementation, and consequences of the latest Australian regulatory intervention in the engagement between content platforms and domestic media organisations: the News Media Bargaining Code (NMBC). The Australian federal government envisioned the NMBC as “a mandatory code of conduct to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media businesses and digital platforms, specifically Google and Facebook”; following a period of consultation that saw substantial public relations campaigning from Google, Facebook, and other content platforms to question the aims and effectiveness of the proposed code, the NMBC bill was sent to federal Parliament in December 2020. Google and Facebook both threatened to remove their services from Australia, or remove Australian news content from their platforms, if the NMBC passed in its original form. Such threats were regarded by some of the NMBC’s proponents as blatant attempts at “bullying” the Australian government to water down the Code, and in pushing ahead with the debate of the NMBC bill in the Australian Parliament the government essentially sought to call the platforms’ bluff – yet in the morning of 18 February 2021, Facebook followed through on its threats and both removed all content from the Facebook pages of Australian news outlets (and from those of other actors mistakenly classified as providing news), and banned any domestic or international users from publishing or accessing any posts that contained links to Australian news sites. The ban remained in force until 26 February, when urgent negotiations between Facebook and the Australian federal government produced a preliminary solution to the crisis. The Code finally became law on 2 March 2021. This panel reviews these turbulent developments. In combination, the four papers on this panel present a comprehensive and multifaceted picture of the News Media Bargaining Code, its context, and implications.</jats:p>",

While California has become a nexus for US debates on the rights of gig labour and tech workers, this coalition focused particularly on intersections of worker rights and environmental justice. The highly polluting air cargo centre, they argued, would worsen air quality and constitute environmental racism in the predominantly Hispanic, working-class San Bernardino. This coalition used creative tactics and data practices informed by place-specific histories of economic and environmental activism, to re-imagine algorithmically mediated work and link it to ongoing struggles. Analyzing primary materials and media coverage of this diverse coalition, we find a strategy unified around economic justice, environmental justice, and community benefits. This case study contributes a framework for worker-centric, site-specific analyses of internet technologies and sustainability. By exploring this intersection, we hope to provide insight into building more equitable internet infrastructures and designing technological systems in solidarity with affected communities, workers, and environments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of app imperialism by exploring the political economy of the Canadian iOS App Store. Building on Dal Yong Jin's concept of \"platform imperialism\", we argue that US companies dominate global app stores through the systematic acquisition of capital resources. App imperialism marks the outsized economic footprint and influence of US companies in national app stores. Using a longitudinal financial dataset, we qualitatively coded the top-50 of revenue-generating game apps in April 2015 and 2016. Distinguishing between value creation (generating revenue) and value capture (appropriating profit) allowed us to determine the plight of Canadian app developers. While the Canadian App Store exhibits a large degree of source diversity, featuring a high number of active app developers, we found the ability of Canadian developers to both create and capture value negligible. US owned developers, publishers, parent-organizations, and intellectual properties, on the other hand, were overrepresented. These initial findings suggest that any potential growth in the Canadian app economy will be increasingly captured by US-owned companies. These results question the effectiveness of Canadian cultural policy frameworks, which have been particularly proactive in supporting Canada-based game studios. While our initial analysis offers just a temporal and regional snapshot of the App Store's political economy, it gestures towards broader critical material issues related to platform capitalism and app diversity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Within video game culture, where the medium's association with masculinity remains strong, it can be difficult for female players to connect with one another or to find safe spaces for play. Without support systems, many drop out of gaming over time. This indicates a need to build greater interdependencies between affected players, to provide interpersonal support and develop collective responses to gaming’s inequalities. Research in other areas suggests that targeted internet communities, such as Facebook groups, could provide space for feminist networking, consciousness-raising, and action, but it also reveals that such spaces have limits. Like games, the internet is often seen as masculinized, meaning explicitly feminist conversations and communities can draw disruptive trolls. Groups that police their boundaries to avoid these problems may implicitly prioritize some participants—i.e. straight, white, cisgender women—over others. This exploratory study analyzes top posts in two gaming forums—one general and one female-specific—to begin assessing if/how online communities for female gamers build interdependencies and raise feminist consciousness. More specifically, it assesses posts about harassment—which is often directed at female players as perceived “outsiders”—to determine if, when, and how toxicity is discussed as a general vs. a gendered problem, as well as if resulting discourses offer opportunities for consciousness-raising and collective action. This paper seeks to help marginalized players build stronger, more inclusive gaming and internet cultures.</jats:p>",

This axiom can be understood as the result of changes in technological regimes and cultural modalities over time and space, and this has been true throughout history. However, continuing exponential growth in the power and ubiquity of computational processing have accelerated this process to the point where new modalities of knowledge production are now available within the course of a human lifetime. We located our analysis at the intersection of several fields of scholarship, including media studies, information science, cultural studies, science and technology studies, and critical data studies. We conclude with an exploration of the carrier wave principle’s real-world consequences and contexts, including implications for privacy, security, identity and subjectivity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the embodied experience of smartphone users in urban darkness, and considers how the geo-locative and network functionality of mobile media impacts upon the perception of safety and risk at night. City spaces at nighttime are often perceived as less safe, and the habitual trust we place in familiar strangers during the day can become imbued with caution, suspicion and fear. Much of the research in this area neglects the impact of both the networked infrastructure of the city – what de Souza e Silva and Sutko (2009) term “net-local space” – and the place of mobile media in people’s nighttime practices and their experience and perception of the urban dark. This paper draws on original ethnographic data collected in Perth and Melbourne from 2015-2017 to examine how mobile devices as both communicative and location-aware interfaces are used to provide women with a perceived or ‘felt’ sense of bodily safety and security, and the potential implications this has on users’ pedestrian traversal of the urban dark. Throughout the paper, our conceptual and ethnographic approach is informed by Merleau-Ponty’s (1945) work on habituation and proprioception, Ihde’s (1993) postphenomenological take on the cultural specificity of the body-technology relation, and Weiss’s (1999) feminist adaptation of the term intercorporeality. The theme of “trust” runs as a thread through this paper, as we unpack the mistrust city dwellers have of the urban dark and how mobile media perceptually ameliorates this embodied sense of risk by extending users communicative reach via location-aware interfaces.</jats:p>",

    "title": "SPODIFY AND NETFLIX AS INNOVATIONS: STREAMING MEDIA HISTORY IN THE LIGHT OF INNOVATION THEORY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Streaming services such as Spotify and Netflix have taken over large portions of the market for music and audiovisual entertainment worldwide. Some have described our current time as the “age of streaming», but the events that led us here has not yet been charted. Most writers who have studied streaming services have included some parts of their history, but the different industries have not yet been compared.This paper is a study of the history of streaming media services under the lens of innovation theory. In this ongoing study, we collect and systematize the findings of earlier published histories of streaming technology. These are contextualised with other genral histories of computer development. We find that streaming media is not one innovation, but a collection of many. Two of the most important events are Steve Jobs' ability to negotiate with all major record companies, and the introduction of \"pirate\" networks such as Napster, Gnutella and Pirate Bay. Counter to many popular characterisations, streaming services are not examples of disruptions in Christensen's terms, but long awaited systemic changes involving technology, economy, rights management and user patterns, including piracy practices.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The nascent literature on platform trust in contexts of the Global South does not yet explain how trust for technology platforms persist or erode in the presence of issues that invite distrust, such as the controversial use of surge pricing in ride-hailing platforms. This paper uses in-depth interviews with 30 users of ride-hailing platforms in Manila to study how attitudes toward surge pricing influence attitudes for ride-hailing platforms. The paper finds that despite respondents’ negative attitudes toward surge pricing amid doubts on its fairness and transparency, trust for ride-hailing platforms persist. Persistence of trust is partly due to users’ rational experiences indicating that ride-hailing platforms provide net benefits despite the possibility of unfair surge pricing, especially when faced with the disagreeable alternative of using Manila’s poor transport infrastructure. However, the persistence of trust was also due to cognitive biases, as reflected in constructs such as _acceptance of limited transparency_, _perceived control_, and the ideational appeal of technological systems. These cognitive biases found in the data increase our understanding why trust in platform technologies may persist even when besieged by distrust. The findings can also increase our vigilance over the various cognitive biases which can be exploited to create trust on less than meritorious grounds, and hold a firm grip on users’ trust even as the latter begin to harbour healthy skepticism over fairness and transparency.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ENTRUSTING CHILDREN'S DATA",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel is devoted to the issue of trust and children’s data. Trust in the ethical treatment of children’s data relies on a broad balance of trust in a complex network of actors and practices involved in data collection, analytics, sharing and use of children’s data. More specifically, trust in how data is captured, who the data is captured by, what is done to the data and how outcomes generated out of the data are employed needs to be guaranteed. We discuss the predictive practices (algorithmic analysis) used to uncover behaviours, characteristics and relationships in order to anticipate outcomes, and nudge behaviours and attitudes or initiate interventions on behalf of children. The panel also investigates how children’s databases have made their way onto the dark web, positing that trust in the security of databases held by commercial and state actors is at risk. We then consider the ethical tension between the use of micro-celebrity social media influencers to establish market trust in brands and products, and the use of these potentially vulnerable influencers to market to other potentially vulnerable consumers.&#x0D;\nPaper one ‘Entrusting predictions for children’s futures’ discusses the future implications of large-scale data collection and analytic activities enacted across the everyday that is evident in media, academic publications and government policy discussions. Digging deeper, this concern is centred largely on unease about how the data is captured, who the data is captured by, what is done to the data and how outcomes generated out of the data are employed. Lack of transparency or clarity around internal machinic calculation processes requires ‘trust’ in the veracity of outputs of these systems.&#x0D;\nChildren are increasingly being positioned as data sources, datafied and embedded in algorithmic ecosystems that employ a range of calculations to uncover patterns or anomalies, to highlight risk, and to predict future outcomes. These practices inform strategies, policies and planning and therefore can have material consequences that can be advantageous or disadvantageous for the child, the family and their future pathways. This presentation explores three examples of predictive practices in early childhood in the health, education and commercial sectors through an analysis of relevant academic, policy and commercial literature and discourse to highlight the raft of ways that the placing of trust in algorithmic processes needs to be carefully scaffolded and critiqued.&#x0D;\nPaper two, ‘When trust goes wrong: Children on the dark web’ investigates what happens when trust goes wrong; when children’s personal data is hacked and circulated on the dark web? Where once child abuse material (CAM) was the only type of children’s data generally available for sale or circulation over the dark web, the growth of big data over the last decade, has seen children’s databases sourced from medical records, school records and app databases now available on the dark web—including those associated with connected toys. The paper first discusses children’s abuse material available on the dark web and then outlines the emerging availability of children’s personally identifiable information.&#x0D;\nThe paper argues that, while parents are often held accountable for their children’s digital profile and data safety, vast amounts of children’s data is being legally collected by tech companies and state actors. Some of this data has found its way onto the dark web. So far, little concern has been voiced about who is responsible for the protection of children’s data along children’s data supply chains—as well as any future ramifications of children’s data being sold and circulated on the dark web.&#x0D;\nPaper three, ‘Trusted babes of Instagram brand-land: Child as co-opted marketer and profitable brand extension on the internet’, explores how marketers are using/exploiting consumers’ inherent love, trust and interest in children, to generate ‘brand trust’, while at the same time wading into murky ethical territory, commoditising children’s images and appeal to promote adult brands. A related phenomenon is the use of children as ‘brand extension’, where celebrity/microcelebrity influencer parents push their children as personal brand extensions, leveraging the cuteness and newsworthy impact of their own children to earn money and/or achieve fame (Archer, 2018). Far from being the ‘everyday, ordinary Internet users’ initially described in Abidin’s early definition (2015b), some child social media stars are now being presented as beyond ‘ordinary’, with lavish lifestyles or unattainable attributes presented as aspirational for the consuming public.&#x0D;\nThe paper uses case studies three extreme case studies, to examine the extent to which mainstream commercial organizations/brands and parents are colluding to use still and video social media images of children (as brands in their own right) in attempt to gain consumer ‘trust’. The impact of marketers and parents co-opting children to engender this consumer ‘trust’, and the ensuing issues relevant to the digital rights of the child and the larger issue of ‘trust’ in society is also discussed.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this proposal, we discuss the role of superparticipants in political conversations on Twitter. Our hypothesis is that these highly active users show a clear political position and intentionally act to give visibility to some topics and to reduce the visibility of others, practices that are similar to those observed among fans in popular culture. In terms of methods, we use social network analysis metrics to identify the modularity of the network and users that receive more attention than others (higher indegree) or mention more other users (higher outdegree). We collected tweets related to the impeachment of the Brazilian ex-president Dilma Rousseff in 2016 in three critical dates of the process. By observing the users with higher outdegree in each network, we noticed some patterns and behaviors that can characterize those users as political fans. Our main finding is that the superparticipants with higher outdegree helped to shape the polarized networks by retweeting like-minded accounts, and thus are important and influence the study of polarized political networks on Twitter.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates new genres of children's content on YouTube that have provoked potent cultural anxieties about the role of YouTube in children's culture, and have raised concerns about the apparent wealth of content targeted at children on the platform that is not child-appropriate. The paper examines the journalistic commentary that constitutes the \"Elsagate\" phenomenon - the neologism used to describe public revelations about the controversy - and conducts a genre studies textual analysis of the YouTube content consistently referenced in this commentary. This analysis aims to illuminate the relationship between the textual features of disturbing children's YouTube content and the cultural anxieties these features have incited.&#x0D;\nThe paper contends that the child-oriented YouTube genres at the centre of the Elsagate controversy re-position extant cultural boundaries of child-appropriate content – boundaries which in some cases have long been enshrined in policy and standards guidelines – in ways that trouble ingrained ideological distinctions between child and adult culture. The paper illustrates how disturbing children’s YouTube content interrupts traditional power balances and interplays between media industries, parental mediation strategies, and “child-effects”: young children’s agency over their own consumption choices and influence on parental media practices (Bulck et al, 2016).&#x0D;\n </jats:p>",

    "title": "EXAMINING THE ROLE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF EMERGING SOCIAL NEWS OUTLETS AND THEIR ADVOCACY JOURNALISM IN THE 2017 AUSTRALIAN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE POSTAL SURVEY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines emerging news forms and journalistic practices within Australia that are native to social media. It argues that these shared forms and practices constitute a new genre of ‘social news’. Social news embodies specific kinds of platform vernaculars and pop-cultural sensibilities, and challenges journalistic norms of ‘objectivity’ and ‘balance’ by consistently adopting an overtly positioned perspective. Three Australian-based outlets are studied through this conceptual lens: BuzzFeedOz News, Junkee Media, and Pedestrian.tv. Using digital tools alongside manual methods, this paper investigates the role and significance of these outlets on Twitter and Facebook during the August-November 2017 same-sex marriage postal survey. The survey was commissioned by the incumbent conservative Liberal-National Australian government to gauge nationwide support for same-sex marriage. During the survey, social news outlets played an advocacy and activist role. These outlets refrained from publishing provocative ‘No’ op-eds, and Junkee Media and Pedestrian.tv actively encouraged readers to enrol and vote ‘Yes’. Preliminary findings indicate that social news outlets were moderately-to-highly visible on Twitter during the postal survey period. On Facebook, advocacy posts received low-to-moderate levels of engagement. These findings indicate a shifting but not yet transformed Australian news ecology. In addition, social news’ eschewing of ‘balance’ indicates a challenge from emerging outlets to traditional journalistic norms in Australia. Significantly, in this case the challenge comes from outlets that intelligently critique the value in publishing both sides. Overall, this research highlights that disruptions from social media platforms and cultures can be sources of positive potential for news and journalistic practice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper proposes an approach for studying the sociopolitical traits of multiple publics on Facebook that emerge in the network of interactions between users and public pages. The study is based on a survey of 1697 Danish citizens whose responses are coupled with their public Facebook activity.This is used to make predictions about a selection of sociopolitical features for a random sample of 50.000 Facebook users across more than 20.000 public pages. The interactions of the 50.000 users are modeled as a network and a clustering algorithm is used to find groups that arise naturally within said network. This allows for the study of how certain sociopolitical features cut across different congregations of the public in a way that retains a lot of the complexity of the digital trace data.&#x0D;\nResults show that voting intention overlaps most strongly with the clusters in the network, followed by gender and geo-location. Additionally they show that the so-called political echo-chambers consist only of smaller subsections of the entire network with many users' interactions mainly being identified by interests that can be attributed to gender, geo-location or other. Although, results also show that the political alt. right are very dominant on hot button political issues such as immigration and religion.&#x0D;\nIt is proposed that by eliciting sociopolitical trends while considering the full network of interactions might lead researchers to overlook and overestimate fewer features when studying the formation of social media publics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing use of messaging apps group chats is defining a new geography of unsearchable digital conversations. Although these spaces often escape the range of internet research, because of the technical and ethical difficulties in extracting of large-scale data sets, they represent crucial contexts where new communication habits and cultural practices emerge. This paper aims to understand the use of voice messages in NSFW group chats, by looking at Telegram closed groups where pornographic contents are shared and commented. Since NSFW group chats are usually understood as prevalently anonymous contexts, the disclosure afforded by voices messages - particularly in terms of gender recognition - becomes worthy examining. More specifically, we ask: 1) What kind of interactions are enacted by voice messages? 2) What kind of self-disclosure is performed through voice messages? 3) Which challenges emerge in the moderation of voice messages? For this research, we are carrying out a qualitative content analysis of voice messages combined with in-depth interviews with groups' moderators. Preliminary results suggest some circumstances that lead users to prefer using voice messages over text, gifs and static images. Contingent (not being able to text) or literacy-related reasons appear less important than the need to establish affective inclusion and identification through one's own voice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>How is trust fabricated today? This paper argues that the persona of ‘Alexa’ bypasses concerns around surveillance and privacy, defusing anxieties not via the rationality of a convincing argument but through the relationality of Alexa as a singular presence.&#x0D;\nIn many respects Alexa is actually more invasive than other technologies. Amazon has encroached into the very heart of the home. Moreover, the company’s patents delve further into the subject through voice identification, mood monitoring, and health detection. But this encroachment is carried out by her, rather than it, a warm and welcoming persona. The team’s aim is to develop something that is friendly, can turn off your lights, chat about anything, and empathize when you’re having a bad day (McGirt 2018). The goal is to construct something chattier, more affective and emotionally attuned. In doing so, Alexa embodies what theorist Byung-Chul Han (2017) has called “friendly power.”&#x0D;\nThe result is that Alexa feels different. Instead of an algorithmic bundle of technologies, Alexa is experienced as an affective persona. Alexa thus delves deeper into the inner life of the subject while shrugging off the anxieties associated with cold, command-and-control technologies. Rather than an all-seeing eye, she is an always listening voice, a friendly companion. And rather than emanating from a central agency, she is co-located with the user. If Big Brother no longer characterizes contemporary power (Harcourt 2015), Alexa might be described as a “small sister.” Small sisters work alongside instead of above. Small sisters are multiple, sited, and supple.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Few studies examine “digital capture,” forces that get people to adopt digital technologies which, on balance, benefit organizations more than the publics. Using various perspectives on this topic, the panel will explore the ways four industries are rolling out digital technologies that have captured audiences in long-term relationships. One paper will use a “digital colonialization” perspective (Ricaurte, 2019) that highlights the influence of capitalist imperialism within contemporary political economy. A second paper demonstrates how network effects fueled adoption of the Common Application laying the groundwork for higher education marketing that fetishizes customer relationship marketing (CRM) technologies to the point of constructing teenage college prospects as sales leads and “yields.” A third presentation explores how companies seduce people to use smart devices that can infer information about the ways they talk and sound while the companies play down the surveillance aspects of the technologies, ultimately eroding their freedom to make choices under the guise of giving them new ways to choose. The fourth contribution presents the growing convergence between emerging technologies and the health sector from the perspective of political economy, demonstrating through case studies how audiences are captured through ambiguous framings that highlight the advantages of health information sharing, but obscure the exploitative nature of pervasive data collection and its use for commercial purposes. Together, the panel points to research needed to understand the emergence of various surveillance regimes before they become taken-for-granted parts of the cultural landscape when changes to them can be made mainly at their margins.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitch.tv has become an important platform for video streaming, especially of games, with more than 100 million monthly users. The structure of content on the platform, which merges live video feeds with chat rooms for user feedback, problematizes existing theoretical frameworks for understanding the roles and hierarchies of different types of users. Combined with efforts to monetize user engagement for the benefit of both platform owners and user-generators of content, there is a need for greater understanding of the new interaction paradigm introduced by the platform. The present study introduces a framework for systematic, quantitative analysis of user interactions in the chat rooms associated with Twitch channels, as well as a preliminary data set. Social network analysis techniques are used to analyse the centrality and homophily of different classes of users, and the theoretical significance of these observations is briefly discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The digital mediation of visual content depicting death and martyrdom as a trope of resistance and contestation is increasingly employed within social media platforms by transnational activist cultures and popular social movements. I refer to this phenomenon as ‘digital martyrdom’. The emergence of digital martyrdom, and its memetic circulation within visual social media platforms, points to the materialisation of a new, affective and ritualised protest dynamic. Through which posthumous visuals become diffused, reappropriated and politicised within global publics. This raises new ethical implications and moral dilemmas for digital and visual social media researchers, and requires more reflexive and critical thought beyond established ethical considerations. Necessarily, this paper raises ethical questions and provocations for digital and visual social media researchers in relation to the design, collection, presentation and publishing of academic work in the context of death and posthumous imagery online. The questions presented in this paper have emerged out of a systematic study of this phenomenon, with a particular focus on case studies drawn from the Middle East, the United States and Europe. This paper argues that digital and visual social media research in this field merits specific ethical considerations and amplified scholarly deliberation. This is of particular importance for visual social media research that extends beyond a Western context and considers the cross-cultural, transnational dimensions of digital activism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasingly, algorithms play an important role in everyday decision-making processes. Recommender systems, specifically, are algorithms that serve to influence end-users’ decision-making (e.g. what to read, who to befriend, who to rent to…). However, the companies that develop and produce these systems are not neutral, but have an economic goal and specific vision on how society should operate. These algorithms should thus never be trusted blindly.&#x0D;\nAn algorithm consists of collective human practices and consequently warm human and institutional choices. Therefore, they should be perceived as culture. Despite the many academics that are joining the debate to denounce the bias, opaqueness and unfairness often found in these algorithms, little empirical research has invested in treating algorithms in its socio-technical assembly as culture.&#x0D;\nTo better understand how end-users perceive these algorithmic systems, we strive to understand how they imagine and (dis)trust the different components of the socio-technical assembly. We are demystifying the imagined processes incorporated in these algorithmic systems in the minds of the end-user using a deconstructed version of Buchers’ (2017) algorithmic imaginary.&#x0D;\nCurrently, companies put ever more effort into personalizing news, using news recommender systems (NRS). NRS organize, select and aggregate news to influence the decision-making of an end-user without a transparent explanation on the process. Therefore, we focus our study on the end-users of these NRS.&#x0D;\nIn this qualitative study, we are interviewing 25 end-users of NRS to understand the assumptions and apprehend the (dis-)trust people have about the different elements of the socio-technical assembly of news recommender systems.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines potential changes in the temporal experience of everyday digital media through the smartphone photo album. Smartphone photo albums not only organize and display domestic photographs but also initiate temporally novel photographic formats: for instance, the images taken by users can be used as raw material in the production of new kinds of ‘moving’ or ‘animated’ photographic products, usually formatted as GIF files and characterized by looped time. While the character of these products and the processes of their creation vary across operating systems, both Google’s and Apple’s systems radically disrupt the conventional assumptions of photography theory regarding photography’s relations with time. Pre-digital photography theory postulated a key distinction between a photograph and a movie or video: the photograph is static; the movie is characterized by temporal progression. In contrast, the GIF presents a shift from linear temporality to looped, cyclical time, promoting a present tense made visible not through instantaneous capture (photography) or sequential unfolding (film and video), but through continual recurrence. It eliminates the linearity of past-present-future because of its perpetual looped temporality, constituting a hybrid between photographic still and film or video. As a result, the repetitive movement of the GIF constructs a generalized impression of an event as an $2 , rather than the structured narrative of an event as a temporal unfolding. The emergence of the GIF in the smartphone album thus signals the rise of a new structure of memory and temporal experience in everyday mediated life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The push for tech companies to incorporate fun and leisure at work as seen in games rooms, health and wellness, and onsite exercise facilities encourages employees in the industry to celebrate work as a core aspect of their subjectivities, and purports to create space for them to bring their “full selves” to professional spaces. Yet, while the individuals I studied were often called to be their “full selves” in the online and offline settings of their places of work and throughout the broader industry, this could be a frustrating discourse, in particular for those who were underrepresented. In the present paper I investigate the industry discourse around “full selfhood” alongside an analysis of how individuals working in the sector negotiated this discourse. I ask how the relation between subjectivity and culture may serve to reproduce or challenge inequities within the sector. Relatedly, I argue that in professional software contexts, performing subjectivity can be an exhaustive process that involves continuous assessment, further complexifying how to perform the “full self.” Additionally, the discourse of “full selfhood” exists within spaces dominated by privileged identities, and in which “ideal” subjectivities often correspond to these positionalities. Thus, the “full selfhood” discourse can lead to tensions surrounding the subjectivities individuals are called to have, and those they are able to take up and sustain, bringing political consequences centered on the self.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social bots are undermining trust in social media. They spread low-credibility content, fake news, and spam. However, most research is based on bots that actively share links or keywords, rather than assessing the longer-term presence of bots as an integral part of platforms. To address this gap, we present what to our knowledge is the first study that assesses the prevalence, influence, and roles of automated accounts in a Twitter follow network on a national scale. This allows us to analyse the potential impact of bots beyond the context of single events and topics.&#x0D;\nTo collect a follow network of the most central accounts in the German-speaking Twittersphere, we have adapted the rank-degree method, a graph exploration method that is able to identify the most influential spreaders within complex networks, as a data mining method using the cost-free standard Twitter API. To identify bots, we employ the Botometer API. Both methods combined allow us to localise bots within topical clusters, to estimate their potential influence, and to assess the roles of the most central bots.&#x0D;\nOur findings indicate that bots have only a low negative impact on the German-speaking Twittersphere. However, the most sophisticated bots will likely remain absent from our study, as false negatives. Similarly, trolls and semi-automated accounts necessitate further research. Our new sampling approach combined with Botometer is promising, for example, for Twitterspheres based on other languages. The study itself opens further avenues of enquiry, such as a long-term monitoring of automated accounts in the German Twittersphere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper argues that emerging technologies of datafication are intensifying a moralisation of predictivity. On one hand, this describes the growing pressure to quantify and predict every kind of social problem. Reluctance to adopt emerging technologies of surveillance is construed as abdication of a moral responsibility via negligence to inevitable progress. On the other hand, it describes the corresponding demand that human subjects learn to live in more predictable and machine-readable ways, adapting to the flaws and ambiguities of imperfect technosystems. This argument echoes that of Joseph Weizenbaum (1976), a pioneer of early AI research and the inventor of the ELIZA chatbot: that well in advance of machines fully made in our image, it is the human subjects that are asked to render themselves more compatible and legible to those machines. Drawing from a book-length research project into the public presentation of surveillance technologies, I show how messy data, arbitrary classifications, and other uncertainties become fabricated into the status of reliable predictions. Specifically, the bulk of the presentation will examine the rapid expansion of counter-terrorist surveillance systems in 2010’s America. All in all, the moralisation of predictivity helps suture the many imperfections of data-driven surveillance, and provide justificatory cover for their breakneck expansion across the boundaries of public and private. They perpetuate the normative expectation that what can be predicted must be, and what needs to be predicted surely can be. In the process, spaces for human discretion, informal norms, and sensitivity to human circumstance are being squeezed out.</jats:p>",

This, along with data breaches scandals, triggered concerns about privacy and the dangers of mass surveillance, and lead developers to provide Instant Messaging applications with greater security. However, the existence of this kind of ‘safe spaces’ in which users privacy is not menaced, has also raised the attention on the sharing of transgressive, obscene or offensive contents that eludes public scrutiny. While the mainstreaming of such contents in non-public digital spaces is often cited as one of the hallmarks of the “dark side of the web”, the research on this topic is still lacking as this phenomenon is observable mostly at an interactional level, and not at the mass media system level. Our study provides an analysis of users’ meaning-making and boundary maintenance activities regarding violent/pornographic contents in group chats (WhatsApp and Telegram), that combines participant observation and in-depth interviews with active participants of such groups. We expect that the results of this research will improve the understanding of 1) the role of messaging apps affordances in shaping the circulation of extreme contents, 2) group trust dynamics, 3) the impact of a common semantics of the obscene on the cultivated semantics of public sphere, 4) methodological difficulties in researching online spaces unreachable by web scraping approaches.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Irish language (‘Gaeilge’), although the first official language of the Republic of Ireland, is a minority language in public life. In recent years, social media campaigns have been organised to promote the use of Irish online. In this paper, we analyse two such campaigns (#EDL #Gaeilge; and #TrasnaNadTonnta) and explore how participation in them is connected to everyday practices of media use and meaning making, and how this in turn influences minority language promotion in social media. Drawing on sociolinguistics and media and communication studies, we address the following research question: How can everyday life and media use influence participation in Twitter campaigns that aim to promote the Irish language? We find that the success of each campaign was dependent on the participants identifying connections between the campaigns and their everyday lives. #TrasnaNadTonnta found particular salience among the Irish diaspora, for whom the language is a marker of a unique cultural identity. This Twitter campaign provided a platform for Irish-language users to connect with others across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia – places where the Irish language has not been traditionally spoken. Although the same platform was provided in #EDL2017 #Gaeilge, Irish-language Twitter users did not identify with this campaign to the same extent. We further surmise that the unique hashtag created for #TrasnaNadTonnta, reminiscent of a song sung in childhood, had particular semiotic appeal when compared with the more policy-oriented approach of #EDL2017.</jats:p>",

This new form of\n        datafied knowledge creation has shifted the sites of expertise and the authority to create\n        educational knowledge to a more-than-human network. This panel conceptually and empirically\n        examines the possibilities and implications that arise from the entanglement of education\n        with advanced media such as ubiquitous sensory environments, APIs, machine learning, and\n        codes. The panel shows how the idea of measurable and re-configurable bodies of students is\n        being performed and stabilized through trade shows and academic conferences; it moves\n        towards a critical analysis of different applications of facial recognition in education and\n        the role of doubt in machine learning methods; it shows the complex involvement of advanced\n        learning analytics through a critical examination of interrelated studies in behavioural\n        genetics and genoeconomics looking for associations between genes and educational outcomes\n        through bioinformatic methods; and, it examines learning and living spaces that create a\n        situation of ubiquitous sensation and explores interventions to disrupt the technical\n        milieu. What connects these papers is more than the spaces, ideas and practices that\n        surround education. All contributions look at datafied knowledge about human life – whether\n        in behavioural, physiological, emotional, or genetic form. The panel aims to show what\n        critical education research has adopted from other disciplines, but also show how it can\n        contribute to the wider discourse around science, technology and society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The three panel presenters and session chair are co-researchers in a seven-year research partnership—involving 28 educational institutions, 25 co-investigators,15 community partners, and 50+ students—that aims to address sexual violence in physical and virtual forms in university contexts across Canada and internationally. The project specifically seeks to address, dismantle and prevent sexual violence by means of multi-sector partnership solutions across the fields of education, law, policy, arts, popular culture, health care, management, news and social media. Using the methodological framework of Parallaxic Praxis (Sameshima et al., 2019), the team looks at a phenomenon from different perspectives by using varied methodological processes as well as a range of rigorous methods of encoding, decoding, and rendering data; and establishing post-qualitative possibilities for generating and mobilizing knowledge to broader audiences. The juxtaposition of renderings (constructions made from deep analysis of the phenomena such as papers, presentations, artworks, and other artefacts), when presented together, manufacture a dynamic agency between works capturing intertextualities, aporias, choruses, and a poesis that arise in the coalescence of the unassimilated, individual investigations. In this panel, an overview of the larger project and the significant milestones in the first four years specifically related to internet technologies will be provided. Drawing from multi-perspectives, the second presenter will address image-based sexual abuse and copyright in Canada, and the third will share data collected from this project in the form of excerpts from an epistolary novel. The session demonstrates how multi-modal investigations and dissemination offer possibilities for extending knowledge production.</jats:p>",

One major factor in vaccine dissent is the proliferation of vaccine opposed content online. Online content has become an integral part of how people make health and science-related decisions. This study explores how members of anti-vaccine Facebook groups use the platform to seek and share vaccine information. Using interviews and Facebook posts shared in vaccine opposed groups, this study was able to identify the information seeking and sharing behaviors on Facebook and how Facebook’s platform changes are affecting the vaccine opposed movement. Findings from this study will provide further insights into the relationships among social media use, values, and trust in the vaccine debate. In addition, results may be applicable to other scientific controversies, online misinformation, and the development of public health interventions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel’s first author, in discussing podcast archiving, notes that internet archives like the Wayback Machine have had much more focus on preserving visual and text content than sound. Internet Research has similarly traditionally had less engagement with sound than with other forms of digital content. This panel seeks to contribute to ongoing work to bring Sound Studies and Internet Studies into better conversation with each other, taking digital sound as a common object and examining it in different cases and through different methods to provide a richer understanding of the role sound plays in shaping our online experiences. The papers coalesce around their common object of inquiry, digital sound, providing depth of understanding about the subject matter by approaching from different directions. Moreover, the papers help to illuminate each other by taking different approaches to common themes. The first and second papers raise key questions about who tends to be included and excluded in circuits of production as well as whose digital sound tends to be seen as valuable. Papers 1, 2, and 3 all ask about how, despite rhetorics of democratization and variety, forms of digital sound may be becoming standardized through technological and social means. The first and third papers call attention to the ways the specific affordances of given digital production technologies shape (though do not determine) the kinds of production that become prevalent in a given moment. There are also methodological convergences: papers 3 and 4 take as their object of inquiry technology makers, and papers 2 and 4 both use press coverage as the site of investigation. Finally, papers 2 and 4 ask questions about what people believe is socially proper or correct in the case of digital sound. In these ways, this panel represents both an important contribution to our understanding of contemporary issues in digital sound as well as relating to broader questions central to internet research.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DESIGNING EFFECTIVE ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR A PREVENTION CAMPAIGN: MISTRUST AND OTHER BARRIERS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reports on the preliminary findings of a research project that is investigating the potential for online advertisements to reduce the incidence of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) consumption on the internet. First time or novice offenders often use search engines to look for CSAM, which presents an opportunity to use display advertisements (for a 24-hour sexual harm helpline) on search results for early intervention. This approach—currently being piloted in New Zealand—aims to decrease the number of potential/novice offenders accessing CSAM, and increase the number seeking help and self-referring for treatment. However, achieving these outcomes crucially depends upon the use of effective images and advertisements, and yet limited research has been undertaken on the characteristics of effective media-based interventions in this context. These outcomes also crucially depend on a two-way relationship of trust: on the one hand, the advertiser’s trust in primary prevention as a strategy, in the potential of online advertising to encourage behavioral change, and in the users’ likelihood of users self-referring contacting the helpline; and on the other hand, the users’ trust—or overcoming of mistrust—in both display advertising targeted at them and in the advertisers themselves (when engagement with both may involve overcoming fears about privacy, surveillance, prosecution, or stigmatization). This paper discusses the pivotal role of trust in informing the development of CSAM prevention display advertisements, arguing that facilitating this two-way relationship of trust is core to the success of a prevention campaign and must be embedded into its design.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel builds on a recently funded research project on the geopolitics of digital sexual cultures in Estonia, Sweden, and Finland (2020-2022) investigating three local online platforms devoted to communities around nudity and kink: iha.ee, darkside.se, and alastonsuomi.com. Our case studies are in a sense “edge cases” which partly move within sexual margins, making space for alternate understandings of platform sociability. Contra to the current de-platforming of sex, our case-studies foreground sex as the dynamics that bind users to the sites and fuel diverse engagements between them. The papers are work in progress and provide initial platform analyses inspired by the walkthrough method (Light et al. 2018) and the notion of platforms as microsystems (van Dijck 2013). We focus on platform affordances and governance in terms of gender and sexuality; acceptable behavior and sexual practices; and public visibility and privacy. This opens up three important discussions with relevance to the AoIR community: (1) how digital platforms shape and constrain sexual expression at a political moment when the sexual dimensions of life are increasingly pushed out of public view; (2) how these local platforms, as notable arenas for sexual expression, contribute to sexual cultures within the Nordic and Baltic region; and (3) how our examples, when understood as social media platforms, can help to push understandings of what social media are, how they operate, and what kind of sociability they allow for. The panel opens up a discussion of how sex matters in social media, how it is valued and communicated.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital community making through a live entanglement of the self and social media, offers up new pathways for thinking through human and nonhuman divides. Queer activism and feminist art on Instagram has made way for a reframing of what constitutes a ‘digital community’ (boyd 2011, Baym 2015, Oakley 2018). This paper thinks through the materiality of this feminist activist art community through the method of ‘Instagram live interviewing’. Drawing from a larger project that aims to understand the ways activist art practice on Instagram subverts heterosexual norms and patriarchal representation, we argue that the ‘live’ nature (Back, 2012) of the Instagram live interview (Hickey-Moody and Willcox, 2019) mobilizes a new type of queer materiality. By applying Karen Barad’s (2007) feminist new materialist theory of ‘intra-action’ to Rosi Braidotti's thinking about posthuman experience as intra-acting with aspects of the world that she classifys as non-human (2013), we reconceptualize some of the literature around digital community making to account for the needs of those often left out of heteronormative and mainstream narratives. This entanglement of liveness and intra-action in our methodology explores the feeling of ‘community’ as being a feeling that is central to human subjectivity and experience. Through a lens of queer materiality, we suggest that community can therefore be produced by more-than-human assemblages, and argue that a more nuanced account of digital community making which accounts for live Instagram intra-actions, and human to nonhuman relationality is needed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines a 1996 U.S. internet censorship protest that encouraged users to email a series of technically “indecent” files as attachments to Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich using an online email generator. These attachments were: a list of abortion clinics, a graphic illustration of condom-use instructions, and excerpted sexually explicit scenes from Gingrich’s own novel, 1945. Selecting from a drop-down menu, senders chose their attachments, completed a personalized message, and clicked send, all within a web-based form. By using the platform to inundate the Speaker’s email with attachments, senders cleverly broke the censorship provisions of the 1996 Communications Decency Act (CDA), putting themselves at risk to the criminalization of sexual expression online. The “bad attachments” protest grew out of the fact that online information about sexuality was vital to marginalized communities with limited access to other kinds of information channels—including queer and rural youth, and people living with HIV. This paper argues that the protest attachments constitute a queer, material digital practice, attuned to the political demand for ready information access as a means of survival.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a pilot study examining the moderation of images depicting post-mastectomy scaring on Instagram by skin tone darkness and the presence or absence of tattoos. It focuses on Instagram given widespread concerns that images of women’s bodies are arbitrarily moderated on the platform, and on depictions of post-mastectomy scarring, one of few explicitly allowed categories of content on Instagram, because mastectomies have important ramifications for women’s self-image and identity worldwide. After using an input/output method of black box analytics, in conjunction with content analysis, preliminary data show potential false positives (n = 31/74 images). While these results are not statistically significant, there is a strong argument for further in-depth investigation as there appears to be differences in removal rates by presence of tattoos and by skin tone darkness. Specifically, a logistic regression suggests that the odds of an image being removed increase by a factor of 1.21 for every unit increase in skin tone darkness. Potential arbitrariness is concerning in this context for many reasons, including that content takedowns can have negative effects on the well-being of women seeking to share their experiences with, or learn from the experiences of, others who have undergone mastectomies. This research ultimately aims to make valuable contributions to the growing body of literature on the moderation of female forms on Instagram and contribute to ongoing debates around the transparency and accountability of platform governance more broadly.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally there is strong enthusiasm for using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government decision making, yet this technocratic approach is not without significant downsides including bias, exacerbating discrimination and inequalities, and reducing government accountability and transparency. A flurry of analytical and policy work has recently sought to identify principles, policies, regulations and institutions for enacting ethical AI. Yet, what is lacking is a practical framework and means by which AI can be assessed as un/ethical. This paper provides an overview of an applied analytical framework for assessing the ethics of AI. It notes that AI (or algorithmic) decision-making is an outcome of data, code, context and use. Using these four categories, the paper articulates key questions necessary to determine the potential ethical challenges of using an AI/algorithm in decision making, and provides the basis for their articulation within a practical toolkit that can be demonstrated against known AI decision-making tools.</jats:p>",

Attending specifically to the ramifications of new forms of (‘big’) data capture and integration implemented by or for state agencies, the panel describes how the rollout of these technologies impacts on and is shaped by contexts prefigured by social and economic inequalities.&#x0D;\nTwo specific arenas are addressed and juxtaposed, with two papers on each of these. The first arena is the introduction of ‘smart city’ technologies and their implications for low income and marginalised communities. Often presented as novel augmentations of urban space, enhancing and customising the urban experience at the same time that they increase the city’s efficiency and ‘awareness’, smart city technologies also reconfigure urban spaces and how they are understood and governed by rendering the city a site of data generation and capture. This presents new opportunities and risks for residents and powerful commercial and state actors alike.&#x0D;\nThe emergence of public wi-fi kiosks as a means of providing internet access to underserved communities, as one panellist describes, can be shown to expose low-income residents to new forms of surveillance and to new kinds of inequity in terms of the asymmetry of information made available to the parties in the exchange at the kiosk. Surveillance and data capture is organised to particular ends and powerful interests shape and leverage the design and affordances of such initiatives in particular ways. Insofar as concerns are raised about these developments, they are commonly framed in terms of individual rights to privacy, missing the scale of the issues involved. It is not merely that ‘opting out’ becomes untenable. As other panellists show, the issues involved are fundamentally social rather than individual in that they foreground questions around the appropriate relations between state and commercial actors, the use and nature of public space, and the uneven distribution of rights of access to space, information, and other resources within the city. Economically disenfranchised groups are not only denied meaningful access and participation, but colonised by data processes designed to extract various forms of value from their use of ‘public’ infrastructure which may not best serve their own interests.&#x0D;\nThe second arena addressed by the panel is the role of algorithmic governance and artificial intelligence in the provision of social welfare. This context is described in terms of both the effects for the frontline service encounter, and the design, justification, and implementation of the technologies reformatting this encounter from key locations within state agencies. Emerging technological infrastructures for social welfare do not simply reconfigure how existing services are offered and accessed. They facilitate the identification of new target populations for intervention, at the same time that they introduce additional burdens, hurdles and forms of intervention and surveillance for these populations. As such, it is evident in the design and application of these technologies that they accord with and expedite punitive logics in welfare provision, providing new opportunities for the application of dominant neoliberal governance strategies.&#x0D;\nIn both arenas, one can conceptualize ‘pipelines’ for the implementation of these developments. These pipelines are interstitial and heterogeneous, and combine different timelines, technologies and actors. They are often technically or administratively opaque or otherwise obscured from view. This gives rise to a methodological and intellectual problem, around the extent to which researchers can say they know enough to point to determining instances, political agendas, commercial agreements, incidental alignments and so on in such a way as to advocate effectively for democratic input and oversight. In this sense the papers assembled highlight how these developments call for new politics of method, new modalities of analysis and critique, and more effective activist and academic engagements with the question of how ideals of justice and equity can best be instantiated in these contexts.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PUNCHING UP OR TURNING AWAY? WHEN PALESTINIANS UNFRIEND JEWS IN ISRAEL",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>We present the first study of Facebook unfriending in the context of the relations between a social minority and majority. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 ‘48 Palestinians (Palestinian citizens of Israel) that explored their unfriending of Jewish Israeli Facebook friends. Nearly all of the interviewees reported unfriending a Jewish Israeli against a background of racist hate speech. For the more politically-oriented interviewees, unfriending was a kind of punching up, an expression of power in a context where they are structurally disadvantaged. These interviewees reported more positive feelings about the act of unfriending (e.g. relief) and active feelings about the behavior that caused the unfriending (especially anger). Politically inactive interviewees showed more negative and passive feelings (disappointment in their Jewish Facebook friends, and fear). For them, unfriending was more like walking away from troubling interactions (because of anti-Arab racism), or withdrawing from social surveillance that could lead to trouble with employers or their college/university. Where dyadic pairs on Facebook enjoy more or less equal social standing, then there may be something to Facebook’s belief that connecting people across the world can improve cross-cultural understanding. However, when one social group enjoys power over another, it would seem that the positive potential of online ties is limited. This study thus sheds new light on online tie management in the context of structural inequality.</jats:p>",

    "title": "OPTIMIZING OUR NETWORKED LIVES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>We use the term networked optimization to emphasize a sustained but changing set of techniques, technologies, and calculations to decide the best life -- the optimal -- through infrastructures, design, mathematics and engineering. Optimization is a vital concept at a time of critical interest in infrastructural power. Usually defined as doing actions to make the best or most effective use of something, our panel highlights the different uses of the term across the internet. Used as a selling point by many technology companies, optimization means different things to different actors. Perhaps the most important question on this is optimized for who? From Facebook to 5G, our panelists work across technical and theoretical literatures as well as computer science and humanities to identify the social implications of networked optimization. Author #1 examines how Facebook’s personalization ideology is engineered into its infrastructure to influence people’s behaviors to maximize its advertising value. Author #2 looks to the discourses and infrastructure of Google’s cloud computing that promise a form of global social engineering. Author #3 takes these questions out of the cloud and into the next-generation of the Internet, 5G. The promised new wireless infrastructure makes a major shift in the meta-governance of communications and re-consolidates power in network operators. Finally, Author #4 looks for forms of resistance through the development of Protective Optimization Technologies that help people counter efforts to nudge and shape their behaviours.  </jats:p>",

    "title": "NON-HUMAN HUMANITARIANISM: WHEN AI FOR GOOD TURNS OUT TO BE\t\t\tBAD",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as predictive analytics, forecasting and chatbots are increasingly proposed as solutions to the complex challenges of humanitarian emergencies. This is part of the broad trend of ‘AI for social good’ as well as the wider developments in ‘digital humanitarianism’. The paper develops an interdisciplinary framework that brings together colonial and decolonial theory, the critical inquiry of humanitarianism and development, critical algorithm studies as well as a sociotechnical understanding of AI. Drawing on a review of current humanitarian AI applications as well as interviews with stakeholders, our analysis suggests that several initiatives fail their own objectives. However, this should not mean that these innovations do not have powerful consequences. Automation reproduces human biases whilst removing human judgement from situations, potentially further marginalizing disadvantaged populations. We observe a transformation of humanitarian work as technology separates officers from the consequences of their actions. At the same time, AI initiatives are cloaked in a discourse of inherent progress and an aura of ‘magic’. Rather than democratizing the relationships between humanitarian providers and suffering subjects, digital technology reaffirms the power asymmetries associated with traditional humanitarianism. The non-human aspects of AI humanitarianism reveal, rework and amplify existing deficiencies of humanitarianism. The hype generated by humanitarian innovation appears to have more direct benefits for commercial stakeholders, rather than affected populations. Ultimately, by turning complex political problems like displacement and hunger into problems with technical solutions, AI depoliticizes humanitarian emergencies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Techniques designed to manipulate public opinion and undermine information ecosystems are rapidly evolving while research lags behind technological innovation and strategic expertise. As a more sophisticated generation of information operations is fast to mature, the papers in this panel shed light on some of the blind spots of scholarly inquiry making visible new thematic strategies, technical infrastructures and both political and economic incentives.&#x0D;\nThe first two papers examine the progression from general political propaganda geared towards influencing elections to highly issue-specific micro-propaganda. The first paper presents an analysis of anti-Semitic disinformation campaigns and harassment during the 2018 US midterms on Twitter and offers rich evidence from interviews with Jewish American opinion leaders about their impact. Drawing on data from Twitter’s Election Integrity Initiative, the second paper examines the gender dimensions of foreign influence operations and how hostile state actors frame and discuss gender identity &amp; politics. The third paper presents an analysis of search engine optimization strategies that extremist YouTubers use in an attempt to game the algorithm and increase their visibility in the network. The fourth paper investigates the relationship between partisan bias associated with Google Search results and the success of political candidates associated with the search queries during elections and finds that partisan search media is a predictor for election outcomes. The fifth paper examines the emergence of a global political economy for manipulation and offers a grounded typology of the vendors, marketplaces, services, and products that are designed to turn a profit from swaying public opinion.</jats:p>",

    "title": "'FASCISM IS THE NEW HIP': ONLINE ANTI-PUBLICS AND POST-NORMATIVE DEMOCRACY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I draw connections between two emergent phenomena of the recent past: the growing influence of online ‘anti-publics’ on democratic debate and the emergence of ‘post-normative democracy’. The paper draws on work by McKenzie Wark (1997) and Bart Cammaerts (2007) to further theorise the rise of online anti-publics. It demonstrates how groups such as white supremacist groups, ‘men’s rights’ groups, anti-climate science groups, and ‘neoreactionary’ or ‘Dark Enlightenment’ groups, among others, can be understood as belonging to a loose-knit, diverse online ‘anti-public sphere’. This is a heterogenous space of often fractious social interaction where discourse routinely flouts traditional democratic norms, such as normative ‘public sphere’ conventions of rational-critical deliberation, rules of evidence and argumentation, and requirements for truthfulness, reciprocity, mutuality, and so on, over and above the ways in which democratic debate is properly passionate (Papacharissi, 2016). The paper uses a case studies approach based in discourse analysis of five different groups to theorise their activities in light of their influence on the emergence of a post-normative democratic politics. This includes the normalisation of race politics across the west, attacks on human rights conventions, attempts to undermine legal processes, attacks on the media and journalists, attempts to shore up subvert gains made by marginalised groups, and systematic attempts to undermine trust in institutions. The paper will show how, to advance their cause, right groups have sought to flip established political logic and to reposition fascism as ‘the new hip’.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A broad body of literature has described contemporary societies as “surveillance societies” or “surveillance cultures” and has expanded on the implications of an increasing “datafication” of society. To date, little attention has been paid to the role of visual data and their analysis in these processes. However, visual data and advancing algorithmic and facial recognition tools can provide particularly rich insights, that may imply both, important potentials and possible tensions. The contribution uses the case of controversial police investigations after the 2017 G20-summit to discuss intersections of datafication, dataveillance and visual communication and to provide insight into how different authorities and stakeholders legitimate and contest the collection of visual data and their algorithmic analysis in the political and public realm. Therefore a qualitative content and discourse analysis of news media articles, tweets, experts’ reports, police statements and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings was conducted. Findings indicate that concrete practices of visual data collection and analysis remained obscure and a critical blind spot in the general media coverage. In turn, they triggered heated debates in the political realm and in specialized media coverage in which trust played a striking key role. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as a \"new standard of proof\" and thus as particularly powerful, objective and specifically trustworthy. However, indiscriminate practices of visual data collection and analysis also triggered fundamental concerns about the role and the trustworthiness of police authorities in datafied societies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Latinos in the U.S. face a high burden of cancer, making it important to deliver evidence-based cancer prevention and screening information (CPSI) on social media to this group. However, there is a dearth in scholarship exploring how Latinos engage with and act upon cancer (mis)information encountered on social media. Cultural values may influence how Latinos engage with multi-lingual CPSI shared on Facebook. This study sought to understand how and why U.S. Latinos engage with and act upon CPSI on Facebook. During one-on-one, in-depth interviews, participants (n=20) logged onto their Facebook account alongside the researcher, typed “cancer” in the search bar, and discussed CPSI they engaged with during the past 12 months. Engagement prompted questions regarding the reasons for engagement and further action. Computer screen and audio were recorded. Interviews were analyzed thematically; CPSI was analyzed via content analysis. Participants mainly engaged with CPSI by viewing/reading content. Engagement was most common when individuals had personal relationships to the poster, when posts included videos/images, and when information promoted popular Latin American foods. Engagement often led to varying levels of action, both online and offline. Not all decisions were evidence-based, and some were potentially harmful (e.g. canceling mammogram after engaging with misinformation). Findings highlight the complex and interrelated ways in which cultural values, source factors and message factors contribute to engagement with health content on social media, which may lead individuals to bypass evidence-based procedures in favor of unproven approaches. Specific interdisciplinary recommendations to address these issues will be discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of an investigation of algorithmic copyright enforcement on YouTube. We use digital and computational methods to help understand the operation of automated decision-making at scale. We argue that in order to understand complex, automated systems, we require new methods and research infrastructure to understand their operation at scale, over time, and across platforms and jurisdictions. We use YouTube takedowns as a case study to develop and test an innovative methodology for evaluating automated decision-making. First, we built technical infrastructure to obtain a random sample of 59 million YouTube videos and tested their availability two weeks after they were first published. We then used topic modeling to identify categories of videos for further analysis, and trained a machine learning classifier to categorise videos across the entire dataset. We then use statistical analysis (multinomial logistic regression) to examine the characteristics of videos that are most likely to be removed through DMCA notices, Content ID removals, and Terms of Service enforcement. This interdisciplinary work provides the methodological base for further experimentation with the use of deep neural nets to enable large-scale analysis of the operation of automated systems in the realm of digital media. We hope that this work will improve understanding of a useful and fruitful set of methods to interrogate pressing public policy research questions in the context of content moderation and automated decision-making.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Teejayx6 is a scam rapper from Detroit who puts to shame the notion that the internet is a cyberspace frontier where you can be all you wanna be. Instead, he presents it as a rich field to be harvested, and through his music provides insights about race and the internet. Ever since Kolko et al. (2000) published $2 , internet studies has tried to tease out how race plays out on the internet. But, as scholar Jessie Daniels (2012) shows, the field has come up way short. Maybe that’s because academics are too focused on what’s going on “in there” with race. There’s too much of a focus on the traditional analyses of representations of blackness, or of browness, or of yellowness. Instead, in line with Daniels (2012) urgings, we should be figuring out how whiteness is embedded, so deeply, in the internet. And so, we ask: What does Teejayx6’s scam rap, and the the scam rap of his predecessors, tell us about whiteness and the internet? Teejayx6 lyrics and online interviews help expose whiteness mythologies entrenched in internet discourse. We see how the open frontier of cyberspace masks territorialization; how identity fluidity is more of an elite fantasy than a pluralistic fact; and, how the promise of leisure and prosperity is false consciousness at best.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The twenty-first century has observed the emergence of new practices of gender diversity, which eschew rigid gender binary and proliferate new gender labels, including “nonbinary,” “genderfluid,” and “agender.” Digital media have played a crucial role in this process as the new labels often originate in online social networks. Academic discussions on digital gender diversity suggest that the new labels either resist or reproduce the dominant gender ideology. I contribute to these discussions by challenging the dichotomy of subversion versus hegemony and demonstrating a wide spectrum of digital practices of gender diversity. Drawing on six interviews with gender-diverse migrants and building on the concept of disidentification, I update the concept to the increasingly digital societies and emerging gender diversity, challenge the dichotomous thinking about digital gender diversity, and stress the importance of mediated and cultural contexts for understanding how new gender labels are being enacted in everyday life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel focuses on the way that platforms have become key players in the representation of knowledge. Recently, there have been calls to combine infrastructure and platform-based frameworks to understand the nature of information exchange on the web through digital tools for knowledge sharing. The present panel builds and extends work on platform and infrastructure studies in what has been referred to as “knowledge as programmable object” (Plantin, et al., 2018), specifically focusing on how metadata and semantic information are shaped and exchanged in specific web contexts. As Bucher (2012; 2013) and Helmond (2015) show, data portability in the context of web platforms requires a certain level of semantic annotation. Semantic interoperability is the defining feature of so-called \"Web 3.0\"—traditionally referred to as the semantic web (Antoniou et al, 2012; Szeredi et al, 2014). Since its inception, the semantic web has privileged the status of metadata for providing the fine-grained levels of contextual expressivity needed for machine-readable web data, and can be found in products as diverse as Google's Knowledge Graph, online research repositories like Figshare, and other sources that engage in platformizing knowledge. The first paper in this panel examines the international Schema.org collaboration. The second paper investigates the epistemological implications when platforms organize data sharing. The third paper argues for the use of patents to inform research methodologies for understanding knowledge graphs. The fourth paper discusses private platforms’ extraction and collection of user metadata and the enclosure of data access.</jats:p>",

To substantiate these claims, this paper investigates the hitherto little explored subjective relevance that Internet users assign to algorithmic-selection applications in everyday life. A representative online survey of Internet users comparatively reveals the relevance that users ascribe to algorithmic-selection applications and to their online and offline alternatives in five selected life domains: political and social orientation, entertainment, commercial transactions, socializing and health. The results show that people assign a relatively low relevance to algorithmic-selection applications compared to offline alternatives across the five life domains. In particular social media are found to be of relatively low assigned relevance for all life domains investigated. The findings vary greatly by age and education. Altogether, such outcomes complement and qualify assessments of the social impact of algorithms that are primarily and often solely based on usage data and theoretical considerations.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper looks at discursive interventions online and protests against political and social injustices against women in India within wider protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (December 2019 - present). In attempting to classify some modes of publicness on digital media platforms that are prevalent amongst women resisting the oppressions of living under an authoritarian regime that overlaps with patriarchal structures, this paper explores the radical potential of spheres of affect that challenge representative authority and questions “who” has the right to construct the political. Drawing on theoretical approaches from Berlant (2008, 2011) and Fraser (2007, 2020), I discuss discourses emerging around women’s experiences whilst theorising the potential that feminist movements might possess to forge transnational solidarity. This paper employs digital ethnography on Twitter, as well as discourse analysis. Instead of utilising the more popular hashtag-analysis or keyword search methods used to study social movements and online cultures, I conduct a qualitative longitudinal analysis of user-timelines. In contrast to studies that measure the impact of digitally mediated activism, I highlight the work involved in constructing these transnational publics through an accurate prediction or ‘knowing’ of others within affective public spaces, as well as in strategic performances of belonging and citizenship.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The internet theoretically offers a socially inclusive space for disabled users and new forms of visibility vis-à-vis mediated communication. However, the prevalent perception of the internet as an idyllic space that liberates disabled people reflects an ableist mindset, as it views departure from the disabled body as the source of liberation. This paper challenges this perception by investigating how people with invisible disabilities that are clinically related to communication mediate their disabled life experience in Social Networking Sites (SNS). To this end, the study probed, through thematic analysis, 31 in-depth interviews with high-functioning autistics, stutterers and hard of hearing SNS users and 7 SNS documentation use diaries. The analysis identified a gamut of disability performances online, which varied based on one's perception of the disability and its visibility. For example, while some interviewees crafted a complex online persona that presented their disabilities through a nuanced perspective, others felt compelled to ‘pass’ as able-bodied. Many felt that their self-presentation was inhibited by a sense of social surveillance, imposed by the presence of friends from “the offline world”. The notion of “authenticity” posed another barrier for many interviewees: Sensing an expectation that their communicative style on SNS align with their physical communication led them to ironically adopt a less true-to-self persona by managing the visibility of their disability online to reflect their 'offline' constraints. Rather than providing an accessible and/or liberating sphere, this paper argues that social networking sites reproduce the ableist biases and power structures that underline the physical, “offline” sphere.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study analyzes the Instagram page, @i_weigh, and its relation to body positivity discourses. Drawing on a visual discourse analysis of 300 Instagram posts from the @i_weigh account, this study suggests that body positivity movements may be increasingly disembodied in a self-representational era hallmarked by popular feminism. On 16 March 2018, actress and activist Jameela Jamil posted a photo to Instagram, obscuring her body with textual identifiers like “great friends” and “I laugh every day.” This post marked the launch of the Instagram account @i_weigh. This page, founded and maintained by Jamil, posts submissions from Instagram users answering the call to “weigh” themselves beyond the corporeal. This movement, now millions in reach, signals a departure from the conventions of body positivity. Rather than discovering empowerment through the body, @i_weigh encourages its participants to publicly privilege external relationships, social identities, and economic opportunities in an effort to look past the body. @i_weigh discursively constructs a mediated disembodiment, characterized by its liminal visual representation and categorization of the self through narratives of resilience and strength, claiming marginalized identities, and extra-self connection. The interaction of liminality and mediated disembodiment is reflective of self-representation in an age of popular feminism, placing the responsibility back on women for their own empowerment and production of selfhood while ignoring the socio-cultural frameworks that create a need for empowerment in the first place.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In post-modern society, the pervasion of social media by business interests is immutable. From benign beginnings as peer-to-peer networking sites, social media has attracted the attention of commercial actors intent on exploiting the media’s propensity to reach large audiences quickly and cheaply. Organically based campaigns saw small firms gain access to large audiences on a previously unthinkable scale. However, the business model monetisation strategies of legacy platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have redefined the intrinsic role of these platforms beyond simple network carriage providers. Together with algorithmic changes designed to filter out unpaid content, a profound effect on equity of access to audiences has been felt by companies marketing via these channels. In particular, the communications efforts of small organisations with limited resources, have been substantially diminished, together with their visibility, under the user-pays regime.\n\nThis paper examines the distribution of power in commercialised social media ecosystems. The research maps significant shifts in relational dynamics to reveal an increasingly dichotomous system of haves and have nots among companies operating in this environment. Using a resource and stakeholder theory lens, in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 social media marketing practitioners in the UK and Australia and analysed using a grounded theory approach. The findings reveal a form of neo-colonial gatekeeping based on increased platform hegemony. The new social media hierarchy was found to diminish diversity and perpetuate an increasingly unbalanced economic system. The research implications are discussed in the context of disenfranchised small enterprises.\n\n</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube’s algorithmic recommendation system – known colloquially as “The Algorithm” – is a powerful character in the lives of professional and aspiring social media content creators, exerting various pressures on them in their struggles for visibility and income. This paper brings an anthropological approach to the study of algorithms in the context of platformised creative work, seeking to understand YouTube’s algorithmic recommendation system as situated in content creators’ everyday lives through a triangulated examination of their discourses, practices and experiences. “The Algorithm” is variously understood as an omnipotent God, a black box to be opened, a mystery to be solved, a voracious machine, and an oppressor of marginalised groups. Above all, it is viewed as unknowable, impenetrable, mysterious, and inscrutable. Though creators’ experiences vary significantly based on a myriad of factors, amongst my participants “The Algorithm” was universally understood as an antagonistic force, one which heightened conditions of precarity and made their working lives more unpredictable and stressful. With an ever-increasing number of people seeking careers as content creators, it is vital to interrogate the emerging and problematic sociotechnological formations that are core to this new form of labour.</jats:p>",

Unlike other forms of participation in the realm of society that happens on and via the Internet, participating as an independent contractor in an online labor market does not only depend on individual access to technology, knowledge, motivation, and skills, but also on the preferences and biases of both the hiring party and the mediating platform. We conduct a scoping review to examine how the existing body of literature has approached inequality, discrimination, and bias with regards to paid online labor. Conceptualizing online participation as a multistage process, we build a model of participation and success in the online labor market as a pipeline. Based on a comprehensive set of studies collected via five academic databases, we map prior literature across the pipeline’s stages of becoming an independent contractor and find that most of the prior literature focuses on later stages, such as having been hired. Ultimately, we identify remaining puzzles and advocate for the importance of studying the precursors of online labor outcomes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the role of newsmaking on the digital platform YouTube during the 2021 Climate Change Summit. Drawing on data collected with the software NodeXL Pro, we assess the connected communities, authorities, and popularity within a YouTube comment network. The data set of the investigation was assembled by the query ’COP26’. Drawing on the measures of influence in-degree, out-degree and PageRank, were ranked the YouTube channels of the researched network. In addition, the layout algorithm Force Atlas 2 was employed to detect network clusters in the software program Gephi. Finally, the study drew on Natural Language Processing to analyze the comment corpus. Our key findings suggest that YouTube channels of well-established, professional news corporations, such as BBC News, DWNews, and Sky News, reached high scores for the PageRank analysis. Based on the evidence collected, we argue that professional news corporations acted as influencers during the coverage of the 2021 Climate Summit on YouTube. This investigation contributes to understanding the role of digital platforms in the science communication on climate change and the negotiations of (post)colonial pasts. Its findings imply that claims for climate justice are increasingly played out within a diverse, global transmedia ecology. Climate justice is increasingly intertwined with decolonial voices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Girl Defined is a cross-platform fundamentalist Evangelical Christian ministry started by two sisters, Kristen Clark and Bethany Beal. The goal of their ministry is to encourage women to reject feminism, deny their personal desires, and live out God’s design for their lives: Biblical womanhood, which centers on traditional feminine gender performance, subordinance to one’s husband, and motherhood. This project seeks to understand the ways that white fundamentalist Christian women make sense of and mobilize against the feminist movement in order to augment our understanding of anti-feminist backlash and white Evangelical women’s place in the culture wars. Informed by research on white Evangelical women in the US and microcelebrity practices, I conducted a critical discourse analysis of 67 blog posts (2012-2021) and 14 YouTube videos (2016-2021) tagged “feminism” on the Girl Defined blog. This analysis demonstrates that Girl Defined portrays feminism as fundamentally self-interested and synonymous with mainstream secular culture. Clark and Beal appeal to their audiences by incorporating neoliberal logics of self-improvement while appropriating the language of progressive movements to modernize their presentation of traditional gender norms. Through their expansive construction of feminism as ideologically dominant, Girl Defined simplifies and individualizes women’s experiences to frame Biblical womanhood as a “radical” alternative to feminism. Overall, these findings provide insight into the paradoxical flexibility of hyper-conservative ideologies that center on a rigidly defined “us” vs. an ever-flexible “them” while expanding our understanding of the ways conservative thought leaders modernize old ideas and use digital networks and influencer logics to spread them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>#BlackoutTuesday was a digital action devised as part of the unprecedentedly large Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. This study builds on Black Lives Matter research through its three main objectives: To test three new independent variables —\n\nrace, gender, and source — in determining the demonstration of users’ empowerment; to test race, gender, and source to determine users’ communicative behavior on Instagram; and, to investigate the connection between source types and user engagement on Instagram. We conducted quantitative content analysis to address the research questions. Using CrowdTangle we collected ten thousand Instagram posts containing #BlackOutTuesday published on June 2, 2020. This study is based on 1250 posts randomly selected from the original sample. This study tested eight hypotheses. Using a series of Chi-Square tests, the results revealed that the users’ gender, race, and source types were significantly associated with their sense of empowerment and communicative behavior regarding #BlackOutTuesday conversation on Instagram. This study also investigated the factors that influenced higher engagement. Employing a One-Way ANOVA, the results showed that source types, particularly celebrities and for-profit and media organizations, generated more Likes. We also found that negative emotions created more Likes and Comments. However, the results did not support the association of post structure with higher engagement .\n\n</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE UNDERSIDE OF TECHNOLOGY: LIFECYCLES OF LIBERACIÓN IN THE DIGITAL AGE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In The Underside of Modernity: Apel, Ricoeur, Rorty, Taylor, and the Philosophy of Liberation (1996), Enrique Dussel prescribes a philosophical pushback to what Eduardo Mendieta calls the ‘discourses of Modernity.’ Emanating from the global south, as both proximate and philosophical situations, Dussel elegantly unravels a metaphysical prescription of Modernity as the blueprint of empire articulated via political, religious, and cultural hegemonic universality. The goal is to reimagine the ethics of liberation outside of Modernity’s stranglehold on philosophy. Dussel’s thesis is simple: resistance to dominant hegemonic frames which center Western Modernity as that which must be repelled passively accepts those frames as a starting point. In other words, framing resistance as negation (i.e., postmodernism) upholds a binary of dominance/resistance wherein the myth of Modernity remains dialectically centered. What Dussel advocates for is a lens enabling us “...to stand outside the reality within which we live in order to critically understand it” (Burton &amp; Osario, 2011, p. 26). To this end, he proposes a ‘transmodern’ position that privileges practices of the ‘Other’—on outskirts of the Modern colonial scheme—as focal points of liberation philosophy.\n\nIn his ‘analectic’ method, Dussel decenters the Modern as a starting point of investigation and/or resistance, privileging the material realities of the ‘Other’ as locus of cultural knowledge. In the vein of decolonial inquiry, the ‘Other’ is of the anterior of hegemonic frames, a subject on/of the outskirts that, when face-to-face with dominant hegemony, presents a new way of understanding systems, universalities (which Dussel believes exist, just not as prescribed by Modernity), and the very prescription of the Modern subject. In defining liberation as praxis, the analectic method accounts for the complex realities of the colonized as targets of, and transgressors to, systems of colonization, depending upon material context.\n\nOur panel draws inspiration from the analectical approach and includes papers that elucidate the material realities of Otherness on the underside of technology. In an age of technological globalization tethered to neoliberal market principles, we argue that approaching questions of technological expansionism via traditional ‘discourses of technology’ that perpetuate the dominance/resistance binary is insufficient if the aim of decolonizing the internet, the systems which support it, and the artefacts which connect us to it is to be achieved. By focusing instead on individual acts of resistance to totalizing technological systems, we investigate the complexities of living within the landscape of technological hegemony from the lens of the user. From migrants of the global south who both rely upon, and transgress, mobile technologies and the critical infrastructure which supports it, to everyday consumers of technology that often universalize and therefore industrialize lived experiences, the metaphor of existing within and simultaneously reacting to systems of colonization persists. Specifically, we clarify the lifecycle of technological expansionism, from the act of occupation to individual acts of resistance in specific panel presentations that discuss:\n- Imagined infrastructures of the ‘smart’ (neo-colonial) city.\n- The push and pull of maintaining Latinx identity within homogeneous digital platforms.\n- The emotional and physical labor of Asian American women in countering Western narratives which totalize “Asian” identity as monolithic.\n- The South American migrant experience as dependent upon and reactionary to critical infrastructure.\n- Corporeal memorialization as resistance to industrialized memory.\n\nEach panel topic identifies technological systems, platforms, and/or infrastructures as modern-day instantiations of colonialism as a basis of investigation. For example, multiple papers clarify technological systems and infrastructures as conduits of cultural imperialism, evident in global urban transformation projects and the industrialization of memory, while others query the role of platform affordances in perpetuating inequity and encouraging monolithic identity. As pushback to this totalization, multiple papers highlight the liminal experience of ‘Otherness,’ caught between the tensions of material reality and the opacity of dominant technological systems that often shape, steer, and ultimately universalize human experience. Centering the lens of the individual, we investigate the necessary utility of global technologies (the ‘realities within which we live’) while articulating how actual experience with, and consumption of, these technologies by those on the periphery (those who ‘stand outside’ that reality) can inform a critical understanding of their socio-technical impact.\n\nThese research topics identify the importance and relevance of decolonial philosophy as a primary framework for understanding the path to liberation from the enveloping forces of global technological systems. In encouraging an analectic, transmodern approach to questions of technological hegemony, we decenter the discourses of Modernity, and by extension the circular dominance/resistance feedback loop which informs much traditional critical scholarship. This panel offers a glimpse from the outskirts, from the periphery of the colonial horizon, situating praxis as foundational to clarifying our socio-technical ontologies.\n\nReferences\n\nBurton, M., &amp; Osorio, J.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Instagram has long been about sharing perfect pictures. For their Instagram posts many users beautify scenes from everyday life, elevate photogenic aspects, and articulate special moments in a style that fits the standards of Instagram culture (Leaver et al., 2020; Manovich, 2017). The term “instagrammable” found its way into many dictionaries and is widely used as a promotional label, for instance in tourism, food, and the museum sector. However, since the introduction of Instagram Stories and Instagram Live – in 2016 – an increasingly large part of the content shared on Instagram is no longer instagrammable in the same sense. These features afford instantaneous sharing of images and videos that are not necessarily displayed permanently, introducing a very different visual language and new visual practices.\n\nAt festivals, Instagram is a ubiquitous platform. Many event-goers share their live experiences through posts and stories, often using event-specific hashtags, locations, and stickers. Based on an elaborate empirical examination of event-goers’ Instagram practices, this paper argues that Instagram’s shift towards live shapes their live experiences in distinct ways.</jats:p>",

We tracked and documented public or otherwise known changes to the algorithms through Facebook public announcements, industry research, and information leaked to the press to parametrize a model that accounts for the variation in user engagement with Guardian news articles. To this end, we queried the Guardian API to collate a database of all Guardian articles published between 2010 and 2020 and subsequently queried the CrowdTangle API to retrieve Facebook engagement metrics for Guardian articles. We modeled this time series using time series analysis, including cross-correlation, anomaly detection, and granger causality tests to examine the relationship between changes to Facebook News Feed and engagement with Guardian articles over the past decade. Our results show that hard news items, particularly those classified in the section ‘News’ by the Guardian API, are significantly more likely to have been impacted by changes made to the News Feed Algorithm in the period. We conclude with a discussion on the asymmetric power exerted by social platforms on news organizations and the elapsed effects of algorithmic changes to website traffic, business models, and editorial decision-making in the news industry.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of the term ‘memories’ by social media platforms is not neutral but puts forward a particular understanding of what memories are. I situate the algorithmic resurfacing of the past as ‘memories’ within the dynamic of data colonialism. Memory becomes another layer of human experience that is subjected to datafication and is part of the economic strategy of Facebook to foster increased feelings of intimacy and interdependence. In this paper, I focus on the overlap between the conceptualisations of memory and mnemonic processes by people and commercially driven social media platforms. Drawing on interviews, focus groups and digital traces shared by participants, I examine how gendered subjectivities are being reproduced and intensified by young women as they engage with memories on platforms. First, I address how participants describe their interactions with memory products, focusing on their expectations of typical encounters and entanglements between remembering and feeling. I argue their interpellation into happy remembering by the platform is consequential due to their positionality. Second, I focus on how participants positioned platforms as spaces for preserving and keeping memories beyond the ‘memories’ feature. Third, I look at the role of likes and the quantification of the past within understandings of memories for young women. By exploring intersections of memory, gender and data colonialism, I grapple with how specific groups experience and navigate social media platforms. Navigating gendered pressures and performing normative femininity is part of the cost of engaging with memories for young women.</jats:p>",

    "title": "#FREEBRITNEY: STRATEGIES OF COUNTERNARRATIVES AND SELF-REGULATION WITHIN FAN ACTIVISM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The conservatorship of Britney Spears represented both a legal arrangement that placed severe restrictions on her autonomy, and also the center of a growing activist movement demanding a restoration of her rights. Commonly known as #FreeBritney, this primarily online group has worked since 2009 to raise awareness of and bring an end to Spears’ conservatorship. This paper situates the #FreeBritney movement at the intersection of fandom and digital activism, highlighting the activist potential of fan communities. Using a thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) of 16 interviews with self-identified #FreeBritney members, we describe key themes pertaining to the intersection of fandom and digital activism. A primary objective of #FreeBritney members involved piecing together an alternative narrative of Britney Spears’ career and conservatorship. In keeping with theorists who argue that hashtags constitute a digital counterpublic (Wimmer, 2016), interview participants recalled organizing “trending parties” to help increase the visibility and validity of resistant readings of Britney Spears’ conservatorship. Echoing de Kosnik’s (2012) theory of the “social innovations of fandom, interviews also demonstrated how the #FreeBritney movement collectively formed internal rules and codes, described as a “self-regulating body” of members. To the extent it reflects and diverges from fandom and digital activism, the #FreeBritney movement poses compelling questions about key tensions in both fields. With this analysis of #FreeBritney, we seek to interrogate fandom as a site of activist potential within the framework of a successful online movement, building on established theory and locating new sites of analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Dating apps pose particular challenges for queer Christians, reproducing oppressions and experiences of dispossession in the context of seeking intimate relationships. Queer Christians using dating apps complicates an already sensitive combination of social and cultural commitments, values, and beliefs. Dating apps position themselves in the dating market in a variety of ways, however all function to help people meet other people for dates. Some apps are known for facilitating hookups or catering to queer populations, others are used more broadly and aim to facilitate long-term relationships. Dating apps, along with other social media sites, independently create and control the categories users interact with. On dating apps, users expect the app interface to enable them to represent their unique identities. However, dating apps are often designed with dominant populations in mind and end up excluding those who do not fit the model of their ideal user. Ultimately, my analysis reveals how queer Christians know and express gender and religious identities on dating apps but dating apps do not allow for this complexity to be easily visible or searchable. Queer Christians wrestle with dominant narratives, deviate from social scripts, and resist condemnation to a life without hope for loving partnerships. Dating apps offer fine-grained means of seeking and finding a match made in heaven while simultaneously constructing a hellhole of exclusionary, discriminatory, and oppressive binary categories. Still, queer Christians depend on dating apps, both to do queer identity work and to help them seek and find their match made in heaven.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technologies function partly according to consensus algorithms and protocols. Beyond a practical means of allowing these technologies to function, they can also be considered to have imagined affordances that “emerge between users’ perceptions, attitudes, and expectations; between the materiality and functionality of technologies; and between the intentions and perceptions of designers” (Nagy and Neff, 2015, p. 5). In the case of blockchains, these affordances are attached to representing social trust and decentralizing electoral processes. As such, blockchain technologies have been intimately woven into discourses that imagine the future of governance, transparency, and democratic decision-making.\n\nBut how has this happened? In this paper I identify that at the root of these discourses is the ambiguous concept of \"consensus\" and that socio-political meanings of consensus have be re-written as a set of technical operations. Through a combination of metaphor analysis and content analysis of canonical computer science papers and news articles, I demonstrate how the oscillation between technical and political meanings became the basis of the celebratory discourses around blockchain technologies. Through this analysis I demonstrate how computer scientists used a metaphor to guide technical development, and then this metaphor took on a foundational aspect of the socio-political value of the technology in the form of visions for decentralization, autonomy, and democracy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Data colonialism refers to the processes by which extracted data is commodified to reproduce and expand capitalist and colonialist practices. As data colonialism transforms infrastructures and ideologies to exercise new ways of control, it has become a crucial approach to better understand how datafication transforms and impacts citizens' lives across the world—especially in the Global South. In this paper, we explore data colonialism as a lens to examine how Latin American citizens' are impacted by their engagement with different information systems. More specifically, we present findings from a collaboration with civic data organizations in five countries in Latin America. Overall, findings show how relying on data colonialism underscores the impacts to citizens when they engage with contemporary information systems, including material and physiological harm to individuals, fragmentation of communities, and various ideological shifts. However, findings also call attention to the value of integrating other theoretical approaches that emphasize discussions about agency, contextualization, and the benefits of datafication. Overall, this paper discusses how data colonialism hurts individuals, target communities, and transforms citizens' imaginaries about their place in society.</jats:p>",

    "title": "SHAPING APP DATA PUBLICS AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CFIUS-GRINDR AND CFIUS-TIKTOK RULINGS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In March 2019, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) labelled Grindr as a risk for national security and forced the Chinese conglomerate Kunlun Tech to divest from the queer dating app by June 2020. Later that year, the Committee launched an investigation into the Chinese company ByteDance, owner of the popular app TikTok, after it acquired the app Musical.ly in 2017. The objective of this paper is to compare how the CFIUS-TikTok and CFIUS-Grindr rulings were shaped as national security controversies, as well as to highlight how app data publics are increasingly the subject of discursive struggles to determine whether or how they constitute risk, especially amid the ongoing US-China trade conflict. Drawing from a political economy approach to communication, we collected and analyzed newspaper articles pertaining to the CFIUS-TikTok (n=294) and the CFIUS-Grindr (n=107) rulings. Our analysis highlights how both rulings were framed by construing the Chinese ownership of popular social media apps as a potential threat to US national security by conjuring anti-Chinese sentiment. However, a closer examination revealed that TikTok’s and Grindr’s data publics were made to matter differently. If the CFIUS-TikTok ruling was predominantly framed as a human rights issue, the CFIUS-Grindr investigation was made to matter by depicting LGBTQ+ citizens as higher security risks for the US because of their sexual and gender identities. This paper concludes by raising the implications that datafication poses for the LGBTQ+ communities who have little control over the regulatory frames that oversee their activities online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the effects of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic has been to further accelerate the incorporation of social media activities into political and electoral campaigning. Especially as a result of lockdowns and other restrictions to offline public life, overall social media use has increased in many countries; health concerns have severely curtailed conventional in-person political campaigning activities, from doorknocking to mass rallies (even if some candidates are openly flouting health measures in order to appeal to fringe, COVID-denialist voters); and concerns about the safety of in-person voting processes have also led to a growth in postal voting well ahead of election day, potentially increasing the importance of political messaging early on in election campaigns. In addition, of course, the pandemic itself, and the health, economic, and social measures taken by different governments to address and manage its implications, have also become a dominant theme in most political contests.\n\nPolitical parties around the world have scrambled to keep up with and engage with these changing circumstances, voter behaviours, and political debates, and it is therefore time to re-examine the current state of affairs. This panel does so by focussing on social media campaigning in two of the most recent major national elections: the German federal election campaign in August and September 2021, and the Australian federal election campaign in March to May 2022. The four papers included in this panel examine political campaigning, public engagement, and journalistic coverage on Facebook and Twitter, as well as political advertising practices on Facebook, and in combination offer a very timely new perspective on electioneering in the final stages of a multi-year global pandemic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The extractive logic of data-driven technology and knowledge production has raised serious concerns. While this discourse initially focused on the impact on Western societies, attention is increasingly turning to the consequences for countries and communities in the (Global) Souths. Criticism has mainly focused on the activities of the private sector. In this paper, however, we argue that publicly funded knowledge and technology production projects must also be examined through the lens of this critique. A research project designing and prototyping a diversity-aware social platform with pilot sites in China, Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, and Paraguay is taken as a use case to ask the question: What do we need to do to meet diverse needs and develop innovative knowledge and products that benefit partners from the South and North alike? Our goal is to identify key efforts that are required to break the prevailing cycle of data colonialism and ethnocentric design. We present data from four different pilot sites and reflect on the original concept, as well as progress and results achieved to date. We then compare the experiences and draw five lessons that we believe will help future projects foster more equitable collaboration and achieve outcomes that benefit diverse local communities.</jats:p>",

Users carefully manage their personal and professional identities online and offline in an effort to avoid blurring of these domains. They exercise some degree of choice in segmenting or integrating their personal and professional domains. Whilst much of the rhetoric around the management of identity in social media revolves around autonomous choice in sharing practices and the affordances and process of platforms, socially engaged employees have little control over the way they manage their personal and professional boundaries. In fact, the social media policies adopted by some organisations actively deprive users of autonomy in how they manage these domains. By conducting a legal analysis of social media policies through the theoretical lens of boundary theory, I argue that restrictive policies impede an employee’s ability to manage their identities by collapsing boundaries which facilitate further blurring of domains. These insights give rise to legal concerns about the enforceability of these policies against employees. </jats:p>",

How might the football game, as a widely publicized symbolic site which stages a relation between competition, chance, and nationhood, inflect these expressions of racism? In this paper, I analyze online responses to the 2020 Euro finals, with a focus on narratives expressing expectations about posters’ and platforms’ roles in propagating online racism. I analyze how online platforms express conflicts over race in the reputational terms of status and attention metrics. Extending insights from W.E.B. Du Bois, Cedric Robinson, and Cheryl Harris, I arrive at an account of assetized, late-neoliberal racial capitalism, which recodes racism as the uneven distribution of reputational risk. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Videogame livestreamers on the platform Twitch present a carefully curated version of themselves negotiated in part via interactions with their viewers. This persona is encoded not just through their live performance, but also through other platform features including streamer-specific emoticons and audio-visual overlays triggered by stream events such as donations and subscriptions. From these customisable features emerges a complicated feedback loop between the streamer and non-streamer participants that ultimately results in a set of collective values performed and refined by both parties over time. In this paper I interrogate how the incorporation of Internet memes into streaming personas creates accessible avenues for communication with and between members of this collective that contribute significantly to this value system. I do this by defining the term memesis as the cultural process by which Internet users draw upon existing memes in order to create new memetic media. Through two contrasting case studies of Twitch streamers BrownMan and PaladinAmber, I examine how memesis reflects streamer agency and impacts the structure and values of stream collectives. In particular, I draw attention to the relationship between memes and stream collectives as it relates to streamer identity, memetic histories within streams, and the contrasting explicit and latent values within manifestations of particular memes, among others. Further, understanding how memesis renders visible the encoding of meaning and value into manifestations of meme by emphasising the creation process over the memetic product, I argue that the concept has value not just on Twitch, but within broader digital cultural spheres.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The focus of this panel is the material, organizational, and cultural conditions of digital markets. While the notion of economy refers to the more general production, distribution and allocation in society, the idea of markets represents specific contexts of economic exchange typical of capitalist economies (Carruthers &amp; Babb, 2013). A more elaborate understanding of digital markets and their relationships with digital platforms can expand our understanding of the economic implications that specific types of platform architectures have at the level of economic interaction. The discussion takes as a starting point perspectives from economic sociology that emphasize how markets are embedded into broader social and societal structures (Granovetter, 2017) and conditioned upon cultural norms and conventions (Beckert, 2009). In addition, the panel is informed by the way economic sociology and STS have approached the material conditions of markets (Garcia-Parpet, 2007; MacKenzie, 2018) and the way these conditions frame and transform power relations and interaction patterns on specific markets. The panel consists of four papers that approach this issue from a range of perspectives: The relationship between platform architectures, open market strategies and the formation of ‘commodity money’ in the case of Steam, the relationship between platforms, markets, and state regulation in the case of Alibaba, the role of narratives, imagined futures, and collective action that frame patterns of buying and selling in global stock markets in the case of Gamestop shares and, finally, how the online engagement industry is organized in practice in the case of “click farms”.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms’ digital advertising revenues depend\n        considerably on partnerships. Business partnerships are endemic and essential to the\n        business of platforms, yet their role remains relatively underexplored in the literature on\n        platformisation and platform power. This paper considers the significance of partnerships in\n        the social media ecosystem to better understand how industry platforms, and the\n        infrastructure they build, mediate and shape platform power and governance. We argue that\n        partners contribute to ‘platformisation’ through their collective development of\n        business-to-business platform infrastructures. Specifically, we examine how they have\n        integrated social media platforms with what we call the audience economy – an exceptionally\n        complex global and interconnected marketplace of intermediaries involved in the creation,\n        commodification, analysis, and circulation of data audiences for purposes including but not\n        limited to digital advertising and marketing. We determine which relationships exist, which\n        are exclusive or shared, and identify key ecosystem partners. Further, we find that partners\n        build and integrate extensive infrastructures for data-sourcing and media distribution,\n        surfacing infrastructural and strategic sources and locations, or ‘nodes’, of power in this\n        ecosystem. The empirical findings thus highlight the significance of partnerships and\n        partner integrations and call attention to the powerful industry players and intermediaries\n        that remain largely invisible to us as audiences.</jats:p>",

    "title": "CONTEXTUALIZING AI ETHICS IN TIME AND SPACE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>While the interest in AI ethics has overwhelmingly intensified over\n        the last decade, and while various initiatives seek its institutionalization, the literature\n        on algorithmic ethics tends to examine the subject through philosophical, legal, or\n        technocratic perspectives, largely neglecting the empirical, socio-cultural ones. Moreover,\n        this literature tends to focus on the United States, and to overlook other tech centers\n        around the world. This paper aims to fill these gaps by focusing on how Israeli data\n        scientists understand, interpret, and depict algorithmic ethics. Based on a pragmatist\n        social analysis, and on 60 semi-structured interviews with Israeli data scientists, we ask:\n        which ideologies, discourses and world views construct algorithmic ethics? And what cultural\n        processes affect their creation and implementation? Our findings highlight three\n        interrelated moral logics: A) ethics as a personal endeavor; B) ethics as hindering\n        progress; and C) ethics as a commodity. We show that while data science is a nascent\n        profession, these moral logics originate from the techno-libertarian culture of its\n        parent-profession – engineering – and that they accordingly prevent the institutionalization\n        of a wider, agreed-upon moral regime. We further show that these data scientists’ avoidance\n        from institutionalized algorithmic ethics also stems from specific cultural and national\n        determinants. Thus, this paper offers to see algorithmic ethics in a contextualized,\n        culture-specific perspective, one that focuses on how data scientists practically see and\n        construct their ethics, while considering their professional, organizational, and national\n        contexts.</jats:p>",

Similar to the bubble in a stock market or in real estate market in\n        different economies where the price of assets substantially exceeds its intrinsic value, we\n        propose “data bubble” as a neologism to describe the phenomenon and ecosystem of\n        manipulating data to aim for an inflated popularity on Chinese digital platforms, which\n        ultimately pitch to higher commercial and financial values. We argue that data bubble is\n        laced with platform company’s commercial and financial imperatives, logics of datafication\n        and popularity of platform as data infrastructure, and active participation from different\n        user groups and complementors, and a deeply embedded mentality of “traffic is king”. It is\n        achieved through mixed data practices including data optimization, commercial astroturfing,\n        and counterfeit data manufacturing behind which a wide range of actors and entities are\n        involved.

The practices of data manipulating and\n        optimization by different participants in constructing data bubble, as a result, have driven\n        the data metrics on Chinese platforms far over—and no longer representative of—the actual\n        popularity.</jats:p>",

Makers of\n        emblems and memes have both considered their work trifles, but with an undercurrent of\n        seriousness to them, while their products have simultaneously enjoyed wide popularity and\n        equally widespread disdain.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>With the emergence of the coronavirus in 2020 led to the closing of\n        gyms and churches, along with the “she-cession” in which women disproportionately left the\n        workforce (Hammer, 2021), Christian women with an interest in fitness increasingly turned to\n        home-fitness-based multilevel marketing (MLM). MLM companies like Beachbody, for example,\n        saw a 300% increase in subscribers in 2020 (Haithman, 2020). Although MLMs encourage their\n        distributors to think of themselves as “independent entrepreneurs,” these companies demand\n        fealty -- putting Christian women who participate in a double bind: bound to company,\n        family, and God, they must still position themselves as free agents and strong women in\n        order to build their “fitness ministry” (Coach 8, 2020) and close the sale.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>If users are being $2 algorithms, and companies and regulators are\n        proposing ways for $2 algorithms, with this paper we would like to discuss and propose a\n        third type of governance — one where users have agency, control and governing power(s) over\n        algorithmic systems and their outputs. Our main research question is how do we enable users\n        to actively govern algorithms, instead of passively being governed by them? And what do the\n        users need in order to be algorithmically governed in such a way that will enable more\n        agency, autonomy and control when interacting with AI systems and their outputs. Instead of\n        getting insights in an abstract way, to answer this question, we opted for a guided and\n        supportive process where participants were able to reflect on the process, formulate and\n        elaborate their insights, thoughts, needs and requirements based on their lived experience,\n        i.e., after a real interaction with these algorithmic systems. We conducted a participatory\n        technographic research with 47 participants, through a multi-stage process consisting of a\n        survey, Subject Access Requests (Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation),\n        purposeful interaction with the transparency tools of seven chosen platforms and extensive\n        structured research diaries. A quali-quantitative analysis of the insights enabled us to\n        formulate the participants’ requirements of $2 and $2 in a way that will enable their\n        agency, control and autonomy. These requirements are translatable and implementable at a\n        user-interaction level, via technology design and through regulatory mechanisms</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Working in the digital platform economies has typically been characterised by a corporatised and media fuelled narrative of independence—as a route to financial independence, freedom to determine work schedules, and the positioning of workers as ‘independent contractors’. This terminology suggests a sense of novelty in the nature of jobs and the upending of hierarchies by technological processes. This panel aims at excavating the pre-existing power dynamics between customers, workers and intermediaries. Taxi driving, delivering food and providing domestic care services have long been informal forms of work segregated along lines of caste, religion, class and gender in urban India. What has the platformisation of this work meant for workers, their experiences of work and the opening up of this work? Has the involvement of technological intermediaries led to an opening up and the opening up of this work outside of its parochial considerations of class, caste, gender, religion? The panel is based on qualitative, ethnographic and participatory fieldwork across ride hailing, food delivery and domestic work platforms in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Through 4 presentations, we bring forth the promise of working in the absence of a boss, the restrictions on independence and the functions of interdependence.</jats:p>",

    "title": "PRODUCING THE “PROBLEM” OF PARENTAL OVERSHARE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>With the rise of social media, the term overshare has become shorthand for concerns about people, especially parents, disclosing seemingly excessive amounts of information. Prior work shows that the term overshare does not simply describe an action, but reinforces problematic boundaries that marginalize women. In this paper, I examine how social media discourse actively produces oversharing and then instructs parents to self-censor in the name of satisfying their social media audience. I focus on STFU, Parents, a once-popular blog dedicated to mocking parental overshare. I analyze STFU, Parents materials through the framework of governmentality, a Foucauldian-inspired means of examining how authorities intervene in people’s lives. I find that STFU, Parents defines overshare as the posting of gross or overly emotional content on social media. It materializes overshare through the technologies of screenshots, which supply evidence of overshare, and editing software, which anonymizes the people in the post and enables STFU, Parents to distance itself from the consequences of publishing other people’s information. STFU, Parents portrays itself as simply curating a phenomenon—overshare—that exists in the world. However, I argue that STFU, Parents brings overshare into being by pulling information out of context and using it as a reason to judge parents, particularly mothers. Presenting overshare as a problem of individuals not knowing proper social media etiquette enables STFU, Parents to distance itself from its role role in constructing the very problem it claims to critique.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Questions of independence and sovereignty have long been present with regards to the Internet. In 1996, for instance, John Perry Barlow published his now well-known “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace”. Twenty-five years later, notions like “digital sovereignty”, “data sovereignty” and “technological sovereignty” are increasingly used in public debates. This presentation will explore “technological sovereignty” but through the lens of Indigenous perspectives as well as those of social movements inspired by free software activism. These two perspectives seem to share what can be called an anti-hegemonic perspective on technological sovereignty. While they may reinforce each other, they also differ on many perspectives. It is noted for instance that the philosophy of information sharing in free and open-source software might foster the usage and misappropriation of knowledge held by Indigenous communities (Christen, 2012; Gida, 2019). This analysis will prolong a previous study by the authors which identified different discursive trends around sovereignty (anonymous reference). Methodologically, our approach is grounded in discourse analysis and reviews of academic and activist literature that has mobilized metaphors of digital sovereignty. What is the role of the metaphor of “sovereignty” in reconfiguring Indigenous and social justice activism, in relation to the Internet? What are the commonalities between these perspectives? How are they reinforcing or contradicting each other? We intend to contribute to the theme of this year’s AOIR conference – Independence – by looking at the critical discourses of Indigenous people and social activists through the lens of the metaphor of digital (technological/data) sovereignty.</jats:p>",

The slow fashion movement includes people,\n        practices, ideas, and things from all over the world and online - all of which are broadly\n        connected through a shared effort to resist and transform the waste-driven, profit-seeking,\n        inequitable and unjust system(s) which produce and sustain contemporary fashion.

By exploring the\n        kinds of performances most commonly posted on Instagram I draw attention to the ways slow\n        fashion practitioners’ performances are both assembling individual practitioner identity (or\n        ‘self’) to the wider slow fashion community as well as producing a wider register of\n        lifestyle politics in the slow fashion movement.</jats:p>",

In game scholarship, analysis of the usually\n        harmful tropes and trends of female representation has resulted in countless studies\n        demonstrating that video games are often a regressive medium in terms of representation,\n        privileging heterosexual white male subjectivities and erasing, marginalizing, or even\n        vilifying anyone outside of that specific demographic. These conversations and scholarly\n        studies tend to focus on the representation of human women, especially as victimized\n        damsels-in-distress. Considerably less work has been done to analyse the portrayal of\n        villainous and monstrous nonhuman women in games, even though countless science fiction,\n        fantasy, and horror games feature these kinds of characters. Many of these games utilize\n        harmful tropes and design practices related to female villainy and monstrosity, thereby\n        reinforcing misogynistic ideologies. With the understanding that gender representations in\n        games can have deep cultural ramifications, especially as they intersect with\n        representations of race, sexuality, queerness, body size, disability, mental illness, and\n        age, this paper examines online player and developer discourse regarding female-coded\n        monsters from a selection of commercially successful “AAA” video games.

    "title": "IN(TER)DEPENDENCE IN PLATFORMED CREATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, a variety of cultural industries have been transformed by platformization – a process in which technology companies serve as intermediaries connecting different parties (most importantly cultural producers and audiences) through websites and applications. From music to book publishing, movie production, and the visual arts, cultural production has undergone massive changes due to platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, Goodreads, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Etsy, etc. In most cultural sectors, creators now have to grapple with the platforms that make their work visible to online audiences. This often means paying close attention to the quantitative infrastructure of platforms, namely their algorithms and analytics, which drive visibility and commercial success. This panel examines what these economic and technological changes imply for the independence of cultural production. Classical studies of culture often emphasized the role that the values of independence and autonomy play in shaping artists’ worldviews and practices. From Bourdieu’s analysis of “fields of cultural production” as “the economic world reversed” to Becker’s theory of “art worlds” where internal dynamics redefine external constraints, or the Frankfurt School’s critical take on the demise of aura through mechanical reproduction, sociological approaches have paid close attention to the threats to independence emerging under modern capitalism. In fact, most classical sociology saw cultural producers in the mass cultural industries as having little independence, often assuming (sometimes without empirical research) that the massification of culture would destroy original and critical art works. Here we revisit the question of independence in the context of platformed creation – a term that embraces all forms of cultural production that are mediated, in part or completely, through digital platforms. By bringing together scholars studying different aspects of platformed creation and reflecting on the concept of independence through diverse disciplinary lenses, we ask: what does independence look like in the context of platformed creation? What are some of the theoretical and methodological tools available to scholars for making sense of cultural, economic, and technological independence in the case of platformed creation? And how do these evolving forms of independence affect the kinds of art works and cultural tropes that circulate online? These different studies aim to put the concept of independence in dialogue with the question of interdependence (among cultural producers, audiences, and platforms) in a mediated digital world.</jats:p>",

From “verified accounts” to “two-factor authentication,”\n        platform affordances have proffered metrics of “authenticity” as an antidote to the\n        uncertainties of attention economies, which are ostensibly saturated by fake news,\n        misinformation, and algorithmic radicalization (Haimson &amp; Hoffman, 2016; Caplan, 2020).\n        Yet the platformization of realness claims are often weaponized against the most\n        marginalized, as evidenced by recent events like PornHub’s demonetisation of unverified\n        accounts. Early hashtag harassment events like #GamerGate foreshadowed the gendered\n        consequences of digital realness regimes.

Rather, we argue, the algorithmic reality for marginalized users\n        better resembles Wile E. Coyote’s painted tunnels on the side of mountains: vortexes of\n        selective porosity that invite some roadrunners and flatten others. Through a Critical\n        Discourse Analysis of #GamerGate coverage from 2014 and 2015, we attend to how ideologies of\n        “realness” reproduce along gendered and racialized lines. Our paper builds on recent work on\n        how the ideation of “realness” embeds forms of communicative and audience-managing labour\n        among networked creators (Abidin 2016; Banet-Weiser, 2012; Duffy, 2017). The ascent of\n        “authentification-as-safety is historicized within the hashtag harassment event “GamerGate,”\n        our case study and pivotal moment in the platform veracity ecosystem when influencers and\n        journalists were exhorted to authenticate their lives or lose their livelihoods. Everyone on\n        the internet knows you’re a dog. Now what?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The platform economy challenges existing economic systems, social interactions and participation as well as the very foundation of democracy. As data is replacing labor as the central economic good, economy, society, class structures and democracy might change fundamentally. Or we might experience old wine on new bottles. Karl Marx famously said that history tends to repeat itself, first as comedy, later as tragedy. In this panel we ask, whether history is repeating itself? The panel’s speakers employ different historical perspectives but focus mainly in two periods: medieval times and the age of colonialism. Both periods were characterized by a strong correlation between a certain economic system and the exercise of political power. Structured inequalities in systems of labor, trade and distribution of wealth had significant consequences for the distribution and (re)production of political power. Medieval and colonial societies were each based on logics of exploitation and dominance, ideologically legitimized by references to first God, later the nation, what Marx would have referred to as the superstructures of economic logics. In this systems, individual agency and possibilities were limited compared to today. In medieval society it was hard to change the estate in which you were born, in colonial times it was hard to change your role in the international system. And the fixed structures were basically grounded in economic logics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media enable marginalized activists to create alternative narratives that challenge mainstream discourse through personal storytelling, a performance that emphasizes personalization and visibility. Disabled activists, however, struggle in creating their online counter-narrative due to inability to conform with able-bodied notions of activism. These notions mark online disability activism as separated from able-bodied activism, ignoring the individual considerations of disabled activists. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting the individual decision-making process of users with concealable communicative disabilities regarding activist performance of disability in social media. The three stages of this process were raised during a thematic analysis of 31 in-depth interviews with autistics, stutterers and hard of hearing users, of whom seven also kept social media diaries. First, interviewees had different perceptions of disability activism in social media. These perceptions mirror the inseparable connection between a person’s self-perception as dis/abled, and one's perceived risk of performing a disabled identity in public, which differed between experienced activists and other interviewees. Second, the interviewees' motivations manifested their risk-benefit calculations regarding public disability exposure for the potential benefit of other disabled people, and the different forms of 'private' disability activism in social media. Third, the design of the activist performances was influenced by interviewees' constant awareness of the presence of their offline acquaintances on social media, and by seeing disability as a social, rather than political, issue. This three-staged process demonstrates personalization, visibility and representation not only as essential to social media activism, but also as conflictual for activists with concealable communicative disabilities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a study that investigated how local health authorities (LHAs) located in the most impacted areas by Covid-19 of Lombardy (North of Italy) answered to the challenges imposed by the pandemic through their official Facebook pages during the early weeks of the emergency (January-March 2020). The goal is to understand how the logics of social media affected LHAs’ communication, representing an opportunity for health institutions to enter a new phase of information diffusion and relations with stakeholders and layperson, but also a mean of constraints due to their algorithmic logics and limits of access. The originality of the approach is that, in order to understand the relationship between social media and local health authorities, the theoretical framework hybridizes health communication theories and social media studies. Empirical results showed that LHAs’ communication on Facebook was affected by the logics of programmability and popularity, and also that the institutional language was shaped by social media habits, with an intense use of visuals, hashtags and other engagement strategies. Findings highlighted also that Covid-19 related messaged triggered users’ interactions. The study pointed out the relevance of social media for healthcare communication, opening up new reflections and insights about platforms’ role on ordinary and emergency situations like the pandemic. Interdependence and tensions between public health communication and algorithmic and platform logics are critically discussed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the e-commerce site’s launch in 2005, Etsy has branded itself\n        as a platform for individuals to buy and sell unique, handmade, and vintage items. This\n        project is interested in questions about gender, race, labor, and platforms and seeks to\n        examine how Etsy articulates new formations of raced and gendered labor directly tied to The\n        Great Recession. While scholars have analyzed Etsy’s relationship to historic craft\n        movements (Krugh 2014; Luckman 2013) and to fan handicrafting (Cherry 2016), there is still\n        relatively little published research on the platform.

Utilizing a cultural studies framing and critical discourse and\n        textual analysis, I identify three main threads: 1) White women on the platform have\n        co-opted Black vernacular to address how economic insecurity has pushed them into gig labor\n        2) These products romanticize precarity by positioning feminized grit and individualized\n        solutions to macro economic hurdles as female empowerment 3) The products discursively frame\n        entrepreneurship as aspirational, liberatory, and, most centrally, compatible with white,\n        domestic femininities. While hustling, and its new, white appearance, is celebrated on Etsy,\n        we must be mindful of how hustling is always raced, gendered, and precarious.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet scholars are uncovering and connecting military, political and cultural histories of early internets across the globe, including in the US, (Abbate 1999), Chile (Medina 2011) and France (Mailland &amp; Driscoll 2016), respectively. All three approaches inform this history, exploring the Canadian context. On the recommendation of US counterparts at NORAD, a top-secret whitepaper recommended Canada develop a distributed communications network (NORAD 1965), which became SAMSON: Strategic Automatic Message Switching Operational Network. SAMSON developed into an internet, though riddled with a series of setbacks beginning almost immediately, until it was disbanded in 1984. (Canadian Armed Forces 1985). This paper investigates Canada’s internet infrastructural technopolitics through Larkin’s framework of questioning how they “emerge out of and store within them forms of desire and fantasy” (2013, 329). Specifically, it asks how the design, equipment, and network protocols of this Canadian internet embodied the imaginary of Canadian independence from 1965 to 1984, drawing on primary sources from the unpublished documents of the Canadian Armed Forces that have since been declassified. The emergence of the early Canadian internet occurred during a political renewal. At a time of pushback against American and British influence, the Canadian military rejected cooperation with the US, and focused on internal threats over Cold War rivalries (Hatt 1984). By design the Canadian internet was a security apparatus, but the technopolitics embedded in the system dictate who is to be secured against whom. This paper asks how this history persists in Canada’s internet infrastructure today.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile media technologies place users in digital (online) as well as physical (offline) spaces in novel ways, opening up new environments of affordances. In everyday life these mobile online and offline spaces are increasingly interdependent and interwoven in manifold ways. Practices, experiences, meanings and expectations are negotiated across these spaces, while at the same time they are bound by the respective logics and limitations, leading to new interrelations and contradictions. The mobile, interlocking but non-converging nature of these spaces involves issues of access and power in struggles over in(ter)dependencies and leads to significant method(odolog)ical, practical and ethical challenges for researchers, to which the current COVID-19 pandemic only adds complexity. Researchers are confronted with questions such as: What are appropriate designs to study mobile online and offline spaces and their intersections? Do interdependent spaces call for likewise interdependent methodological approaches? In what ways can elaborated mixed and multi-method designs capture complexity adequately without the researchers losing sight of the specifics? And what are the ethical and practical implications for the parties involved? Meanwhile, in the methodological literature, the specific challenges associated with researching the intersections of online and offline spaces, especially under mobile conditions, are rarely explicitly addressed. For this reason, the panel presents a thought-provoking range of five examples of research into phenomena at the intersections of mobile online and offline spaces and the associated experiences as well as methodological challenges of researchers in dealing with issues of in(ter)dependence at all levels.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Several known Buzzfeed Creators have left the company’s toxic culture\n        by beginning a career as YouTubers. They hoped that their Buzzfeed audience would migrate to\n        support their company-independent channel. Often represented as a move towards independence\n        by creators, cultural production research (Nieborg &amp; Poell, 2018; Burgess et al. 2020)\n        has shown that creators are platform and audience dependent for viability. Therefore, we are\n        questioning whether being an (in)dependent YouTuber would be more precarious than being an\n        employed Buzzfeed creator. How does the migration from Buzzfeed to YouTube creator offer\n        both independence and a host of new contingencies? Situating a content and discourse\n        analysis of “Why I left Buzzfeed” YouTube videos and comments within academic and popular\n        discourse, we understand these videos as sources of ‘gossip’ (Bishop, 2018) defined as\n        “loose, unmethodological talk that is generative” (2590). Gossip can be beneficial to\n        ex-Buzzfeed creators building on their Buzzfeed association to boost algorithmic visibility.\n        Additionally, gossip is a valuable form of knowledge exchange for content creators to stay\n        informed on discourse, support one another, and communicate their perspective on former\n        Buzzfeed content. Gossip also allows us as researchers to break through the blackbox of\n        YouTube content creation to better comprehend precarity as multifaceted. We hypothesize that\n        creators have to balance different aspects of precarity depending on Buzzfeed as employer or\n        YouTube as distributor. The imaginary of independence is a false friend as both employed and\n        self-employed creators are dependent on platform governance and their platform public\n        (Mniestri &amp; Gekker, 2020) for success.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Although employers around the world (e.g. USA, Mexico, Sweden, Belgium, Estonia) have started to implant employees with microchips (Esfola, 2018; Petersen 2019), there is still not enough empirical insights about the opportunities and risks microchipped employees associate with the technology. Semi-structured individual interviews with microchipped employees (n=14) from six different organizations in Estonia were carried out in autumn 2019 so as to contribute new knowledge in this realm and to explore the reasoning of employees with implantables for accepting microchip implants from their employers and the potential benefits and problems they associate with the technology. Relying on the diffusion of innovations theory (DOI) by Everett Rogers (1962 [2003]) the current presentation aims to trace the five steps of the innovation-decision process our interviewed employees underwent when adopting to microchip implants. Preliminary findings indicate that micro-chipped employees are technology enthusiasts who are eager to embrace various technological affordances and have a lot of faith and trust both in the organization they work for. In fact, they were totally unconcerned about the potential problems microchips could pose and wholeheartedly believed in the value of trade-off between convenience and privacy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cultural anxiety about the impact of young people's intimate exchanges online has increased over the past 15 years. Sexual media and 'digital intimacies' are routinely understood to be a source of harm and adverse outcomes. This paper engages with Finland's National Bureau of Investigation's  $2  video campaign, the Police of Finland's public announcements on 'teen sexting' between 2017–2019 and young Finns responses to such educational efforts by using data from  $2  study that is a part of a more significant research project on intimacy in data-driven culture in Finland.  My research interest lies with some of the disconnections between current educational and policy discourses addressing young people's participation in digital cultures, and the lived experiences of young Finns. By asking from a focus-group of young Finns aged 15–19-years-old how they and their peers experience digital intimacy and their perceptions of the benefits, possible risks and harms, mitigations and solutions, I can draw a more ethical yet a complex picture of young people's engagement with digital intimacies.  I call for a focus on the political, ethical and material implications of such educational efforts and policy responses that premises on digital abstinence to critically reflect on the question of young people's (sexual) rights in digital environments. The University of Turku ethics board has approved the research design and the uses of all the research datasets.</jats:p>",

This panel interrogates the uses of biometric technologies and the consequences for the lives of migrants and refugees. It asks how biometric data are constituted, what their limitations and biases are, how biometric technologies challenge traditional notions of the physical border, in whose interest and with what implications for migrants and refugees. In particular, in bringing together a multidisciplinary group of international experts to develop a critical, comparative and empirically grounded dialogue, the panel explores the consequences of this ‘machinic life’ for the lives of actual people, migrants and refugees who navigate actual and digital borders in the quest of a better life. As such, the panel engages with crucial themes of processes of bordering, extractive logics and commercial dimensions of biometric flows and algorithmic sorting, discrimination and exclusion, and human agency and autonomy. Ultimately, all papers are concerned with the broader intersection of data, computation and justice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines China and South Korea’s health surveillance infrastructures that are being developed and deployed during COVID19. To control the outbreak and maintain the state, the Chinese government implemented the \"Alipay Health Code” in collaboration with technology giants like Alibaba, while South Korea launched a “self-quarantine safety protection app” to enforce home isolation to suspected carriers and monitor their health statuses. By comparatively analyzing these quarantine surveillance mobile applications that the Chinese and South Korean governments are utilizing in pandemic control, we investigate how these two different governmental regimes - one authoritarian and the other democratic - construct and propagate what their state-of-the-art surveillance technologies can offer to the public in moments of emergency. Through a mixture of walk-through method and situational analysis, this article aims to unpack the processes in which these technologies become developed and examine the politics around their deployment. More broadly, we argue that analyzing them offers new opportunities to investigate the relationship between state surveillance and personal privacy in the context of a national crisis. As surveillance tactics that were deemed oppressive and undemocratic in ordinary times get easily normalized in crisis situations, these moments allow us to reveal the precarious and flexible nature of surveillance and privacy while destabilizing the West-oriented, dichotomic understanding of these concepts. This article tackles this question by observing the relationships among relevant actors – the state officials, industry professionals, and general users – and various contestations/negotiations involved in the processes of designing and deploying these quarantine surveillance apps.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Play and performance with materials and objects can be observed as a trope across digital video cultures. Forms such as slime making tutorials, prank stunts, ASMR and unboxing videos employ different forms of interaction that serve to emphasise material form and sensory qualities. Activities can include pouring viscous glue, crushing tin cans, exploding watermelons, nails tapping on plastic or sinking into sand. Sound, visual and material are employed to create a ‘haptic visuality’ (Marks, 2000) as an affective embodied experience. I will analyse these video cultures as presented in the algorithmic context of YouTube and its claim to user-generated content. Through a DIY culture aesthetic and frame, materials are represented as everyday: the 'stuff’ of life. I will unpack the mimetic representation of ‘reality’ through which these videos function, employing Cowie’s concept of ‘desire for the real’ and Auslander’s discussion of ‘liveness’ in a mediated society (Cowie, 2011; Auslander 1999). I will contextualise this discussion in wider visual culture, drawing parallels with historical and contemporary performance art works. In particular the online practices of David Henry Nobody Jr. and Jan Hakon Erikson, which use play with domestic materials, objects and food to provoke abject, sadistic and absurd voyeuristic pleasures. I will discuss how these works reveal, mobilise, parody and subvert such digital video cultures. In this way, I aim to trace and analyse how this sensory play with material works to ‘hook’ the body of the viewer as a means of harnessing affective labour within the digital economies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Burgess and Bruns (2015) have linked the computational turn in social media research to a rise in studies that focus exclusively on ‘easy’ data, such as the ‘low hanging fruit’ provided by Twitter hashtags. This paper set out to explore whether this preponderance of easy data and studies focused on the 2011-12 protests is evident in research between 1995 and 2019 through a systematic review of digital activism literature (N = 1444). A particular focus of the review was the extent to which digital activism research revolved around the use of computational digital methods, case studies based in Europe and North America and data gathered from single online platforms (e.g. Twitter). The review showed that most of these studies focused on social movements, campaigns, activists, and parties based in the United Kingdom and United States, and were conducted by researchers based in universities in these countries. In contrast, there were relatively few articles addressing activism, institutions and platforms in non-Western /Global South contexts with the exception of the Arab Spring in 2011. In terms of methodological approaches, traditional research methods and big data digital methods studies were prevalent. In response to the easy data hypothesis, the study found that Twitter was the most researched platform in the corpus, but that digital methods were not as commonly deployed in these articles as traditional methods. Thus, the paper concludes argues in favor of greater diversity in digital activism research in terms of its methods, participants, and countries of origin.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2023, the world faced a humanitarian tragedy in Brazil involving the Yanomami people. In addition to the result of criminal conduct of public policies aimed at indigenous peoples in the last four years, the case highlights a culture of erasure of Brazilian native peoples that permeates society, institutions, and the mainstream press. In this work, we discuss how mining in indigenous lands has been approached discursively in Brazil. For this, we analyze the conversations on Twitter related to #AtoPelaTerra, a protest in defense of the environment and against the bill that authorizes mining in indigenous lands, held in Brasília in March 2022. To understand the conversation dynamics of the publications collected, we performed a network analysis (WASSERMAN &amp; FAUST, 1994) and to analyze the speeches produced by the subjects who participated in the debate, we adopted the Analysis of Connected Concepts (LINDGREEN 2016). Our results demonstrate that the conversation about the indigenous agenda has been polarized and with a strong misinformation content, especially in the field of the extreme right. In addition, the defense of native peoples and environmental preservation has a limited scope to its most active militancy. In the mainstream media, both the environmental agenda and the indigenous agenda are softened by replacing the term “mining” with “mineral exploration”, which ends up normalizing (FOUCAULT, 2003) practices that are harmful to the environment and indigenous peoples, as an effect of a crossing of the economic and supposedly developmentalist debate that prevails in these spaces.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines how dominant institutional actors exercise power and control over the digital advertising ecosystem. It pursues this inquiry through a case study on the 2021 introduction of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature—a privacy setting newly integrated in the operating system of iOS mobile devices. Developing this case study, we ask: How do dominant market actors exercise control over the infrastructural layers of the ‘mobile ad stack’ and how do they gain access to end-user data? These questions are addressed through a mix-methods approach that involves (A) analysis of developer documentation provided by Apple, (B) a review of ongoing litigation, and (C) analysis of financial disclosure forms of two ad-driven platforms Meta and Snapchat. This inquiry shows, first, how and why Facebook and Google, each in their own way, have been highly successful in their ability to aggregate both ad inventory and accurate, real-time user data. Second, it demonstrates how ATT blocked the access of advertising platforms to a key part of this real-time user data, while, simultaneously, enabling Apple to gain control over end-users’ mobile data. Thus, the rollout of ATT and its subsequent shifts in revenue and data demonstrate the relational and constantly evolving nature of institutional power in the mobile advertising ecosystem.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The #metoo movement has been one of the key social movements which has ushered in a change in structural relations in the society. In the Indian context, the movement has meant giving a powerful platform to women address generations of sexual assault in the Indian society. However, the #metoo movement has also witnessed a counter-response from the growing online ‘men’s rights activists’ (MRA) community.\n\nThis study focuses on the online presence of MRA movement in India and the practice of everyday visual misogyny on their Facebook pages. I specifically focus on the public Facebook page of Save Indian Family Movement. The paper focuses on visual posts like images in form of memes and distorted news clips shared on their public page with the aim of capturing visual misogyny.\n\nThe selection criteria were to manually collect all posts with an image for a duration of three months (17 October, 2022 – 21 January, 2023). I focus on this timeframe to cover the three months after Justice Chandrachud--who is not seen favourably amongst the MRA community for his progressive judgements --was appointed as the new Chief Justice of India.\n\nThe dataset of images only contains either memes or cartoons or news clips. I employ an iterative multimodal critical discourse analysis approach to analyse the visual posts and categorise them based on the schema of explicit and implicit misogyny developed by Strathern and Pfeffer (2022). The findings suggest majority of the visual posts fall within the implicit misogyny category.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Examining the competing images, values, and purposes attached to digital health tracking platforms, this paper analyzes how platform imaginaries are constructed and negotiated in complex intersectional realities. It pursues this inquiry through a case study on how Fitbit and Apple Health have become involved in recent societal negotiations over female digital health tracking in the US. Female health tracking has a well-documented history of negotiation and contestation. Developing this case study, we build on and rethink the concept of socio-technical imaginaries. We propose to consider the articulation of platform imaginaries not as a one-sided sense-making process, but as negotiations between multiple stakeholders of which platforms are but one. This conceptual perspective allows us to analyze the construction of imaginaries as a dynamic process, open to constant renegotiation, shaped by power differences between stakeholders, and affected by the intersectional positioning of user groups within platforms. The research is operationalised through a combination of critical discourse analysis of user and platform content and walkthroughs of Fitbit and Apple Health. The analysis highlights how digital health tracking platforms have become centrally imbricated in crucial societal issues, such as female bodily autonomy and reproductive rights. And it shows how quickly platform imaginaries of female self-determination and autonomy, associated with health-tracking apps, can be overthrown and reversed.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last two decades quantitative data representation has moved from a specialization of the sciences, economics, and statistics, to becoming commonplace in settings of democratic governance and community decision making. The dominant norms of those fields of origin are not connected to the governance and activism settings data is now used in, where practices emphasize empowerment, efficacy, and engagement. This has created ongoing harms and exclusion in a variety of well-documented settings. In this paper I critique the singular way of knowing embodied and charts and graphs, and apply the theories of epistemological pluralism and extended epistemology to argue for a larger toolbox of data representation. Through three concrete case studies of data representations created by activists I argue that social justice movements can embrace a broader set of approaches, practicing creative data representation as epistemological resistance. Through learning from these ongoing examples the fields of data literacy, open data, and data visualization can help create a broader toolbox for data representation. This is necessary to create a pluralistic practice of bringing people together around data in social justice settings.</jats:p>",

    "title": "IF NOT, ELSE: STANDARDS, PROTOCOLS, NETWORKS AND HOW THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The contemporary Internet's \"network of networks\" has become infrastructural to our lives. The Internet is a stack of physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers which all have unique rules and roles. While many see Internet infrastructure as a foregone conclusion, Paris, Cath and Myers West (2023) write “Internet infrastructure is built slowly, over time, protocol by protocol, in response to many different technical, social, political, environmental, and economic imperatives”. Even as the particular model of the Internet we are all accustomed to has become the standard, other attempts proliferated and eventually failed, as did the Soviet Internet (Peters 2016), and as this panel highlights, the Internet is still ever-evolving.\n\nThe project of this panel is to trace alternative, parallel, and emergent network models, standards and protocols, theorize their impact as they appear in different places, spaces, and contexts, and gesture towards how the Internet might be different. As critical internet studies have since the early 2000s shown, computational standards, protocols, and network diagrams are more than technical details, they have the power to shape and structure the conditions for our socio-cultural lifeworlds (Galloway 2006; Chun 2008; Bratton 2016). As Gehl (2014) puts it: “interfaces, database structures, mechanisms of connection all shape social activities”. Change an element in the stack and a different connectivity, a different future becomes possible.\n\nThe papers of this panel introduce and discuss five different and potentially revolutionary network technologies that manage and organize our online lives.\n\nThe first paper represents a media genealogy of ActivityPub – a protocol that enables the Fediverse, a collection of social media sites that can communicate with one another. The author argues that ActivityPub was not produced through an instrumental process, but was the result of accidents and coincidences. The accidental nature of the protocol, coupled with its being authored by self-identified queer and trans developers, has put it on a collision course with both the “standard” approach to standards production as well as mainstream, corporate social media.\n\nThe second paper focuses on the design of the Interplanetary Internet and the idea of delay-tolerant networking fundamental to operating in outer space. The author maintains that when delays are central to a network model, we are forced to rethink how our connections are maintained and organized in the future. Delay-tolerant networking is thus not only a technical solution for a communications system but a control protocol through which interplanetary life can be managed.\n\nThe third paper is also focused on the temporality of networks. The third paper examines how time is enacted as a design ideology in the course of the development of a future internet architecture protocol project: named data networking (NDN). This work locates aspects of the sociomateriality of time in the processes of building Internet infrastructure and demonstrates how it binds together cultural, economic, and discursive power. The paper argues that thinking through time as a design ideology can be useful in projects imagining how the Internet might be built to engender and support different values than market ideology.\n\nThe fourth paper is about the organizational culture of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a key internet standards and protocol organization. The paper argues that the organization is guided by a culturally inflected anti-political engineering ethos, whose depoliticizing tendencies hampers the organization’s functioning and its ability to rise above narrow industry-interest and pursue a public interest internet.\n\nThe fifth paper looks to the Crypto Wars of the 1990s as a moment where things could have been otherwise; comparing the examples of PGP and RSA encryption software and how they shaped the nature of our networked systems. It argues that a combination of regulatory and commercial interests influenced the development and use of cryptography in ways that facilitated the development of e-commerce, but left private messaging in dubious legal status.\n\nCollectively the papers investigate alternative and emergent trends behind the Internet and its network models, standards, and protocols. The protocols and rules for network connection, standards bodies, and modes of governance are critical to maintaining and upkeeping a network. Their impact, however, is not merely technical but potentially world-changing. The papers direct their critical gaze towards the development of these technologies and what their introduction to our world potentially entails. By focusing on projects of past, present, and future and by exploring the Internet’s deepest sociotechnical layers, the panel critically dismantles the commonly-held idea that the Internet is a monolith and illustrates that the history of the Internet is still being written.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we explore how activists and human rights defenders deal with datafication. This work demonstrates how data can be a valuable resource in activism and campaign planning. In addition, data and lack of data also complicate daily life for people in vulnerable positions, for example, when contacting government agencies, schools, and medical facilities .\n\nData from four types of human rights activism formed the basis of our analysis. They include volunteers and employees of NGOs dealing with refugee and migrant issues, homelessness, poverty, sexual minorities, and women's shelters. The study was done in Sweden, where the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) laws limit the handling and storage of personal data.\n\nThe following five major themes emerge from the analysis of data from our interview study: Affording personal integrity, Data poverty, Protective data practices, Drawing attention to data, and Systems and data routines.\n\nIn addition, this study shows how activists and the organizations that they support are exposed to contradictory aspects of data; on one hand, deliberately exposing data about marginalized/minoritized groups, while on the other, making sure those groups, along with activists themselves, are not exposed. Most important, the data laws and regulations are not adjusted to the needs of the most vulnerable in society, and therefore, actions of civil disobedience are necessary to care for vulnerable populations through data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Online media platforms have become an arena for activists to engage with political discourses. Since COVID-19, an increasing number of citizens have begun to actively participate online to express their ideas towards political issues. Various types of user-generated content were circulated on various social media platforms: they wrote textual content on Wechat with various metaphors and created user-generated videos on video-streaming platforms to express their opinions. In this context, this study examines how citizens express democratic opinions against ideological discourse, what role social media platforms play as an arena for activists’ participation, and what social media factors facilitate active online civic participation. Adopting a cross-platform perspective, this study compares how Douyin and Wechat facilitate civic participation differently and how people engage with political content differently on these two different media platforms. I employed digital ethnography, augmented by the walkthrough method (Light et al., 2018), and qualitative content analysis to examine how WeChat and Douyin play different roles in civic participation. This study argues that the social networking platform WeChat provides more in-depth participation and has more resistant forms than Douyin, especially for expressing counter-ideas to mainstream discourses. Among the various forms of resistance, sharing WeChat articles is one of the most visible and effective ways to express democratic opinions in mainstream discourse.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Leading up to, during, and immediately following the 2016 US election of Donald Trump, there was buzz about magic on the internet. From the meme magic of the cult of Kek to liberal witches performing binding spells, magic seemed to emerge out of thin air. However, while technology and the occult may seem like strange bedfellows, they have a cozier historical relationship then we often acknowledge. For instance, it has been well-documented that there was a synergetic relationship between telegraphy and spiritualism (Sconce, 2000) and we can consider ciphers used to construct grimoires as an antecedent to modern techno-cryptography (Reeds, 1998). In this paper, I historicize internet magic situating the recent online magical wars within the broader context of both digital and occult histories. Just as spiritualist séances articulated hopes and anxieties of mass communication, meme magic speaks to contemporary concerns and desires about information spread.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As social media platforms face increasing complexity, severity, and pervasiveness of violent content, it is of utmost importance for researchers, educators, policymakers, and users alike to regard digital violence as an imminent threat. Indeed, violent content is widely acknowledged as an inseparable element of the continuum of violence, interlinked with various other types and embodiments of harm that transcend the archaic boundaries of online and offline realms. To adequately address the increasingly complex nature of violence on digital platforms, it is paramount to understand how digital platforms may modify and amplify violent behavior and content. The initial step in such efforts is to contextualize violence within its cultural and historical settings. Accordingly, this panel explores digital manifestations of violence as experienced and perceived within specific socio-cultural contexts. The papers presented delve into four case studies from diverse socio-cultural contexts (Colombia, Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestine, and Syria), and touch upon pressing contemporary issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, anti-religion protest in Iran, and the recent earthquakes in Syria. These case studies aim to explore the impact and reach of various forms of violence manifested on digital platforms. Panelists unpack ways of inciting, reproducing, expressing, and countering violence, enacted through a wide variety of media practices (such as memes, tweets and viral videos) across various platforms (including TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp). In this panel we seek to build bridges and deepen our understanding of the complex and multifaceted dynamics of digital violence by exploring possible solutions for mitigating its detrimental impact.</jats:p>",

Specifically, this research explores the use of algo-design in the paratext of romance and erotica novels by authors of color and LGBTQIA authors who publish their fiction on digital publishing platforms, such as Amazon, and market them on social media platforms. This exploratory reseach is based on a qualitative multi-method research design, including interviews with authors and metadata analysis. In many cases, algo-design may be seen as a revolutionary creative tactic for BIPOC and LGBTQIA authors of romance fiction, who are disproportionately affected by content moderation systems (Monea, 2022) and often have their works flagged as adult material due to the genre’s tendency to include intimate relationships (Parnell, 2021). In this way, the use of algo-design by authors is a clear effort to push back against bluntly imposed content moderation interventions and subvert platform power.</jats:p>",

    "title": "REVISITING KEY CONCEPTS IN DIGITAL MEDIA RESEARCH: INFLUENCE, POPULISM, PARTISANSHIP, POLARISATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent scholarship on the intersections between digital media and political debate has taken on a decidedly pessimistic, even dystopian tone, and not without reason: from the effective use of social media platforms by populists and demagogues like Donald Trump to the expression of deepening ideological divides in online public debate, and from the emergence of partisan online communities and platforms to the intensification and exploitation of such partisanship by conspiracy theorists and state actors, there are substantial concerns about the way that extremist actors are utilising digital and social media logics to further their ideological agendas. The situation is further complicated by platform providers’ and regulators’ limited and unsystematic responses to these issues.\n\nBut while there is considerable research into the various issues and events that illustrate these developments, many of the central concepts that are used to describe these cases receive substantially less critical attention. Terms such as ‘influence’, ‘populism’, ‘partisanship’, and ‘polarisation’ are often deployed as if did not themselves require further qualification and definition – even in spite of the considerable volume of literature in political science and other ancillary disciplines that addresses the various facets that such concepts may have. Informed by and building on substantial empirical research, this panel therefore facilitates a conversation between methodological innovation at the coalface of digital trace data analysis and careful reflection on the definitions of key concepts, in order to explore the conceptual frameworks and methodological approaches that might illuminate the distinct features of our four key concepts in sharper focus.\n\nOur first paper engages with the concept of influence, which it conceptualises as the power to affect others. Focussing especially on the spread of verified false content (VFC) through social media, it proposes a novel population-scale approach that both employs a bottom-up perspective for identifying the influential actors spreading such content, and highlights the exposure of ordinary citizens to these messages. It demonstrates this approach by drawing on the large-scale Facebook URL-sharing dataset available from Social Science One, developing an EU-wide perspective on VFC exposure at national levels.\n\nOur second paper continues this approach by critiquing the concept of populism, highlighting the term as a weak analytical concept. It argues that, rather than focussing on their populist stance, populist politicians can be judged by the extent of their delegitimising rhetoric. Further, the paper asserts that such rhetoric is enabled by the decentralised communication environment of social media. The utility of the concept of delegitimisation is that enables the identification of political messages that are truly dangerous because they are meant to destabilise fundamental democratic principles, such as the integrity of the vote and the legitimacy of alternative policy perspectives. By situating this in the context of social media messaging, we can see how such messages are amplified by distributed network channels.\n\nOur third paper shifts focus to the possible results of influence campaigns and populist demagoguery, and addresses the concept of partisanship. Taking as case study the 2022 Italian election, it introduces a novel combination of computationally informed analytical methods and applies them to social media data to gauge the level of partisan attention devoted to the different news sources and political topics in the election campaign, and distinguish between partisan and cross-partisan sources and themes. This provides new insights into the structures, intersections, and faultlines of partisanship, and enables the mapping of a broader multi-dimensional ideological space.\n\nOur final paper continues this discussion by exploring the complexities of polarisation. It highlights the conceptual fluidity of this term, which is expressed in the multitude of adjectives and qualifiers that can be found in the relevant literature – from ideological through affective to interactive polarisation and beyond, and from benign and even beneficial to pernicious and destructive polarisation. Mapping these distinct forms of polarisation onto a diverse range of mixed-methods digital media research approaches, and outlining a number of criteria for assessing whether the dynamics of polarisation have turned destructive, it outlines new pathways for polarisation research in Internet studies.\n\nIn combination, then, these four papers offer a timely nudge for digital and social media research to revisit and reconsider some of the central concepts in online political communication studies, and to retrace and reaffirm the connections between the definitions of these concepts and the methodological frameworks that we use to study them.</jats:p>",

    "title": "THEORIZING ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIATION THROUGH IRELAND'S PEATLANDS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In colonial and postcolonial Ireland, boglands were seen as \"wastelands\" to be \"improved\" by large-scale enterprise. Today, they are strategic landscapes for carbon sequestration and climate solutions, both for the state and multinationals located in Ireland. Various contemporary projects, co-funded by industry and state partners, have facilitated the expansion and proliferation of sensing, monitoring, and mapping technologies across Ireland's bogs to measure and maximize their value in these economies. However, by doing so, they are laying the foundations for a \"green grab\" of Ireland's land resources by tech companies.\n\nThis paper situates the historical resource and conservation landscape of Ireland’s peat boglands within their emerging role in datafied “green” revolutions. Emphasizing the stakes of land, resources, technologies, and research institutions within green transitions, the paper theorizes peat bogs an emerging site of digital climate solutionism. In doing so, I offer a framework for understanding resource landscapes in so-called “post-extractive” contexts where networked forms of extraction are innovated through public/private technoscientific research at the intersections of digital technology and ecosystemic interactions between geologies, atmospheres, and cultures. Bringing together literature from environmental media studies, STS, and geography, and performing participant observation and discourse analysis on emerging projects of peatland science in academic and industry settings, I theorize how “environmental mediation” offers an aperture for understanding how digital technologies network landscapes towards “ecosystem services” and other capital-driven climate projects.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>“Super apps” are on the rise and gaining popularity worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia, India and Africa. These are “do-everything apps” that offer a wide range of services in a single interface, making them more integrated into people's lives. Super apps thus highlight the organisation, political economy and geopolitics of the platformisation process in the app economy. While most studies on super apps focus on Chinese and Southeast Asian apps, this paper examines super apps from around the world to better understand and discuss the phenomenon. Specifically, it examines and discusses (1) what “super apps” are, (2) by whom they were developed, (3) when they were created or how they evolved over time, and (4) where—in which countries or regions or parts of the world—they emerged. We provide a typology of super-app constellations based on the different characteristics identified in a global collection of 40 super-apps. We discuss the local or regional differences between apps, their historical emergence, modes of capital accumulation and the challenges and implications arising from them for critical research. The rise of super-apps and their integration into people's daily lives in general invites us to delve deeper into the relatedness and situatedness of apps, and focus in particular on the unique conglomeration processes currently taking place in the mobile ecosystem.</jats:p>",

We then discuss how these built spaces are used and experienced as “socio-sexual silos” with a particular focus on notions of safety. Finally, we consider what this means for sociality on social media and propose “context promiscuity” as a conceptual aid for unpacking this.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1994, U.S. President Clinton stated that the commercialization of the internet was a “top priority” for his administration. The domain name system (DNS), which was developed to deal with the growing unwieldiness of the commercial internet, was an early battleground in shaping the values of early internet governance policies. The system would include highly sought after addresses in generic top-level domains (gTLDS) that ended in .com, .gov, .org, .edu, and so on. Below this were second-level domains and country codes which ended web addresses in sequences like .uk, .jp, .ca, etc. This model raised legal and economic questions about trademarks, intellectual property, and the global distribution of addresses on top level domains. Technical experts were wary of the limitations of the proposed system, particularly given the potential to expand the number of gTLDs. While many groups responded to U.S. governance policy, a number of non-profit associations were particular vocal in their critique, most notably the Internet Council of Registrars (CORE), the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC), and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) represented by Jon Postel. As the internet transitioned from a network used primarily by government and educational entities to a mass medium, there was a potential for revolutionary modes of communication, information sharing, education, creative expression, and a revolutionary, de-centralized structure of governance. The DNS debate resulted instead in support of predictable structures of power and a failure to realize that potential.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Solidarity has been cited as a necessary prerequisite for transformational structural change and therefore contains revolutionary potential (Featherstone, 2012). This paper examines the role and evolution of mediated solidarities, which have become increasingly central to an analysis of social movements with the advent of participatory technologies, by drawing on data from a project on anti-Islamophobic counter-narratives.\n\nOnline platforms have the affordances to contest Islamophobic hate speech as demonstrated by the dynamics of #stopIslam following the Brussels terror attack, 2016. In this instance, the hashtag gained its prominence through the contestations of users who sought to question, critique and undermine its original message (reference redacted). However, research has also shown the limitations of social media for online activism, in particular for creating meaningful debates or change (Schradie, 2019).\n\nThis paper examines data from a large-scale study that used methods of computational, quantitative, and qualitative analysis to examine the dynamics of discourse about Muslims on Twitter in the case of Brexit, the Christchurch terror attack and Covid. We will examine whether the high incidence of solidarity discourses in this dataset are limited to acts of counter-speech (and other acts of weak solidarity) or if they contribute to sustainable counter-narratives that have implications for wider discursive formations related to Islam. Rather than reinforce existing binary arguments regarding the potentials and limitations of Twitter as a platform for solidarity, we wish to demonstrate the contradictory dynamics of the solidarities that arise from the logics of Twitter which relies on and produces these entanglements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Age-related digital inequalities have been one of the key aspects to understand and enable better ageing in the digitalized world. Although there is a large body of literature on direct forms and determinants of digital engagement among older internet users and non-users, only a few studies have focused on determinants of indirect internet uses among older non-users. To address this gap, this study investigates how the unequal distribution of resources among older non-users affects the availability and activation of supportive relationships, which enable them to ask other internet users to perform internet activities on their behalf—a practice known as use-by-proxy (UBP). Drawing on van Dijk’s (2005) resources and appropriation theory, we build a conceptual model with seven hypotheses. These hypotheses specify sequential pathways between categorical inequalities and differences in social and material resources as determinants of the heterogeneity of UBP availability and activation of networks. In turn, availability and activation affect the breadth of UBP engagement among older non-users. The model is tested on a representative survey sample of 241 respondents aged 65+ from Slovenia. Results from path analysis partly support the model and demonstrate the importance of investigating the sequential paths between social and age-related digital inequalities with respect to indirect forms of internet uses. The results also suggest that interventions aimed at supporting older non-users in their access to online services can be targeted at different levels, from addressing categorical and resource inequalities to providing UBP services.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores how content creators in the Nigerian social media video industry navigate the economic, infrastructural, and cultural logics of digital platforms through practices of reciprocal labour. As is the case in many global contexts, the economic formalization of social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok, have enabled the emergence of for-profit social media video production in Nigeria. This paper focuses on the under-studied intersection of platform logics and labour relations in this industry. Drawing on 10 semi-structured interviews with Nigerian content creators, combined with analysis of the domestic trade press, we observe that creators struggle to generate visibility in a highly saturated social media landscape. This visibility imperative is not unique to Nigeria. What sets Nigeria apart, however, is the local political economy of video production, which translates into high production costs, which are offset by orchestrating practices of informally organised reciprocal labour. Nigeria thus provides a relevant perspective to ongoing debates in platform research that seek more regional specificity and seek to decentre the Global North as their point of reference. To heed that call, the specific labour practices we highlight, those of reciprocal labour, reflect the broader informal economies and traditional kinship norms in Nigeria. Exploring this mode of work showcases the intersections among creative labour and cultural dynamics in a given national context vis-à-vis the unifying business models and centralized governance frameworks of platform companies.</jats:p>",

We present findings from a study with 25 participants who have used Instagram for five or more years as part of their professional or creative practices. Participants downloaded and donated their complete archive of Instagram posts and stories. We then printed out 500 images from their profile as photographs and clustered their entire archive using our purpose-built machine vision system. In a co-analysis interview participants scrolled back through their Instagram profile, narrating changes in their practices and the platform over time. They then manually sorted the images printed from their archive and explored a visualisation of the algorithmic clustering of their images. Through this process of co-analysis we elicit the algorithmic imaginary of users and develop an intimate platform biography of how their practices are entangled with platform interfaces and algorithmic models.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Children’s finances are increasingly datafied through the emergence and development of applications for managing chores, saving, and spending. These finance apps incorporate features for both parents and children, enabling the setting and tracking of chores, the payment of allowances or pocket money, as well as supporting and managing children’s saving and spending habits.\n\nThe paper draws on and contributes to children’s financial socialisation and digital platform studies. This paper offers a novel contribution to these fields, applying the concept of datafication to children’s financial lives through a feature analysis of children’s finance apps. The feature analysis reviews information in Appstore descriptions, company websites, and product reviews to identify and map the range of features spread across these apps.\n\nOur analysis considers three emergent themes in which these apps are significantly impacting children’s financial lives: management of child household labour; mediation of children’s financial agency; and datafication of children’s economic participation.\n\nWe argue that the data produced by child finance apps simultaneously enables increased agency and control of children’s financial lives by initiating a lifelong digital trace.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As the Covid-19 pandemic spread globally, activist-led mutual aid efforts quickly emerged all over the world to help people access food and other basic necessities. Mutual aid activists relied on multi-layered digital practices to coordinate their efforts, largely by employing corporate digital technologies. In conversation with the literature on digital activism and drawing on 40 interviews with activists in the US, Italy and the UK, in this paper I examine how Covid-19 mutual aid complicates our understanding of the intersection of activism and digital technologies and of the online/offline divide. I show that contradictory experiences of the digital marked this wave of solidarity activism. First, while mutual aid was fully digital, especially given the necessity to organize while physically distancing, it was also embodied, because activists physically had to come together to prepare and distribute food and PPE. At the same time, there was also a new appreciation for digital-only activism as an equally valid form of engagement. Second, some mutual aid groups adopted very sophisticated tech-enabled systems, which required significant labor to manage and had a steep learning curve. Other groups, however, relied on less sophisticated tech practices (e.g. Whatsapp chats and phone calls). Even in a moment of heightened centrality of digital communication, such as the pandemic, the offline was still crucial. I argue that we can make sense of these somewhat contradictory aspects through activists’ commitment to care as overarching principle, which oriented them towards developing more inclusive movements, built on overlapping modalities of activism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The government of India, in 2014, launched a flagship programme called Digital India, with a vision to transform India into a ‘digitally empowered society and knowledge economy’. A similar intention is reflected in another initiative called BharatNet. The USO Fund was established with the fundamental objective of providing access to telegraph services, including mobile services, broadband connectivity and ICT infrastructure creation in rural and remote areas.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that India has also been notorious at shutting down the internet. In Access Now’s report (2021), India has consistently raked number one, in the total number of hours spent under internet shutdown. In India, shutdowns have occurred during citizen protests like the anti- CAA protests in late 2020, and early 2021, and the Farmers Protest in 2021.\n\nWhen we look at these two actions by the government- one, to digitise governance and provide connectivity to all citizens to digitally empower them allow for the participation in networked economy; and two, to disrupt these very connections when citizens use networks to express dissent.\n\nIn this paper I take a closer look at the policy documents and the building of information infrastructure that is written into it. While also studying how infrastructure gets suspended during dissenting movements led by citizens. I use the case of the two protests to understand this disruption. Using newspaper analysis and interviews, I examine how infrastructure gets denied and disrupted to citizens when digital networks are used in ways that are unintended by the government.</jats:p>",

The findings advance AfroGreek youth's proclamation of social media as a breeding ground for racism and how their proactive participation can help reshape the internet. It also results in developing Critical Consciousness as mapped out through the knowledge-holders' involvement in Critical Action, Political Self-Efficacy, and Critical Reflection.\n\nThe output actively contributes to creating impactful internet-based interventions and towards a more inclusive and informed societal framework.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholarly attention is increasingly paid to the dynamic and embedded ways in which third-party tracking has become widespread in the mobile ecosystem. Much of this research has focused almost exclusively on Android applications in Google Play and their respective infrastructures of data capture, even though Apple and their App Store have a significant market share. To examine Apple’s ecosystem and to overcome the challenge of opening and inspecting large quantities of apps, we have explored the role that a large language model (LLM) can play in enabling this process? We have opted to use Chat GPT-4 because of how it has been designed to assist humans in both interacting and understanding code. We therefore ask: Can Chat-GPT assist scholars interested in Apple’s mobile ecosystem through the auditing of Apple app (IPA) files?\n\nThe outcomes of the explorative study include 1) an evaluation of Chat-GPT4 as an assistant for reading code at scale as well as its potential for automating processes involved in future app monitoring and regulation; 2) a deep dive into the shortcomings of Chat-GPT4 when it comes to interventions into the mobile ecosystems; and 3) a discussion of ethical issues involved in harnessing LLM for forwarding a research agenda around Apple’s otherwise understudied ecosystem. Our exploration aims to evaluate a methodological intervention that could bring more observability into an otherwise closed ecosystem that promises the preservation of end-user privacy, without any meaningful external oversight.</jats:p>",

We offer a playbook for better understanding live streaming platform governance as an iterative process which frequently targets vulnerable streamers.\n\nWe applied thematic analysis to two case studies to document how regulatory inconsistencies are directed at historically marginalized streamers. These cases include Twitch’s response to: 1) Kai Cenat’s impromptu community meet-up which was labeled a riot by the NYPD and 2) When Twitch modified their clothing and attire policy three times in one month to curtail the so-called ‘topless meta’, where a handful of women staged their cleavage to imply full nudity and optimize viewer engagement.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The question as to the most apt regulatory model to apply to the internet is one that occupies legislators, policymakers and courts around the world. This question was recently debated in two diametrically opposed judgments by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth and the Eleventh Circuit, triggered by challenges to the Texas and Florida ‘anti-online censorship’ laws. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit likened platforms to common carriers, disputed that their content curation amounts to First Amendment protected speech, and upheld the constitutionality of the Texas law. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected platforms’ characterisation as common carriers. It argued that their content moderation decisions are First Amendment protected editorial judgements and declared the Florida law unconstitutional. These judgments did not address the closely linked, and equally vexed question whether users should be able to assert their free speech rights against social media platforms. In Germany, this question has been fought in a multitude of court cases, and has divided courts and commentators alike. The pending Supreme Court judgment and a possible German Constitutional Court verdict on the power of platforms to moderate users’ speech are likely to decisively shape the future of the internet. This paper proposes to contribute to this debate by adopting a comparative constitutional methodology to test, first, the historical analogies between old and new media employed in the Florida and Texas cases, and secondly, the limits of regulating social media platforms by human rights.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Platformization of news, and the resultant concerns for publishers, have led to the rise and formalization of a network of intermediaries that mediate between news businesses and large distribution platforms in India. These intermediaries facilitate and broker interactions between news publishers and platforms by providing AI/ML tools and algorithmic expertise on news production, distribution, and monetization. This paper locates and conceptualizes them as platformization intermediaries, highlighting their role in reshaping cultural economies and practices into platform-optimized models. Platformization intermediaries leverage certified partnerships with major platforms thereby assisting in integrating platform infrastructure, funding and governance models into the digital news industry.\n\nTaking a political economy approach, this study critically examines the services and market dynamics of a range of platformization intermediaries in the news industry in India. Further, interviews with these actors in India unpack the implications on news publishers and the public interest value of news. This paper draws focus onto these emerging and influential actors aiding the platformization of news. It highlights their role in translating platforms' algorithmic and economic priorities into the human and social practices of news-making, and in reinforcing platform dependencies within the digital news industry.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper explores small-scale entrepreneurship on the early web, specifically identifying socio-economical practices of local/regional business in the Netherlands during the emergence of the new economy in the mid-90s and early 2000s. The new economy has been described in prior research as not only a novel, financial system but also as a cultural shift. Public media highlight the widespread optimism and subsequent disillusionment of the dot-com era; a period in which many traditional local/regional businesses migrated to the digital realm. In the Netherlands, a push is notable from ideological initiatives and state actors to make the internet accessible and functional for everyone. One can identify an interesting mix of neoliberalism, commercialism, and individualism, as well as everydayness and amateurism that created the backdrop against which local/regional industries took their businesses online for the first time. Following a grassroots approach and a mixed methodology, including computational analysis and content examination of archived websites, the research identifies the integration of domestic and commercial spheres on early websites, as well as a shift towards more professionalized e-business strategies over time. The paper contributes to the field by theorizing small-scale entrepreneurship in the move of local/regional businesses onto the web, offering a methodological framework for archival exploration, and enriching the historiography of the Dutch public web and the new economy from a bottom-up perspective. By foregrounding local/regional perspectives, it aims to provide a cultural-historical understanding of the web and encourages comparative analysis between under-studied narratives and dominant interpretations in the field of Internet History.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Sex is central to the internet. It exists everywhere online and yet is everywhere constrained, sanitized, normalized, and invisibilized. This panel will investigate the ways in which sex seeps, spills, and oozes across boundaries, both online and off, despite efforts to control and limit its impact beyond consumer capitalism. Author 1 examines online ‘gooning’ communities, oriented around prolonged masturbation sessions to multiple streams of pornography. Gooners build community around the fetishization and roleplaying of porn addiction, but simultaneously produce a problematic queerness that reifies some elements of heteronormativity. Author 2 examines the ways that Generative AI imagines queerness, probing AI systems by asking them to imagine the figure of the ‘twink’. The end result is “glitchcraft,” which refers to creative practices of engagement that underscore the excitatory enchantments of generative AI, their frustrating constraints, and the accidents–exploited or serendipitous–that might result. Authors 3, 4, and 5 examine alternative social media aimed specifically at enabling users to engage in sexual expression. They document both the affordances of these platforms for creating sex-positive and kink-friendly online spaces, and their constraints, as they introduce new norms, and thus new forms of exclusion and marginalization. Author 6 examines anal sex practices as mediated by gay hook-up apps like Grindr and shows how these apps increasingly mediate larger portions of gay men’s everyday lives. Grindr inflects the way they imagine, propose, seek out, and react to a diverse spectrum of anal activities (such as fisting, spanking, caressing, and rimming).</jats:p>",

    "title": "MIXED FEELINGS: THE PLATFORMISATION OF MOODS AND VIBES",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few years, digital platforms from different sectors have started tailoring their content to both respond to and create certain moods, vibes, or ‘ambiences’. In so doing, they become ‘atmospheric architectures’ (Bohme 2020), entering the industry of emotional regulation. I posit that a critical-phenomenological framework is a productive epistemological, theoretical, and methodological resource for scrutinising this shift precisely at the intersection of embodied affect and the political economy of platformisation. By critical phenomenology I mean a phenomenological disposition that is not blind to the social, technical, and political environment in which it is situated (Couldry and Kallinikos 2018). This paper also dialogues with recent discussions both in public discourse and the relevant scholarship about a latent change in our digital sociality, in which the values for which we once celebrated digital media are now being replaced by a different mode of consumption, fruition, and attention (John 2022). Using the contemporary case studies to flesh out these new formations in emotional capitalism (Illouz 2007), I propose that we are entering a new stage in programmed sociality (Bucher 2018), focused less on sharing, connecting, or engaging, and more on the platformisation of the merely felt. The examination of this phenomenon demands us to acknowledge the significance of those mixed feelings – which involve an interplay of the affective and the computational – and of their entanglement with a profit-oriented corporate technoscape.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, a specific type of influencers has notoriously popularised – misogynist influencers, with Andrew Tate standing out as the most prominent one. While popular and networked misogyny (Banet-Weiser &amp; Miltner, 2016) and various parts of the manosphere, together with related conceptualisations have been well studied, Andrew Tate and other misogynists as (aspirational) influencers have received little academic attention. This study will focus on these aspirational misogynist content creators, exploring the circulation of their misogynist content on social media, the professionalisation and monetisation of misogyny, and lastly, how these communities keep registering ‘under the radar’ (Abidin, 2021).\n\nUsing a mixed-method approach, this study will focus on misogynist influencers in Estonia. Digital ethnography (Pink et al., 2016; Markham, 2017) will be the dominant method employed, exploring the strategic circulation, professionalisation (Greenwood, 1966; Trice, 1993) and monetisation aspects of misogynist content on various social platforms. Secondly, a combination of qualitative content analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) and socio-semiotic visual analysis (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2020) is used to study the textual and visual methods of social steganography (boyd &amp; Marwick, 2011). Very preliminary results show that in the process of professionalisation, ideologies of masculinities are created, each of which emphasises different aspects (e.g., financial, physical, sexual, etc). The results of this study are crucial for understanding the circulation and professionalisation of misogynistic content in the context of networked misogyny (Banet-Weiser &amp; Miltner, 2016) – an important phenomenon related to the influencer industry.</jats:p>",

Our inquiries into the labor subjectivities that emerge from processes of adaptation to platform work are oriented around the cultures, practices, and ideals of social media influencer careers.\n\nThese papers discuss the mechanisms by which different actors within the influencer industry navigate constantly changing organizational environments, a crucial aspect of what it takes for them to thrive across industries and labor markets. This involves reinventing themselves in an ever-changing technological environment, coping with being subjects of permanent control and evaluation by customers and employers, and making sense of their activities in highly-commercial environments. Consequently, notions of labor and value remain in a continuous state of contestation and redefinition within the influencer industry. The papers span topics ranging from visibility and authenticity to the reinvention of work through platform engagements, as well as the role intermediaries play in the quantification and qualification of influencer activities.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the rise in commercial applications of LLMs, scholarship has neglected an in-depth appreciation of the free contribution of subjects communicative social action as the engine of training data production as a necessary moment in digital processes of valorisation. This issue was popular in the analyses of the post-operaist tradition of free labour, but have since been missing in examinations of more recent technological developments, specifically in what concerns AI. Although the work of Baudrillard is semi-frequently evoked in descriptive critical assessments of new technologies, there is little integration of Baudrillard's work in contemporary studies of AI. This paper aims at contributing in this direction, by showcasing the utility of Baudrillard’s concepts of simulation, subject function, masses, and the social, for an understanding of immaterial free labour in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nDrawing from the recent phenomena of the sale of Reddit communications content to OpenAI as training data, I propose the notion of digital common as the pre-trained collected and recorded data of actual human communication through digital systems. I propose the framework of the subject function as expounded by Baudrillard, in both its individual and collective aspects, as a necessary conjuncture to understand how commercial applications of conversational LLMs fit into the broader landscape of digital political economy. I suggest that the role played in this specific application derives from the appropriation of freely generated user-data as constituting the digital common and as carrying a specific conception of subjectivity as functional.</jats:p>",

    "title": "HOW FACT-CHECKERS ARE BECOMING MACHINE LEARNERS: A CASE OF META’S THIRD PARTY PROGRAMME",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>A recent development in the field of fact-checking is what some scholars call the “debunking turn” in which fact-checking organisations move from fact-checking expressions of politicians and public figures to checking claims made on social media. A main driver of this change is the proliferation of a paid program initiated by Meta, where fact-checkers check and label claims on the platform in exchange for monetary remuneration. This paper draws on interviews with and fieldwork amongst fact-checkers who are or have been part of the Meta partnership. Based on the empirical insights we argue that the human-machine assemblage in fact-checking is (1) enabling a move beyond the ‘debunking turn’ by turning journalists into ‘machine learners’ and (2) cements a ‘politics of demarcation’ in which public contestation over public facts is diminished and moved into networked infrastructures.\n\nWith this argument, the paper highlights an additional aspect of the platformisation of journalism, as the labelling and claim-checking work of journalists now also enables large tech platforms to expand technical infrastructures that commodify journalistic work by turning it into training data aimed at improving their ML systems and algorithms. This enables platforms to move further beyond their current market role, as they also participate in the further industrialisation and standardisation of fact-checking. As large tech companies become industry leaders in the provision of ML systems, for example, for fact-checking, the need to understand what politics they produce equally increases, as they become integral in the production of democratic ideals of citizens and public debate.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Originating as supplementary firms that operate in and around YouTube’s advertising infrastructure, Multichannel Networks (MCNs) have become a renewed form of cultural intermediaries shaping platform-based cultural production (Lobato 2016; Craig and Cunningham 2019). The emergence of MCNs represents “an opportunity to revisit some elements of the theory base around intermediaries and update it for the platform economy” (Lobato 2016, 350). To hold with this appeal, this research investigates MCNs’ operations in the context of China’s e-commerce livestreaming industry and rethinks its position within the complicated social commerce landscape based on a three-month participatory observation (from December 2021 to March 2022) taken place in an MCN organization (pseudonymised as W company) in Guangzhou, China. For providing a more grounded analysis, 15 in-depth interviews with media professionals working in MCNs (within and outside W company) or working in the e-commerce livestreaming sector as content creator, advertiser, or manufacturer were also included. I employ the concepts of “trade stories” (Caldwell, 2008) and “industry lore” (Havens, 2014) to describe MCNs professionals’ meaning-making practices when navigating a complex network of actors including platforms, livestreamers, brands and retailers. Whilst MCNs are important “platform complementors” (Poell, Nieborg and Duffy 2022, 11) fulfilling an intermediary role in compliance with platforms’ commercial logics, practitioners also struggle to keep up with the changing business models. The deeply integrated components between cultural production and marketing activities in MCNs’ work are supported and determined by the digital platforms they operate around, making the MCNs’ intermediary roles limited, contingent, and oftentimes failing.</jats:p>",

This panel examines the role that content moderation and platform governance play in censoring sexual expression online and the communities that engage in it. It documents the impact that censorship, banning, shadowbanning, and demonetization have on internet communities and highlights potential alternatives for platform governance. Author 1 examines the pole dancing community on Instagram and the impact that banning, shadowbanning, and content takedowns have on its constituents. In particular, she examines the impact that Instagram’s new ‘Account Status’ feature has had on pole dancers’ labor to manage their visibility on the platform. Author 2 examines the role that early cisheteronormative content moderation practices have had on shaping the algorithmic imaginary of Queer TikTok. He shows that it has resulted in ‘algorithmic folk remedies’ – like ‘algospeak’ – that are still used by Queer TikTokers in attempts to avoid demonetization, shadowbanning, and/or deplatforming. Authors 3 and 4 examine erotic webcam streamers and platforms and document the ways in which webcam platform policies work to discipline the labor of erotic webcam streamers. Content moderation is leveraged to keep streamers on the platform and capture their revenue streams. Author 5 examines how new and emerging independent small-scale platforms and cooperatives moderate sexual content. She documents the incredible difficulty of maintaining an alternative, sex positive, business model in the current political and economic landscape.</jats:p>",

This work contends that for many, especially those with less power, the techno-utopian vision characterized by datafication and Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead produces a state of prolonged waiting. Drawing from two long-term ethnographic studies examining the production and implementation phases of data-driven technologies in China and U.S., we demonstrate how the “long-standing but mistaken belief, hegemonic in Silicon Valley, that automation will deliver us more time” (Wajcman, 2019) belies the highly stratified temporal impacts of automation, datafication, and AI. Specifically, this work uses AI training and the homeless services system as case studies to reveal the politics of waiting; despite the promise of data-driven technologies, pervasive waiting serves as evidence of an enduring residue—an unequal power structure. Our findings also suggest that the technologies which mediated the experience of waiting in the first, more immediate sense, also impacted how people conceptualize the future.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have raised questions about the changing nature of work. Research has started to investigate how this technology affects labor markets and might replace or augment different types of jobs. Beyond their economic implications in the world of work, there are important sociological questions about how LLMs connect to subjective evaluations of work, such as the prestige and perceived social value of different occupations, and how the widespread use of LLMs perpetuate often biased views on the labor markets reflected in their training datasets. Despite initial research on LLMs’ world model, their inherent biases, attitudes and personalities, we lack evidence on how LLMs themselves evaluate occupations as well as how well they emulate the occupational evaluations of human evaluators. We present a systematic comparison of GPT-4 occupational evaluations with those from an in-depth, high-quality survey in the UK context. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 and human scores are highly correlated across all ISCO-08 major groups for prestige and social value. At the same time, GPT-4 substantially under- or overestimates the occupational prestige and social value of many occupations, particularly emerging occupations as well as stigmatized or contextual ones. In absolute terms, GPT-4 scores are more generous than those of the human respondents. Our analyses show both the potentials and risks of using LLM-generated data for occupational research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Snapchat has long been a pivotal space for youth digital intimate and sexual cultures, as well as gendered and sexual risks and harms. Despite being one of the most widely used social media platforms among youth in England and America, there has been little in-depth research that connects Snapchat’s unique features and affordances with an analysis of young users’ practices, behaviours, and experiences on the platform. Responding to this gap, our paper explores our mixed-methods research findings on British young people’s diverse social, sexual, and intimate experiences on Snapchat. We explore how Snapchat’s unique features, such as disappearing images (“Snaps”), algorithmic friend recommendations (“Quick Adds”), and user engagement metric (\"Snapscores”), form new conditions and environments for young people’s experiences of digital courtship, sexting, and sexual and gender-based violence. In addition, we contextualise youth user experiences with Snapchat’s community guidelines, safeguards, and protections for youth, which we argue fail to understand or address the actual lived experiences of youth users. We conclude with recommendations for interventions dedicated to increasing platform-specific digital literacy (particularly for parents, policymakers, and educators), and preventing and responding to youth experiences of online gendered risks and harm—while upholding their digital and sexual rights.</jats:p>",

    "title": "MEASURING MISOGYNY: DEPP V HEARD AND THE LIMITS OF ATOMISTIC CONTENT MODERATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past decade, social media companies have come under increasing pressure to make their platforms safer for women. While they have made some changes to their policies and design, their foundational approach to content moderation has remained largely the same. Platforms continue to focus on identifying, assessing and responding to individual pieces of violating content, like overt hate speech, direct threats, and doxxing. This approach is ill-equipped to deal with structural harms like misogyny, which cannot be understood in terms of isolated instances, but instead as part of a continuum. ‘Everyday’ experiences of sexism and misogyny form part of the same dynamic as the more widely recognised, extreme forms of violence, but existing tools for identifying this type of harmful but not prohibited content are extremely limited.\n\nThis paper presents the preliminary findings of a study that investigates how everyday misogyny manifests on social media platforms, using the online discourse around the $2 trial as a case study. We use a combination of topic modelling and in-depth qualitative analysis of content, informed by the literature on believability and doubt in cases of domestic and sexual violence. We find that everyday misogyny is widespread, and manifests partly in double-standards and double-binds in the expectations imposed on Amber Heard. We aim to use these findings to develop new methods and frameworks for understanding misogyny in aggregate.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies that collect personal data have spent billions of dollars complying with a patchwork of global data privacy laws since 2018. In response, a nascent privacy tech industry has emerged, consisting of tech startups, consultants, investors, platforms, and domain experts that collectively help companies build compliant data governance programs. This study recognizes the key role of translating the law into software products by asking: how is expertise defined and encoded in the privacy tech industry? I draw on fieldwork from a broader ethnographic study of the privacy tech industry to identify three findings. First, the privacy tech industry constitutes a networked arena of relations structured by partitioning professional expertise across technical, legal, and operational domains. Second, technical expertise in the privacy tech industry is often tenuous and contingent, which could be strengthened by applying scrutiny and deliberation to evaluate the content of expertise rather than its performance. Third, boundaries of expertise are increasingly encoded in compliance software, perpetuating performative rather than scrutinized expertise. At scale, these products promote managerial processes that manifest as checkbox compliance, codifying splintered accountability and undermining the spirit of data privacy law. I argue that technology policy would benefit from scrutinizing the contents of expertise, inviting agonistic deliberation, and including lay expertise to counter the technocratic structural relations of a surveillance economy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The humanitarian sector is known for its reliance on technological pilots as part of the digitisation and datafication of aid operations. Drawing on ten years of research in the aid sector, this paper outlines a new type of technological experimentation which I term surreptitious experimentation. This type of experimentation is possible as digital technologies and practices become enmeshed with the infrastructures of aid. This process of infrastructuring allows for a continuous flow of experimentation, which is not named as such, and which operates in the infrastructural background, and therefore remains hidden – yet in plain sight. Surreptitious experiments take place outside the laboratory, without clear boundaries, meaningful consent or processes of accountability. In so doing, surreptitious experiments compound the power asymmetries of humanitarianism with significant risks and harms for some of the world’s most vulnerable people.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to investigate the increasingly prominent phenomenon of queerbaiting in Chinese social media, which is to bait and lure the queer audience in for an existing media text, through queer representations including erotica. With the development of streaming media and its innovative application in e-commerce especially during the COVID-19, social media platforms such as Douyin have become a rich site for economic and cultural analyses. This project is significant that since the Chinese government and platforms regulate queer content in a seemingly strict way, for example, those who express ‘abnormal’ sexual orientation will be banned. However, queerbaiting as a genre of media production still finds its way through short videos and gets away with tightened regulatory regimes. At the same time, Douyin’s huge monetization potential with e-commerce in various formats (e-gift-giving, sponsorship, advertorials) makes queerbaiting as a marketing strategy an indispensable part of Chinese social media that attracts scholarly and market attention. Furthermore, most queer content creators would self-present on the Douyin as straight especially when they engage with queerbaiting strategies, making both their media production sustainable in a tight regulatory regime and data accessible for my research. The study emphasizes a departure from fan-centred queerbaiting research and instead examines from the producer's perspective, dissecting the actions and goals of influencers to attract followers, monetize and profit by manipulating audience interpretations and queer imaginations as their strategies, at the same time, to navigate and protect themselves from homophobic regulatory and social environments.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contributes to the critical study of platformisation and deplatformisation of software development and how networked infrastructures commodify, configure and challenge relations between code, coders, communities, technologies, investors and industries. It explores the political economic and cultural dimensions of the platformisation of software development in the news industry with a case study on Github. It then examines how resistance to platformisation and counter-mobilisations in the context of free software, art and activism surface alternative arrangements for socialising software development imbued with other logics.\n\nThe paper proposes the concept of “connective coding” to characterise GitHub’s dominant modes of configuration and capitalisation of public repositories and profiles and the power relations that underpin it, whereby public software and project development work becomes assets in the platform economy that have the potential to be variously capitalised by the platform and its associated third-party ecosystem. This institutional perspective is complemented by an analysis of newsroom industry practices mediated by the platform and how GitHub modulates visibility in this space.\n\nThe second part of the paper reflects on efforts to deplatformise software development by examining various responses and counter-mobilisations partly prompted by Microsoft’s controversial purchase of Github. It reviews the development of alternative coding spaces such as Gogs, Gitea, Radicle and Forgejo, and the values, practices, concerns and communities associated with them. In doing so it contributes to conference themes pertaining to political economy, labour and resistance in digital industries.</jats:p>",

    "title": "GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON PLATFORMS AND CULTURAL PRODUCTION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>While digital platforms have reconfigured the institutions and practices of cultural production around the globe, current research is dominated by studies that take as their reference point the Anglo-American world--and, to a lesser extent--China (Cunningham &amp; Craig 2019; Kaye et al. 2021; Poell et al. 2021; Zhao 2019). Aside from totalizing theories of platform imperialism (Jin, 2013), the “rest of the world” has thus received relatively scant attention. Consequently, central concepts in the study of platform-based cultural production bear a strong imprint of Western institutions, infrastructures, industries, discourses, and cultural practices. US-based research, in particular, has informed how we understand and subsequently theorize notions of precarity, labor, governance, authenticity, gender, creativity, diversity, and autonomy in a platform environment. We can’t simply apply these concepts to local cultures of production in other parts of the world. There is bound to be friction, as this panel will demonstrate, between how labor, precarity, and governance are understood in the Anglo-American world and the lived experiences of platform-dependent cultural labor in Latin America, Southern and Eastern Europe, and East Asia.\n\nConcerns about Western-dominated research and theory are, of course, by no means novel. Post-colonial and decolonial theorists have long criticized the dominance and universalism of Western theory, pointing to the continuation of colonial knowledge-power relations (Chakrabarty 2009; Chen 2010; Escobar 2018; Mignolo 2012). Moreover, there have been numerous calls to decolonize (Glück 2018; Willems &amp; Mano 2016) and de-westernize (Curran &amp; Park 2000; Khiabany 2003) media studies and, more recently, production and platform studies (Bouquillion 2023; Bulut 2022; Zhang &amp; Chen 2022). That being said, in practice, the US and Western Europe continue to function as the primary and often sole frame of reference in research on platforms and cultural production. In the light of these concerns, this panel aims to contribute to efforts to: 1) challenge universalism, 2) “provincialize” the US, and 3) multiply our frames of reference in the study of platforms and cultural production. Such a conceptual undertaking is especially vital as the cultural industries are at the heart of societal processes of meaning making (Hesmondhalgh 2018) and market activity.\n\nLet us unpack how the papers in this panel pursue this objective. The first paper develops a conceptual framework to expand our frames of reference for studying platforms and cultural production. Departing from epistemological universalism, it argues that “platforms”, “cultural production”, and the “local” need to be studied as dynamic configurations, characterized by crucial variations and correspondences across the globe. That is, in contemporary instances of creating cultural content, transnational platform markets, infrastructures, governance frameworks, and cultural practices become entangled with local political economies and cultural practices.\n\nExamining how such configurations take shape around the world, the next four papers in this panel focus on specific regions and modes of production, interrogating how local and transnational political economic relations and practices articulate each other. In this discussion, we pay specific attention to the notions of precarity, governance, and imaginaries.\n\nThe second paper reframes influencer precarity in a semi-peripheral context in the Balkans and emphasizes the relational basis of influencer agency, as influencers rely on family members and oft-mocked “Instagram husbands” to alleviate precarity. It thus offers insights into the local characteristics of algorithmic encounters with platforms by proposing the concept of platform lethargy. This concept speaks to an emotional response and deliberate refusal on the part of influencers to adapt to platform mandates. This refusal is rooted in algorithmic knowledge from the semi-periphery, where creators are cognizant of their position in a devalued platform market.\n\nThe third paper critically examines the intricate dynamics of creator culture, challenging the assumption of globally detached markets. Focusing on Latin American content creators in the United States, it explores how their aspirations intersect with the construction of the \"Latin American\" content creator dream. The study also scrutinizes the role of Content Service Organizations (CSOs) executives in shaping creator culture. Despite global portrayals, tensions emerge, revealing national market characteristics rooted in socio-cultural, linguistic, and regional norms.\n\nThe fourth paper examines how drama creatives, who work for streaming platforms, are globally connected and yet remain nationally restrained in terms of how they imagine work. Through the notion of platform ambiguity, the paper shows how streaming platforms negotiate with cultural producers by both enabling and restraining their work. Thus, it thus de-westernizes scholarship on platforms and cultural production by highlighting how drama makers are not only creative but also geopolitical subjects dependent on the state.\n\nThe last paper offers an alternative epistemological and ontological perspective on the state-platform-user configuration, where each actor works in alignment with others under the logic of governance. It uses a Chinese social media platform, Douyin, as a case to reveal how platforms rely on anthropomorphization to communicate with cultural producers and develop playful governance of China’s political and cultural environment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates messaging by smaller businesses in the hair and beauty industries in South Africa who use targeted ads to promote products and services to Facebook and Instagram users in South Africa. These ads are currently not considered “political” ads, despite the fact that racialised notions of hair and beauty have played and continue to play a key role in white supremacist discourses in South Africa. Using the Facebook Ad Library, we obtained a purposive sample of ads posted to Meta platforms over a six month period (N=558) by 99 different advertisers whose ads matched the query “hair”. We review image-based adverts in this sample, asking how visual signifiers of gender and ethnicity address potential consumers and represent their hair. Multimodal content analysis was used with the aim of identifying current micro-targeting practices on the platforms. Our analysis of the messaging about hair in the ads found hegemonic racial ideologies and binary gendering in campaigns addressing ethnically differentiated audiences of women in SA. The relative absence of men from the messaging suggested that the burdens and pleasures of hair care and maintenance remain distinctly feminised while the hair industry is actively involved in production of gender. WoC were targeted with messaging which, at best, promoted a new aesthetic or promised to save money or time. At worst, it was promoting harmful products and perpetuating racialised discourses. Built on dataveillance, such micro-targeting may be fuelling feedback loops that further entrench the country’s extreme racialised inequality.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Industrial time and space produce marginalities and resistance: Queer time rejects linearity and potentiates alternate experiences (Halbertsam, 2005). Today, many experience phones or smartwatches as mediating temporal ruptures in daily lives (Mowlabocus, 2016), and hookup app industries monetise intimacies. Given permanent online connectivity, work and leisure are more porous than in a factory, yet corporate industries mediate marginal socialities. Industrious rural queers wrestle control of spatiotemporal intimacies from totalising platforms.\n\nThis study maps rural sexuality and hook-up app (dis)comfort and visualises whether hook-up contacts penetrate social networks. Seven semi-structured interviews took place in Finland. Three themes were determined: (in)visibility due to (fears of) marginalisation; categories and borders of app design inadequately reflecting indigenous/gendered, (neuro)queer, rural, linguistic, infrastructural and economic realities; and resisting spatiotemporal app logics.\n\nHistory has shown the rise of industry as precariously subject to queer temporal forces lacking predictable directions, ultimately declining. Nonetheless, emergent digital industries, such as queer hookup apps, re-attempt to totalise expression via universal logic. They inadequately account for the cultural, linguistic, neurodiverse, gender diverse, disabled, indigenous and local contexts of queer lives beyond major cities, just as clock-time undermined working labourers while empowering colonial interests. We hope to demonstrate the ingenuity of users in questioning and queering social norms, with the hope of building improved digital queer social worlds that do not fetishise queer bodies as visible yet unreacable products for capitalist consumption but rather facilitate spatiotemporal possibilities that fulfil rural, queer, digital, and social needs.</jats:p>",

Automoderator is an automated anti-vandalism tool, which uses a language-agnostic ML model that predicts the probability of an edit being reverted. The product team integrated volunteer feedback and direction on a continuous basis. This included the use of existing community-created tools to guide Automoderator's direction, the creation and dissemination of a spreadsheet-based testing tool, soliciting user feedback on a central project page, and integrating an extension to allow communities to control Automoderator's behavior directly. We conclude by discussing the limitations and trade-offs of this approach to product development.</jats:p>",

    "title": "ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE BY DIGITAL PLATFORMS: HOW TWITCH CHANGED ITS PLATFORM OVER TIME",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since its launch in 2011, the live streaming platform Twitch has continually expanded its mechanisms for monetizing interactions between content creators and their viewers. While numerous studies document the motivation of viewers (Sjöblom, et. al. 2017; Wulf, et. al. 2020), experiences of live streamers (Taylor, 2018; Sjöblom, et. al., 2019; Woodcock &amp; Johnson, 2019), and platform policy (Partin, 2020; Poell, et. al., 2022), an explanatory framework and a clear timeline of functional changes on Twitch is still missing. Tracking Twitch changes can shed light on what motivates them, and what is likely to influence the platform going forward.\n\nThe literature on Twitch platform policy focuses mainly on how the platform mimics features that were first introduced by users, a process Partin (2020) called “envelopment”. However, we argue that there are two important parallel mechanisms that motivate change. First, via competition, Twitch copies features from other platforms. Second, via realignment, Twitch meets user demands for changes on the platform. This process of strategic cooptation of features via envelopment, competition, and realignment, is what we call adaptive governance. It is this holistic approach of adaptive governance that remains a blind spot in the literature and which this article aims to give a first description of.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The world today is awash with narratives of artificial intelligence (AI) as an \"inevitable,\" \"unstoppable\" force destined to \"revolutionize\" society. Using the concept of \"entanglement\" from Black and Indigenous feminist science, technology, and society studies, we provide a critical examination of the AI industry's complex intersections with sociopolitical dynamics, technological determinism, and oppression. Instead of viewing AI advancement as a predetermined path, we show how this perspective is socially constructed and has dire consequences for the environment and society alike, especially for marginalized communities in the global and local Souths.\n\nUsing discourse analysis and critical quantitative techniques, we analyze the discourses surrounding AI, examining over 1,200 pieces of digital content to show how language shapes both technology's development and our collective imaginations. By tracing the ideological roots of AI back to colonial and eugenic practices, we demonstrate the industry's deep entanglement with interlocking systems of oppressions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Content moderation comes with trade-offs and moral dilemmas, particularly for transnational platforms governing borderline content where the boundaries of acceptability are subject to debate. While extensive research has explored the legality and legitimacy of $2 in democratic contexts, few address the complexities of less-than-democratic developing nations. Through socio-legal analysis and controversy mapping of TikTok’s localised moderation in South and Southeast Asia, the study examines how major actors negotiate the shifting boundaries of online speech. The analysis reveals that neither the platform nor regional states effectively govern borderline content. Primarily, TikTok localises its moderation based on pragmatic necessity rather than moral obligations, intentionally sidestepping contentious political controversies. Governments demonstrate strong will to control online discourse, leveraging legal uncertainty to advance political interests. Local content governance thus always relies on vague rationales around securitisation and morality. The contradictory goals of (de)politicising borderline moderation seemingly counterbalance each other, yet in practice lead to an accountability vacuum without legitimate interests. Given the lack of normative common ground, the study highlights the significance of procedural justice and civic participation to mitigate rhetoric that rationalises imposition of speech norms hinging on imbalanced political power.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Using radio and podcast studies as its main scholarship areas, this paper will examine the potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to change podcasting both in how it is crafted and in how audiences consume podcasts. Focusing on the idea of intimacy this paper interrogates how this defining characteristic of “sound-based digital media” (Hilmes, 2013:44) may persist and evolve, particularly through conceptualizations of space and place, imagined and actual. In a landscape where podcasting is increasingly perceived by (mostly younger) audiences and creators to be a visual medium (Berry, 2023), I want to explore how intimacy may continue to be a defining characteristic of podcasting. In particular, and going well beyond just the aural or indeed beyond the combination of the visual and the aural, I want to understand what intimacy can mean when podcasting moves into the virtual reality immersive space.\n\nThis paper’s case study is the video version of episode 398 of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which is an interview with Facebook and Meta’s co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, titled 'First Interview in the Metaverse'. In the podcast, the two meet in the metaverse to discuss the new possibilities that this technology, in combination with AI, may open in the ways that humans communicate with each other through the internet. Looking at themes such as disembodiment, imagination and materiality, this paper examines what VR and AI technologies can mean for podcasting and the way audiences and podcasters may communicate and create meaning through them.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the 1980s, Chinese cities have been built based on the image of a mechanized city. Maçães perceives them as a product “in the age of mechanical reproduction”, repressing \"genuine spontaneity; the stirrings and desires of life”. However, with the increasing integration of digital and intelligent technologies in Chinese cities, smart cities with a new image are rising. They are imagined as organic entities, a human brain, namely \"City Bain\". The City Brain is anticipated to sense what happening in the city in real time and make overall decisions. More importantly, the organic smart city is expected to dedicate to serving the people.\n\nThese two contrasting images represent a shift in Chinese visions of intelligent technologies' role in society. In contrast to mechanic cities, the organic entities concerns more about citizens' role in an intelligent environment and how this intelligent environment reconfigures the governance mode. Then the questions are: What does this organic metaphor mean, why it has emerged, why it is so important that local government even made a regulation centering this metaphor?\n\nThrough the combination of the fieldwork and discourse analysis, this work studies the genealogy of the discursive developments of Chinese smart city metaphors. AS a result, this study identifies the hidden historical undertakings and societal strivings behind current metaphor of organic entity. This work also casts a light to the shift from mechanization to intelligentization in China, by analyzing and outlining the features of the intelligent transformation in China.</jats:p>",

Prior to this, toggle was a noun that referred to fasteners on garments and on walls that held things in place. This evolution from a noun to a verb, helps attend to the fact that as people, we have always used our hands, heads, and objects to hold things together, as we switch between doing and being.\n\nTo theorize toggling, I will first detail my motivation, methods, and methodology. Then I will illustrate how toggling as a concept, enables reframing two dominant views on (1) how information is imagined to push users to do things and (2) how being a user, especially a consumer, is imagined to move us “out of touch.”\n\nToggling as a conceptual vessel places UI in this history of how our hands and fingers have interacted with surfaces of objects like buttons and made sense of the world. Placing interaction in our hands makes room for us as scholars to ask: how do people make sense of information and hold everything together as they switch between doing livelihood-care and being workers, consumers, business owners, householders and so on?</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Media users increasingly express ambivalence about their own media consumption, often related to ubiquitous media technology such as the smartphone and social media. In order to understand the growing trend of disconnection as a cultural and social phenomenon, we conducted an analysis of the digital detox inspired camp for grownups, Underleir, which has been arranged in Norway annually since 2014. The main empirical material stems from a field study of the camp Underleir in 2019 where we conducted participatory observation on a four-day field trip. Online material about the camp from the inception in 2014 to the sixth installment in 2019 was also included. The framework for this analysis is media domestication theory with special attention to the concept reverse domestication. In contrast to the domestication process where new media technology is \"tamed\", reverse domestication implies cognitive processes and practical strategies involved when distancing from media technology. Underleir illustrates how practical, social, and normative aspects may be interwoven when media use is reversed or altered. Normatively speaking, the digital detox experience was tied to broader sets of values, including an aim for a more creative, authentic life and a quest for mental wellbeing and the ability to focus. Many participants stated that the opportunity to engage in creative activities, and to be social in a friendly setting, was just as important as the absence of media.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, this panel brings together scholars from global north and south countries that will map the complexities and subjectivities of platform workers in order to tame platform capitalism. We present a set of articles that address: (1) regulatory resistance that clarifies and redefines the rules that platforms need to abide by; (2) bottom-up resistance of platform workers who seek to organize, subvert, and build alternatives; (3) the ways that action research can support either of those initiatives to ultimately tame some of the worst excesses of platform capitalism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On January 7, 2022 Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC, went on Good Morning America to discuss the state of Omicron. While explaining that more than 75% of those who died after receiving the full series of Covid-19 vaccines were people who had at least “four comorbidities” Walensky concluded, “So really, these are people who were unwell to begin with. And yes; really encouraging news in the context of Omicron” (Dodge 2022). This statement inspired the viral hashtag #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy, started by Imani Barbarin. The goal of the hashtag, like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter before it, was to push back against the rhetoric that it is ok if chronically-ill and disabled people are dying or discriminated against. The hashtag raises awareness toward the high prevalence of chronic illness and disability in the United States while also critiquing discourse which dismisses these lives as expendable. While abled people were quick to argue that this was not Walensky’s intention, the hashtag brings to light how an inattention to disabled life perpetuates a system of harm. In this presentation, I analyze how the hashtag was strategically utilized by chronically ill and disabled people to push back on rhetoric which implies their lives are acceptable losses in a pandemic. This moves beyond the common declaration of the disabled community, “nothing about us without us,” to a new demand of “nothing without us.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The recent minimalist lifestyle is often claimed to be a way to\n        change your life by minimizing your spending, possessions, tasks, relationships, etc.\n        YouTube is an important venue where minimalist content is published and shared (Meissner,\n        2019). The current study focuses on “minimalist journey\" narratives, where people tell their\n        stories of \"encountering\" the minimalist lifestyle. I collected “minimalist journey\" stories\n        from 40 YouTube videos with their comments and analyzed them using narrative analysis\n        methods, both thematic and structural (Labov &amp; Waletzky, 1997; Riessman, 2005). By\n        closely examining these narratives, this study sheds light on how people experience and make\n        sense of the minimalist lifestyle within the context of anti-consumerism and neoliberalism\n        in digital space. This study also contributes to digital culture studies by showcasing how\n        personal life narratives are constructed on video-sharing platforms like YouTube. Two themes\n        emerged in the analysis. In the “Hoarder to Minimalist” narrative, narrators were once\n        over-consuming hoarders and now minimalists. Minimalism facilitates discursive rejections\n        and behavior disruptions of consumerism. The \"transformational\" stories, however,\n        reinforcing the neoliberal sense of self that needs constant improvement. In the “Always\n        been a Minimalist” narrative, narrators have always been frugal due to underprivileged\n        social status. Minimalism empowers them by providing a set of vocabulary for recreating\n        meanings. It, however, downplays the class divisions in capitalist society as merely an\n        issue of “framing”; the struggles of lower social class people just need to be beautified as\n        “minimalism.”</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2019, TikTok captivated international attention as a breakout short-video platform. A key affordance for user-generated content creators on TikTok is how easy the platform makes reproducing popular videos. The video creation interface allows users to make new videos based on the one they were just watching with just one tap. While these features make it fun and easy for users to replicate popular videos, it can also obscure the identity of the creators who created the ‘original’ content being reused. In this way, TikTok engenders a culture of misattribution. Users can freely reuse popular formats, audio clips, or even licensed music without any connection to the original source with impunity. Using a combination of an app walkthrough, a bespoke data scraping tool, content analysis, and a series of qualitative case studies, this study explores the contradictory logic of authorship and how (mis)attribution is shaping cultural production and platform practices on TikTok.</jats:p>",

    "title": "CONSTRUCTING CONTEMPORARY PARENTHOOD IN DIGITAL SPACES: A WALKTHROUGH OF        INFANT FEEDING APPLICATIONS",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Infant feeding and baby tracking apps remain extremely popular mobile applications, downloaded by millions of parents to facilitate the feeding and care of children in their first year of life. These applications are commonly considered as part of a wider ecology of apps to manage reproductive health, which are typically gendered in design. Unsurprisingly, research on infant feeding apps to date has focussed on analysing these applications through a critical feminist lens, problematising the surveillance and disciplining of women’s bodies, since the tracking of infant care tracks the caregiver as much as the baby. These issues relate to broader societal trends around the datafication of family life, as well as participatory and co-surveillance practices, which ultimately support data-dependent surveillance capitalism. Yet, the predominant focus on critical perspectives on these technologies tends to construct their uses as disempowering, and their users as lacking agency. This work-in-progress paper explores how contemporary parenthood is constructed and mediated through the functionalities and technological design of infant feeding apps. It employs a feminist lens, while striking a balance between critical analysis and the identification of opportunities for user resistance, agency and empowerment. The app walkthrough method was used to examine two infant feeding applications, the commercial Feed Baby and the public health-oriented mum2mum. The study’s findings indicate that infant feeding applications are diverse in design and functionalities, providing opportunities for resistance and empowerment, that complicate and challenge understandings of parenting apps as (dis)empowering technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The smartphone has become a crucial devise in everyday life, providing access to a range of communication, entertainment and utility tools. This has led to concern about intrusive media and worries that tech companies take advantage of our \"easily distracted mind\". This has also incited a booming app industry where digital detox and productivity apps are offered as tools to restrain smartphone use. The aim of this study is to add new empirical data and a conceptual framework to shed new light on this issue. The analysis is based on descriptions of 70 digital detox and productivity apps retried from the App Store and Google Play. The analysis focus on affordances, and distinguishes between two broad categories: undesign affordances, which comprise affordances that punish or inhibit certain types of use and gamification affordances which, in general, reward the user or encourage certain user behavior. The product description is also subject to a discourse analysis. A general finding is gamification affordances such as rewards, achievements, and ratings are generously used in most apps regardless of what kind of context it is meant to be used. More relentless undesign affordances, such as complete blocking of the smartphone is uses to a much lesser degree. The frequent use of gamification design means that the apps can, paradoxically, direct more attention toward the smartphone.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On January 18, Microsoft revealed its $68.7 billion deal to acquire videogame publisher Activision Blizzard. The acquisition was pitched as an investment towards “metaverse platforms” that gaming would play a key role in developing. Journalists speculated about the increasing consolidation of the videogame industry and whether blockbuster franchises would be locked into Microsoft’s platforms and subscription services. Commentary on the metaverse weighed in on how toxicity and harassment in game industry workplaces such as Activision Blizzard might relate to issues of trust and safety in virtual worlds such as Meta’s Horizon Worlds. Seemingly above the fray of platform strategy, market speculation, and corporate scandal, New Yorker writer Kyle Chayka (2022) tweeted as a matter of fact: “video game infrastructure and tools are increasingly going to take over all digital platforms”. This panel contextualizes discussions about the business and aesthetics of 3D platforms in the infrastructural work of game engines, which routinely integrate databases, file formats, web protocols, and translational algorithms. We trace public debates and corporate statements over representation and governance, equity and inclusion (Bosworth 2021) to the techniques, technologies, and practices that enable massive real-time 3D digital spaces to flow and transact. We also highlight the growing intertwinement between game engine development companies and related content ecosystems, such as the Epic Games Store and the Unreal Engine, and Epic’s and Unity’s Asset Stores. This panel investigates how digital systems are designed to regulate technical interoperability and its implications for creative practice and cultural production. Together, these papers map how power and capital become centralized and distributed throughout the back end of the metaverse, and politicize how social practices and subjectivities are negotiated through technological architecture.</jats:p>",

    "title": "NOT YOUR ROBIN HOOD: GAMESTOP AND PLATFORM ECONOMICS AT PLAY",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In January 2021, GameStop and AMC, stocks with no discernable reason\n        for an increase in value, rose abruptly in price. This was soon understood as the result of\n        manipulation by members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. While individualized stock\n        trading is often framed as equalizing the playing field, everyday people remain second-class\n        participants in the stock market, which quickly became clear as trading was suspended on\n        stocks the Redditors targeted. Backlash against this decision played out across platforms.\n        We argue that this incident is the inevitable result of treating platforms (and economics)\n        through the lens of gaming and trolling. The first key issue in the r/WallStreetBets\n        incident was content moderation, as the Robinhood trading app stopped the trading, the\n        subreddit the traders used to organize went private, and the corresponding Discord server\n        was banned. The second important factor in this incident was coordinated inauthentic action,\n        as thwarted traders immediately turned to the app store and targeted Robinhood with a review\n        bombing campaign. Third, while the popular response to the r/WallStreetBets saga was\n        frequently celebratory, seeing their actions as a challenge to capitalism and evidence of\n        progressive politics, longstanding tropes associating Jewish people with capital, meant that\n        Redditors’ anti-capitalism slid easily into anti-Semitism. Ultimately, many of the patterns\n        of the Reddit stock incident locate it in a long history of coordinated internet action\n        steeped in toxic technocultures. However, the expansion of these practices into taking\n        direct action on economic systems worth billions of dollars is new and calls for rigorous\n        attention</jats:p>",

    "title": "THE AFTERLIVES OF MEMORIAL MATERIALS: DATA, HOAX, BOT",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of death online has often intersected with questions of trust, though such questions have evolved over time to not only include relations of trust between individuals and within online communities, but also issues of trust emerging through entanglements and interactions with the afterlives of memorial materials. Papers in this panel attend to the growing significance of the afterlives of digital data, the circulation of fake deaths, the care attached to memorial bots, and the intersection of robots and funerals.&#x0D;\nOver the last twenty years the study of death online developed into a diverse field of enquiry. Early literature addressed the emergence of webpages created as online memorials and focused on their function to commemorate individuals by extending memorial artefacts from physical to digital spaces for the bereaved to gather (De Vries and Rutherford, 2004; Roberts, 2004; Roberts and Vidal, 2000; Veale, 2004). The emergence of platforms for social networking in the mid-2000s broadened the scope of research to include increasingly knotted questions around the ethics, politics and economics of death online. Scholars began investigating issues like the performance of public mourning, our obligations to and management of the digital remains of the deceased, the affordances of platforms for sharing or trolling the dead, the extraction of value from the data of the deceased, and the ontology of entities that digitally persist (e.g. Brubaker and Callison-Burch, 2016; Gibbs et al., 2015; Karppi, 2013; Marwick and Ellison, 2012; Phillips, 2011; Stokes, 2012).&#x0D;\nScaffolding this scholarship are a number of research networks, including the Death Online Research Network and the DeathTech Research Network, who encourage international collaboration and conversation around the study of death and digital media, including supporting this AoIR panel.&#x0D;\nThis panel contributes to the growing field of research on death and digital media, and in particular poses challenges to focus on the commemoration of humans to encompass broader issues around the data and materiality of digital death. Digital residues of the deceased persist within and circulate through online spaces, enrolling users into new configurations of posthumous dependence on platforms, whilst at the same time digital afterlives now intersect with new technologies to create emergent forms of agency such as chatbots and robots that extend beyond the human, demanding to be considered within the sphere of digital memorialisation. Questions of trust emerge in this panel through various kinds of relationality formed with and through digital remains. These extend from relations of trust in the digital legacies now archived within platform architectures and how we might curate conversations differently around our personal data; to the breaking of trust in the internet when creating or sharing a hoax death; to the trust involved in making and caring for a posthumous bot; to the trust granted to robots to perform funerary rites.&#x0D;\nIt is anticipated that this panel will not only appeal to scholars interested in the area of death and digital media, but also engage with broader scholarly communities in which questions of death now arise in larger debates around data, materiality, and governance on and of the internet.&#x0D;\nReferences&#x0D;\nBrubaker, J.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>As a platform, Reddit provides a bit of a conundrum. Despite being visited by more people than Netflix and remaining one of the most visited spaces on the web, it remains extraordinarily resistant to generalization. Some of the worst of Internet culture can be found on the site. It has served to amplify the voices of misogynists, supported vigilantism, and hosted child pornography. At the same time, some of the more civil conversations and learning communities appear on the site, with subreddits like Change My View fostering respectful deliberation. Even more than many other platforms, the lack of centralized moderation means that Reddit contains a very wide range of practices, some of them quite extreme. But because these exist on a single platform, users bring these practices with them, both to the “front page” of the platform, and to other areas within. The three papers that make up this panel seek to better understand localized behaviors and how they may relate to global flows of participants and practices. Of course, many of the discursive patterns that were fostered in subreddits make their way into other online and offline contexts. But before they do that, they have often been produced as part of a culture local to one subreddit, or to a “neighborhood” of subreddits. How these practices emerge, evolve, and relate to the actions of their users runs as a thread through the three presentations.</jats:p>",

    "title": "DATA INQUIRY: METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON DATAFICATION IN SOCIAL\n        RESEARCH",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Datafication is widely acknowledged as a process “transforming all\n        things under the sun into a data format” (van Dijck, 2017, p. 11). As data become both\n        objects and instruments of social science, many scholars call for attention to the ways\n        datafication reconfigures scholarly knowledge production, its methodological opportunities,\n        and challenges (Lomborg et al., 2020). This contribution offers a reflection on the\n        interdependence between methodological approaches taken to study datafication and concepts\n        about it, that these approaches provide within the domains of critical data studies and\n        media studies. Expanding on the concept of methods' performativity (Barad, 2007), I apply\n        the notion of methods assemblages: “a continuing process of crafting and enacting necessary\n        boundaries [and relations]\" between researchers and all relevant matters (Law, 2004: 144).\n        The key question in the presented study is what kinds of methods assemblages are being\n        applied in current datafication research and what concepts of datafication they produce. 32\n        expert interviews were conducted with scholars who published empirical work on dataficaiton\n        between 2015 and 2020. Three methods assemblages were developed. Central to distinguishing\n        between methods assemblages are the ways of associating of the involved actors and things.\n        In my analysis the questions of (1) what we are talking about when talking about\n        datafication and (2) kinds of knowledges that researchers were interested in producing can\n        be understood as such ways of associating. The methods assemblages contribute to critical\n        data studies by producing accounts about datafication processes that are in concert with the\n        methods assemblages applied to study these.</jats:p>",

    "title": "INCELS ON REDDIT: A STUDY IN SOCIAL NORMS AND DECENTRALISED        MODERATION",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The social news website Reddit has a long history of hosting communities (‘subreddits’) that advocate or encourage white supremacy (Gillespie 2018), disparagement of minority groups (Topinka 2017), and violence against women (Massanari 2017). As a platform that relies heavily on volunteer moderators to self-govern the subreddits (Matias 2016), Reddit has been criticised for failing to adequately enforce its site-wide rules (Gillespie 2018). Incels—an internet subculture that ascribes to deeply misogynistic beliefs—grew in visibility when they developed subreddits on Reddit. After ongoing criticism and media attention about harmful behaviour of incels both on and off the platform, Reddit imposed escalating sanctions and ultimately banned the most visible of these subreddits over a period of several years. In this paper, we focus on the interaction between formal rules and social norms in incel and related subreddits. This paper aims to improve understanding about how problematic norms are contested in (partially-) decentralised systems of content moderation. We examine discourse about moderation to better understand the role of moderation teams in maintaining and changing social norms in their communities and to examine the interaction between these norms and both sitewide and subreddit-specific rules. Our analysis suggests that the threat of prohibition alone is unlikely to be sufficient to drive cultural change in problematic subreddits. We argue that content moderation is an insufficient frame to understand the regulation of harmful communities; real change requires addressing the underlying cultural norms rather than focusing on individual pieces of content.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Conventionally, the African continent is largely written out of accounts on technology. If discussed, technology is often framed as the result of outside influences or the product of technology transfer from the West but rarely are Africans taken seriously as makers or active users of technology (Mavhunga, 2014, 2017). Recent work on race and technology has been useful in highlighting the contribution of Black people to the development of digital technology (McIlwain, 2020) and the creative deployment of technology (Brock, 2020) but has not always engaged extensively with longer histories of racialization and transnational dimensions of Blackness.&#x0D;\nOngoing debates on platform imperialism (Jin, 2013) and data colonialism (Couldry and Mejias, 2019) have been important in demonstrating the disproportionate levels of power that global social media platforms continue to wield and the lingering importance of technology in extractive practices. However, these political economy approaches have insufficiently acknowledged spaces for agency nor have they examined the way in which the state impinges on the everyday lives of citizens.&#x0D;\nThe four papers in this panel deploy the notion of independence to make sense of the way in which Africans have created, used and imagined digital technology. They treat digital technology as potential tools for liberation as well as constitutive of spaces that enable reflection on what it means to be independent. The panel regards the freedoms occasionally made possible by digital technology as always subject to the constraints imposed by powerful actors such as the (post)colonial state and corporate social media platforms.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines TikTok as an emerging activist space for Gen Z.\n        It uses the ‘fox eye’ trend as a case study to illustrate how TikTok allows young people –\n        Asian diasporic communities in particular – to create audiovisual narratives of personal\n        experiences and stories to speak up against anti-Asian racism. Through a qualitative content\n        analysis of 30 relevant TikTok posts, the paper argues for the platform’s distinct\n        audiovisual features in enhancing users’ capacity for civic engagement. This paper generates\n        three related findings. First, young Asian users have created TikTok videos featuring a\n        variety of themes in relation to the fox eye trend. Some notable examples include historical\n        popular representation of Asians, personal experiences of racism, impossible beauty\n        standards, jokingly advocating for countertrends, among others. Collectively, these videos\n        aim to emphasize the ‘problems’ associated with the trend – that is, it is racially\n        insensitive and builds on cultural appropriation. The second finding suggests three main\n        types of narratives constructed through the videos – historical, educational and affective.\n        Each type is characterized by distinct narrative structures and strategies. Finally, the\n        audiovisual functions of the platform in creating and amplifying the narratives. That is,\n        the narratives on TikTok are powerful not only because of the rhetorical devices used, but\n        also due to their audiovisual elements such as visual filters, audio memes, image and video\n        compilations and non-verbal performance. Through these discussions of findings, we propose\n        and explain the concept of ‘audiovisual narrative agency’ as an emerging lens to understand\n        contemporary digital activism.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Turkey has a notoriously restricted Twittersphere where any explicit criticism towards the government can be framed as a criminal offence (Saka, 2018). However, despite the efforts to eradicate public expression of dissent on social media, Twitter remains as an essential space for political deliberation for Turkish dissidents (Dogu and Mat, 2019). This surveillance regime creates a necessity of engaging in political talk that remains under the radar. Especially, the accounts with higher visibility such as micro-celebrities suffer most scrutiny, whilst being important actors of information dissemination (Sanjari and Khazraee, 2014). In this paper, I analyse the evasion tactics used by dissenting Twitter micro-celebrities in navigating these restrictions. In order to do this, I specifically focus on micro-celebrity accounts by ordinary users who gained fame due to the humorous commentaries they offer on the daily events in Turkey. Without a claim for expertise or any exceptional ability beyond being avid observers of the social, cultural and political realities of life in Turkey, these accounts claim follower numbers that often exceed 30-40k and some reaching millions. This paper presents how these accounts express political criticism through a narration of everyday life and daily events by utilising platform specific cultural capital in formulating a language (Scott, 1990) that is understood by subgroups who are acclimated to the platform culture. I argue that these practices signal a change in the conventions of dissident political talk that relies on a perceived gap in platform cultural knowledge between the pro- and anti-government groups.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What does the rise of algorithms and data analytics mean for European screen production? This paper examines the experiences of screenwriters, producers, and directors who have collaborated with data-driven streamers like Netflix and Amazon. The findings arise from on an exploration of the following research questions: (1) How do screen workers engage with broader debates about the impact of data-driven streamers (e.g. Netflix and Amazon) on the European screen industry? (2) How do screen workers make sense of their labour conditions and creativity in a streaming era? (3) How do screen workers evaluate the look, feel, and quality of the resulting streaming output? To answer these questions, I mix concepts and methods from media industry studies, production studies, critical data studies, and critical algorithm studies. The project takes the form of a production study that examines how screen workers negotiate the production dynamics in a streaming era. More specifically, I have interviewed 33 screen workers and carried out what Sherry Ortner (2010) calls an ‘interface ethnography.’ My findings especially focus on the multiple barriers to access – for me as a researcher as well as for the interviewed screen workers. It is well established that streamers like Netflix and Amazon hold audience figures and insights close to their chest. This paper demonstrates some of the ways screen workers interpret and interact with data despite this secrecy. Drilling down into these experiences will illuminate how screen workers make sense of their labour conditions and content output in a streaming era.</jats:p>",

Thinking across their research on chronic and crip technologies, this panel interrogates what it means, and is, to care for oneself and others in relation to the feel of navigating technologized, datafied, and materially marked lives and the systems and communities that shape their very possibilities. Building on Hamraie and Fritsch’s (2019) conception of “crip technoscience” and capacious notions of care articulated by folks in our research, panelists examine how chronic and disabled lives are lived between “enclosed regimes of self-care” with their individualizing models of selfhood and “collective communal care” frameworks (Sharma, 2017, para. 20, para. 4) that our research shows often require new ways of thinking about and better sourcing social and technological infrastructures that are centered around chronic and crip ways of living.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>For diaspora activists in transnational networks, digital media play a crucial role to mobilize and advocate against authoritarian regimes in their country of origin. Yet the reliance on these technologies creates multiple points of exposure that state actors exploit to silence and punish dissent from abroad. While research has exposed the technical underpinnings of digital attacks targeting civil society, less is known on how potential targets perceive and respond to these threats. Using more than 50 interviews with exiled human rights defenders and journalists from Egypt, Syria and Iran, this paper investigates risk perceptions and security practices of activists in transnational networks. It shows that rather than on nuanced risk assessment, digital security decisions and behavior are often built on the “imagined affordances” of digital technologies for surveillance and information control. The paper argues that the complexity of digital tools and constantly evolving risks thus only work to aggravate activists’ uncertainty regarding the capabilities of the state actors threatening them, reinforcing the silencing effects of transnational repression. Networks of incident response, support and information sharing, in turn, will help to strengthen the digital resilience of transnational civil society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>YouTube has become notoriously associated with extreme right-wing communities that spread discourses of white supremacy and conspiracy. This study applies a social semiotic approach to analysing conspiratorial YouTube videos created by white supremacists in response to the Notre Dame Fire of 2019. In particular, this study applies a combined legitimation (Van Leeuwen, 2007) and communing affiliation (Zappavigna and Martin, 2018) framework to the verbal and visual content of 15 videos. Communing affiliation refers to how values are positioned as bondable in situation where users don’t interact directly (Zappavigna and Martin, 2018). It is formed from couplings of ideational (what is being evaluated) and attitudinal (how it is evaluated) meaning (Martin and White, 2005), hence forming a value that is bondable. Legitimation (Van Leeuwen, 2007) refers to how discourses establish authority and can be realised textually or visually, with various linguistic strategies. This study will focus on the idea of ‘technological authority’ construed by positive evaluations in the transcripts of screenshots as evidence and the use of screenshots as visual evidence. Overall, this study will show how key values are working in tandem with (de)legitimation strategies, how (de)legitimation can further explain the significance of these values, and how YouTubers artificially create credibility in their videos through these legitimation and affiliation strategies. This raises further questions about the invoked meanings of screenshots as evidence and the ethical dilemmas that screenshots become entangled in, when considering the attention given to false and hateful content that is shared online.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past few years, Kenya’s digital landscape has transformed and this has been made possible by proliferation of the usage of digital technologies, particularly - mobile phones. Due to increased access to digital technologies, faster internet speeds, increased securitization among other issues, data on individuals in online spaces has also increased. Recently, the government rolled out a National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS) which is meant to capture biometric data but this has generated a huge debate online in Kenya under the hashtag #ResistHudumaNamba. This paper will therefore examine the following issues: What has contributed to the decline of trust between the government and its citizens when it comes to internet technologies? What are the actual sentiments given for and against in the introduction of Huduma Number? What are the underlying reasons for continued registration of individuals in Kenya? This research will be a qualitative research study. Data will be generated from social media sites (Twitter and Facebook), as well as blog posts and newspaper articles. A discourse analysis of the events around #ResistsHudumaNamba in these sources will be done so as to answer the research questions. This research has the potential to contribute to literature on trust in sub-Saharan Africa as well as establish trust issues between government and citizens when digital technologies are involved.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper addresses the theme of this year’s conference by focusing on the issue of trust in the uneasy relationship between content-generating users and commercially owned platforms. In this paper, I will present a case study of the use of so-called ‘bookshelves’ on Goodreads which offers a distinct example illustrating how a social media platform will often tests its users’ trust as it seeks ways to capitalize on its users’ engagement and contributions while still preserving the atmosphere of a social network built for and with its users. Bookshelves constitute a key element in making Goodreads a space users can feel ‘at home’ in. In the paper, I show how this becomes clear when considering users responses’ to Goodreads policies on bookshelves. I focus specifically on three different examples of negotiations of trust that have emerged in relation to the platform’s policies on bookshelves. The study draws particularly on discourse analysis with a focus on narrative and organizational metaphors, and the aim is to identify central points of ambivalence in users’ attempts to balance their trust in the platform.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel examines the role of affect in transnational digital media, offering fine-grained analyses of online communities and media artifacts which contend with and carve out contested futures. In doing so, it offers digital affect as an analytic for contending with interdependent realities. Through qualitative interviews, close readings, and textual analyses, these projects engage in a range of approaches to trace the digital affects which circulate transnationally. They examine the World Economic Forum as a transnational spectacle of justice, the promotional materials and the recoding work of extremist groups like the so-called “Islamic State,” online communities which suture continuities between Al-Andalus and an emerging Arab Muslim identity, and global meme-makers who engage in expression through playful but also puncturing forms of critique. Through these case studies, the panel examines the power of particular affects—like nostalgia, fear, shame, and zanaakha, a kitschy humor of the times—and the particular power of affects—to bind and polarize communities, to identify transnational structures of feeling, and to reshape the political present by feeling history differently. By turning to these spaces, these projects make the case for careful, contextualized approaches to affect and digital media in order to mine their political power.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>No single tool is more fundamental to writing—and more\n        unexamined—than the computer keyboard. Most of us in the West never consider that the\n        standard QWERTY key layout, i.e. the staggered key design and the selection of keys\n        available, is anything but the received, traditional means of text input. And as such,\n        keyboard/device manufacturers wield a unique form of power: they dictate the kind of words\n        we can create. They further decide, however unconsciously, the motions our fingers take when\n        we write; the staggered layout was necessary for the proper functioning of mechanical\n        typewriters, but has no necessity for computers (let alone mobile devices), yet continues to\n        be replicated, despite the fact that it is responsible for repetitive stress injuries that\n        could be eliminated or reduced with an improved ergonomic design. QWERTY may even shape the\n        meaning of words that we type. Furthermore, considering the global reach of QWERTY against\n        the backdrop of language diversity, and particularly the approximately 300 non-Latin scripts\n        in existence, the hegemony of default QWERTY keyboards hints at the ongoing impacts of the\n        colonial legacy within digital technologies. Thus, to make computing, and the Internet, more\n        equitable and humane, we must reimagine our keyboard layouts, the characters they include,\n        and our modes of human-computer interaction. Our paper presents this case, employing data\n        analyses of hardware and software keyboard usage statistics.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Reddit.com is a social media site with huge volumes and varieties of content, both hosted on their platform, and imported from other providers. It is also a place of counterpublic community action. Sub-Reddits like r/the_donald, and r/theredpill expound, in turn, alt-right and anti-feminist views. Along with various posts, links, and outside content, the communities support millions of words of user discussion. These communities are policed, at least in part, by their exposure to the community at large, and push-back from other people and groups to their content. When a community sees that its action on a site like Reddit is limited, and perceives that its ideas and ideologies are being silenced, what happens? This paper uses data from a digital ethnography of r/TheRedPill, a sub-community of Reddit dedicated to “discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.” The community was quarantined by Reddit in September of 2018, and since that time has engaged in regular discussion about the movement of community discussion and forums away from Reddit to their own hosting site www.trp.red. Beyond simply allowing versus limiting speech, the case of r/TheRedPill provides an opportunity to engage in a discussion about whether progressive sanction is the right way to manage the intersection of counterpublic views with the needs of tech firms. This paper hopes to further that discussion using a community that is less generally associated with hate speech, and can therefore exist on the margins of acceptability.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The manosphere is an online network of disparate formations, which are united in their antipathy toward feminism, their reliance on evolutionary psychology and their belief that Western civilization is under threat. In recent years, a growing body of scholarship on the manosphere has emerged from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Much of this work sits within internet studies but there are also significant contributions from gender studies, social psychology and terrorism / cybersecurity studies. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the current research, to identify methodological limitations, and to propose some new interdependent research frameworks and methods. To date, much of the work conducted on the manosphere and its various subgroups (e.g. incel) relies on gathering a dataset from one platform and subjecting it to either manual or machine analysis to identify key themes or characteristics. While this categorisation has been important, its frequent replication has led to a certain stagnation of knowledge, as we are missing the dynamic aspects of how and where ideas travel and interconnect. We call for a conceptual shift away from thinking of manosphere communities such as incel as isolated, homogenous identity groups, to conceiving of them instead as a multifaceted, ever-evolving online ecosystem. We map out a number of key pathways that need to be explored, outlining methodologies for each. Approaching the incel/manosphere as a dynamic ecosystem, we argue, will take knowledge of this phenomenon in important new directions, as well as opening up new space for inter-disciplinary collaboration.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>There is great public concern about far-right radicalization online,\n        the process by which individuals are exposed to internet content and then adopt extremist or\n        hateful ideas. However, this concept has two major problems. First, the idea of\n        “radicalization” and “extremism” assumes that to study the radical is to study the other,\n        yet white supremacy and racism are hardly new phenomenon in America. Second, while the\n        internet clearly contributes to spreading fringe and far-right beliefs, \"online\n        radicalization\" furthers simplistic narratives of media effects that ignore political,\n        economic, and emotional complexities. Thus, to understand the adoption of fringe and\n        far-right beliefs outside the problematic frame of “radicalization”, this paper takes up\n        narratives of “redpilling,” slang for coming to believe something counterfactual to\n        mainstream consensus. Drawing from qualitative and ethnographic research on far-right online\n        subcultures and critical terrorism studies, we ask how members of far-right and fringe\n        communiteis understand and perform their own community enrollment. We conduct critical\n        discourse theory and qualitative data analysis on a broad corpus of in situ discussions of\n        redpilling drawn from internet spaces devoted to far-right and fringe discussions, including\n        12 different subreddits, Gab.ai, Discord, Parler, Telegram, and 4chan. Our preliminary\n        findings suggest that “online radicalization” is an ongoing process in which people come to\n        believe extremist viewpoints by consuming far-right content, participating in far-right\n        internet spaces, viewing interpersonal interactions through an ideological lens, and\n        interacting with friends and family with similar views.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This panel delves into the complex entanglement of children within our 'platform society,' spotlighting their roles amidst the dynamics of platformisation, datafication, and monetisation. It scrutinises the emergence of child influencers, mapping their integration and active participation within the influencer economy. This exploration underscores the critical intersection between childhood and platformization, highlighting the commodification and monetization practices shaping children's presence on platforms. The panel seeks to understand these practices across diverse contexts, including time, platforms, geographies, and cultures, emphasizing the multifaceted roles of children as consumers, producers, and actors. The panel also examines regulatory frameworks surrounding children on platforms, focusing on governance issues related to child labour, advertising, and platform liability. It navigates the tension between viewing children as 'becomings' in need of protection and as 'beings' with an agency, contributing to the discourse on platform governance and regulatory practices. Presenting a range of papers, the panel traverses topics from the monetization of children in influencer content on TikTok, to the offering of a child influencer taxonomy, to the influence of kidfluencers on young viewers' consumption behaviors. It critically assesses the impact of digital dashboards on parenting, illustrating how children's health, location, and well-being are intertwined with datafication logic. Collectively, these papers illuminate how the place of children online is contested, as they become embroiled in practices of monetisation, visibility, and datafication across platforms and infrastructures. Our panellists draw from their empirical and theoretical work to challenge these practices, emphasising their implications for platform governance and addressing how regulations can serve children's best interests.</jats:p>",

Here, we investigate specifically how Twitter users engaging in arguments about mask-wearing invoke scientific principles to argue against masks. We further analyze the sources that these users cite to support their claims. Using a qualitative approach drawing from constructivist grounded theory, we show how these users work to defend the legitimacy of their claims and their external sources by selectively exploiting rhetorical values of scientific endeavour. We analogize their work to the process of scientific boundary-work, in which actors consciously manipulate the boundary between science and not-science for personal and political gain.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>On 3 October 2020, a 22 years young man, Joshua Ambrose, was shot dead by a team of the Nigerian Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Delta State, Nigeria, on the allegation that he was an Internet fraudster (Dambo et al., 2021). The SARS was established in 1992 to curb crimes. However, the SARS has been accused of gross humanrights violations (Wada, 2021). Joshua's shooting was captured in a video. The audio in the video states that the Police just shot and killed the owner of a Lexus SUV and zoomed off with his car (Agbo, 2021). In a few days, the viral video generated outrage that transformed into vast decentralised street protests in major cities in Nigeria, mainly organised through social media. EndSARS Movement continues to construct memories across time, an area dominated by Western studies (Daphi &amp; Zamponi, 2019). Researchers (Nwakanma, 2022; Dambo et al., 2021; Nwabunnia, 2021; Ajaegbu et al., 2022) have explored the EndSARS Movement from diverse perspectives. Nonetheless, the literature is devoid of studies from the memory study perspective, a critical area in social movement studies (Smit, 2020; Merill &amp; Lindgren, 2020). Besides, considering the online feature of the Movement, the current literature on EndSARS needs to include the novelty and methodological rigour of virtual ethnography. Consequently, this study attempts to understand how protesters use Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram Stories (Ephemeral; 24 hours $2 ) to construct a memory of the EndSARS Movement in Nigeria from 2020 until its Anniversaries in 2021, 2022, and 2023.</jats:p>",
