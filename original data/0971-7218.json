    "abstract": "This special issue revisits the changing dynamics of international migration of highly skilled professionals since the publication of the Science, Technology and Society Journal’s special issue on International Mobility of Brains in Science and Technology in 1997 (Vol. 2, No. 2, July–December 1997). Two important features underlying migration were extensively analysed and discussed in the 1997 special issue: first the return of the highly skilled expatriates to their home countries; and second the S&T diaspora option (Gaillard and Gaillard, 1997). Case studies from Argentina, Colombia, India, South Africa, South Korea and Uruguay illustrated some of the points. In the last two decades we have witnessed several changes in the global science and technology system as well as national innovation systems in various countries. Two increasing trends have become quite prominent in these years. The first is the internationalisation of R&D and global nature of innovation triggered by ICT revolution. This is associated not only with the mobility of capital, R&D and innovation across countries due to various economic and intellectual factors, but also the mobility of professionals. The second is the economic transformation of several countries due to rapid growth in the respective national innovation systems. Science, technology and innovation policies in these countries have led to greater investments in R&D and S&T institutions from Latin America, North Africa, Southern Africa, East Asia and South Asia. This is also associated with greater need by several countries to connect with the global trends in science, technology and innovation developments in an effort to take advantage of the globalising world. All these trends have induced several changes in the nature and",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper begins with a brief consideration of general approaches to technology transfer and its impact on the processes of late development, with the focus on industrial develop ment. Section II narrows down to the manner in which industrial historians have analysed that greatly significant era of global industrialisation, 1870-1914. Here the emphasis is on the influential writing of Alexander Gerschenkron, although with modifications including those of R.P. Dore, A. Sulejewicz and others. The purpose here is to show that models of late development must fully take into account not only the process of technology transfer, but also its technical imperatives, institutional and control requirements and socio- political impacts. The next section presents a brief case study of what has been termed as the South Russia Metallurgical Project (circa 1887-1900) in order to highlight the com plexities and sequences in the Russian-Western European technical interaction during the period. The following section draws some lessons of interaction from this more empirical material, much of the latter being based on British and American engineering reports of what was happening in Russia. Section V broadly considers the comparative perspective. Finally, a concluding section discusses needed revisions in the theories of late development which have implications for more generalised models in such areas as institutional inno vation and the role of the state in the industrialisation process. </jats:p>",

Indeed, the current situation in the field has been described by one distinguished historian as a ‘cacophonous confusion’. The challenge historians face is how to imagine new ways of writing history that overcome this confusion without falling back upon ideological and methodological prejudices that reproduce the problems of the past in new guises.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The qualification level of the emigrating Moroccans rose steadily in the 1990s, and especially since the year 2000. At present, an estimated 20 per cent of the highly qualified Moroccans live abroad. Student migration, which accounts for a large part of this 20 per cent, is contributing substantially to keeping this level high. For the last 20 years Morocco has been testing actions to mobilise and reconnect its S&amp;T diaspora. The related special programmes and institutions are discussed and analysed in this article. Results are mixed, especially if measured against the original goals and the high expectations of the MREs (Marocains Résidant à l’Etranger: Moroccans living abroad). In response to these weaknesses and criticisms, proposals for institutional reorganisation and programme revisions have recently been put forth, or tested, but it is too early to evaluate the outcome. </jats:p><jats:p> Interviews conducted in Morocco and in Europe with scientists who returned to their country or were part of the diaspora living in Europe indicate a very strong desire to participate in the development of Morocco, but also highlight inhibiting factors inherent in the public higher education and research. The international mobility of the interviewees was a constant but not all thought that Morocco would be their final landing place. Many of them are the forerunners in a new type of mobility system that will contribute (together with the reform measures that Morocco will have to adopt) to making the Moroccan national research system attract Moroccan and foreign scientists for all or part of their professional career. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> National innovation systems and policies are confronted by many interrelated factors, including large socio-economic structural problems, globalisation, pressure to provide public research funding and changes in research communities driven by the Mode 2 paradigm. These changes challenge sectoral public research organisations (PROs). The role of universities and other policy organisations in innovation policy has been studied at length but there has been little investigation of PROs, despite their significance in developed and developing economies. This article fills this gap by exploring PROs in Finland, an open, industrialised and export-dependent economy. It draws several conclusions about the current state and future prospects of PROs in Finland. PROs are in transition in terms of their organisational, managerial and funding structures and their role in the internationalising national innovation system. Their rationale, legitimacy and strategies are also changing due to national innovation driven missions and internationalisation strategies. All PROs in Finland now engage in international cooperation. However, despite increasing funding from international sources and the globalisation of many aspects, PROs are still national organisations subject to national policies and governed by national bodies. Finnish PROs need to redefine their strategies at the international and European levels without forgetting their national role. </jats:p>",

The institutional model chosen to face these questions was that of the 'Geological Surveys', a tradition well-established in the Western world. A first national survey appeared in 1875, a second, regional one, was founded in the state of São Paulo in 1886, and a third one, national, and of strongly applied character, was founded in 1907: the 'Geological and Min eralogical Survey of Brazil'. Its trajectory from the foundation until 1934 is the focus of the present paper. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> At the end of World War II, numerous initiatives for international scientific cooperation were undertaken by the UN: the creation of a science division in UNESCO, projects of international laboratories, support to scientific unions and creation of scientific cooper ation field offices in Southern countries. The development of international science and the contribution of scientific cooperation in maintaining peace were seen as one and only goal. Committed scientists such as Henri Laugier in the UN and Joseph Needham in the UNESCO tried to give life to ideas developed by the 'science and society' move ments in the 1930s and 1940s through a new form ofscientific cooperation. The develop ment of international science, before anything else, was to meet social needs: health, food, standards of living and education. But in the beginning of the 1950s the Cold War reduced the international support given to these projects considerably. This paper analyses the goals coherence of the goals pursued by these international bodies. It focuses on the specific perspectives defended by Paulo Carneiro, as a scientist and as a representative of the Brazilian government in the UNESCO, mainly through his project of the International Institute of the Hylean Amazon. </jats:p>",

This is why the Indian experience is so relevant to thinking that is needed everywhere. When Tyabji says that there was little highlevel discussion in India about enhancement of technological capability, in spite of the fact that it seems ’self-evident that continual innovation in manufacturing processes is precisely the key to sustain international competitiveness’ (p. 6), he describes many countries. This is the reason why this little gem of a book should be read round the world, and should definitely be in the hands of anyone embarking on a project to change the industrial landscape of India. Each of the ’classical’ units of analysis in innovation studies is treated by Tyabji: the firm, local supplies of capital, commodity chains, competitive rivalry, purchasing power of local markets, state economic policy, international business and business cycles. Failure and success in innovation are carefully analysed. This book is a must for students of social",

In spite of this they show distinctive features as Asian societies. The region hosts eight of the world’s ten most populous countries and has a large share of the world’s poorest, although the region is also hailed for being witness to the most remarkable economic, social and demographic ’miracles’ in modem times. Not only Japan (which industrialised in less than half the time it took Western countries to do the same), even the small and resource-poor economies such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea have attained economic breakthroughs and have sustained their economic gains. Likewise, China along with Sri Lanka have attained palpable improvements in the health and welfare conditions of their populations at relatively low levels of economic development, besides achieving substantial reductions in their population growth rates. Similarly, some countries have achieved literacy and education levels that are high by developing country standards. More recently, both Thailand and Indonesia have undergone dramatic demographic transitions and are similarly experiencing economic breakthroughs. The positive changes in some countries notwithstanding, countries in the Asian region, with the exception of Japan and the NICs, continue to confront massive and persistent poverty and unemploy-",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past forty years, Korea has shown remarkable economic growth with drastic changes in its national innovation system (NIS). In general, government research organisations play a very important role in the NIS, especially in developing countries where science and technology resources are lacking. Since Korea has developed its current national innovation system from virtually nothing, it is worth analysing the Korean government research institutes (KGRIs) in the context of Korea's NIS (KNIS) development. To this end, this article describes the concept of NIS for the analytical framework, and presents how KNIS has changed in response to the economic and industrial changes of Korea. Then the changes of KGRIs to changing KNIS are categorised over several periods. It is argued that such changes are in fact evolutionary responses and the outcome of Korean government S&amp;T policies. Finally, the article concludes with some policy implications for other developing countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the evolving landscape of e–commerce in the Philippines. It looks at two information and communication technology (ICT) applications that are being used innovatively by Filipinos: mobile phone–based cash systems and social networking websites to enable small entrepreneurs to venture into e–commerce. The article investigates how these two technologies help overcome barriers for individuals to participate in e–commerce, and explores how small and informal markets are evolving in the information age. The research samples individuals already doing business online (through Multiply.com), investigates the profile of these new entrepreneurs, the limitations of their market and explore how they nurture their business. While this phenomenon of using social networks and m–cash may primarily involve an urban population, it is significant for development, nonetheless, considering the growing segment of the poor found in urban locales. Further, lessons for the rural population can still be derived by analysing the barriers to entry in the online world, provided that access to infrastructure (that is, the Internet, courier and G–Cash services) is available. In this regard, the linking enablers/disablers of online commerce to offline contexts remains crucial. </jats:p>",

The six contributions to this issue address the ‘state’ of Africa STI in different, but complementary, ways. Three papers (Michael Kahn; Rigas Arvanitis, Johann Mouton and Adeline Néron; and Robert Tijssen and Jos Winnink) take on this challenge mostly through quantitative approaches using indicator-based evidence through ‘continent’ wide analyses. The three other papers (Agnes Lutomiah, Jaco P. Blanckenberg and Stefan Skupien; Nelius Boshoff and Similo Ngwenya; and Sanaa Zebakh et al.) present their analyses through country (Kenya and Zimbabwe) or regional (three Maghreb countries) case studies. But the individual papers in the issue are not only differentiated in terms of the quantitative–qualitative spec-trum, substantive issues around trends in the funding of science in Africa, patterns and trends in research collaboration and changes in the role of the institutions of scientific research, and especially the growing importance of (research) universities in the production of knowledge on the continent. The individual papers are rich in evidence and data despite the continuing constraints on the availability of accurate and robust STI data about the majority of the science systems in Africa. But, in addition to presenting and discussing on the implications of the evidence from recent bibliometric and scientometric data, some papers also venture into more theoretical and conceptual Tijssen proposes a distinction between global and the of research the the the colleagues",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Economic geography in an era of global competition poses a paradox. In theory, location should no longer be a source of competitive advantage. Open global markets, rapid transportation and high-speed communications should allow any company to source anything from any place at any time. But in practice, location remains central to competition and institutions seem to help in the development of regions. This article examines the role of Malaysia's Multimedia Development Corporation as a regional development agency—in the development of the MSC Project—the Multimedia Super Corridor Cluster, a project to develop the information and communications technology sector, started by the government of Malaysia to kickstart the transition to a knowledge-based economy. Even though the MDC has played a significant role in developing the MSC project, there is much more it can do to develop it as a ‘regional cluster’. It is concluded that the MDC has been doing a good job of marketing the MSC in general and attracting companies to set up shop in Malaysia in order to form a new knowledge-based sector. It is suggested that the business-related function should receive equal attention when any innovation cluster is designed and operated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study intends to demonstrate whether firms’ cooperative activities, particularly ‘coopetition’, affect business performances. Coopetition, which is cooperation with competitors, is a strategic concept that suggests competition and cooperation between firms can exist simultaneously. More specifically, in order to investigate cooperation as a part of innovation mechanism, this study analysed the mediating effects of product and process innovation performances in between cooperative activities and management performances. For this purpose, we applied a structural equation model (SEM) by integrating a regression model and a logistic regression model. The former analysed the effects of cooperation and innovation on management performances, whereas the latter studied influence of cooperation on innovation performances. For empirical analysis, we utilised data from Korea Innovation Survey (KIS), which incorporates information on Korean firm’s innovation activities and their relevant performances. The results from this study can be applied to addressing and diagnosing issues in Korean industries by analysing relationships among cooperative activities, innovation outcomes and management performances in the structural context. </jats:p><jats:p> The analysis showed that coopetition, compared to other types of cooperation, has enhanced the performance of process innovation. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that cooperation related positively to management performances. This study, however, also addresses the problem that Korean firms have limitations in linking these innovation performances to actual management performances of financial growth. The results highlight the significance of strategic openness and flexibility, even to competitors, as the business environment and technology market may change drastically. Coopetition strategy can work as a facilitator in providing windows of opportunity for sustainable growth through field-based innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Blockchain has been regarded as an emerging global phenomenon in the field of new technologies. However, the existing literature still lacks descriptions of the cooperation characteristics and innovation landscape of blockchain. This study uses the social network analysis method to compare the development of blockchain technology and technological collaboration in China and in the United States based on patent data. Our analyses suggest that the number of blockchain patent applications in China is increasing rapidly due to the Chinese Government developing consistent national strategies for blockchain technology. In all, both countries have notable agglomerations in a few geographical areas or cities. However, the university or enterprise block in the United States has broader and deeper cooperation, unlike the Chinese university or enterprise block, which is more inclined to cooperate within blocks and has more isolated blocks. Lastly, there are various patent attributes-influencing factors behind the importance of node cooperation. The results show that the degree of cooperation of cooperative inventors or important patents is greater in China’s cooperation network, while in the United States, the influence of enterprises rather than universities or individuals is greater. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Developing talented human resources through learning entails nurturing innovation and improving competitiveness; to achieve innovation, tech-based SMEs within or around Korean technoparks must undertake learning organisation activities (LOAs). Our results demonstrate that six dimensions of the LOA model have more validity or a better model fit than the previous seven dimensions of the LOA model. Furthermore, three important sub-variables of LOAs (i.e., creating continuous learning opportunities, establishing systems to capture and share learning and providing strategic leadership for learning) have a positive and significant effect on learning transfer. Finally, transferring LOAs was found to mediate the relationship between LOAs and innovativeness by creating continuous learning opportunities (and future directions) and by providing strategic leadership for learning. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Women, especially women in the developing world, occupy few positions of power within the realm of science and technology. Yet, women’s experience of science and technology frequently differs from that of men-and often in less positive ways. Gender differences in this field have real consequences for the quality of women’s lives and for sustainable human development. They reflect issues of justice, equal access to knowledge, and equal opportunities to shape that knowledge. Why do boys surge ahead in primary school science education while girls fall behind, a gender difference that continues at higher education levels? This question is one among many posed and examined in Missing Links. Gender specialists from around the world examine topics ranging from indigenous knowledge, health and information to education, literacy and small business. They provide valuable insight into the failure of science and technology to answer women’s needs and the lack of women’s power in this critical domain. Their analysis along with the recommendations of the Gender Working Group of the UN Commission on Science",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses the practice in Mao-era China of creating new medical ‘therapies’ based on the blood of fowls (chickens, geese and ducks), which were emblematic of an expanded interest in the use of animal tissue in general. The logic and charisma of these practices stemmed from their hybridity: references culled from classical Chinese texts, suggestions taken from Soviet medicine (particularly tissue therapy), identification with the countryside and their seeming expression of political ideologies. My primary focus is chicken blood therapy, which emerged in the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward and reached its height of popularity in the Cultural Revolution. While ultimately discredited, similar practices such as goose blood therapy were legitimised in its wake. Such therapies helped originate the still-current claim that modern Chinese drug discoveries could be ‘miracle cures’, and may represent a neglected early chapter in the ongoing craze for animal-based drugs in Chinese medicine. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The web of linked data, otherwise known as the semantic web, is a system in which information is structured and interlinked to provide meaningful content to artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. As the complex interactions between digital personae and these algorithms mediate access to information, it becomes necessary to understand how these classification and knowledge systems are developed. What are the processes by which those systems come to represent the world, and how are the controversies that arise in their creation, overcome? As a global form, the semantic web is an assemblage of many interlinked classification and knowledge systems, which are themselves assemblages. Through the perspectives of global assemblage theory, critical code studies and practice theory, I analyse netnographic data of one such assemblage. Schema.org is but one component of the larger global assemblage of the semantic web, and as such is an emergent articulation of different knowledges, interests and networks of actors. This articulation comes together to tame the profusion of things, seeking stability in representation, but in the process, it faces and produces more instability. Furthermore, this production of instability contributes to the emergence of new assemblages that have similar aims. </jats:p>",

The role of exports in promoting faster growth is also examined, as are the channels of technological capability acquisition.

Accordingly, patent operation platforms (POPs) have emerged recently in China, yet few studies focus on uncovering their structures and operating mechanisms. This article aims to explore them based on two in-depth case studies with the application of a four-dimensional service innovation framework. Findings pinpoint that POP consists of ‘Patent Plus’ database, patent service platform and two-sided patent platform, as a closed loop. In this structure, ICT plays a prominent role, connected with new service concepts, service delivery system and client interface, to operate the platform. Our article also shows implications to POP related theory and practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The fact that some developing countries with authoritarian regimes have achieved high rates of growth and impressive technology development has been interpreted as an indication that authoritarian regimes fare better than democratic ones in the promotion of technical change. This paper argues that, in the Latin American case, authoritarian insulation led to lack of accountability and protected inefficiency; it did not translate into a capacity to elicit the desired innovative behaviour from the relevant players, nor guaranteed the correctness of policy decisions and timely adaptation to changes in the relevant policy parameters. These effects of authoritarian insulation are illustrated with the help of the informatics policies of Brazil and Argentina. Political and social democratisation lead to improved prospecls of more realistic and effective science and technology policies in the region that diffuse what are currently isolated cases of innovative dialogue between the users and producers of technology, that is, those who need a technological solution and those who design it. </jats:p>",

The main factors influencing the performance are investigated in terms of research budget, capacity, number of researchers and international collaboration on the basis of previous researches. </jats:p><jats:p> The main finding is that the research capacity is basic requirement to increase the modified impact factor and the main factors influencing research performance through IJR are the network size and the number of contact in this research. Its recommendations, in accordance with this finding, are as follows. The government should support researcher to have more and easier contact with foreign researchers in terms of budget and programme structure and institutional improvement, including evaluation system. The additional budget on the existing programme and easy usage of research budget in the IJR are the good ways to promote the IJR activities through renovation of basic R&amp;D programme structure. The additional credit to the research groups with bigger research networks should be considered in the selection process and ex-post evaluation process.

    "abstract": "Helga Nowotny is at Wissenschaftsphilosophie und Wissenschaftsforschung, SemperStemwarte, Schmelzbergstrasse 25, ETH Zentrum, STW, CH-8092, Zurich, Switzerland ; e-mail: geiser@wiss.huwi.ethz.ch. IT IS ALWAYS rewarding to be challenged by a historian of science of Dominique Pestre’s intellectual stature and depth of knowledge, both of historical and contemporary issues. His rereading of our book The New Production of Knowledge (Gibbons et al. 1994) provides a welcome opportunity not only to respond to some of the insightful comments he makes, but to engage in a wider debate. At times many of us may have shared his ’sentiment of disquieting simultaneity’ between our own scholarly work and some of major macroeconomic and political changes we are witnessing today. In contrast to historians who work with the benefit of hindsight, laboriously earned as it may be, scholars who venture onto the terrain of diagnosing the present are exposed to a double risk: the ’normal’ risk of misreading or misinterpreting the phenomenology, and ruptures or continuities of the actual changes that take place; and also the ’additional’ risk of contributing, consciously or not, to some of the trends that they portray. The language of description may then easily give way to what others read as approval. The use of words may then appear as collusive in the sense of helping to render more acceptable what should perhaps be more critically exposed, if not opposed. Yet language remains our most indispensible means of communication-the key to an open and honest debate.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Nepali information and communication technology (ICT) policies, informed by dominant international discourses on internet and ICT for development, have attributed a ‘self-evident’ positive impact to economic growth. Such a conception is inconclusive and hides the underlying socioeconomic inequalities and the barriers they oppose to universal connectivity ambitions. The self-evident discourse overlooks the importance of adjacent infrastructures like electricity, critical for efficient functioning of a ‘digital society’. History has shown Nepal’s eagerness to buy the irrational exuberance of the dot-com era. It also shows policy targets were not based on local evidence and experiences. While the question about when the next bubble will emerge and burst is debatable, the techno-deterministic arguments need to be checked in light of evidence. We offer insights from import trajectories since the drafting of the first IT policy. The proliferation of mobile phones is explored in light of data consumption (i.e., usage) and access during the deadly earthquake in 2015. The evidence clearly highlights the mismatch between connectivity ambitions and socioeconomic realities in a stratified information society. We contend that the self-evident visions of connectivity need to be checked empirically. We call for internet and ICT policies that have a nuanced conceptualisation of access and its gradation. </jats:p>",

It takes years to plan, build, test and live with a bomb. Like a few societies, India is a now living with its bomb, but like many more countries/societies, India conceived of, planned and built nuclear weapons since the late 1940s. So this book about India is valuable for its example to Argentina, Brazil, Norway, Israel, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, North Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, Ukraine, etc. Here is the story of the difficult development of indigenous scientific institutions in parallel with nuclear developments elsewhere, the development of a public physics, chemistry and engineering capacity, and a secret one. Here are generations of prime ministers, from 1964 onwards (except for one), pretending to toe the no-nukes line set by Nehru-though Nehru himself appears to have opened the file on nuclear ambiguity, keeping the option open while developing capacity to make bombs. All along there were senior administrators and scientists who",

The book analyses the main factor which contributes to this poverty: the regional conflict that has prevented an effective response to the floods, drought and poverty which affect the plains surrounding these two rivers. It goes on to investigate the key issues underlying more than four decades of dispute about the sharing of these waters between India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The biopharmaceutical industry in Korea is considered a key strategic industry following the semiconductor industry. However, success in the biopharmaceutical industry depends on the outcome of research and development processes that require long periods and substantial investment, resulting in a success rate of only around 2.5%–4% for new drug development. Consequently, rational strategic choices, such as determining key capabilities to pursue business, deciding where to position within the value chain and identifying collaboration partners and strategies, are more crucial in the biopharmaceutical industry compared to other industries. In this study, we divided Korean biopharmaceutical companies into research and development groups and Integrated groups, which perform both research and production, and compared their productivity using the meta-frontier methodology to verify the significance of technology gap ratio (TGR) values between groups. We also investigated the influence of open innovation activities, including the type, partners and timing, on the TGR of each group with Tobit analysis. The investigation revealed that productivity and its influencing elements varied depending on the business model. This finding suggests that this information can be utilised to develop efficient industrial policies. </jats:p>",

This exploratory study investigates the effects of high income and gender on playing violent video games in Malaysia, and how it results in poor academic performance amongst secondary school children. This is a case study for other middle income nations in Southeast Asia, which also have strong Eastern cultural and religious beliefs. Contrary to earlier findings, the results indicated that boys from higher income backgrounds had a higher propensity for playing violent video games than adolescents from lower income backgrounds. The same effect though, is not manifested on adolescent girls. Nevertheless, playing violent video games was positively related to trait aggressive and negatively to academic performance in both the sexes. Our findings shed new light on socio-economic and demographic factors influencing violent video gaming, offering insights to both policy-makers and theoreticians in researching gaming effects. </jats:p>",

It is found out that the overseas PhD returnees are still in short supply. Overseas returned scientists are generally better off in academic and innovative performances. Sizable qualitative interviews showed that even within the influx of overseas returnees, the labour market is also a social and political field that the social network and policy design would largely direct the flow of overseas returned scientists. </jats:p>",

The discipline though recognised as a legitimate area of research has not come out of all its teething problems associated with the formation of any new area. </jats:p><jats:p> The mainstay, during the first phase of its development was the attitudinal surveys conducted in various countries. The objectives of these surveys were to measure the extent of scientific knowledge, probe public attitude towards science or scientists, and at times simply to explore the level of confidence or lack of confidence that a common citizen had in science. These surveys gradually turned into an important and regular activity in many countries. </jats:p><jats:p> The debate that followed the first phase resulted in refinement of methodology, tools and the models of assessment of Public Understanding of Science. The PAUS group at NISTADS, India, has since 1989 worked on methodology suitable for carrying out surveys in developing countries. Subsequently, a culturally sensitive model for analysing the survey data was proposed by the group. </jats:p><jats:p> The present article in the first section gives details of the model designated here as the ‘cultural model of Public Understanding of Science’. The following sections, in detail, deal with the application of the model on data sets collected by two different organisations in India.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Open Innovation means that valuable ideas can come from inside or outside the company and can go to market from inside or outside the company as well (Chesbrough, 2006). This concept is a decade old and is still alive and thriving concept that we need to integrate it into the broader stream of innovation literature focusing on collaboration with external partners (Vanhaverbeke, Chesbrough, &amp; West, 2014). Society of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity (SOItmC) in conjunction with 8th Knowledge Cities World Summit (KCWS) organised a conference at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) in 2015. The theme of the conference was ‘open innovation, knowledge city, and creative economy’. The concrete meaning of this theme is twofold. The first leads us to motivate to make use of open innovation to build up knowledge city. The other motivates us to make creative economy, which is based on creative knowledge and technology through knowledge city. Most articles in this special issue were initially presented at this conference held at Daegu in South Korea. We triggered open innovation to motivate knowledge city and creative economy. Our conference made open innovation as the logical background of eight Korea creative economy centres. </jats:p>",

Firms, universities and government organisations (including public research institutes) are defined as the three major players of the national innovation system and interactions between the players are considered the key of the national innovation system. However, public research institutes are relatively understudied compared to firms and universities even though their contribution in the national innovation system is not trivial. Aiming at understanding detailed process rather than testing hypotheses, the findings of this article shed practical information regarding innovation process in public research institutes. Focusing on the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (Fraunhofer) and the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan (ITRI), this article analyses and compares innovation processes of public research institutes with their patent data. Based on findings, this study further discusses issues for better management of public research institutes. </jats:p>",

The study addressed the question by integrating data from three sources: Scopus, the Web of Science and the National Research Database of Zimbabwe. A set of fifteen bibliometric indicators was constructed for 2,873 Zimbabwean authors, of which 248 (9%) were in agricultural sciences and 295 (10%) in multidisciplinary agricultural sciences. The indicators represented three dimensions: volume of article output, scholarly publication outlet and research collaboration. Results are discussed in terms of the Zimbabwean government’s policy for agriculture. Part of the lessons learnt calls for author-level bibliometric studies to connect more closely with the local, regional and global politics of knowledge production. </jats:p>",

The findings pinpoint the important role played by CBCS in helping NRDI construct, a micro-collaborative and academic entrepreneurial ecosystem, and improving academic entrepreneurial performance. The following are the key to form CBCS and improve its entrepreneurial performance: to focus the core mission of NRDI on the research results commercialization, to establish cross-border integration, business incubation system and diversified incentives.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Due to high uncertainty of product development and business environment, firm-level diversification has been regarded as one of the most effective methods in pharmaceutical firms. In previous study, firm-level diversification was discussed by different value chains of market, product, and technology. However, in most cases, the diversification itself was adopted in a simple manner although its property contains different aspects and the results varies depending on the diversity property of selected index. In addition, the existing approach for measuring firm’s product/market diversification using sales information distinguished by standard industry classification cannot provide direct implication as different strategies are made for market and product diversification. Therefore, this study examines the effects of firm-level diversification on business and innovation performances in pharmaceutical firms by considering (1) three diversification types: market, product, and technology, (2) clear separation between market and product diversification, and (3) two diversification perspectives: balance-centred and hetero-centred. For empirical analysis, an integrated firm-level data set combining from Medtrack, Orange Book, Compustat and Total Patent database is used. From the result, in case of market diversification, less market heterogeneity causes significant influence on business performance. For product and technology, a concentrated and greater heterogeneity of product diversification are turned out to promote business performance, while the more intensive and heterogeneous technology diversification has been shown to improve innovation performance. </jats:p>",

Second, we gauge if technology impacts employment. We use a multi-database and multi-method approach. Our analysis is based on National Sample Survey’s (NSS) 73rd Round on unincorporated non-agricultural enterprises. To understand the downstream of value-added value chain functions, capacity utilisation, last-mile delivery, product and process innovation, and orientation towards export, we use the World Bank Enterprise survey (2014). While confirming the stylised fact of the direct relationship between the firm’s resources and performance, the study emphasises the pivotal role of human capital in a firm’s performance, valid for both VC streams. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Is ANT an actor in its own ontology? This question summarises a number of issues that will be comprehensively investigated in this article. ANT will be analysed ‘reflexively’, that is, considering it as an actant of the ontology that it reclaims as a theory. The analysis of the concept of ‘description’ and the observation of the relational effects that ANT exerts and that are exerted on it reveal its asymmetric singularity in relation to the other actors. Therefore, we will argue whether ANT should actually be considered a ‘standing refutation’ of itself. The analysis of the concept of sociological relativity and its comparison with physical relativity reveal a possible reason for this self-contradictory behaviour, which will be the basis of our assumption concerning the emergence of a new type of action. Finally, a brief reinterpretation of ANT will be proposed, in the light of the newly introduced concepts of ontologisation and metaphysical action: it seems that this apparent contradiction can be ‘reabsorbed’ within the theory itself. Latour’s philosophical production will be broken down based on the applicability of the analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Today, startups are achieving innovation differently from traditional companies based on quick application of new technologies, promptness in decision-making, and active risk-taking. In this background, the startup innovation ecosystem (SIE) is defined as a system of innovation actors and influencing factors and their relationship, affecting innovation-based startup activities and their performance. SIE is distinct from the traditional national innovation system (NIS) and has an impact on NIS and government policy, co-evolving in the time. This study investigated how the Korean government, which is experiencing the R&amp;D paradox of high R&amp;D investment but low productivity, seeks to change the NIS by developing the SIE. According to our analytical framework of the SIE, Korea’s SIE is analysed in terms of startups, technology/knowledge, training/human capital, finance, infrastructure, and globalisation. In particular, the evolutionary process of startups-related policies is explained with several specific examples of policy programmes. It is found that Korea’s SIE has achieved unique development, with the government’s active supporting policy for startups, and has produced a big positive impact on Korea’s NIS. </jats:p>",

The evidence from Singapore shows that a sectoral approach in NSBI may help developing countries in finding a niche for growth instead of broadening the area of investment within biotechnology. In case of Singapore, the biomedical sector has been chosen by the national government for achieving the desired growth rate in the manufacturing sector. The various components of the NSBI and specific achievements of Singapore in this regard have been discussed in the article. </jats:p>",

We focus on how firm behaviour and structure drive these innovation factors. Our results are based on multiple regression analyses using firm-level data from 2010. We show that innovations in product, processes and R&amp;D activities (especially external R&amp;D activities) are more likely to improve the productivity of Spanish manufacturing firms. In addition, the activities related to the internal organisation or the external collaboration for innovation generates a higher productivity level. This positive effect is bigger when a firm collaborates with universities and/or technology centres and employs recent college graduates, especially those with degrees in science, engineering or technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We begin our reflection in this paper with the cursory observation that most of the major variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus were deciphered in the Global South, namely, alpha (China), beta and omicron (South Africa). This underappreciated fact demonstrates that independent capabilities in frontier sciences in the South contributed fundamentally to global efforts to minimise the human cost of the pandemic. However, while the more efficient vaccines primarily emerged from research and development (R&amp;D)-based capabilities in the Global North, some novel vaccines, secondary innovation in the form of manufacturing and the innovative deployment of preventive measures were also salient in the Global South. Thus, rather than starting with the ‘deficit model of development’ that is implicit in several policy discourses on the Global South, we argue that innovation concepts should instead be anchored in the rich civilisational heritage of such societies themselves. Theoretical notions such as secondary innovation, which emerged from Chinese efforts at economic catch-up, endogenous development, which seeks to ground Africa’s advancement in its own historical antecedents, and grassroots innovation from the Indian subcontinent, guide our South–South dialogical exchange in this article. Consequently, we propose a contextually rooted conceptual framework on endogenous innovation that could better inform socially transformative efforts and highlight some implications for medicinal innovation and astronomy beyond COVID-19. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the post-TRIPs behaviour of domestic and foreign pharmaceutical firms in respect of technology acquisition, knowledge transfer and domestic R&amp;D in India. It evaluates the prospects of development of capabilities by domestic firms in a scenario where they have also chosen to enter the markets for generics in developed countries and build relations of subcontracting with multinational corporations in the sphere of R&amp;D and production activities. It suggests that due to the introduction of strong IPRs, pharmaceutical multinationals are now advantageously placed to control knowledge diffusion and integrate the local capabilities of a country like India into their own myopic and narrowly benefiting innovation strategies. Evidence available from the experience of developing countries like India on the diffusion of knowledge contradicts the claim of TRIPs advocates that its adverse effect on prices of patented medicines would be adequately compensated by the benefits of technology transfer and domestic R&amp;D. The domestic industry is told to utilise emerging market opportunities for contract manufacture and R&amp;D in a selective way. The government is asked to intervene with the aim to make the domestic industry undertake technological activities that would allow the Indian pharmaceutical sector to upgrade itself for the benefit of development of therapies for the needs of Indian people in particular and developing countries in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The literature on the building up of technological capabilities in industrial latecomer firms has focused on analysing the gradual building of a minimum base of technological knowledge to be able to carry out innovative activities. The literature on strategic management focuses on maintaining, nurturing and renewing core capabilities/competencies by the most innovative firms. This paper argues that there is no simple linear progression from the early stage of accumulation of the minimum levels of innovative capability to the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and the deployment of core capabilities. On the contrary, the transition process is complex and while firms make that transition, they have to build deeper and broader stocks of knowledge and develop new types of knowledge management. This paper reviews those bodies of literature, discusses the lack of attention to the characteristics, problems and strategies of the building up of technological capabilities of large firms that compete close to, but still below, the technological frontier, particularly in the Latin American context, and proposes an analytical framework to analyse firms at this stage of accumulation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Technologies based on microelectronics have led to major changes in production, consumption and delivery of services in the past few decades. The essays in this volume examine the implications and impact of this in developing nations, particularly India. It is easy to hail technology as a new saviour or to dismiss it as a threat. Explanations based on technological determinism may offer easy answers to many questions, but when examined such answers will hardly be convincing. The relationship between technology and society is mediated by various factors and is too complex to be",

    "abstract": "’Brain drain’ or the international migration of educated and skilled professionals from relatively less developed to more developed countries has predominantly been viewed as a negative phenomenon. This unusual book takes a positive approach and explores how a developing nation losing its valuable human resources through brain drain can make the best of the situation. To this end, the author analyses the migration of knowledge workers from India to the USA over three decades and locates this phenomenon within the context of a civil society seeking to reconcile its loss of human capital with an expanding diaspora. Focusing primarily on the ’second generation effects’ of brain drain, Binod Khadria proposes various ways in which the exodus of talent can be turned to the home country’s advantage. Maintaining that the ’poverty of education’ and ’poverty of health’ are two important reasons for the loss of the potential productivity of human capital in India, the book argues for strengthening the nation’s capabilities in these areas in order to restore the productivity base of India’s vastly growing manpower. The author then explores the channels of investment through which expatriate participation in",

    "abstract": "Song Sang-yong is at Hallym University, 134-9 Kugi-dong, Chong-gu, Seoul 110-011, South Korea. THIS PRESENTATION AIMS at reviewing the evolution of science, technology and society (STS) studies in Korea and raising some tasks for the future. When Korea was liberated from the Japanese colonial rule of thirty-five years in 1945, there were less than fifty scientists trained at university level. By 1993, Korea had more than 15,000 S&T personnel (including M.A.’s and Ph.D.’s). Science and technology witnessed considerable growth, particularly from the 1960s, after the division of the country and the devastating Korean War. By the early 1990s, Korea had 106 National and Public Research Institutes; and 1500 research institutes in the private sector which accounts for more than 70 per cent of the total R&D expenditure. One estimate given by the Korean Institute of Science and Technology puts the figure of total S&T human resources in the industry sector around 38,600 personnel (including the 15000 S&T mentioned above). The categorical goal of Park Chung Hee regime was economic build-up which, in turn, was the raison d’être of science and technology. The first economic policy, modelled after Japan, was quite successful. After a generation, Korea could emerge as a promising economy in the developing world. Science and technology were nothing but a means for high economic growth. As is well known, the success",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Biopolis is the major life sciences investment by Singapore to become a global player in a new knowledge economy, as well as a promissory construction, a future-oriented emergent form of life constituted by and constitutive of a series of ethical plateaus or terrains of decision-making under entrepreneurial, policy and scientific conditions of risk and inadequate knowledge. Singapore’s Biopolis partakes in general cultural shifts towards biological and ecological sensibilities as responses to fears of pandemics, climate change, destruction of biodiversity, and toxicities produced by industrial agriculture and manufacturing. The issue is learning about biorepair mechanisms and creating new ecologies of knowledge involving not only interest in infectious or chronic diseases but also stem and iPS cells, cancers and regenerative medicine. Using the Genome Institute of Singapore’s first ten years as a partial focus, this article suggests metrics of success (beyond merely money, jobs, patents) which lie in three arenas: infectious diseases, cross-national science diplomacy and regenerative medicine. In October 2010, Biopolis underwent a sudden shift towards ‘industrial alignment’, raising ethical questions about the nature of future biologies, bioeconomies and bioecologies that have been spliced into the messenger RNA of different social networks and technical platforms of emergent twenty-first century biological sensibilities. </jats:p>",

Total of 25,566 records were retrieved from the SCI for 1999–2012. In terms of world share, India stood at seventh position. India contributed only 4.38 per cent of publications to world output during 1999–2012. The authorship study validates that now-a-days multiple authorship prevails in almost all fields especially science subjects. Therefore, Lotka law when applied in our study does not pass the test. The institutions involved in polymer science research in India are mostly government supported academic institutions. The presence of private research laboratories is negligible. The Indian scientists in polymer science are collaborating with international scientists mostly in terms of joint publications. Out of top 40 journals, there are 34 foreign journals and are mostly from USA and UK. The analysis of subject categories shows that the polymer science is a multi-disciplinary field. </jats:p>",

It argues that future employment will critically depend upon the completion of the privatisation process, as well as improved efficiency and market opportunity. Privatization in Rural Eastern Europe prescribes radical restructuring of the East European countryside and examines the future prospects for restitution and privatisation, from both national and regional perspectives. The economic and political history of Eastern Europe is examined in the context of the transition process. The discussion then develops with the extensive use of detailed country case studies, which analyse the growth of private economic activity in Albania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, in a clear and systematic way. The book offers careful consideration of the future of rural economy and emphasises the importance of rural diversification and the development of the service sector to create new employment opportunities in rural areas. The book will prove invaluable to academics with an interest in",

To this end, a brief description of the historical background of the scientific community in Argentina, its political-institutional context, and the successive migrational periods which have been produced in the country will be presented. Before discussing this particular case, three 'ideal types' which may be useful in understanding the different types of migration embarked upon by scientists will be described. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a developing economy perspective of 'knowledge-based development'. The observation is made that in order to avoid some of the negative consequences of globalisation, developing countries need policy instruments quite different from those that prevailed among developing countries through the 1980s and 1990s. The current development of science and technology policy in Mozambique is presented as an example of how national S&amp; T policies in developing economies might be redirected toward achieving this. The Mozambique case suggests a way forward for developing countries to adopt alternative S&amp;T policy approaches from those that have generally prevailed elsewhere. This is essentially an inclusive rather than exclusive approach to science and technology, and one that serves to bridge 'knowledge systems' rather than simply building links between scientific institutions and industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, the internationalisation of business R&amp;D has received much attention. Much less attention has been paid to another group of actors within national systems of innovation, namely, non-university research and technology organisations (RTOs). The article aims to conceptualise this highly diverse sector and to ascertain how its characteristics influence the internationalisation propensity of RTOs. The close relationship of RTOs with governments and their policies is seen as the most important aspect. The article presents the motives and strategies for R&amp;D internationalisation of both the business and academic sectors, which together feed into the strategic considerations of RTOs. In addition, it provides (secondary) empirical evidence of RTO internationalisation activities and enriches the empirical foundation by providing qualitative insights from interviews with five European RTOs with representative offices in China. The focus on China is justified by its high level of ambition, investment and recent achievements in science and technology, and the great amount of R&amp;D-related foreign direct investment in recent years. We conclude by drawing a tentative comparison of the internationalisation processes of enterprises and RTOs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous literatures about the relationship between social network and technological innovation performance were mostly from the perspective of network structure characteristics, while rarely considering the effect of composition of a firm’s social network on technical innovation. This paper provides models to examine the relationship between technological diversification and technological innovation performance, as well as the moderating effects of absorptive capability. Using survey data from a sample of 134 Chinese machinery and equipment manufacturing firms, the empirical results showed that there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between the technological diversification and technological innovation performance, indicating that technological diversification of network made the highest technological innovation performance. We also found that all three dimensions (identification &amp; acquisition, assimilation &amp; absorption and transformation &amp; exploitation) of absorptive capacity had significant positive effect on technological innovation performance, and the stronger the first two dimensions was, the higher value the technological innovation performance with technological diversification got. Enterprise managers were suggested to weigh the technological diversification and specialisation of the technological development in practice, as well as strengthen their absorptive ability that would reap the highest technological innovation performance. In sum, theoretical research was enriched about the relationship between technological diversification of social network analysis and technological innovation; on the other hand, guidelines for enterprise technology development in practice were provided. </jats:p>",

We highlight the collaborative dynamics in terms of ITRI’s (a) (co-) evolving knowledge capital, (b) strategic collaboration mode, (c) co-publication in scientific papers, (d) co-owned patents, (e) forward and backward citations and (f) science-based patents. Our systematic review of the role of ITRI in both catching-up and post catching-up phases will provide a useful guide for policy makers in other economies (such as Malaysia and Hong Kong) that aspire to define a similar role for their public research institutions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Neonatal Screening (NBS) is a mass screening, secondary prevention policy aimed at detecting one or several often congenital disorders in all neonates in a given country. The French CF NBS programme is completely functional since the middle of 2003. Drawing its inspiration from the socio-material approach, this article advances a description and analysis of the interactions between the biomedical technologies used in neonatal cystic fibrosis screening and the resulting changes in clinical practice, the bioethical debate and finally in the interstice between voluntary individual consent to screening and the management of a population’s health. The analysis grid focuses on four dimensions: institutional, techno-scientific, regulatory and socio-professional. Backed up by a field survey conducted in the specialised healthcare centres, this study explores two major aspects of the repercussions of NBS: first, the genesis and institutionalisation of this public policy and the impact of a more flexible form of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) and the sustained controversy on the neonatal screening programme uniting the community of cystic fibrosis paediatrics. This study suggests that institutional stability remains fragile and in this respect constitutes a paradoxical form of production with incompleteness and uncertainty as constituting factors. </jats:p>",

IN THE TRANSITION to the twenty-first century we witness such wanderings in the philosophical, social and political assessment of science as to seem wise to keep a certain distance from claims of transparency of meaning, unity or rationality in scientific programmes. Instead of grand syntheses of all natural knowledge, what prevails today is an admission of the underlying ontological complexity of the world, the disorder of things about which Dupre speaks (1993: 7). The book by Gibbons et al. (1994) shared this feeling of detachment and expressed, in a managerial idiom, a strong shift in the perception, understanding and handling of scientific and technical knowledge. Its aim was to highlight a change in the way knowledge is produced today across a wide range of scientific and technological scholarly activity. In so doing it touched briefly on some of the issues that have become important in recent debates of the sociology, history and philosophy of science. Its main target was the socio-cognitive organisation of disciplinary knowledge, which the authors called Mode 1 of",

To implement its so-called ‘Replacing Humans with Robots’ policy, which we see as an expression of the central government’s ‘Made in China 2025’ policy, the Dongguan government offers incentives to manufacturers’ region to automate their production lines with a range of assets including computer numerical control (CNC) machines and industrial robots. Applying Humphrey and Schmitz’s (Regional Studies 36[9]:1017–1027, 2002) taxonomy of industrial upgrading, our mixed-methods ethnographic and documentary research identified three types of upgrading at the factories we studied: process, product and functional upgrading. While our data draw on the perspectives of factory owners and managers, they bear important implications for workers. Future studies are needed to elaborate those implications. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes an emergent innovation ecosystem in the southern Indian state of Kerala. In contrast to a dominant national imagination of start-ups in India as spaces for the development of novel products with high economic potential, we suggest that start-ups in Kerala exhibit a tendency towards ‘social innovation’, that is, start-ups that are strongly oriented by the goal of addressing particular societal needs in addition to being successful on the market. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with start-up founders and other related stakeholders, as well as media and documentary analysis, we highlight in this essay key characteristics of social innovation in Kerala, including their reliance on tech-fix approaches. We also highlight the central role of the Kerala Start-up Mission (KSUM), a state-sponsored nodal agency, as a crucial enabler and shaper of the state’s innovation ecosystem. We further suggest that even as this innovation ecosystem is able to address important societal concerns, it nonetheless bypasses underlying social structures that produce them in the first place. Building on the work of sociologist Cornelius Schubert, we argue that it is analytically productive to interpret social innovation in Kerala as an instance of ‘disruptive maintenance’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "DURING A MAJOR part of the twentieth century most of the firms from developing countries were functioning under protectionist import substitution regimes. Emergence of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime and the environmental regulations adopted by the developed countries resulted in a paradigm shift in the international economic scene and virtually gave a jolt to the enterprises from the developing countries. The WTO regime prohibited the developing countries from using quantitative import restrictions to protect the domestic fi rms. The regime also forced the countries to drastically reduce the import tariff rates. It also prohibited the governments from favouring the domestic fi rms in the government purchase and contract as the member countries had to accord national treatment to all fi rms—both multinationals and domestic enterprises. Multinational enterprises entered the once protected domestic market with superior technology and marketing and managerial know-how. Furthermore, developed countries imposed strict environmental standards on the goods they imported. Intellectual property protection was enhanced and copying of technology was prohibited. Some of the fi rms were adversely affected by the change in the international trade and investment environment and some of them went out of business. However, some fi rms with stood the challenge and became successful global players. This special issue offers six different accounts, one from Vietnam and fi ve from India, about how enterprises, large and small, coped with the post-liberalisation, post-WTO global economic environment and the factors that helped the enterprises in improving productivity. Economic reforms in India started in 1991 with the policies which included opening for international trade and investment, deregulation, privatisation, tax reforms, etc. India has been a part of WTO from the very beginning.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although prior studies have broadly examined the external economic consequences of corporate green innovation (GI) strategies, whether and how GI strategies influence firms’ internal operations is underexplored. To fill this significant gap, we investigate the effect of GI initiatives on firm human capital structure, as represented by the ratio of salesmen (RSE) and accountants (RAE) to total employees. A higher RSE (RAE) plausibly indicates an enhanced position of salesmen (accountants) in human capital and greater importance that firms attach to their crucial role in improving marketing (reporting). Consistent with GI enhancing consumer purchase willingness, we find that GI lowers RSE. In line with GI reducing financing constraints and firms’ emphasis on high-quality financial reporting, we record that GI decreases RAE. Moreover, such inhibitory effects become stronger when stakeholders’ recognition of GI strategies grows, or when firms ex-ante rely more on marketing (reporting) functions of salesmen (accountants). </jats:p>",

The different positions on the role that it can play in the process reflect particular interpretations of the relationship between science, technology and society. We divide the arguments expressed in this discussion in two broad groups. One can be identified as the instrumental position, which emphasises the technical capacity of nanotechnologies to solve poverty problems and spur development. The other group of arguments can be identified as the contextual position by emphasising the social context wherein technology is produced, used and adapted. We summarise and analyse the main arguments in the debate on nanotechnologies, development and poverty. We consider the most influent opinions from organisations, institutions and meetings, presenting their main ideas in chronological order. The outline covers the period from 1997 to late 2007, and reviews the documents that most directly address the issue. Afterwards, we highlight and analyse the main issues at stake in this controversy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Historically, capitalism has been characterised by socio-spatial unevenness, and information capitalism is no exception. To that extent, it is relevant to ask who is served by ‘development’ projects in the information age? In the context of information and communication technology (ICT) deployments in development projects in particular, it is critical to ask: ICTs for whom? This article argues that the development of standards is an important factor in influencing who benefits from ICTs. While standards can deliver long-run aggregate benefits, the extent of benefits will depend on the trade-offs that standardisation entails. Since standards draw boundaries between those who conform and those who do not, there is a trade-off between aggregate benefits and the creation of individual winners and losers. There is another trade-off, between a narrow focus required for rationalising processes, and the need to retain wider context and diversity. In other words, the outcomes of the deployment of ICTs for development are shaped by these trade-offs and reflect the social contestation over the choice of standards. </jats:p>",

Although ‘cyber’ was the dominant term used in the 1990s and early 2000s, it has been largely replaced by the term ‘digital’ now that the internet has become much more pervasive, moving from desktops to devices that can be worn on the body and transported anywhere, allowing the user to be constantly connected to the internet. ‘Digital studies’ encapsulates the concerns previously addressed by social scientists in the 1990s and extends into this new era of mobile digital usage. It is a neat descriptive term that also encompasses other disciplines and their use of the term ‘digital’. ‘Digital studies’ focus on the way emails, mailing lists, digital forums, blogs, social networks or mobile applications change the way people work and live (Rainie & Wellman, 2012). Whether called the network society (Castells, 2009) or the connected revolution (Brown et al., 2002), the fusion of internet and multiple digital devices further expands the influence of these objects in our daily lives. The particular uses of those new devices have been documented so far by economists, historians, sociologists and a growing number of STS scholars are",

    "title": "Buying In, Edging Out: Perspectives on Contemporary Global Health Financing among Thailand’s Malaria Community",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The first signs of an unprecedented form of drug resistance, identified along the Thai–Cambodia border, have reawakened scientific interest in the discovery of new anti-malarial treatments. Innovation in malaria financing policy geared to promote wider access to effective and safe malaria drugs through coordinated investment practices of large global health donors has significantly contributed to invigorate international product research and development (R&amp;D). This article seeks to explore the elementary question of what the increment in global funding for malaria control and elimination has done, not for, but to the Thai malaria policy and research community. Drawing on ethnographic research, it first examines how public–private partnership arrangements in this bioscientific and biomedical field have helped close the product innovation cycle of a non-profit-based drug developer. Second, it asks in what ways the successful resolution of an earlier disjunction between drug safety and efficacy studies and drug discovery has impinged on the working relationships between two local communities of practice. I set out my notion of ‘disconnected connectivities’ to analyze this dynamic between the global and the local to elucidate how the global inclusivity that collaborative financing instruments and mechanisms provide spurs unanticipated forms of exclusion within the international malaria science enterprise. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research is about multinational enterprises and their subsidiaries abroad. The specific focus of the research is on the foreign subsidiaries’ local embeddedness, global integration and multinational networks. As these linkages vary among subsidiaries and across time, the focal interest of this study is the processes of subsidiary strategic evolution. On the basis of a longitudinal survey of subsidiaries in China, the results show that most subsidiaries in China start as a quiescent-type of firm, which is clearly a stepping stone towards other more strategic roles as quiescent subsidiaries move out of this category towards autonomous-type or confederate-type firms and eventually active-type subsidiaries. The most prevalent trajectory of strategic evolution by multinational subsidiaries in China is by increasing the liaisons in the multinational network before gaining more local embeddedness towards a more globally active role for the foreign subsidiary. This is in contrast to previous research which found strategic evolution towards the quiescent-type firm in more developed economies. It is suggested that this contradictory result is linked to the emerging economy status of China, which still allows for much strategic progress to be made by foreign affiliates. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Newborn screening (NBS) for inborn errors of metabolism and other serious conditions with onset during infancy is a widespread public health initiative. Like other screening programmes, it aims to discover and treat a disease before effects manifest themselves. Recently, there have been two prominent changes in NBS: a substantial increase in the number of conditions screened for and growing attention to secondary use of residual newborn blood spots. Here, we analyse how this latter change has transpired in Norway. </jats:p><jats:p> In 2018, Norway’s parliament sanctioned the secondary use of NBS samples for epidemiological research unrelated to NBS. This broadened the programme’s scope, co-opting it for research purposes, making samples available for inclusion in Norway’s biobanking strategy. We argue that this transformation is a case of function creep, whereby the function of screening samples is expanded to serve purposes other than helping newborns. The process provided only minimal involvement from ordinary citizens, but it transformed screened infants into potential scientific citizens. Henceforth, all future generations of Norwegians must choose to stay in or opt out of biobank research when they turn sixteen. Additionally, consenting to this research may occasion a second form of function creep, as ‘actionable findings’ are fed back to participants. </jats:p>",

With institutions disintegrated and their profession in ruins, researchers have been pushed into what became a free market for scientific work.

It shows that policies, strategies and struc tures of science and technology evolved under a planned development approach in both Korea and India. However, while Korea created a strong national innovation system and acquired phenomenal technological capabilities, India had vital links missing that weak ened the performance of this system and resulted in a poor R&amp;D performance of firms in the industrial sector. Four conditions need to be satisfied for building an effective national innovation system: (a) strong competitive pressures on domestic firms; (b) the presence of high-quality human capital; (c) well-developed industry-institutes-academia links; and (d) access to foreign technologies. While Korea tailored its policies to accommodate these conditions in each stage of its development, India failed to evolve an appropriate mix of these critical ingredients. The paper proposes to adopt a more focused but a multidimen sional integrated approach to create technological dynamism within the country. </jats:p>",

This study focused on the mechanism of impacting the patent value from the perspective of technological proximity and made an empirical analysis by using patent data and multiple ordinary least squares regression models. The results showed that the technological proximity network extracted from patent data significantly affected patent value through the centrality measurements of patent nodes in the proximity network.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Population screening for early-stage cancer or cancer precursors began in the mid-twentieth century, with the goal of reducing suffering from cancer illness and lengthening average life by preventing cancer deaths. Since the establishment of cancer screening, concerns have emerged that it may be doing considerable harm; despite this, screening practices have remained relatively intractable. This intractability in the face of harm is the central problematic of my analysis. I reinterpret a large study of breast, cervical and prostate cancer screening completed recently by our Australian research group, working across empirical bioethics, public health and social science. I suggest three reasons why cancer screening might persist as it does, and thus reach conclusions about what might be required to make cancer screening systems more responsive to the potential for harm. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Among the actors in the National Innovation System, Public Research Institutes (PRIs) are probably the least studied. Historically, PRIs played an important role in conducting research related to the Japanese government’s missions in defence, space exploration, health care, agriculture and industrial technology. PRIs that aimed to help industry played a significant role during the catch-up period before and after the second World War. However, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as Japanese firms acquired new technological capabilities and crossed technological frontiers with increasing financial resources, the firms’ reliance on PRIs as a source of advanced technology decreased. At present, discussions are underway regarding the role and rationale of PRIs in Japan’s innovation system. </jats:p><jats:p> In this article, we focus on three large PRIs in Japan—AIST, RIKEN and JAXA—and investigate their role in helping Japan’s industry by examining their patents. We briefly describe their background and history of development, which clarifies their distinctive role in Japan’s innovation systems. We use four measures drawn from patent data (technological value, exclusionary value, expected market value and knowledge spillover) to describe PRI performance. The difference between the PRIs’ patents and those of universities and firms, as well as the impact of the PRIs’ research collaboration with the private sector is analysed. We found that each of the three PRIs has its own identity and is fulfilling its specific role. In addition, we pinpoint problems concerning universities’ patenting activity. Finally, we discuss factors that might affect the research outcome. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks into dynamics of open social enterprises. We used several research methods—literature review, content analysis and case studies through intensive interviews via semi-structured questionnaire. First, we developed a research framework, expressed as the social open innovation dynamics model through literature reviews on social economy, sharing economy, collaborative innovation, open innovation and social enterprise. Second, we applied the model to ten Korean social enterprises and determined the success factors of social open innovation, as well as the concrete dynamics behind it. Main finding of this research are as follows. The success of social enterprises depends on the extent to which they strive to move towards open innovation. Adopting open innovation strategies seem to be a fruitful pathway for social enterprises to progress and grow in their operations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Synthetic biology, according to some definitions, is the attempt to make biology into an engineering discipline. I ask what is meant by this objective, which seems to have excited and energised many people and encouraged them to start working in the field. I show how synthetic biologists make a point of distinguishing their work from previous genetic ‘engineering’, which is described as bespoke and artisan. I examine synthetic biologists’ accounts of the differences between biology and engineering, which often oppose comprehension to construction. I argue that synthetic biology, like other branches of engineering, aims to meet recognised needs, and to make the world more manipulable and controllable. But there are tensions within the field—some synthetic biologists have reservations about the extent to which biology can be engineered, and ask whether it is necessary to develop a new type of engineering when working with living systems. After exploring these debates, I turn to some of the broader consequences of making biology easier to engineer, particularly the deskilling and democratisation of the technology. I end by arguing that because synthetic biologists are skilled at bringing together both technical and social forces, they are appropriately described as ‘heterogeneous engineers’. </jats:p>",

The visitors told me that there were three Western philosophers of science whose works were familiar to them in China: Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and my friend and colleague from Sydney University, Alan Chalmers. We have always been rather tickled by this anecdote in Australia. The reason why Chalmers was a member of this exalted trinity was, of course, that he had written an extremely successful philosophy of science textbook: What ls This Thing Called Science?

This article focuses particularly on the divergent ways in which the notion of ‘uncertainty’ is understood by scientists and scientific bodies engaged in studying the effects of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, and by the residents who are the main victims of these disasters. I argue that the approach to uncertainty and risk assessment developed by bodies like UNSCEAR and the Chernobyl Forum has been applied in Fukushima in ways that have widened the gap in understanding between academic scientists and local residents, but I also point to experiments in citizen science that have potential to help bridge this gap. </jats:p>",

These SMEs account for the largest chunk of industrial units and employment in the national economy. Yet, most of them are competing with deeply inadequate resources, especially by means of weak technological capabilities. The present study has provided not only preliminary estimates on SME R&amp;D investments in Indian manufacturing and their broad trends and patterns, but also contributed to the understanding of factors driving the SME in-house R&amp;D activities. It shows that Indian SMEs continue to be vulnerable among all firmas they have the lowest incidence of doing in-house R&amp;D and their R&amp;D intensitieshave fallen in the last decade. Based on the results from three-step Censored Quantile Regression, this study has suggested a set of useful policy implications for enhancing SME R&amp;D. </jats:p>",

I deem it a great honour and would like to take this opportunity to dwell upon the relevance of social history of Science, Technology and Medicine (STM) for our region and culture. What I propose to present here is not a new research piece but a collage of existing researches on the theme interspersed with some key questions and observations. This synoptic survey is dedicated to the memory of Professor P.S. Gupta, our past President and a teacher whose erudition and simplicity inspired. Science as a rational exercise is intrinsic to human nature, so has been man's fascination for tools as homo faber. Indian society, through the ages, has been no exception to this. Centuries ago Said-al-Andalusi (1029-70) in his Tabaqat-al-Uman (probably the first work on history of science in any language) referred to India as the first nation which cultivated the sciences.1 In ancient India, medical men inspite of their scripture-orientation, insisted on the supreme importance of direct observation of natural phenomena and on the technique of a rational processing of the empirical data. The Carak Samhita, an ancient medical text, says, \"To one who understands, knowledge of nature and love of humanity are not two things but one.\"2 Nothing could illustrate better the links between science and society. In relatively recent times the relevance of science for the society was not lost either on the colonizers or the colonized. In its very first",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the last two decades, numerous policy actors have advocated multiple models for the diffusion of solar energy-based technologies in India. In recent years, the social development-based energy business model was promoted by some NGOs, civil society groups and academicians for reaching the poor for meeting their energy needs. Using a case study approach, this article explores the social shaping of a solar micro-grid established in rural Bihar through the hybrid model of environmental governance. The article employs the social shaping of technology framework to explain the top-down and bottom-up interpretations of the solar micro-grid in rural India. By focusing on the idea of citizens and consumers, it explains the influence of the wider socio-political context in closing down the debate and stabilising the choices. The article illustrates the implications of the narrow framing of the socio-technical ensemble by the NGO’s and civil society groups (top-down perspective) on the diffusion potential of the solar micro-grid. The bottom-up perspective adds more layer to the interpretation of the socio-technical ensemble. An integrated, comprehensive understanding based on both the top-down and bottom-up perspective would help in developing a responsible research and innovation paradigm. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article examines the development of advanced digital manufacturing (as outlined in the ‘Made-in-China 2025’ government plan) from the perspective of the changing socio-technical paradigms of production. The analysis focuses on the transformations of value chains and work, based on theories of social shaping of technology, regulation theory and regimes of production. Analytically, the author proposes to distinguish between ‘production-driven’ and ‘distribution-driven’ pathways of manufacturing digitalisation. The transformation of semi-rural industrial areas (‘Taobao villages’, named after China’s largest e-commerce platform Taobao) into mass production clusters for e-commerce is depicted as a paradigmatic model of distribution-driven transformation and as a characteristic Chinese strategy in this field. The article examines the impact on industry supply chains and work, leading to ever-more precarious conditions of employment. Policy recommendations focus on local strategies to stabilise supply chain structures and working conditions, as an alternative to the present top-down approaches to manufacturing modernisation in China. </jats:p>",

Foreign funding modalities have changed during the last twenty years and this may lead to greater national ownership in the future. Although foreign funding will be necessary to sustain the survival of the Tanzanian scientific community in the near future, it is argued that the government should increase its support to S&amp;T activities to ensure a needed revival. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> More than half of Chinese high-technology firms are led by top executives (chairman and CEO) with R&amp;D background. This study investigates whether and how top executives’ R&amp;D background affects corporate innovation outcomes using a sample of listed firms in the high-technology industries in China. We find that the R&amp;D background of top executives is positively related to innovation outcomes. We also find evidence on the mediating effect of R&amp;D expenditure and moderating effect of corporate risk-taking on the above relationship. Our baseline results are robust to tests that address concerns caused by potential unobservable characteristics, reverse causality and other issues. Findings of our study have important implications for firms that aim to enhance their innovation outcomes and countries regarding their research policymaking and R&amp;D management. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> India was perhaps the only country among the developing world with a colonial past to have organised and established national science community much before it attained its independence. Nehruvian science and technology (S&amp;T) policy in India’s formative years left a distinct imprint in the post-colonial and post-independent India. With a huge population of nearly 1.35 billion people, India is not dependent on food on outside countries since the 1960s. Green and White Revolutions have made immense contribution to develop scientific and technical capacities in agriculture. India’s innovation system, including higher education, has given her some comparative advantage through ‘human capital’ in information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, space research and so on. In export promotion and economic competitiveness in technology-based industries, we lag compared with East Asian ‘Dragons’. India’s informal sector poses a formidable challenge with more than 95% of the total labour force, about 550 million, 90% of which is 8th class dropouts. When we begin to assess our national innovation system, one feature that stands out to research observers is few islands of excellence and vast ‘hinterlands’ of underdeveloped research potential. There is clearly a gap between theory and practice of science policy in India. Our gross expenditure on research and development as a proportion of gross domestic product remained relatively stagnant and, in fact, receded from 0.8% in the 1990s to 0.7% in 2020. In this period, our neighbour, China, left us far behind in S&amp;T for development. </jats:p>",

Based on an integrated social network and absorptive capacity perspective, this article proposes a conceptual model in which the local firm’s strategic flexibility is affected by its position in global production network and its internal absorptive capacity. Using a sample of 276 local manufacturers located in the Yangtze River Delta, China, the roles of social networks and absorptive capacity in strategic flexibility are identified, and the results indicate that by occupying a central and strong-tie-abundant network position, local firms can gain more resource flexibility; and absorptive capacity possessed by a local firm plays an active role in coordination flexibility. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How to reduce carbon emissions is a critical problem in the world, especially when the emerging economy grows and technology breakthrough happens frequently. In this study, we systematically evaluate China’s digital economy based on regional data experience and construct a nonlinear dynamic threshold model to incorporate a heterogeneous threshold of green technology innovation into the influential mechanism to figure out whether the digital economy can effectively reduce regional carbon emissions. According to the results, China’s digital economy currently shows a trend of overall upward and local fluctuation and there is a large ‘gap’ between the rich and poor. Interestingly, green technology innovation has a heterogeneous threshold effect between the digital economy and carbon emissions: a lesser level of green technology innovation promotes the carbon emission impact of the digital economy to a certain extent, but when green technology innovation rises and exceeds a threshold, the digital economy can dramatically inhibit regional carbon emissions. This study answers the question of how to use the threshold effect of green technology innovation to reduce carbon emissions in the digital economy, which has significant theoretical and practical value to reduce carbon emissions in developing countries. </jats:p>",

Converging the NIS and ecosystem perspectives—at sectoral levels—is found to be germane for STV emergence. The sectoral systems of innovation (SSI) perspective is then advanced to emphasise how the integration of NIS and ecosystem approaches has enabled a thriving STV landscape in India. The case of biotech sector is discussed to illustrate the integration. Based on this analysis, the study advocates policy intervention at the sectoral level, and a thrust on firm-centric innovation as a complement to investments in fundamental research, to unleash a wave of STVs in the country. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Effect of Technology and Market Dynamism on the Business Performances of SMEs by Supporting Services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research objective of our study is to find the effect of technology and market dynamism on the business performances by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) supporting services. Technology and market dynamism have been introduced as moderating variables, utilisation degree of information provided by SME supporting services was selected as an independent variable and contribution degree to SME business performances such as revenue, export, employment and so on were selected as dependent variables. Structural equation modeling was established to analyse moderating and mediating effects on SME business performances by SME supporting services using Smart PLS programme. The SME supporting services had a direct effect on SME business performances and also indirectly influenced SME business performances via contribution degree to decision-making of SME executives. Technology and market dynamism significantly moderated the effect of decision-making of SME executives on SME business performances. It could be seen that technology and market dynamism had a mediated-moderating effect on SME business performances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Crowdsourcing firms, their client firms and the government in Japan have advocated that crowd work provides opportunities for workers to enjoy autonomous working practices, enabling subpopulations such as women and the elderly who would otherwise be excluded from the labour market to find employment. This is far from the case. Instead, crowdsourcing is perhaps better considered a means, enabled by technological advances, by which to flexibilise the labour market. We have been witnessing a shift in the forms of domination and control imposed on labour from a direct, physical and onsite type of control to an indirect mechanism of domination that has rendered workers less visible while suppressing wages. This further implies that the paradoxical autonomy of crowd work is embedded in contemporary antagonism in Japanese employment relations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> e-Waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams globally. In the South African context e-Waste is receiving considerable attention from the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) who view it as being one of the fastest growing and most complex waste streams. There is recognition that e-Waste provides both threats and opportunities. In terms of the latter, e-Waste if well-managed can address the triple challenges of job creation, poverty and inequality as well as promote environmental sustainability that aligns to the South African government’s mandate to protect the rights of all its citizens to an environment that is not harmful to health and well-being. The article presents and discusses primary data collected from a survey-based and case study research (including key informant interviews) with representatives from various government departments and agencies. The findings reveal that there are substantial variations within the government sector in terms of who is responsible for e-Waste, the amount of e-Waste generated, policies and procedures that are in place, and how e-Waste is managed. The results show that government departments and agencies have stockpiles of e-Waste and there is substantial storing/hoarding of e-Waste throughout the country. Furthermore, current practices of managing e-Waste are unsustainable and undesirable. Based on the findings and literature review undertaken which includes an overview of the e-Waste challenge and trends globally and in South Africa specifically, a model for the management of e-Waste in the government sector that drives broader economic revitalisation and sustainability imperatives is proposed that embraces a regional approach. </jats:p>",

Quantile regression is more powerful than classical linear regression since quantile regression can produce estimates for all conditional quantiles of the distribution of the innovation activities variable, whereas classical linear regression only estimates the conditional mean effects. The empirical evidence shows that the effect of foreign competition on make innovation activities is different across the conditional quantiles of the distribution of innovation activities, something classical linear regression would leave unidentified. This finding suggests that estimating the quantile effect of innovation activities variable can well be more insightful than effect. Additionally, this article finds a U-shaped relationship between foreign competition and make innovation activities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Services sector in India showed a remarkable resilience to global economic crisis and grew at a rate of 9.3 per cent explaining around 88 per cent of the growth rate in real GDP of India in 2008–09. Exportsof software services helped considerably in providing the necessary resilience. The main objective of the paper is to examine the role of external demand and productivity growth in exports of software services. Global income elasticity of demand for export of software services is estimated for the period 1970–2008. Sources of total factor productivity growth in Indian IT services firms are identified using Data Envelopment Analysis for the period 1994–95 to 2007–08. It is found that high income demand elasticity for India–s software services has contributed substantially to its growth. But more importantly, there has been a steep rise in productivity growth in the post-2000 period which is attributable mainly to technological innovation. </jats:p>",

It argues that the recent regional turn in development studies should be welcomed as regions play an increasingly important role for high-tech industries in developed and developing countries. While acknowledging the insights stemming from the regional turn the article nevertheless argues the need to extent the theoretical perspectives and to apply a regional innovation systems (RIS) approach. RIS has its strength in theoretically linking regions and high-tech industries. This article contextualises RIS to the situations characterising developing countries. Special attention is paid to how regions in developing countries can engage in a strategic coupling with high-tech TNCs. The importance of RIS as an analytical approach and tool for policy prescription is illustrated by two Asian high-tech cases, namely Bangalore's IT RIS in India and Shanghai's high-tech RIS in China. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1970, an observer of the investment by the consumer electronics multinationals in Mexico and Taiwan could not have predicted the marked difference in the develop ment of these two nations. The contrast between the Mexican and Taiwanese elec tronics industry could not be more striking—Taiwan's electronics industry was a result of expanding foreign direct investment. Taiwan experienced an expansion of foreign exchange, employment and development of assembler-supplier relations. But, most importantly, it developed local firms capable of supplying these foreign assemblers. Among the Latin American nations, Mexico received the preponderance of investment in consumer electronics. Unlike in Taiwan, investments in Mexico never led to the development of an indigenous industry nor created a synergy between the assemblers and the local suppliers. This paper explores the reasons for the divergence between the two economies, related to the investor's objectives, the investor's position in the international market, and the specific regional location of production chosen for each nationllocality. A complete and historically accurate understanding of the divergence between these two countries can be obtained by examining firm and general industry strategies regarding production and production location between 1965 and 1982. This permits a nuanced understanding of the complexities of local industrial development and the potential role of the foreign investor and, in the process, move beyond simplified arguments about the centrality of the state industrical development. </jats:p>",

For example, the clues and suggestions to approach relations between different areas of the world, such as Asia and America, in the field of health. It is well known that the cholera epidemic of the 1830s experienced by several American countries was a consequence of the disease leaving its natural habitat in India round 1817, but it is less known how Chaulmoogra oil, a therapeutical medicine traditionally used in India to fight lepra, spread in Latin America during the nineteenth century and was used in Colombia since at least 1881, as shown by Diana Obregon (p. 176). Above all, this book is useful in the defence of everyone’s right to health, and in illustrating the duty to promote health for all.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The main question to be discussed in this article is: Why do women not program? In other words, why, in an activity that appears similar to others where women have gained ground, one cannot find an analogous process of incorporation? We propose a scheme of five related factors in order to analyse the genealogy of women’s exclusion from the world of software. First, we discuss the relation between gender and technologies in general, focusing on the initial stages of socialisation. Second, we fast forward a few years in the lives of boys and girls and we analyse their first interaction with digital technologies. Next, in relation to puberty or adolescence, we inquire into peer-group dynamics which are established by those who dedicate much of their time to computers. Fourth, we take into account the gender gap in college or bachelor degrees related to informatics. Lastly, we analyse the common representations of and beliefs about gender that employers hold in relation to informatics workers. These five parts of the explanation have different foundations. Some rely strongly on our qualitative fieldwork in Buenos Aires; others are based on texts or statistics which belong to other authors. </jats:p>",

The findings illustrate that different sectoral systems of innovation and production evolve differently. The direction and the pace of evolution depends very much on existing absorptive capabilities of agents, strength of their linkages, and their process of collective learning to withstand the threats and exploit opportunities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Derek Hook’s A Critical Psychology of the Postcolonial: The Mind of Apartheid feels as if it is written with a concentrated passion, a compulsion to understand the racism of Apartheid, the persistent grip of its ‘bigoted social logic’ (p. 8), and the way that racism is at the same time a quintessentially subjective and a quintessentially structural social relation. The concentration and passion of the book’s engagement with these questions is evident in the force and clarity with which Hook extends the work of key postcolonial and psychoanalytic theorists to develop a complex account of the ‘libidinal economy’ of racist discourse. His conceptualization of the libidinal economy offers two levels of insight. First, it constitutes a close mapping of the psychopolitical constitution of colonial subjectivities, developed through a precise exposition and critique of the work of Fanon, Biko, Coetzee, Bhaba and Manganyi, alongside Kristeva, Zizek, Freud and Lacan. Hook traces, for example, the relation between Kristeva’s conception of the abject and Manganyi’s account of the allocation of ‘crass corporeality’ (p. 207) within racist culture; and between Freud’s account of the fetish and Bhaba’s theorization of racial stereotype. This dense rearticulation of colonial relations is supported through analysis of a range of empirical sources, including two rich narrative accounts from the Apartheid Archive Project that Hook returns to in each chapter, to illustrate the productivity of different conceptual perspectives. At the same time the book develops a broader argument about the inherent antagonism between different levels of analysis: the way an essentializing focus on subjective experience comes to be set against types of structural analysis that elide or disrupt the coherence of the individualized subject. This aspect of Hook’s argument is framed in the Lacanian vocabulary of the imaginary and the symbolic:",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although critical of contemporary capitalism, and the injustices and asymmetries derived from it, current conceptualisations of ‘surveillance capitalism’ have been developed from within the Global North, paying little attention to the effects and ramifications of this new phase of capitalism for the global periphery. This text looks at this phenomenon from the Global South, emphasising the concept not as a territorial marker but contingent on social relations, intersecting ethnic, nationality and social class markers. Its objective is to explore the applications of automated facial recognition systems in Brazil, discussing how they reinforce a disciplinary logic of social subordination and diversify forms of symbolic violence. In this context, from the perspective of digital colonialism, we aim to highlight how the operation of such systems in the Global South contests and challenges the idea of soft instrumentarian control. It analyses the manifestations of surveillance capitalism in the Global South as enablers of digital colonialism, where disciplinary and violent social effects are fostered. It describes the functioning of AFR and its extensive relationship with colonial practices. To deepen our discussion, we will briefly focus on the application in public security and schools in Brazil, describing its controversies and disciplinary logic. Furthermore, it addresses the problematisation of instrumentarian power through post-colonial and digital colonialism approaches, arguing that the effects of deploying digital technologies globally are not restricted to data plundering but also foster complex social effects, such as dependency and violence. </jats:p>",

The findings from a survey of 144 biotechnology firms indicate that diverse R&amp;D alliances have a positive effect on firms’ innovation performance, and these effects are moderated by environmental factors and alliance network position. The overall R&amp;D alliance network was also examined to understand a broad variety of collaboration patterns of emerging biotechnology firms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> On the basis of an analysis of the creation of an Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), our contribution addresses the progressive stabilisation of an institutional design for assessing Nature. Social science literature has widely promoted norms of transparency, openness and participation regarding the implementation of new forms of environmental governance. But so far, few researchers have focused on the way this disclosure model now concretely weighs down on real institutions and institutionalisation processes. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the way this requirement can combine with other requirements or older models of action. In the case of IPBES, our goal is to question how the requirements of participation and transparency are put into practice. We will highlight the role of UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) in the institutionalisation process of IPBES and see how the disclosure model is combined with other requirements that simultaneously involve the re-creation of ‘enclosure’ (that is, the need for academic sound–science, or the usual way in which things are done at UNEP—that is, bureaucratic practices). Our work is based on an empirical study including documentation analysis (official reports available on websites) and interviews. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> India has the necessary potential to become a global leader in the knowledge economy. However, this cannot be achieved without the universities playing a prominent and leading role. Globally, higher education is poised to become more responsive to societal needs. Although many developments have taken place in the Indian higher education system, it still has to come to terms with modern society. The university outreach programme concept is fast picking up globally, and many universities use it for community development and building relationships with industries. In offering outreach programmes for community or for industries, we should go beyond merely providing some relevant courses. Some examples of universities where the relationship with society or industries has moved on from just offering distance education courses are given in this article. We need to find ways to use the ‘whole’ university, incorporating the various recent developments and meeting the requirements of various stakeholders of higher education. It is shown that university outreach is one of the best strategies where we can include various concepts like open distance learning, online learning, virtual universities, corporate universities, and so on, which have taken place in recent years. Universities, both traditional and distance education institutes, should move beyond their traditional boundaries to become more flexible and incorporate the new innovations that help in creating a knowledge society. </jats:p>",

TÜBİTAK is responsible for promoting, developing, organising, conducting and coordinating research and development activities in line with national targets and priorities. The salient features of the R&D (Research and Development) strategy are to foster an R&D culture in Turkey and increase co-operation and joint projects between public and private sector industry, research institutes and universities. The strategy to collaborate is adopted to complement and accelerate the research and development efforts. Moreover, there is an increasing emphasis on developing the Research and Development capabilities of the local industry so that an R&D culture prevails in the country. The Turkish government desired to have expertise to indigenously develop new products so that the country becomes self-sufficient and foreign dependence on imports of advanced technologies is reduced.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper contributes to the under-researched domain of standard setting for bottled water quality in India. The paper opens-up the ‘black box’ of regulation-making by analysing the mandatory bottled water quality standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The regulation-making exercise is dominated by bureaucrats and technocrats representing government departments, publicly funded institutions and representatives of big industries. In the standard-setting committees, representation of NGOs, small firms, technology suppliers, independent experts, consumers and citizens are either missing or limited. The kind of experts enrolled by the technical committee and the practice and principles employed by BIS for decision-making have a strong bearing on the regulatory standards. The standard setting for bottled water was the outcome of a complex process that was significantly shaped by the views and values of the dominant regulatory actors, especially what was perceived as valid and superior ‘regulatory knowledge’. Discrete actors, such as bureaucrats, technocrats, big firms and NGOs, supported the wider adoption of international standards, but they had different rationales for advocating the adoption. However, the uncritical adoption of international standards has resulted in a disregard for incorporating environmental, epidemiological, dietary and diverse socio-economic factors into setting standards. Inclusion of socio-economic and other contextual factors could increase the validity and effectiveness of regulatory standards. </jats:p>",

    "title": "New Asian Challenges",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Asian agriculture is faced with major new challenges as a result of globalisation, urbanisation and environmental problems such as climate change. To meet these challenges, Asian agriculture needs to become more knowledge intensive and innovation oriented. This article frames the new Asian challenge in terms of innovation theory, emphasising the importance of the co-evolution of technological and institutional change and linkages between actors in open, interactive innovation processes. It studies the performance of agricultural research and technology organisations (RTOs) in four small and medium-sized South and Southeast Asian economies: Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam. A key performance issue is the linkages between actors, which is a key weakness in the agricultural innovation systems of most Asian countries. The need for effective linkages is growing as agricultural production and innovation are becoming increasingly complex due to the impact of the consecutive green, sustainability, biotechnology and supermarket revolutions. Linkages are in short supply, but the demand for them is exploding. As a consequence, traditional public agricultural research organisations in Asia, created at the time of the green revolution, no longer play a central role in agricultural innovation as they did when countries faced only one challenge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In June 2023, the Nishan Dialogue on Digital Civilisation of the World Internet Conference was held in China. At this conference, China proposed for the first time, in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), to build a digital world of exchange, mutual appreciation and tolerance, hoping to gather the wisdom of the internet community and seek the governance of digital civilisation. In recent years, with the rapid development and wide recognition of AI technology, how to solve the AI ethical issues generally faced by the international community has become the focus of attention. By analysing the current status of AI ethics and governance in the United States and the European Union, and comparing it with China’s development in recent years, this article further advances the exploration of Chinese solutions to the global ethical governance of AI. On this basis, it responds positively to the call of the United Nations and international organisations to explore solutions to the four main realities of: (a) phenomenon of alienation of labour competition brought about by AI technology; (b) infringement of the subject’s personal privacy and impact on the ethics of responsibility for awareness and undermining of social fairness; (c) justice to seek a path of avoidance for collaborative governance from government supervision, public constraints, technology; and (d) sound mechanisms, which can actively promote global AI ethics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyses recent changes in the agricultural technology trends at the current pace of its convergence with information technology (IT) using South Korean agricultural patent data from 2000 to 2015. This article focuses on the structural changes in agricultural technology in terms of patent applications by specific technology sector between the two periods: Period 1 (2000–2007) and Period 2 (2008–2015). Accordingly, we performed centrality analysis to measure the importance of each agricultural technology based on International Patent Classification (IPC) sub-classes. We also conducted citation analysis to identify whether the proportion of backward and forward citations of agricultural patents had significantly changed between the two periods. The results of the centrality analysis suggest that, whereas food technology was the most important technology sector in agriculture during both the periods, agricultural production technology experienced a considerable increase in its share in agriculture in Period 2. The results of the citation analysis confirm a substantial degree of interconnectivity between agricultural technology and non-agricultural technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a puzzling uncertainty about the real size of gas reserves in Bangladesh. Different institutions and companies provide widely differing estimates. No authority is able to verify the actual reserves. Nevertheless, most evidence shows that the country has vast natural gas reserves, exceeding the present domestic demand. This raises a question: should Bangladesh export some of its gas? Obviously, the export of natural gas will generate revenues for the country to balance its trade, and for investment in many other sectors. It will enable the government to implement social and cultural reforms and development programmes in primary education, poverty reduction, health and infrastructure. However, exporting natural gas in a developing country like Bangladesh is not an easy matter. The public is divided into two camps: those who are in favour and those who are against it. Following a brief history of Bangladeshi gas exploration, this article looks at its natural gas export potential and geology education associated with natural gas exploration. It discusses gas exploration by several national and international companies, and how they became a conduct for the transfer of technology and innovations. It also looks at the idea and plans for a pipeline to India to carry Bangladeshi gas. Finally, it concludes that there is an urgent for radical reforms in the Bangladeshi gas industry and institutions from exploration to marketing. </jats:p>",

The impetus for this change has been the funding decisions of governments. As a result, science has been 'captured' by the private sector and, consequently, public trust in and understanding of science has diminished. These argumenis are explored by setting out the two models and then explaining the process of change by reference to universities as examples. The paper then presents two case studies, one of genetically modified organisms and the other on mobile phone safety, to illustrate the breakdown in public understanding and acceptance of science. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the first twenty years after independence, scientific research in Algeria was largely displaced in favour of teaching and training. From the beginning, there arose a conflict between scientific research and political independence that was tied to the tensions generated by two sets of forces: professionalisation autonomy on the one hand, and institutionalisation control on the other. The process of professionalisation leads to greater independence for researchers, which comes into conflict with the exercise of government control over the process of institutionalisation. It drifted down to an incessant political and administrative impediment to the aspirations of scientific researchers for professional autonomy. This situation influenced the conditions under which the scientific community emerges and consolidates itself in its relationship with the state in Algeria. The relationship between the scientific and political worlds comprises the nolitical backdrop of the problems that this paper will attempt to unfold. </jats:p>",

In this situation, it is very timely to investigate the antecedent factors for the performance enhancement of technology startups that can play a big role in driving economic growth. We investigate the effect of entrepreneurial orientation and technology acquisition on the financial and non-financial performance of technology startups. In order to achieve these research goals, we collected data from 121 Korean technology startups to examine the effects. Our results support that both entrepreneurial orientation and technology acquisition improve the performance (financial and non-financial) of technology startups. In addition, the entrepreneurial orientation of technology startups has a significant indirect effect on performance (financial and non-financial) through technology acquisition. Overall, our study contributes to improving the understanding of the antecedent factors for the achievement of the performance of technology startups in the field of entrepreneurship research by presenting a new research model of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation, technology acquisition and the performance of technology startups. In addition, this study provides the basis for the need for technology acquisition support policies for technology startup support institutions to nurture technology startups. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Natural resource management (NRM) organisations in Australia are increasingly recognising the need for complement studies of biophysical condition of the environment with studies of social condition, such as values, understanding, and participation related to the environment. Relevant and reliable social indicators that can be scaled and measured on a regular basis are essential to meet this need. In this study, we identified four indicators to test the social condition of the public in the State of Victoria in Australia with regard to river health. These indicators were river use, river knowledge and literacy, values and aspirations, and river health behaviours. </jats:p><jats:p> We tested the four indicators through telephone and web-based surveys with over 1000 people in three areas of Victoria. We analysed the survey data statistically and gathered baseline data on the social condition of river health in the three regions. We made recommendations for how this data could be interpreted and used in community engagement and science communication programmes about river health. We also examined the limitations of the methodology and recommended modifications to the survey design and application for an anticipated roll-out of the survey across the entire State of Victoria. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) will use this survey instrument to test social indicators on a regular basis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> University-enterprise (U-E) innovation chain fractures hinder the commercialisation of knowledge. However, few contributions in the academic field have uncovered how certain mechanisms repair U-E innovation fractures and commercialise their research results. In order to bridge the research gap in the repair mechanism of U-E innovation chain fractures, a multiple-case study of U-E innovation fractures was conducted by proposing a ‘behaviour-process-outcomes’ repair model. The results are as follows: motivation coordination mechanism is the driving force that converges the goals of different organisations; organisation coordination mechanism is the platform that provides the basic support for the weak links and makes up for the defects of a single organisation; capability development and coordination is the element of U-E cooperation through a combination of basic and applied research capability, technological innovation capability and product commercialisation capability; policy coordination mechanism is the vehicle of U-E innovation chain that strengthens U-E cooperation with various preferential policies. The conclusion shows the ‘coordinated innovation’ repair model for U-E innovation chain fractures provides important insights for practitioners and policymakers involved in developing an innovation chain in U-E cooperation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "development in arid regions has been a mixed blessing for farmers in the long history of humankind, especially with canal irrigation in arid tracts. The source of the trouble has been the gradual build up of soil salinity, leading to reduction in crop yields in the beginning and to eventual abandonment of crop farming altogether. That is why people with a sense of history question the wisdom of introducing canal irrigation in desert like areas. Even truly knowledgeable irrigation engineers have shared this concern because they know how waterlogging-salinity problem has been a bugbear of irrigation canal builders in all ages. Planning for Sustainability in Irrigation is an attempt to deal with problems of waterlogging-salinity within the mega canal project of western Rajasthan, namely, the Indira Gandhi Canal Project (IGNP), formerly known as the Rajasthan Canal Project. Therefore, it is likely to be read with avid interest by many concerned readers both in India and abroad.",

    "title": "Productive Inertia and Technical Change",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> How can we evaluate the direction and dynamics of technical change? Indicators or analyses are often based on the immediate causes such as innovation, investment in R&amp;D, or on the anticipated effects such as improved competitiveness and creation of new products. Anxious to demonstrate the economic or social benefits, the forecast ing impact is often reduced to risky comparisons between these two sets of data. This recording of change takes into account only the immediate situation, that is, the short-term. But technical change is first and foremost the product of the long history of societies. The recording of variations, the introduction of variables considered as exogenous, even if it facilitates the introduction of rationality into the choice which presides over change, in no way enables us to understand its origins and the evolution. </jats:p><jats:p> It is essential that we restore the dimension of time to technical change and to consider it as the product of contradictory forces. In this paper it is proposed that the relationship between changes and non-changes in techniques includes the idea of inertia. Although changes are manifest and justify the analyses which have been devoted to them, non-changes have rarely been taken into consideration. The role of inertia appears even more clearly when the rate of growth slows down, as social values are called into question, as price or regulatory systems are transformed. These considerations have an impact on the formulation of technological policies. They permit a redefinition of industrial innovation strategies in a context which should permit their social and economic insertion. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A strong social and technical divide is particularly visible in the predominant understanding of technological innovation in modern societies. The field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) aims to overcome this divide, by focusing on the continuously entwined relationships between the social and the technical, that is, sociotechnical combinations. In this article, we argue that while it is reasonable to state that the social and the technical are entangled, it should be acknowledged that some issues are dealt with solutions that are more technical than others. A technical problematisation (the definition of an issue as a problem that is treated via a technical solution) is different to a social problematisation (the definition of an issue as a problem that is treated via a social solution) of the same issue. Our discussion is built upon examples from nuclear waste management, where the social–technical divide has been strong. However, more recently there has been a push for more democracy in technical decision making in this area, with much experimentation on public participation taking place. The only way these activities will successfully support such a democratising process is for them to be integrated into a renewed and explicitly acknowledged technical problematisation of proposed solutions. </jats:p>",

This book, and the work that could be done to follow it, should inspire research on innovation in India and other countries. This is work that perfectly combines two apparently served discourses-the applied and the fundamental. India, like other countries, suffers from an unhistorical business press that deals mainly in exhortation or celebration, and does little to promote careful public analysis. One is sure there is good analysis behind the scenes, for that is industry’s task. But we are talking here about research in the public domain. Public policy can rarely do better than its environment. Tyabji’s combination of analysis and practical implications effectively counteracts that unfortunate tendency and leads us to something stronger and independent.",

Biotechnologies are expected to play an important role in economic development, in domains such as agriculture and health. Like many other countries, Egypt entered the fi eld some twenty years ago. More than other sectors, the research sector requires close cooperation between many actors at several levels. Fundamental research concerning biotechnologies is necessary but it must be orientated to economic purposes and embedded in industrial processes. The state and its public research policies play an important role in involving and mobilising private sector, including foreign partners. Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), lobbying groups, the media, farmer unions and public opinion—all have concerns about genetically modifi ed organisms (GMOs) and the related ethical issues.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Building on both the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the relevant portions of the advisory opinion of the International Monsanto Tribunal, this article presents a normative argument on the right-to-food responsibility of corporate actors that own and exercise intellectual property rights on seeds and plant varieties. This article contends that while states bear the primary responsibility for the right to food, corporate actors that own intellectual property rights on seeds and plant varieties equally have a responsibility to respect the right to food and to ensure that the exercise and enforcement of their intellectual property rights does not negatively affect the ability of small scale farmers to gain access to the means of food production nor threaten agricultural biodiversity, as both of these factors are crucial for ensuring food security. In this regard, agricultural companies that own intellectual property rights on seeds and plant varieties should not engage in activities that negatively impact the non-commercial farmers’ seed system nor should they prevent farmers from saving and exchanging seeds. </jats:p>",

The technological cultures that we live in, make us empowered and vulnerable at the same time (Bijker, 2006; Hommels et al., 2014). To accommodate the uncertainty that is inherent in innovation processes and outcomes, it is generally considered beneficial to enrol multiple perspectives and ways of seeing and understanding the world, when looking for innovative solutions to specific problems. Since some ten years, this often happens under the banner of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). This special issue originated from such an effort.

Such investigations help broaden the notion of science in keeping with what is really experienced in practice by taking several factors into account: the actors in science and technology, the content of knowledge, the context, and the social and cultural im plications. If the 'different' research approaches are confronted (involving studies of spa tially and temporally well-defined subjects according to discipline, etc.), they provide essen tial elements for comparative analysis which can trace the structural features of the diffusion, conjunction and integration of different sciences.

However, spatial effects are seldom considered, which could lead to potentially misleading analytical results. This study addresses this concern by applying the spatial analysis method to investigate how university-level factors and commercialising academic patents are related. Using a comprehensive dataset of university patents from 1815 Chinese universities in 2016, we find that public research funding of universities, industrial research funding, the number of scientific research personnel, the number of monographs published, and the number of awarded achievements are positively related to the commercialisation of academic patents. However, the number of teaching and research personnel and the number of academic papers published are negatively related. There are positive spatial spillover effects in commercialising academic patents among neighbouring universities, but there will be negative spatial spillover effects in funding competition. </jats:p>",

The research method of this study includes multiple regression analysis, including (1) the effect of collective intelligence on open innovation (i.e., the number of citations), (2) the effect of the amount of knowledge (i.e., the number of references) on open innovation and (3) the moderating effect of the amount of knowledge (i.e., the number of references) between collective intelligence and open innovation. The research scope of this study is Scopus published papers from two periods, namely, 2001–2005 and 2011–2015. The scope here is limited to mathematics and electronics. According to the research conducted here, if the amount of knowledge increases in an economic system, collective intelligence will increasingly motivate open innovation. The implication of this study is that there are diverse methods for collective intelligence to impact open innovation and the consequent results. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Social Dynamics Underpinning Telecentres in Nepal: Feedback and Absorptive Capacity in a National Innovation System",
    "abstract": "This article offers a conceptual analysis of two aspects of openness: extended feedback and absorptive capacity in the context of a developing country national innovation system. Extended feedback is defined as the capacity of national agencies, responsible for telecentre development, to learn and share learning about the practices, ideas and information demands of people using their telecentres. This allows for a greater diffusion of knowledge across the national innovation system (NIS). Absorptive capacity is defined as the capacity of users to access and share information and apply it for productive practices. These concepts are used in this article to help explain the ways that social networks can be consolidated and extended, horizontally and vertically, through telecentres in rural Nepal and consequently contribute to social and economic development. The argument is developed that telecentres, providing there is extended feedback at the institutional level and absorptive capacity at both local and central levels, extend access to ‘bridging social capital’. The paper concludes by identifying some potential indicators for monitoring and evaluating the impact of ICT (Information Communication Technologies) using these concepts.",

The overall status of Chinese science and technology is reviewed in order to explain the background of the reform process. Reform was started to change the prevalent inefficiencies of government R&amp;D institutes, which have been very important players in the Chinese national innovation system. The reform processes can be classified into two. The first is to make government R&amp;D institutes serve the economic battlefield, while the second is to restructure their internal organisations and establish a Chinese national innovation system. After the reform, Chinese government R&amp;D institutes have changed a lot and the results seem to be positive. However, there are still some fundamental issues unresolved and questioned, such as ownership, management and focus of R&amp;D activities. In the last part, those associated obstacles and arguments of the reform are discussed and presented for the future policy directions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Link between Exporting and Productivity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The theory that links exporting behaviour and productivity consists broadly of two hypotheses—the ‘self-selection hypothesis’—more productive firms venturing for exports and the ‘learning by exporting hypothesis’—exporting leads to increased productivity. This study measures the productivity differentials between exporters and non-exporters for 120 firms belonging to the Indian chemical industry to investigate if the self-selection hypothesis holds. The productivity differential comparison between exporters and non-exporters show that non-exporters have higher total factor productivity than exporters. Though labour productivity is higher in exporters than non-exporters, the yearly averages show that the labour productivity of exporters is converging to that on the non-exporters. In terms of capital productivity, overall averages show that exporters are more productive, but yearly trend shows that capital productivity of non-exporters has overtaken that of exporters over the years. With respect to self-selection hypothesis, the study does not find any evidence for it for the chemical industry. Prior exporting status, size, being part of a group and age are the only factors that induce a firm to go for exporting. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Meeting the Liberalisation Challenge: Technological Learning in the Brazilian Banking Automation Industry",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The opening of the Brazilian computer market to foreign enterprises and trade in 1992 presented a unique challenge to the technologically dynamic national banking automation (BA) industry. National BA firms' responses varied in relation to their size and dependence on this market segment. Despite the weight of new entrants (such as A T&amp; T and Olivetti), the segment's leader preserved its competitive position. This paper explores how this small, national banking automation firm reoriented its hitherto successful flexible and cooperative technological strategy to face these competitive challenges. It briefly examines the firm's innovative strategy in the protected market environment. It also discusses the firm's strategic responses to the new environment and the corresponding changes in its corporate innovation process. It explores the constraints imposed on a long-term technological learning process by such reorientation. The concluding section examines the normative strategic impli cations for similar firms and sectors in developing countries, and suggests the need for innovative and flexible cooperative socio-institutional arrangements to make up for the diminished edge in technological innovation brought about by responses to liberalisation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the global economy focuses increasingly on Asia, Hong Kong’s role as an intermediary between China and the rest of the world merits investigation. In view of the increasing importance of knowledge-based business services and Hong Kong’s recent drive to promote innovation and high-tech services, economists and policy makers must understand Hong Kong’s capacity to support economic development in the Asian region. Following a theoretically informed discussion of the role of information technology (IT) services within the broader category of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS), Hong Kong’s IT services sector is described and analysed to determine its potential for supporting an innovative local services environment and to identify the key opportunities and challenges involved in further developing the sector. In-depth interviews of important actors in the IT services sector in Hong Kong and case studies of firms that have leveraged IT services supplement our analysis of data on IT service production and usage. IT services represents an opportunity through which Hong Kong can use targeted policy to drive growth and expand and deepen economic relations with Mainland China. </jats:p>",

We find that the insufficient financial and human resources hampered the potential role of R&D to contribute toward economic development, adaptation to imported technologies and development of local technologies in Sudan.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, which is based on a review of archival and published primary and secondary sources from many repositories in Mexico, France and the United States, we discuss the impact of French agronomy on the development of this scientific discipline in Mexico. We consider the evolution of Mexican agronomy in the context of the nation's political history, discuss the rise of French influence during the nineteenth century, examine the impact of the introduction of other foreign models of agricultural science after the Mexican Revolution (1910-20), and evaluate Mexico's decision to adopt the agricultural science of the United States as a model for the development of Mexican agronomy after 1940. Using this discussion we demonstrate that French agronomy had a crucial impact on the early development of the discipline in Mexico. Further, although the French model eventually lost out to the agricultural science of the United States, the Mexican agronomists' early ties to France ensured that French agronomy continued to exercise some influence in Mexico after 1940. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Cooperation between industry and universities is vital in the sustainable development of industries. However, research on industry–university cooperation in specific industries remains limited, which motivates our examination of this issue. Drawing on social network theory and the knowledge-based view, we discuss the effects of relational embeddedness and network routines on industry–university cooperation by Chinese construction firms as well as the moderating role of intermediaries. Using a sample of 256 members of Chinese construction firms, we show that trust and tie strength in relational embeddedness in addition to norm consensus and tacit understanding of behaviour in network routines all have significantly positive effects on firm performance with industry–university cooperation. The moderating effects of intermediaries on the links between trust and tie strength in relational embeddedness and firm performance are not statistically significant. However, intermediaries weaken the relationship between norm consensus in network routines and firm performance, and strengthen the relationship between tacit understanding of behaviour in network routines and firm performance. Overall, our study has important implications not only for construction firms seeking to improve firm performance but also for intermediaries on how to better play a positive role in industry–university cooperation. </jats:p>",

At the same time, the HLPP is one component of the global Human Proteome Project (HPP), which in 2001–2002 began dividing the organs and systems of the human body between different national laboratories and institutes. Research on the kidney was assigned to Japan, brain research to Germany, liver research to China, etc. Only in China, however, did the project take on the character of ‘big science’, successfully competing with other scientific initiatives for funding and prestige at the highest level, and developing ‘national’ characteristics similar to that of genomics research in the United States. Our article considers this flagship Chinese bioscience project from two complementary angles: as ‘big science’ at the cutting edge of biomedical research, and as a discursive and practice-oriented meeting ground between modern and ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine. We also discuss how these strands are politically and philosophically convergent. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article revisits the conceptualisation of pharmaceutical regulation. While States and multilateral organisations play a central part in devising rules, regulation as a social practice extends beyond their role. Domestic and international interests, geopolitics and spatial configurations, commercial and health considerations, governmental policies and individual behaviours and legal and illegal transactions all contribute to regulating the pharmaceutical milieu. This consideration expands the epistemological range of pharmaceutical regulation, which then appears as the assemblage of heterogeneous laws, rules and codes of conducts. The way in which these layers are connected forms what regulation actually is in practice. Regulation multiple thus appears as the product of tensions between harmonisation efforts and persistent diversity, as well as the result of interactions and overlaps between official regulation and unofficial regulatory practices. This article explores these tensions in the Southeast Asian pharmaceutical market along three themes: circuits and logistic regimes; control and attention to quality; bridges and harmonisations. </jats:p>",

New policies and practices, which can be group together as ‘Thaksinomics’, transformed not only the government sector, but also two other leading actors of the NIS: private firms and university. Even though it is too early to draw final conclusions of the effects of Thaksin policies on Thai NIS, it is true that it became stronger and more coherent. The experience of Thailand demonstrates that a national innovation system of a latecomer country can transform from a long-standing character of a weak, fragmented and slow-learning one to a stronger, coherent and more-active-learning one, if there is a significant change in the behaviour of a key actor that can cause positive effects in other actors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept ‘research excellence’ remains ill-defined in performance assessment and science funding frameworks. This article introduces a framework that distinguishes ‘global excellence’ and ‘local excellence’, which enable a better understanding of ‘research excellence’ in African science. Where global excellence is primarily determined by acknowledged visibility and partially measurable reputation within the (inter)national scholarly community, its local counterpart relates to utilisation of knowledge and know-how among non-scholarly users and communities. Our empirical study of global excellence, based on a citation impact analysis of ‘basic research’ publications during the past 15 years, with one or more African-based authors, shows a large degree of dependence on and cooperation with non-African international partners. More detailed analysis of research-active universities in the African Research Universities Alliance also highlights their large dependency on international resources and funding in their highly cited ‘globally excellent’ research. Our analysis of local excellence focusses on the research objectives of the centres of excellence at universities in sub-Saharan Africa, showing a mix of local and global components. The notion of local excellence is in need of appropriate definitions and further operationalisation. The distinction between global and local excellence, within science funding and research assessment frameworks, offers a more comprehensive view and better understanding of high-end research performance of universities in Africa. Developing quality criteria and performance indicators of local excellence may incentivise researchers to contribute to socio-economic development and innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Few papers have dealt with disruptive technology from a technological evolutionary perspective. This article analyses disruptive innovation activities in terms of the new concept of technological DNA (TDNA). To pursue the research aim, evolution theories and a case methodology were utilised. We find that evolutions in technology are due to changes in environmental conditions. Parallels may be drawn between technology discontinuity and the punctuated equilibrium theory in evolution. When seen from that perspective, TDNA has not been disrupted but has evolved within the new market environment, and technological evolution gives birth to a new industry. New products or services are created through the changing or reconfiguring of TDNA. Over time, technology evolves, but its inherent nature remains. For that reason, TDNA is not disrupted even if disruptive innovation occurs. Rather, through the process of disruptive innovation, new functions are created by the substitution or replacement of the architecture surrounding the technology which determines how it actually functions. Thus we may refer to this phenomenon as a ‘Multiplier innovation’ rather than a disruptive innovation in that it involves the birthing of new products. This article seeks to contribute to innovation studies in expanding its methodological framework. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Regulating Access and Protecting Traditional Health Knowledge through Intellectual Property Rights? Issues from a Holistic Health Systems Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional Health Knowledge (THK) has been a resource for modern pharmacology and the pharma-ceutical industry since its inception. Until the 2000s, there was little obligation to acknowledge the use of THK by the pharmaceutical industry. Now, with the intellectual property regime becoming a prominent mode of regulating use of pharmaceutical inventions and innovations, and attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to patent products based on THK, rights of THK holders are being fore-grounded. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is seeking to protect the rights of THK holders through international legal instruments under the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) framework. This article discusses dilemmas arising from this attempt at bringing together two diverse knowledge frameworks. It draws upon existing literature on the nature of THK and upon the debates of the WIPO’s Inter-Governmental Committee on Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expression (WIPO-IGC), and analyses them from the standpoint of a holistic health systems approach (HHSA) in an era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The approach leads to the conclusion that deliberations and promulgations of the WIPO-IGC will have long-lasting implications for the survival of diversity and context-specificity in healthcare. Therein lies the significance of thinking through the policy and legal measures to be adopted nationally and internationally. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This contribution to the sociology of food security as a globalised public issue highlights the importance of instruments of proof that underlie discourses on related matters. This article addresses the issue of the economic models that are used in the definition of the futures of food security. Through these models, the food security issue is centred on neo-liberal options which systematically and closely connect agricultural productivity and international agricultural trade. Over the last ten years, we have been witnessing the development of new kinds of foresight which construct alternative scenarios. Agrimonde (2008-2010) is one of them. This article highlights how this foresight attempts to open up the debate in instituted networks dedicated to food security in which economic models – and the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) model developed by IFPRI<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> in particular – exert a strong influence. Furthermore, it examines the way in which Agrimonde’s construction principles and its underlying axiology engage in a critique of economic models. The Agrimonde approach also includes the mobilisation of the strategic resources required to perform the international debate and to raise the visibility of alternative conceptions of food security. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In less than ten years, India has launched colossal biometric databases. One among them is related to the first ‘free’ health coverage scheme offered by the government of India: the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY). Based on a public–private partnership between government and private companies, RSBY national scheme was launched in 2008, as a first step towards universal health coverage in a country where households endorse 70% of health expenses. The first phase of RSBY offers to cover ₹30,000 ($600) of inpatient expenses per year for five members of a below poverty line household and is now piloted in several Indian States to include outpatient expenses and above poverty line families too. RSBY relies exclusively on a centralised digital artefact to function, made visible by the ‘RSBY Smart Card’, a chip enabled plastic card containing personal data of individual and their family counting and conditioning the granting of health services to them; thus, no smart card means no health coverage. Till date 120 million Indians have been registered in the RSBY database. This article analyses how health accessibility is crafted under the RSBY scheme by questioning two central dimensions of this data-driven digital health scheme: the smart card technology and the public–private partnership, whereas RSBY scheme promises health coverage for all, its digital infrastructures may complicate access to health services, and reveal new patterns of exclusion of individuals. Thus, we will detail how smartcards technologies and private providers condition access to health care in India. </jats:p>",

Subsequently, an empirical study is conducted using stochastic frontier analysis on unbalanced panel data covering 31 provinces. The empirical result shows that innovation performance of RISs differs greatly in the various provinces and cities analyzed. The average score of the national regional innovation performance is 0.4514, indicating that non-efficiency is very common in Chinese provinces and cities. There are various factors that should be considered to promote innovation performance of the RIS. These are openness of RISs, maturity of the technology market, collaboration of RISs and intellectual property protection. Interestingly the unique circumstances of the Chinese market show that enterprise technology input and government investments have a negative impact on the regional innovation performance. </jats:p>",

Paradoxically, the initial post-independence period was characterised by a sustained attempt to shake off the subtle neo-colonial impact and set in place an institutional frame work that could capitalise on indigenous capability. Unfortunately, restrictions in funding, loss of highly qualified manpower and inconsistent policy signals continued to restrain efforts for a resurgence in scientific capability. This is clearly evident from repeated abor tive attempts to commit the government to accept and implement an explicit national pol icy for science and technology. Sri Lanka, however, can boast of a network of scientific organisations, painstakingly created over the past fifty years. In this context, even if the dis abilities inflicted are considered symptomatic of the developing country scenario, there are no strong arguments to justify the current state of the scientific base of Sri Lanka struggling to establish and professionalise the scientific community. </jats:p>",

Renewed policies are consequently designed in order to ensure the return of this expatriated talented group. Besides the repatriation-return-option generally enacted in these policies with varying success, a second one has recently emerged: the diaspora option. It consists of the remote mobilisation of intellectuals abroad and their connection to scientific, technological and cultural programmes at home. </jats:p><jats:p> At the beginning of the 1990s, Colombia began to systematically and consistently apply this option, through the creation of 'the Colombian Caldas' Network of Scientists and Engineers Abroad'. The experience of this strategy has been studied during the last four years by a Franco-Colombian research team. The paper discusses the results of this study. It first contextualises the diaspora option and the Colombian experience by putting it in historical perspective along with the other policies designed to tackle the issue of professionals' migration. It then describes the S&amp;T diaspora in terms of actors and dynamics. The way it works through the Caldas network is presented in terms of an analysis of three major aspects: the electronic list through INTERNET, the local associations (network's nodes) and some joint projects between diaspora and the home community members. The concluding part draws the signific ance of the experience, its achievements as well as its limitations, and suggests indicators and methods that could help develop it elsewhere. </jats:p>",

In this article, we use the world system approach to discuss the largely peripheral relations of Kenya’s science systems to the global science system and to identify indications for Kenya becoming a semi-peripheral scientific player itself within Eastern Africa. While the publications are dominantly oriented towards the Global North and while foreign sources fund nearly half of Kenya’s research and development (R&amp;D), the country starts to become an important country for its neighbours. However, Kenya is still facing an unstable system of integrating significantly more graduate students. These are seen as essential to provide for a sustainable knowledge base that is required for the country’s socio-economic goals. We point to the lack of robust and recent data on R&amp;D in Kenya as an impediment to evidence-based policy-making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Indian state has been steadily increasing its focus on and use of digital technologies. This article argues that if digitisation is to continue and accelerate, certain other aspects of digitisation require greater scrutiny. To begin with, for digitisation to be meaningful to citizens, it is necessary to consider them not only as data points but as participants. This requires improved access to the internet. In order to do so, it is incumbent upon the Indian state to enhance digital infrastructure. However, this infrastructure cannot be narrowly conceived. There are material, educational, and legislative interventions that make digital infrastructure meaningful, accessible and non-extractive. This article raises two questions: should access to the internet be considered a basic right? And, if feasible, what would such a policy entail? This article attempts to shed light on India’s digital divide, look at the direction in which public–private relations are headed in an increasingly digital India and discuss the benefits of considering digital infrastructure—rather than the internet itself—as a public good rather than a private commodity. Such infrastructure includes laws and policies that protect and empower citizens. </jats:p>",

THIS VOLUME ON the social history of colonialism and imperialism presents some of the best recent examples of historically-informed science studies. Scholarly interest in the imperial roles of technology and science has a long history. In the West, studies by Basalla (1967), Headrick (1981) and MacLeod (1987) established the conceptual foundations for thinking about the diffusion, adaptation and adoption of the Western technosciences within colonial and post-colonial settings. Others, such as the sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein and the historian Michael Adas, place Western science and technology at the centre of Europe’s successful expansion and subsequent colonisation of much of the globe. Disagreement, debate and intellectual ferment characterise historical studies of colonial science and tech-",

    "title": "The Politics of Memory: NLP Models as Liberating Artifacts",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The main argument of this article is that natural language processing (NLP) projects of Indigenous African languages can be understood as an effort to restore and preserve Africa’s memory in the digital. Language has always occupied a particular place in the African decolonial imaginary. Several African states embarked on processes of Africanisation of postcolonial institutions in their respective national contexts. One of the main features of this project in many African countries was the restoration of African languages in education and public service. Taking a social constructivist approach rooted in science and technology studies and looking through the analytical lens of decoloniality in Africa, I conceptualise NLP models of Indigenous African languages as liberating artifacts. I mobilise decolonial theory to look at language as a technology that can be used to dis-member and re-member the African subjects of their memory of being as people. The coloniser erased the memory of the African subjugated by cutting off their linguistic connections and instead planted the European memory. From this perspective, decolonisation can be understood as a process of re-memberment that can be achieved through the return of the languages of those whose humanity has been denied or questioned. In this sense, NLP projects offer instances of the digital that represent spaces of restoration and negotiated digital futurities. I contend that these digital spaces in Africa are social spaces of contestation about what common investments should be made, what collective futures are desirable and what are the perceived material consequences of such shared imaginations. </jats:p>",

The book Negotiating Water Rights is an attempt to redress the balance in favour of the traditional systems of the poor, and to bring forth ideas of water rights and management that give space to a rich repertoire of possibilities at the local level as alternatives to those approaches that reify the monistic state. It draws its inspiration from a school of thought that originated among sociologists and anthropologists in the late 1970s and early 1980s, centred in Cornell University, with a later home found within Ford Foundation and Wageningen University in the Netherlands as well as the International Water Management Institute, now in Colombo. This book opens and closes with two strong chapters by the editors, nesting twelve case studies centred around three geographicolegal groupings: Indonesia, South Asia and Moorish Hispania.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Disruptive innovation is an effective way for market latecomers to draw a level with earlier developers. Yet, little is known about how a path of disruptive innovation for semiconductor latecomers can be cultivated. We aim to fill this gap in knowledge with the help of the experience of China’s local fabless semiconductor firm, HiSilicon, by using a single case qualitative method for vertical research. The results show that the ‘five-steps-in-one’ S-M-A-R-T framework is an effective path for semiconductor latecomers to cultivate disruptive innovation of the dynamic process. It can help existing semiconductor latecomers to break through their lagging dilemma. Among them, strategic direction (S) is a guideline, market identification (M) is a prerequisite, ability building (A) is a foundation, R&amp;D for independent technology (R) is a key, and timing of market entry (T) is a safeguard. Our case study ‘HiSilicon’ happened to be in this situation; it took 15 years to counterattack from a niche market to the mainstream market, and finally accomplished disruptive innovation. Our findings contribute to enriching and expanding the guidance for semiconductor latecomers in different countries by identifying how to foster their disruptive innovation to catch up successfully. </jats:p>",

One occurred when the increased diagnoses made the disease more prevalent and feared, and efforts at prevention and treatment seem more efficacious, leading to more screening, and so on. The other cycle occurred among men with screening detected cancer who initially eschewed radical treatments or imagined doing so, whose lives were often consumed with fear and surveillance, increasing demand for radical cures. </jats:p><jats:p> This history underscores the need for novel clinical and policy responses to the looping effects—self-reinforcing cycles of action and perception—which can radically transform so much of what we believe and do about disease. </jats:p>",

The whole system of science and technology was highly affected by thirteen years of military dictatorship. One of the main objectives of the basic science community, during the redemocratisation process, was to create the conditions for the consolidation of a permanent infrastructure for the development of basic sciences, namely, Biology, Chemistry, Information and Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics. </jats:p><jats:p> One of the basic conditions in order to attain that goal was the repatriation of a great number of the Uruguayan scientists who had left the country during the 1970s. It is important to point out that Uruguayan scientists who lived abroad had expressed a desire to return to their country, and to collaborate with their peers who had remained in Uruguay to develop a collective and self-managed effort. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper migration waves observed within the Latin American scientific community and those related to the exodus and return of Uruguayan basic scientists are discussed; exploring the reasons, motives and assumptions underlying the return of scientists.

    "title": "‘New Drugs’ Approvals in India: An Institutional Perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The approval mechanism for new drugs in India has in recent years been a subject of scrutiny and controversy in both the public sphere and academics. Frequent rollbacks in the guidelines have attracted criticisms from the industry as well. All this happens at a time, when the country aspires to catch up and keep pace with the fast-changing global regulatory norms. This article draws upon the scholarships on regulatory science and institutional theories to understand the regulatory processes of new drugs approval in India. Both strands of scholarships highlight the multidisciplinary, context-specific character of regulatory knowledge. We find that Indian regulation-making process relies heavily on regulatory knowledge built up elsewhere, potentially limiting the scope of generating its own, context-specific, regulatory knowledge through learning and capacity building. Inadequate level of deliberations in the decision-making process, dearth of documentation and a lack of connections with the larger institutional settings appear to be two other features of it. All this might explain the reasons for frequent changes, and lack of continuity, in regulation for new drugs approval in the country in recent years. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the disruptive technology innovation time arrival, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been the motor of innovation and played an increasingly major role in national economic development. As the shift towards an ‘open innovation’ paradigm, awareness of intellectual property rights has increased, and patents have been an important tool for Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises. Considering its mass production of low-level generic drugs, there are still many arguments about its lack of innovation. This article aims to identify if and how patents, as essential indicators of innovation, generate financial performance measured by SMEs in the pharmaceutical sectors. Patent data are a vital source of competitive intelligence. A positive association was found between annually added patents and gross sales. Many other patent indicators, such as the number of forward citations and patent transfer, were statistically significant. Moreover, the results suggested that there was a one-year lag between patent publication and financial performance. A series of patent quantity and quality indicators have shown significant effects on the financial performance of Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises. These patents generate a positive financial impact, which builds up a solid basis for keeping sustainable innovation capability in the Chinese drug industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Responsible research and innovation (RRI) aims at mitigating the negative unintended consequences of technologies, developed by large business organisations, on society and environment. Scholars point out that the broader ethical underpinnings of RRI in terms of ‘transparency, interaction and mutual responsiveness’ are difficult to achieve in a typical business environment as conforming to these principles may erode the very competitive advantages the corporations seek to achieve through innovations. At the same time, the scholarship on frugal innovations by ‘the vulnerable’ puts forward an alternative narrative of innovations. Seeking to respond to the gap created by the apparatus of the mainstream market, and the State, these innovations reflect many pro-social motivations, and desire for inclusive development. The two discourses, however, remain isolated from each other. Our article is an attempt to initiate a dialogue between them. We intend to widen the scope and ambit of both RRI and the frugal innovation scholarships, which might help garner more policy and social support in favour of developing socially relevant, inclusive and context-specific innovations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines why the growth of biopharmaceutical firms in latecomer countries such as Taiwan has been slower than that of information and communication technology (ICT) firms. Unlike prior studies which have focused on the industry-level driving forces, this study offers a firm-level perspective to examine factors driving industry growth. By utilising the DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, we analyse data collected in questionnaires with the top managers of biopharmaceutical and ICT firms in Taiwan, both public and non-public. We then compared and contrasted our empirical findings to capture theoretical and practical insights. Our empirical results demonstrate that the entrepreneurial activities of Taiwan’s biopharmaceutical firms are weak in terms of adaptation to external institutions and the utilisation of resources while the primary drivers of growth in Taiwan’s biopharmaceutical firms are rather (internal) institutional factors than resource-based factors, especially in the emerging and early growth stages. We conclude that the challenge for the latecomers lies on the institutional entrepreneurship to enable and affect the circulation of strategic resources so as to bring the firms onto the growth and mature stages. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article aims to reflect on the role of Science, Technology and Society (STS) research(ers) in co-constructing Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the Global South. By reporting on RRI research in the Global South, here the Indo-Dutch NWO-MVI project on rice straw burning in Punjab, we make an argument for approaching RRI as a symmetric process of knowledge production mobilised by local actors and researchers alike. For STS researchers to responsibly engage with local innovation systems, their activities need to go beyond knowledge provision and towards facilitating the ownership and circulation of local meanings and means to responsibly innovate. Rather than understanding RRI as a fixed framework to govern innovation practices, this article reflects on RRI as an approach that combines research with intervention. We propose that following the principle of symmetry can turn RRI into a productive tool for the mobilisation of embedded local principles that can organise innovation systems in a responsible way. In particular, symmetry allows the re-location of meanings and practices of innovation as well as the re-negotiation of multiple notions of responsible governance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Europe's overseas expansion became a challenge for its simultaneously developing sci ences, especially from the eighteenth century onwards. Geography was certainly the most prominent scientific means that was applied to comprehend the earth. As a sub-discipline, cartography enabled overseas territorial penetration. It will be argued in this paper that it had been the cartographical construction of Bengal, and later on India. by British geographers and cartographers in the second half of the eighteenth century that made Britain 's economic, political and eventually military expansion into India possible. Maps became the vital instrurnent for the military control of the land and its population. This was in stark contrast to Europe's development of scientific cartography where cadastral maps were drawn for the fiscal and juridical centralisation of the country and the tight administration of its people. Hence, science was applied to intensify the political regime's grip on the land. In India, cartography was developed in a rather unknown environment to serve the colonial state's immediate needs. Cartography gained its own momentum, along with natural history, geology and botany, creating a specific 'arhive of knowledge'. Thus, besides facilitating the penetration of India, it made colonial rule possible. Science was, therefore, rather applied to legitimise the colonial regime's impact on a foreign country. </jats:p>",

While it was expected to introduce a creative mechanism of compliance with international environmental agreements without upsetting the promising biotechnology research in Ethiopia, it conspicuously failed to strike a balance between the imperatives of promoting innovation and protecting humans and biodiversity. Contrary to the claims of the architects of the Proclamation, the legislation hardly entertained any national indigenous input other than adopting a more stringent version of the parent law—the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. </jats:p><jats:p> The article examines the Ethiopian Biosafety law and its impact on innovation in biotechnology and other emerging technologies that go by other names.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Knowledge, a fundamental component of innovation, expands more effectively when innovation actors are in geographical proximity to each other. Innovation in each region is driven by innovation actors, and thus, the innovation capability of a region is directly linked to the activities of innovation actors in that region. In keeping with this perspective, this study was conducted in order to present the characteristics of the cross-regional innovation capability using an analytical framework of regional innovation actors, such as research institutes, technology intermediaries, universities and firms. In order to analyse the position of each Korean region’s innovation actors, this study classified research subjects from the 2013 National Research and Development Investment Program Information into seven sub-categories and utilised them as the data for the analysis. Multiple factor analysis (MFA), which compresses the various indices effectively, was applied in order to classify the regions that have similar innovation actors into a small number of categories. Based on the factors derived from MFA, the innovation characteristics of sixteen regions were examined. The results showed that the innovation actors differ across regions, although Seoul, Gyeonggi and Daejeon are ahead of all other regions in terms of innovation activity. The policy implications of this analysis are as follows: first, the imbalance in the innovation capabilities among regions must be improved. Second, differentiated regional innovation policies are required because the innovator actors who lead regional innovation differ from region to region. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Korea’s technological achievement in the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) industry became possible primarily through a catch-up strategy in technological development. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses of the Korean TFT-LCD industry’s knowledge management, the researchers highlight the strategies that key Korean firms utilized to enable a successful technological catch-up. On a national level, patent citation information is analyzed to evaluate the Korean industry’s technological knowledge position compared to other Asian countries. Results from this analysis indicate that Korea plays a central role within the knowledge network, as evidenced by the highest centrality value. On a firm level, Samsung and LG Display are investigated in the areas of technological development and manufacturing strategies. Samsung and LG Display show strength in the technological specialization of devices’ arrangements/optical operation and arrangement/circuits of control indicating devices. In addition, these two firms show more diversification to allow for new business opportunities. By integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the TFT-LCD industry on national and firm levels, this research demonstrates the industry’s trajectory with depth and precision. In addition, this study contributes a meaningful strengthening of analysis methods in technological knowledge management and provides successful management factors for new latecomers in the industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In resource-poor emerging economies, the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired governments and various organisations to develop innovative solutions to help combat the pandemic. We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis of 19 cases drawn from a sample of emerging countries to understand how varied actors rapidly forged healthcare solutions. We uncover the entrepreneurial agency of bricolage as an intrinsic, unconscious and cooperative process of entrepreneurial action in crisis management. Our study contributes to the theory of bricolage as we propose the concept of ‘crisis-driven bricolage’ in healthcare. By highlighting the capacity of multiple actors to collaborate and create effective healthcare solutions within a very short timeframe, our study holds strong practical implications for regional responses. It encourages bricolage as a viable solution when resources are tight and responses need to be rapid. Our study proposes greater consideration of bricolage as a way to provide low-cost and efficacious solutions, and as a complement to society’s innovation repertoire. </jats:p>",

It argues that most existing schemes tend to rely on assumptions that seem to be in need of revision, what helps to explain the low impact of North-South research partnerships on development. It illustrates the argument with an analysis of the Nicaragua-Sweden partnership with support from SAREC. It suggests new assumptions to be taken into account when designing modalities of support to research capacity building as follows: (a) the notion of innovation as a non-linear process involving different stakeholders and forms of knowledge; (b) the need for social relevance and accountability; and (c) the idea of self-determination and local ownership. </jats:p>",

However, this study asserts the co-existence of a counter power through which societal cultures may ‘colonise’ educational technologies too. This assumption of power struggle is examined by addressing the question: to what extent do societal cultures colonise educational technologies? This question is answered using a qualitative and quantitative enquiry into Israeli society. Having analysed the data, it is found that societies consist of beliefs, attitudes and behaviours that may challenge the determination of educational technologies. This could be seen as empirical evidence suggesting that, although educational technologies may seek to colonise societies, societies may seek to colonise educational technologies as well, with the two entities engaging in a politically reciprocal relationship. </jats:p>",

Despite the existence of a National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS) since 1962, national research institutes, a plan of action approved in 2002 to implement the Lebanese Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Policy (STIP), and five integrated action programmes managed by CNRS, it is argued that S&amp;T activities in Lebanon remain primarily a university-driven business. </jats:p>",

We focus on two main types of collaborations: co-publications and collaboration in research projects through formal participation. We find that longer stays abroad seem to provide better opportunities to publish with a host principal investigator and to participate in research projects in the recipient country. We find that the length of the stay also has an impact on the likelihood of return to Spain: longer stays abroad reduce the likelihood of return. However, a longer duration international stay does not affect the collaboration links maintained with the home country, which may persist over time. We also find that public financial support is crucial for explaining and facilitating the return of Spanish researchers from abroad. </jats:p>",

These represen tations have no doubt helped Tunisian research overcome the many trials and tribulations of its short history. However, on the other hand, the state policies from the mid-1990s have set to reorganise the research system to make it more responsive to the economic and practical demands of the society.

It identifies the patterns of clusters through overall review of the various clusters in Korea. The study revealed that production clusters were built either by government policy or by investment of large chaebols during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s formation of more advanced types of clusters like those of R&amp;D was also initiated by the government. Although there are various types of clusters in Korea, innovation clusters in which firms and related supporting institutes closely inter act and stimulate the innovation process are at a primitive stage. Most clusters are per forming parts of a value-adding chain, lacking many essential capabilities and technopoles needed to sustain regional economic activities. Moreover, there are a number of hurdles for further development of the clusters that leads to innovation clusters. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the global concern for the loss of biodiversity, biological knowledge has become a central tool in environmental governance. Science studies has addressed the data-driven nature of biodiversity protection and explored various aspects of it, ranging from knowledge infrastructures to engagement of various social groups in knowledge production. This article focuses on how this knowledge is applied in forestry, one of the most threatening socio-economic practices to biodiversity. Drawing from a case study in Finland, carried out as an ethnography of forestry expert practices, I analyse how biodiversity has been institutionalised in forestry operations. Responsible action and pro-environmental behaviour are much debated topics in environmental governance literature. Here the focus is on how they are articulated and enacted as embedded in the expert practices. The practices and techniques of identifying and locating the biological values are thus not viewed as resources for decision making but as performative of the partnerships in environmental governance, shaping the roles of science, corporations, government and civil society. These partnerships and power relations are constituted by the uncertainty of biological knowledge and the instability of biological objects travelling between the realms of science, administration and economy. </jats:p>",

Account has been taken of the fluid, dynamic situation in the country—at that time undergoing a process of change—that influenced the visions of the players taking part in this project, which unfolded in a university environment that demanded profound changes, both on the political-academic front and in terms of physical infrastructure, to enable it to adapt to the process of modernisation that was taking place. In order to put this research into its proper context, we have examined elements from the world of politics, and from the economic and social fields, as well as aspects of the dominant culture. In existing documentation, moreover, there are indications of agreements and disagreements among members of the university itself, and between the university and representatives of the government, a struggle that reveals personal preferences, given approaches and political commitments, visions of science and even professional jealousies. </jats:p>",

As this essay demonstrates, 1960s to 1980s emerged as the phase of brain drain. The country witnessed considerable economic growth and development of S&amp;T infrastructure coupled with the emergence of science community and intellectual climate in the 1990s. The development reversed the process of brain drain. A historical perspective is adopted which presents ample data and empirical evidence to map the evolution and operation of three phases. Towards mapping the last phase of brain circulation, it is shown that the country embarked on the development of ICT software sector and become globally relevant and competitive. In an unexpected way the growth and dynamics of this high technology service oriented sector has unravelled the process of brain drain transforming it into brain circulation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes a way of integrating modern science and technology into the fabric of Thai culture. Such an attempt is necessary for their development in such a country like Thailand because science and technology do not exist in a vacuum, but are deeply interrelated with various external factors in a culture. But if this is the case, then any attempt to promote and develop science and technology in a Third World country needs to take the culture and historical tradition of that particular country into consideration. Finding a way to integrate the culture of modern science and technology with the local one is also necessary as an antidote for the feeling of alienation, apparently felt by many in Thailand nowadays, that results from imposing modern ideas from outside without careful consideration. It is argued that the integration can only be accomplished effectively by, metaphorically speaking, 'growing' them out of indigenous soil. This means that elements within the culture need to be found as a starting point for devel opment into modern science and technology that are capable of serving the goals and values of the members of the culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> After the 2008 food price crisis, food security once again became a priority on the international political agenda. This introduction to the special issue tackles the links between this reprioritisation of food security on the one hand, and science and technology on the other hand. First, this special issue introduces the new controversies emerging around food security. Trying to articulate food security with other global issues, actors involved into these debates have elaborated at least two new food security frames, global food security and food sustainability. Second, this issue highlights the role played by knowledge infrastructures in shaping debates on food security. The formal constraints of models or foresights tend to format our ability to assess and act upon food insecurity. A sociological analysis of knowledge infrastructures thus helps to democratise food policies. Third, technosciences are embedded in dense fields of meaning, moral values and contribute to the making of sociotechnical imaginaries. The articles in this issue show that food security research is not just about knowledge, but also about how life ought to be lived. Last, food security articulates science with politics and policies. In particular, the debates about technologies are complemented by disputes about the regulations that should encourage or oppositely restrict their implementation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many countries have suffered from a lack of long-term strategy for international joint R&amp;D, which triggered foreign resources that have not been strategically utilised, through supporting short-term projects with a small sum, bottom-up approach. Thus, this article aims to develop international cooperation maps, considering relations with South Korea, through analysing factors for international cooperation and creating a strategy for international cooperation for a group of nations. In order to develop the cooperation maps, the current status of individual countries will be investigated on the basis of their science and technology policy, technical capability, scale of market and state of cooperation with South Korea. After defining cooperation-related factors in conjunction with a test of validity regarding each factor, the international cooperation map is developed by combining diverse factors for cooperation. Then, all countries are clustered with cooperative factors and international cooperation maps, and an international cooperation strategy will be created for each country by considering critical elements including technology fields and methods for cooperation. The results will be helpful for understanding new directions to go towards for international cooperation at the government and private level and for suggesting diverse strategies from the perspective of possible cooperative activities. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Bounded Futures: Growing a Boundary Foreknowledge Infrastructure in Food Security Research",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> One preferred way of coping with the openness or indeterminacy of future is to elaborate ‘fictional expectations’ that enable action by defining possible outcomes. In this article, I propose to focus on the career of the impact foresight model to analyse how agro-economists combine imaginaries, narratives, data and calculative technologies addressing the long-term future of agriculture. Impact is a partial equilibrium model, which has become increasingly comprehensive. Its modular structure now enables it to interweave scenarios produced by other legitimate institutions, and to run simulations for a number of configurations of climate change and socio-economic evolutions. </jats:p><jats:p> In this article, foresight models are taken to be material discursive devices. My argument is that their evolutions as technologies and the framing of the future they operate should not be analysed separately. Transforming radical uncertainty into controlled variability – magnitude of change, they explicitly endeavour to ‘bound’ uncertainty. But it is ‘bounded’ in a way that is highly dependent on the knowledge infrastructure upon which the models rely. Quantified modelling also makes it possible for economists to compare rival models and create alignments or negotiate zones of consensus, that is, a certain form of knowledge on the future. In the case under scrutiny, technological choices and data processing work contribute to reinforce a certain point of view – market, production and technology-oriented – on food security. Studying infrastructure and model design therefore allows a better understanding of path dependency and cognitive lock-in effects regarding the way the future is envisaged and narrated. </jats:p>",

The fi ndings support the theoretical implications of the positive and robust impact of trade liberalisation on firm performance. The study reveals that while more trade liberalisation is conducive to better firm performance, increasing the share of skilled labour is the key for firms to achieve higher potential output in the long-run rather than using more unskilled labour, which is relatively more abundant in Vietnam. The policy implication is that more attention should be paid by policymakers to provide incentives and support for firms to facilitate upgrading the skills of their workers through different means such as on-the-job training. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Chinese policymakers have witnessed great efforts in building indigenous innovation-led economy as well as a deep interest in promoting outward strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) as a major approach to acquire advanced technological know-how. Although debates take place regarding whether the governmental promotion of strategic M&amp;As has an impact on the particular responsiveness of Chinese enterprises in terms of innovation activities, most studies use input or output additionality approaches that directly measure either the additional investment in innovation or the innovation output in the form of commercial benefits. The adoption of these approaches has led to inconclusive results. In this article, we assess the relationship between the governmental promotion and enterprises’ responses using a behavioural additionality approach. The findings show that China’s outward strategic M&amp;A policy is likely to increase enterprises’ willingness to venture abroad, extend their international innovation networks, change their focus on innovation and, last but not least, enhance the learning capacity of Chinese government. We conclude that outward strategic M&amp;As is an avenue to achieve the innovation-led economy in China. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the difference in the effects of innovation modes on innovation capabilities dividing various collaborative activities conducted by venture firms with science-based partners into innovation modes. Venture firms that relatively lack the resources and capabilities for innovation perform various collaborative activities such as marketing support and management support as well as research and development collaboration with science-based partners. However, this has not received proper attention in the literature on open innovation. We classified venture firms according to innovation modes and compared each group through a multi-treatment model. As a result, we found that there was a difference in the impact on innovation capability according to the innovation mode with science-based partners. This study contributes to enriching the empirical bodies of open innovation research. In addition, it suggests that there is a need for a portfolio approach considering the innovation modes by establishing policies at the level of collaborative activities in supporting the collaboration of venture firms. </jats:p>",

The findings show that the increase of wealth has not propelled a large number of farmers at the research sites to adopt the Internet even though they can afford computers and network facilities. Instead, Internet adoption and usage are closely connected with rural entrepreneurs and their private enterprises. The three rural entrepreneurs covered in the study started to experiment with the Internet long before their peers, especially at a time when the advantages of the technology had not fully demonstrated themselves. On account of their favourable attitudes towards technologies and relatively strong command of financial resources, the venturesome rural pioneers are more likely to stand up to the possible risks associated with Internet adoption. They act as gatekeepers when imparting innovative information carried over the Internet to rural people nearby. Their adoption behaviours may influence how people perceive the Internet and let the benefits derived from the Internet trickle down to those non–adopters. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an open innovation (OI) paradigm, universities are considered as important sources of external scientific knowledge for industry, and comparative study of such collaboration can result in more effective and efficient employment of OI. Within this framework, this study explores how the determinants of collaboration between industry and universities in an open context of innovation are addressed by firms within industrial areas. For this purpose, a conceptual framework of industry–university determinants in an open context of innovation is developed from the related literature. Taking into consideration the determinants integrated into the framework, this study compares motives, barriers, channels of knowledge transfer, benefits and drawbacks of such collaboration in two Italian and Romanian industrial areas. Comparative differences in each OI determinant between the firms from the two Italian and Romanian industrial areas are analysed. The associations among the study determinants are also investigated based on correlation matrices among the five determinants in both Italian and Romanian firms. An artificial intelligence approach based on fuzzy logic was developed to predict the impact of the study determinants on the perception of universities as a source for OI activities of firms. </jats:p>",

Based upon an analysis of the documentation related to his arrest and expulsion, this article analyses the articulation of different operations of control. A chain of public interventions and governmental actions makes the substance of the management of digital expression in Nepal and this has to be analysed with tools from media studies and science and technology studies. We present different operative regimes: Twitter accounts and discussions, police action and arrests, and court petitions. We analyse how operational levels are connected and how their interconnections lead to the criminalisation of one individual, most notably through the reformulations of the accusations by different groups of people via different devices. This in turn shows how specific technical interventions determine the control of the public space. These analyses then add to the debate upon the ‘digital public sphere’ by offering a critique of its spatial metaphor from a view focused on its performative stakes—public spaces not as sites of discussion, but as theatres of operations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Vibraimage is a digital system that quantifies a subject’s mental and emotional state by analysing video footage of the movements of their head. Vibraimage is used by police, nuclear power station operators, airport security and psychiatrists in Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, and has been deployed at two Olympic Games, a FIFA World Cup and a G7 Summit. Yet there is no reliable empirical evidence for its efficacy; indeed, many claims made about its effects seem unprovable. What exactly does vibraimage measure and how has it acquired the power to penetrate the highest profile and most sensitive security infrastructure across Russia and Asia? </jats:p><jats:p> I first trace the development of the emotion recognition industry, before examining attempts by vibraimage’s developers and affiliates scientifically to legitimate the technology, concluding that the disciplining power and corporate value of vibraimage are generated through its very opacity, in contrast to increasing demands across the social sciences for transparency. I propose the term ‘suspect artificial intelligence (AI)’ to describe the growing number of systems like vibraimage that algorithmically classify suspects/non-suspects, yet are themselves deeply suspect. Popularising this term may help resist such technologies’ reductivist approaches to ‘reading’—and exerting authority over—emotion, intentionality and agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews the evolution of startup ecosystem development in Thailand from the early 2010s to the beginning of 2020s. We summarise our findings and provide critical analyses about the innovation development in Thailand, using internal and external sources of information about Thailand’s innovation strategies, policies, and case studies. We also include macro-level national policies and changes in the government that affect the foundation of Thailand’s startup ecosystem, including the mechanisms that drive the growth of the ecosystem. We argue for the decentralisation of innovation policies and ecosystems to help navigate through new challenges and uncertainties, for the recovery of socio-economic factors. Different types and examples of startups that are key to the decentralisation of innovations in Thailand are also explained and illustrated. Impediments and caveats of innovation ecosystem development in Thailand are discussed, pointing the directions for future research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This short essay explores some of the issues at stake when science and technology studies (STS) are situated within a global frame. Global, in this reading, is both historical and aspirational. As historical, it rejects the East-West dichotomy, insisting instead on one world as the outcome of multiple unequal and uneven world-making processes. As aspirational, to consider what a global STS would look like this essay imagines a world where technology studies were invented in the megacities of the Global South. At once it becomes clear that familiar concepts need revision: illegibility gets added to legibility, repair and dismantling join production and construction, permanence and impermanence occupy the same register of privilege. Making particular what had been considered general forces a reconsideration of the objects, methods, boundaries and histories of our studies. This is further demonstrated by a comparison of hybridity/isation as it is understood respectively in STS and post-colonial studies. What becomes apparent is the relative absence of violence as a core STS concept, notwithstanding its centrality in the making of the modern world. Going global exposes intellectual foundations STS scholars have been unable or unwilling to acknowledge; this alone makes the exercise productive and worthwhile. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Walking as Embodied Research: Coloniality, Climate Change, and the ‘Arts of Noticing’",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Walking is the speed for noticing….’ In 2014, I began convening walking seminars together with the researcher Christian Ernsten and the documentary photographer Dirk-Jan Visser. Each seminar involves a mix of scholars, artists, curators and activists and results in various work: journal articles, musical scores, photographic essays, and creative non-fiction. This chapter sets out the thinking behind the walking seminars, drawing on a variety of sources: recent interventions in the environmental humanities, decolonial thinking and practice, arts-based research methods and ideas around embodied research and the senses. Not least, it draws on the long history of writing about walking as a way through which to engage the world and intervene in social scenarios. As we enter the ambiguous new epoch of the Anthropocene, and as familiar landscapes change and degrade, we need—more than ever—to pay attention, to notice, to take care. For scholars, this arguably involves leaving the ‘white cube’ of the seminar room for more materially involved and implicated forms of engagement with our research subjects. The humble, everyday act of walking offers one route towards such modes of engagement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With business today relying increasingly more on collaboration, new product development is also on a network base. The concept of innovation ecosystem is built upon knowledge creating and sharing across companies, knowledge institutions, policy regimes, business enterprises and industry boundaries. China as the largest emerging market has witnessed innovation with interaction among government, university, industry and research. Though government plays an important role in promoting innovation, not many studies have covered the detailed dynamic process and impact of policy on forming innovation ecosystem, especially in places where initial knowledge resources such as universities and research institutes are limited. Therefore, our article aims to fill in this research gap. Through document review and case study on Changzhou region of China,<jats:sup> 1 </jats:sup> we map out the local government policy concerns and changes during each stage of innovation ecosystem formation, development and expansion from 2001 to 2015.

Further research areas are recommended with implication and conclusion. </jats:p>",

An impressive science and technology system inherited from over sixty years of being embedded in the former Soviet economy has been placed under con siderable financial pressure during the reform process. As market reforms deepen, a major challenge for government planners is to maintain the inherent strengths of their science system and turn its potential technology development capabilities towards national priorities for socio-economic development. While the Mongolian government has recently introduced an array of new legislation to underpin S&amp;T policy for the twenty-first century, the task of setting out a plan of action still remains. In order to assist the Mongolian government to meet these challenges, UNESCO has funded a project to prepare a National Master Plan for Science and Technology Policy.

I have adopted an agent based modelling to analyse dynamic interaction between market participants. To derive the analytical results close to the current, realistic context of Korea, I have used real statistical data from government agencies and private institutions. The analysis results show that the investigated factors affect consumer-purchase. Especially, vehicle price change has highly significant influence on the market share of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in Korea. Subsidy/penalty policy of Korea turns out to have rather less effect on HEV penetration. Furthermore, unlike the research findings for other countries, fuel price changes do not nearly affect the penetration rate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the late 1980s, the business incubator model in China has been evolving—from the early traditional model that focused mainly on providing basic services, such as office space and one-stop administrative services, to an emerging value chain model (value position, value creation, value transfer and value capture), which efficiently combines the profits of an incubator with the success of its incubating tenant ventures. This article analyses the case of ‘Innovation Works’, which is one of the pioneers of the value chain model in China. It raises the following research questions: (a) how does the incubator business model evolve over time in China? (b) What differentiates the value chain business incubator model from the traditional model? (c) What are the critical elements that contribute to the success of a value chain business incubator model? Using primary data gathered through interviews, on-site visits and surveys, the study found that the incubator business model in China has been reshaping towards more complex value propositions and more efficient value chain models. The study also found that specialisation, flat organisational structure and professional management team are the critical elements that contribute to the success or efficient performance of the value chain business incubator model. This article makes significant contributions to the literature and draws policy implications for future business incubator development—both in China and in other emerging economies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The triple helix of university–industry–government relations has been accepted as a significant determiner of innovation. For the economic progress of the industrialised nations, the cooperation between academia and industry is terribly crucial. For the purpose of profit maximisation by means of such cooperation, achieving a healthy and productive cooperation is of vital importance. Science and technology (S&amp;T) cooperation platform is an original cooperative mode in East China, which is similar to the technology transfer office. This article researches the cooperation relation and makes a thorough inquiry of the influence of cooperation on high-tech firms. Based on an investigation of 552 high-tech firms and 56 universities, we found that the high-tech firms can improve economic situation via the cooperation with universities on the platform. Moreover, principal discoveries demonstrate that the economic performance of high-tech firms is positively related with the co-operation projects. Furthermore, with a view to making policies and raising probable improvements to cooperative efficiency between academia and industry, this study also finds that high-tech firms selecting distinct cooperation models on the platform will bring different effects on the economic performance of firms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite business model innovation (BMI) being considered the primary factor to ensure the survival and success of firms in a turbulent environment, comprehensive empirical studies of the antecedents of BMI based on crisis management and disaster management are limited. This study develops a theoretical framework and integrates internal and external factors of drivers of BMI to explore how organisational resilience and network embeddedness impact BMI and its underlying mechanism with Chinese unique empirical evidence under the crisis. We distinguish three dimensions (robustness, agility and integrity) of organisational resilience and two dimensions (structural and relational embeddedness) of network embeddedness. The results validate that robustness and agility can significantly promote BMI. Likewise, both structural and relational embeddedness have a significant positive association with BMI. Besides, organisational learning capacity mediates the relationship between organisational resilience, network embeddedness and BMI. This study contributes to research on BMI and provides theoretical guidance for organisations to leverage BMI to cope with crisis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Issues related to the existence of low-level radiation in the environment, in food and on farms have added significant problems to the already problem-ridden reconstruction efforts that Japan faces after the crisis in March 2011. Radiation-related issues have brought to the surface hitherto hidden fault lines within society, especially the rifts in the varied interpretations of risk. Despite the deepseated concerns that some people have about the presence of ionised radiation, overt public objections are rarely seen nor heard. Against this backdrop, this article asks the question why the lay public, particularly victims of the disaster, is not more vocal in objecting and expressing concerns. The analysis sheds light on the social conditions that tend to suppress the expression of concern. The data are drawn from in-depth interviews with farmers and consumers in Fukushima and participant observations in public forums and seminars that concern radiation of food and farms. The study indicates that various forms of social control exist within the phenomenon which the author calls ‘scientification of food and agriculture’. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Can Government Policies Drive Open Innovation Type Platforms? Ideas from the MSC Malaysia Flagship Applications",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The discussion of open innovation has always been centred on the organisation where innovation occurs. The focus would be on the inflow and outflow of knowledge into the organisation; several studies and cases published have addressed the concept around business (or government) organisations and their research and development (R&amp;D) activities. The open innovation framework is based on a focal organisation, which is usually a business organisation that provides a platform for other organisations to collaborate—either helping the focal organisation to commercialise its knowledge and gain economic benefits or vice versa. This notion, we argue, is where an open innovation platform is ‘supplier-driven’, that is, ‘supplier’ indicating the focal organisation where innovation occurs. In this article, however, we propose an alternate framework for open innovation, that is, one that is ‘customer-driven’ where the customer organisation or demand-creating organisation provides a platform for open innovation. This alternate notion is derived from the case of the flagship applications of Malaysia’s Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC Malaysia). The MSC Malaysia flagships can be seen as open innovation type platforms established by the customer, that is, the Malaysian government—which provides the demand pull for creating an open-innovation platform. This framework of a ‘customer-driven’ open innovation platform could provide lessons for other emerging economies to understand how their governments can play a more active role, as policymaker and demand-generating entity, to create a platform for open innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "AT PRESENT, THE concepts of industrial clusters and innovation systems have gained a worldwide popularity among policy makers at transnational, national, regional and local levels, and among consultants and business people. In the developed and developing countries, policy makers are keen on implementing these concepts as tools aimed at enhancing competitive advantage and economic sustainability in particular places. To some degree, clusters and innovation systems replace standard economic approaches to economic development and growth. This is much needed as theories that primarily focus on resource allocation provide only a limited insight into the organisation of innovative activities. Innovative activities—despite displaying institutional, industryand firmspecific differences—increasingly constitute the backbone of any nation’s, region’s and firm’s economic development and growth. They also determine a firm’s competitiveness. The attractiveness of clusters and innovation systems stems from the attention paid to localised collective and/or interactive learning and knowledge spillovers.",

    "abstract": "Modem forestry practices in India started in the mid-nineteenth century with an intention of sustainable management of forests. But after more than a century of management, the condition of forests deteriorated rather than improving. The green area shrank at an alarming rate and this forced the government to reconsider its policy. The social forestry project thus emerged as an alternative. It was conceptualised as a programme of regenerating village forests. However, it could not break free from the dominant practices of modern forestry and failed to achieve what it was meant for. Eva Cheung Robinson’s Greening at the Grassroots attempts to explore factors responsible for this failure. Robinson, who herself was involved in an agroforestry project in Andhra Pradesh, offers rich and deep insights to the working of social forestry. Officially, social forestry was aimed at solving the fuel wood crisis of rural areas by regenerating village forests. It subsequently acquired broader social role-that of ameliorating the conditions of rural people. The author, however, finds officially stated objectives of social forestry rhetorical. She suggests that various other factors played a crucial role in the inception of the social forestry scheme. Issues of ecology, poverty and development were receiving international attention in the early 1970s. With an intention to gamer international funding for the forestry sector, the government launched a programme. As was expected, funds poured in, which reflected in an increased allocation to the forest sector in the",

The other feature this paper will examine is where islands of research have emerged.

Petrobras is a global leader in the field of deepwater oil production technology and so offers an interesting opportunity to investigate whether government procurement in developing countries is used to promote the capability of domestic firms to develop innovations. The article presents the findings of a field survey on P-51, a platform that was ordered by the Brazilian state-owned enterprise and began producing in 2009. The case study is based on information collected from interviews with managers of Petrobras, EPC contractors and some of the firms subcontracted to work on P-51. </jats:p>",

The empirical findings reveal that bilateral linkages and partnerships—mostly between government and public sector research institutions, including universities—seem to be more relevant and meaningful than tripartite relationships. Even though scientists now do seem to be positively oriented to commercialisation of knowledge and accord high importance to it, they continue to assign equally high importance to publications compared to patenting. Our study reveals that scientists in universities and national research institutions lack adequate and effective institutional and organisational framework and mechanisms that foster commercialisation of knowledge. In conclusion, the study attempts to underscore some policy measures that will catalyse triple helix-based partnerships in context of biotechnology sector in India. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article presents some results of a research carried out in the Mexican chemical industry, with the objective of reflecting on the capacities and the weaknesses of technological learning and firms' innovative behaviour. After defining in an operative way the notion of technological learning, we propose a taxonomy based on a multifactorial analysis which makes it possible to combine all the variables that we have chosen as indicators of technological learning and innovation. The principal finding is that the companies that have more 'technological' linkages with their environment and greater accumulation of technological capabilities paradoxically show relatively less innovative activity than other types of firms. Some exploratory hypotheses are offered by way of explanation. </jats:p>",

In the previous chapters, Prasad argues that isolation, marginalisation, deprivation and tribal identity developed together, but now she argues that exploitative efforts to mainstream tribal groups into Hindutva capitalism demand ‘linking the fight for a secular-democratic nation with the fight against the integration of tribal economies into the global economy’ (p. 101). If we imagine the present as part of history, perhaps her argument could be turned around and projected back into the past to suggest that people trapped in the social category of ‘tribal’ in India have been torn historically between isolation and integration. For individuals, groups and whole populations, agency has pushed and pulled between isolation, autonomy and stable group integrity on the one hand, and integration, subordination and assimilation on the other. For some, Hindutva may be an attractive option, as Christianity and Islam have been in the past. Fighting communalism and globalisation may be a good idea, but saving tribal peoples from them is not a good reason.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The onset of constitutional democracy in South Africa potentially marked a critical juncture in the evolution of its innovation system. At this point the Ministry responsible for science and technology adopted the innovation systems approach. This adoption followed the IDRC OECD-style review of 1993. Nineteen years later, after a full-fledged OECD Review, the extent to which the innovation system demonstrates continuity or change may be assessed. The assessment is broadly functionalist and considers the role of institutions and actors. While the polity has become more inclusive, extractive economic institutions persist. Likewise the social contract between science and society has evolved but it continues to show extractive attributes. It appears that thus far the innovation systems approach has been more of a rhetorical than a practical device with the pre-1994 and present innovation systems showing both continuity and disjuncture. It is these challenges that the current Ministerial Review of the STI Landscape ( DST 2012 ) has sought to address. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on a qualitative study, the present article examines the social organisation of knowledge production in the software work in India. The two sample firms located in Chennai city, India representing contrasting images about nature of software work were studied: a branch of a large domestic software services company—low-end programming/Fordist production model; and an Indian subsidy of a multinational software product firm—high-end software product development/flexible production model. The social organisation of software production in the two software firms are hierarchically organised, but demonstrated differential flexibility to meet the emerging market or client demands, and exhibited autonomy at the employees’ level to use craft and technological knowledge through organisational procedures and routines, mediated through the project managers. It appears that prolonged engagement with the same technologies or projects works as impediment to the learning process or new knowledge production. The self-interest of the programmers motivates to engage in new knowledge production despite being directed by the organisations. The accumulated knowledge is kept within the organisations by retaining the employees through periodic pecuniary and non-pecuniary rewards, and possibilities of career leaps through technological breakthroughs. The external agents are brought in for new knowledge acquisition either through informal learning by doing or through upgradation of technological skills through training. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Population-based biobanks collect donors’ biological samples and associated data, following them over time to study gene–environment interactions as causes of human diseases. International biobank collaboration is envisioned as necessary for a better understanding of causes of morbidity and mortality. However, determining how to govern international biobank collaboration remains challenging due to nations’ heterogeneous ethical and legal frameworks. This article explores how China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), a China-UK collaborative project, coped with ethical issues, such as informed consent, benefit sharing and community engagement. The CKB case study provides insights into ethical issues and governance challenges for international biobank collaboration. The transformation of biobank research from a localised endeavour to networked, internationalised projects in the context of post-genomic medical research has created a highly challenging constellation for biobank governance. The governance of global collaboration, such as between China and the UK, will depend on developing joint governance protocols based on mutual recognition and respect. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we analyse the mechanisms by which family farming established itself in Argentina over the 2004–2016 period as a legitimate solution to the food security challenge. We show that this process has played a role in the emergence of an alternative sociotechnical imaginary built as a counter-model to the one associated with industrial agriculture. We highlight the importance of the processes of demarcation and detachment at the heart of this shift, in the political, techno-scientific and agricultural spheres. The actors involved in the promotion of family farming associate this alternative approach to the development of the agricultural sector with the implementation of an alternative practice and organisation of science and technology. These shifts correspond to a narrative and mode of political action that put the emphasis on the production of a national future liberated from the mistakes and injustices of the past, in which science and technology play a central role. By highlighting the tensions at the heart of this dynamic, between the establishment of new boundaries and the challenging of existing ones, the article contributes to the analysis of the formation of alternative sociotechnical imaginaries, and in particular the underlying mechanisms of co-production between science and politics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores Japanese perceptions of nuclear technology from 1945 to 1956, the early stage of the introduction of nuclear technology, by using discourses of the government and of antinuclear civil movements. It is based on the theoretical framework that discourses construct social perceptions of science and technology. For this purpose, statements such as official documents of the Japanese government and declarations made by the antinuclear movement were used as main resources of analysis. This article finds that various technological aspects influenced the formation of the Japanese nuclear technological system. In addition, the Japanese government tried to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons. It tried to justify its ‘peaceful use of nuclear power’ by portraying itself as the sole victim of nuclear weapons while hiding its intention to develop nuclear weapons. Moreover, the nuclear safety myth was formed at the beginning of the introduction of nuclear technology. As a result, we can see that in Japan, the nuclear safety myth was growing from the beginning of the introduction of nuclear technology amid a dichotomous understanding of good and bad uses of nuclear power and the desire to enter an advanced state of science and technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the societal and structural risks linked to digital ID programmes in Africa and the adequacy of regulatory and legislative responses that are in progress in this area. It unpacks the disjointedness between the societal and structural nature of the risks and the individualistic orientation of the right to privacy and data protection often presented as a response to such risks. To address these incongruities, the article argues for people’s right to privacy as a complementary layer of protection to mitigate the societal and structural risks associated with digital ID programmes. The account of people’s privacy proposed in this article draws on the people-centric African perspective on human rights as reflected in the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (the Banjul Charter), African philosophy that is rooted in communality, scholarships in the area of group privacy, people-centric due diligence assessment, and the AU Data Policy Framework. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Introduction of biotechnologies, particularly genetically modified (GM) technologies, have led to varying public responses from the government, general public and concerned farmers who use the technological products at the field level. Introduction of Bt cotton in India over the last five years generated considerable debate from the time open field testing of Bt cotton commenced towards the late 1990s. This paper is a modest attempt to map the contours of this debate and analyse it from a sociological perspective of the actors. Most significantly, actors in government and industries express trust in the ar rangements governing biotechnology, while actors in civil society point out problems with the functioning of the relevant governing bodies. We first present a brief overview of the events of the controversy, and then proceed with the body of our study. </jats:p>",

The main objective was to overcome the shortcomings of Brazil’s conventional STI public policies, the technological and innovation results of which were considered unsatisfactory. EMBRAPII innovates in governance and funding, regarded as an instrument capable of boosting companies’ engagement in collaborative technology and innovation projects. This article concludes by acknowledging EMBRAPII’s evident qualities with respect to the conventional STI policies, even though its achievements seems lower than expected in terms of the number of companies involved. The research findings endorse Ergas’ assumption that policies cannot be assessed in isolation. ‘The first and most fundamental is the dependence of technology policy outcomes on their economic and institutional environment.…’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Climate change is taken as a new site of scientific inquiry across the disciplines against the backdrop of the global discourses of the crisis human society confronts today. Our inability to predict and forecast the future and the problems of climate change led to a theoretical vacuum and thereby burden on the scientific communities. Climate change-induced uncertainties manifested in the manifold and their implications on human society, livelihood and ecosystem have increasingly become the objects of analysis for devising empirical tools for field enquiry. It challenges the specificities while looking at the events of uncertainties in context. The new set of evidence on climate change has also redefined the role of the scientific community. This paper discusses climate-related events in the lives of people and the changes in the ecosystem and explores how such factors became an object of scientific inquiry. With the ideas of political ecology, the domain of scientific practices is transformed into an arena of co-production of knowledge in which place, social context and agencies become central. This study explores (1) how the scientific community adapted to outline an interdisciplinary research programme to systematically investigate and register climate-change-affected areas and (2) how the local people in Ladakh Himalaya have participated and reflected on the changing pattern of livelihood and ecosystem through this research enquiry. It has further complicated the analysis on nature-culture dialectics to adapt a robust scientific method to signify the importance of mutual learning and knowledge co-production in climate science. </jats:p>",

Publishing-one of the traditional forms of communication-is, therefore, central to the development of a society. This volume of key readings focuses on the broad theme of publishing and development, and provides insights into the challenges facing the book publishing industry in developing nations. Among the various themes discussed is the increasingly common use of hi-tech methods in the publishing industry, which has put the developing countries at a disadvantage. Besieged by numerous problems, these countries do not give importance to the development of a small industry like publishing, thus endangering indigenous publishing houses. In addition, since developing countries are dependent on the developed world for new technologies, they are in danger of losing their autonomy and control over the communication of relevant",

    "abstract": "plasma containing 40 per cent of the normal amount of prothrombin might give a 100 per cent prothrombin estimate by this method. Furthermore, in carrying out the test, such factors as fibrinogen, prothrombin accelerator, and the various anticoagulation substances are uncontrolled. The two stage method, which allows the prothrombin conversion to go to completion, and then in a second step permits the thrombin thus formed to act on a standardized fibrinogen solution, eliminates a number of the variables present in the one stage test. The chief objection to it is that it is difficult to perform. The two stage test is a more accurate measure of available prothrombin, while the one stage test gives more information regarding the likelihood of bleeding, since it is a measure of the activity of a number of factors, both coagulation and anticoagulation. As an estimate of liver function, both methods are of value, although the two stage test, being a more sensitive reflection of changes in prothrombin, may show degrees of liver damage not registered by the one stage test. With regard to the control of anticoagulant therapy, the one stage method is a more sensitive measure of heparin effect than the more commonly used coagulation time of whole blood. In dicumarol therapy, efforts are directed toward the control of the single factor, prothrombin, and the two stage method is preferable. However, the one stage test is of value as a measure of the overall safety factor. ABRAMSON",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Several governments around the world have developed new ways of registering citizens when it comes to their relations with the state administration. Contemporary practices of identification through databases open up new ways of institutional and governmental practices across various sectors. In France, the tax administration had become the flagship of the whole French e-government project. The first case study focuses on the Copernicus project, which rapidly raised concerns about the implications of identification practices for taxpayers/citizens/households/individuals through unique identifiers. The Indian case study focuses on the National Register of Citizens as a citizen identification infrastructure, the processes of trying to categorise a diverse demography into citizens and non-citizens, and the subsequent issues that arise around different claims to citizenship. Taking these two case studies, this article discusses two national databases in France (tax administration) and India (citizenship), respectively, as examples of contemporary state practices around digital identification infrastructures as a form of database politics to enforce accountable forms of citizen practices through which different forms of data driven institutional and sociotechnical processes are marking new changes in the state–citizen relationship, both in France and in India. </jats:p>",

Anthropologists were the only exception, though their main interest was in the ritual significance of trees in various cultures. Foresters have a century-old tradition of silviculture but they were primarily interested in timber trees grown on government lands. Even those who studied the forest as the site of tribal or peasant rebellion or as an arena of conflicting choices over the environment did not really investigate trees in the fields in any serious way. Of late, a new group of researchers has attempted to do just that. Their focus, as the editors of this volume indicate, is on what cultivators think about trees. This is a set of",

This study used Bayesian Network Analysis (BNA) to examine the relationship between innovation factors such as information acquisition, research and development, government support system, product innovation and business process innovation using the 2020 Korean Innovation survey (KIS) data. As a result of the analysis, it confirmed that various factors and innovation had a direct or indirect relationship. For example, it found Government tax support, collaborative R&amp;D and information from private research institutes to play an essential role in innovation, and other factors indirectly affect innovation through these factors.

In the process, they rejected China as a model of civilisation, considering it merely despotic, feudal or stagnant. This Eurocentric judgement has hung over all subsequent thinking about China, even influencing Chinese perceptions of their own history.

As this study will show, the emphasis on the delivery of medical care in the dependent British Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century created conditions for the domestication of tropical disease research in the twentieth cen tury. A large pool of underemployed medical practitioners in Britain enabled the Colonial Office to satisfy the personnel needs of its far-flung empire. Colonial governments, in turn, maximised the labour of imperial doctors as primary care providers through a wide range of administrative tools. This emphasis simultaneously retarded the development of labora tory research into disease in the periphery while creating an opportunity for its metropolitan appropriation. Eventually the Tropical Disease Research Fund was created to promote the understanding of disease in the empire by subsidising laboratory science in Britain. </jats:p>",

It examines issues pertaining to innovation in indigenous systems of medicine (ISM) in contemporary India, with specific reference to siddha medicine. Drawing upon Kuhn’s theory of growth of scientific knowledge, the paper argues that only innovations within an epistemic tradition contribute to its incremental growth. On the other hand, innovations that happen in the interstices of distinct epistemic models of the body, such as the case with the laboratory trials of indigenous medical formulae, are not likely to lead to cumulative growth of ISM, even if they contribute to the biotechnology sector. The argument is set out by foregrounding the career of different kinds of practitioners of siddha medicine, showing how innovation between scientific traditions becomes invisible because of the absence of institutional closure on the norms of discovery and verification in ISM. </jats:p>",

Drawing on the case of Kazakhstan, the article discusses how the development of the space industry has been accompanied by the government’s efforts to indigenise space techno-science, while public discourses promote a vision of space services as playing a key role in addressing some of society’s major problems. The article reflects on new challenges faced by emergent space nations like Kazakhstan in the context of the ongoing commercialisation of space services, which undermines the economic viability of investment in the national space infrastructure, such as satellites. The analysis of ongoing challenges and policy dilemmas reveals that space techno-science in the context of emerging space nations can be seen as an instrument serving to consolidate state sovereignty, as well as the ground where this sovereignty has been put to the test. </jats:p>",

The book begins with a comprehensive introduction by the editors, which focuses on the concept of ’community participation’ in forest conservation. They argue that a ’new moral economy’ is in the process of being evolved. In recognising the legitimacy of ’local’ involvement, JFM policies and strategies tend to impose new, limited rights and understand customary claims selectively due to distorted notions of who constitutes a ’community’, and why and what constitutes ’participation’ in natural resource management. The essays that follow take up a variety of important topics, such",

Science fiction is one of the fascinated genres of the Indian film industry. Incorporating science concepts in plots with the usual commercial elements provides a unique platform for the creators. This hybridisation by the creators instigates imagination among the audience. This paper explains the scientific concepts handled in the sci-fi genre of contemporary Tamil cinema (2010–2020). The study aims to track down how science concepts are dealt with in contemporary Tamil films. Films are classified into five categories based on the themes identified from the plots. A survey was conducted among the Tamil audience to know their opinion about Tamil sci-fi films. </jats:p>",

SINCE THE 1970s historians and sociologists of science developed a strong interest in scientific practices. The pioneering study of Ludwik Fleck (1979), Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact, provide a model of such practice-oriented studies. In addition, however, this paper argues, another and less known aspect of Fleck’s thought is his proposal to pay attention not only to all the data and ’facts’ present in a given scientific record, but also to those that are absent from that record. The latter problem, I propose, is especially important for students of non-Western science and for those interested in inter-",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In today's new media landscape, consuming media content is only part of the equation. Media consumers also enjoy various avenues by which they can produce and share media content. This combination of consuming and producing has been termed ‘prosuming’. Rather than being the preserve of the intellectual elite, virtually any media consumer can be a media producer too given the relative affordability and accessibility of new ICT and media platforms. Media production is satisfying because it allows individuals to flex their creative energies and empowering because it enables people to make their views heard. Focusing on media literacy programmes targeted at developing country youth, this article analyses media literacy programmes that impart media production skills. Specifically, it looks at the Little Masters programme in China, the Cybermohalla programme in India, and the Young Journalists (YOJO) Group in Vietnam. The article finds that media literacy programmes that emphasise media production may have more significant long-term impacts as they vest young people with the abilities to voice their concerns and raise public awareness about youth-related issues. The media literacy skills imparted are, therefore, imbued with the potential for social activism and democratisation. The experiences of the Little Masters, Cybermohalla and YOJO programmes also suggest a few strategies for heightened success–sensitivity to the social and cultural contexts of the participants, building up a sufficiently wide base of community support, and leveraging media convergence to increase their impact. </jats:p>",

It shows the complex nature of the research partners at each node of a network, and of the structure and dynamics of the interaction that results. The study suggests that we need to open up the ideal enshrined in South African policy, of the desirability of research partnerships, to more informed analysis of the complexity of creating networks, in specific industrial sub-sectors, knowledge fields and institutional contexts. The major insight offered for developing countries like South Africa is the value of a contextualised analysis for informing cross-sectoral coordination of interventions within a national system of innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article explores the rise, regulation and risks of genetically modified (GM) insect technology in global agriculture. It contributes to the debate on the nexus of science, technology and food security in Science and Technology Studies from an International Relations perspective. The study locates GM insect technology within the context of conceptual debates about global agriculture, transnational entrepreneurship and the pooling of different sources of political authority. It introduces the pooling of political authority as a potential causal mechanism that transmits biotechnical innovations and entrepreneurship to the spread of GM insect technology in the global agri-food regime. The study focusses, especially on Oxitec Limited, the most important business entrepreneur in the field. The empirical findings reveal that Oxitec has pooled moral and technical political authority and has influenced the global rise and regulation of GM insect technology. The contribution discusses the implications of Oxitec’s entrepreneurial involvement and identifies the three key challenges concerning the global regulation of GM insect technology: the transboundary scope, the provision of transparency, and the assessment of risks. Finally, the study outlines future areas of research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The focus of this article is to examine the extent to which firms in the electronics industry in Malaysia and Brazil (Manaus) have developed significant levels of innovative technological capabilities (TCs). By examining whether innovative capabilities have spread to these two late-industrialising countries, the article seeks to add new evidence to the debate of globalisation of innovative capabilities and to argue against existing generalisations. It draws on empirical evidence from eighty-two electronics firms—TNC subsidiaries and local firms: fifty-three in Malaysia (twenty-five in Penang and twenty-eight in Klang Valley) and twenty-nine in Manaus (Northern Brazil). Contrary to common generalisations, the study has found that the capabilities of most of the sampled firms in Malaysia and Manaus have been upgraded to carry out diverse types of innovative technological activities. Additionally, these capability-building efforts are strongly associated with higher capabilities for local decision making and control, automation level, and efforts to increase exports. Indeed, the study has found pockets of innovative firms that innovate to be competitive by reducing costs, being more productive, reducing lead time and producing better products—regardless of whether they are in a domestic market-oriented country or in an export-oriented country. Finally, the findings and analysis in this study challenge the relevance of some of the existing perspectives on the globalisation of innovative capabilities to the late-industrialising context. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Testing for Life? Regimes of Governance in Diagnosis and Screening",
    "abstract": "Testing—involving the analysis of blood samples or scans, colonoscopies, biopsies, or other procedures—is frequently the front door to healthcare. It often leads to further tests or treatments, perhaps hospitalisation, and sometimes unwelcome news about one’s future. Consequently, being tested is fraught with meaning and is likely to evoke strong emotional responses in those subject to its regimes, including anxiety, fear and uncertainty. What if the test comes back positive? Should one gain a second opinion? Or confirm the results by undertaking further tests? If it is negative, should one feel relieved and get on with one’s life? While testing promises certainty—providing an objective, unequivocal indicator of an underlying disease or ‘disorder’, or susceptibility to such, and a clear path to treatment and care—it tends to give rise to many uncertainties and questions. In many cases, perhaps most, it calls for further investigation involving a cascade of other tests, which raise their own questions. It creates new categories and medicalised subjects (e.g., the ‘at risk’ or the ‘genetically susceptible’) and classifications (typically deriving from finer delineations of disease) that shape treatment and preventive approaches, and may profoundly impact individuals’ sense of self and experiences of health. It almost always generates ethical dilemmas. Depending on the context, these may include ‘the right to decide’ (e.g., the individual or family in the case of tests for inheritable conditions); constraints on ‘freedom of choice’ in decision-making; what, if any action, to take on the basis of test results (especially in the case of genetic testing where test results do not equate directly with disease); and how to reconcile commercial interests with the broader ‘public good’. It also has financial consequences as there are invariably associated costs and some procedures can be very expensive—which is an important consideration in healthcare systems where issues of cost-benefit often loom large. And it has politico-economic implications: testing itself or the results may serve broader governmental policy",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the effects of plants’ dynamics on productivity growth in the Indian pharmaceutical industry across five regions, north, northwest, west, south, and the rest of India, during the period from 2000–01 to 2005–06, using the unit-level panel database drawn from the Annual Survey of Industries. The selected regions differ in the degree and age of agglomeration of the pharmaceutical industry. The empirical analysis is based on the decomposition methodology of aggregate productivity growth. This methodology decomposes productivity growth between two points in time into the contribution from four broad factors: improvement in incumbents’ productivity (within effect), reallocation of resources from less productive to more productive producers (reallocation effect), entry of more productive firms (entry effect), and exit of less productive firms (exit effect). Our empirical findings reveal that productivity growth is relatively higher in the agglomerated regions. Furthermore, the effects of plant dynamics on productivity growth differ with the age of the agglomeration. Rather large positive entry effects are found in the region where the formation of agglomeration is a recent phenomenon. In the mature region, reallocation effects of surviving plants are large and robustly positive. In other areas, however, ‘within effects’ of surviving plants are robustly positive. </jats:p>",

Over the last few years, STS studies emerged as a new discipline in its own right in the context of the developing world. With the growing maturity of scholarship in STS, both in the North and South, with the focus of research on the developing worlds, a journal devoted to this region was due for some time now. We hope that this new journal stands to fill the void and at the same time provides an appropriate professional medium for the emerging scholarly studies in STS.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the factors that influence pro-environmental behaviour intention (PEBI) in manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The data were collected from 517 executives and chief technology officers of Korean SMEs and analysed using a comprehensive research model. The model includes variables such as awareness of consequences (ACs), ascription of responsibility (AR), personal norms (PNs), extrinsic motivation (EM), subjective norms (SNs) and realistic values (RVs). The results show significant relationships between these factors and PEBI. In particular, ACs and AR have positive effects on PNs, with AR having a stronger effect. PNs are the most important predictor of PEBI. EM has a positive impact on behaviour intention, while SNs do not have a significant impact. Interestingly, RVs have a negative impact. These findings have practical implications for encouraging pro-environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs. Policymakers and business planners should focus on increasing awareness of environmental consequences and individual responsibility to reinforce PNs. Moreover, offering extrinsic rewards and benefits can motivate pro-environmental behaviour in these firms. Understanding these factors can help design targeted strategies for promoting sustainability practices within manufacturing SMEs. By addressing these aspects, businesses can contribute to environmental innovation and sustainable development. </jats:p>",

Second, to conduct convergence analysis, it studies agglomeration patterns characteristics, absolute β convergence and its converging mechanism of China’s provincial high-tech industry development performance from 2001 to 2013 by adopting a spatial autoregressive (SAR) panel data model. The results indicate distinct absolute β convergence in China’s high-tech industry development performance is due to technology diffusion.

    "title": "Agglomeration, Technology Clusters and Networks: Introduction to the Special Issue",
    "abstract": "Over the last quarter century or so, there has been an increasing global awareness of the complexities that constitute the organisation of productive activities, cluster formations and in particular, the role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Clusters differ from one another depending upon the history of emergence, nature of the product, markets and organisation of production. Industrial clusters have grown and come to stay as hubs of business activity in many countries including India. Literature in the area of clusters, by and large, attribute the presence of relatively immobile resources such as knowledge, skills, local institutions, and industrial and corporate structures and networks, as important determinants of growth-enhancing effects of agglomeration. The set of papers presented in this special issue of the journal were selected from the papers presented at the Annual Conference of the Forum for Global Knowledge Sharing (Knowledge Forum at http://FGKS.in) hosted by Goa University from 18–20 November 2011. They address various issues relating to cluster formation and differential conduct and performance of firms in different clusters. The phenomenon of geographical clusters and agglomerations is an emergent global feature. The volume presents the manifestations of this phenomenon at the levels of corporates, industrial and urban structures from an economists’ perspective. Recognising that science, technology and innovation are embedded in these clusters, the volume provokes researchers engaged in science and technology studies or STS to look at these clusters from their own disciplinary perspective. Indeed clustering phenomenon has already attracted the attention of the STS community albeit in relation to studying the output of scientific research. The findings of STS however appear to open a new dimension of research on clusters examined in this volume. We may cite here two studies that indicate the contours of this new dimension.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The research objective of our study is to find the route how the information provided in small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) supporting services in South Korea affects business performances. Investigation into business performances from SME supporting services was conducted by a survey method. The survey data was statistically analysed by using SPSS program. A research model was designed by using a mediation model. In our research model, information utilisation of SME supporting services was selected as an independent variable; contribution degree to decision-making, growth of information competitiveness and customer satisfaction were introduced as mediating variables; and SME business performances, such as contribution degree to growth of current revenue, future revenue, future export and current employment, were used as dependent variables. Correlation and regression were analysed to investigate the relationship between two variables such as independent variables versus mediating variables, independent variables versus dependent variables and mediating variables versus dependent variables. The route from information provision in SME supporting services to business performances was clarified by using Baron and Kenny’s mediation model. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ACCORDING TO THE United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 2006), Mozambique is one of the ten least developed countries of the world. Yet, cellular phones have washed over the country as a tsunami. About 17 per cent of its 20.5 million inhabitants have now access to this technology (Brouwer and Brito 2008; National Bureau of Statistics 2008). The speed with which mobile phones has been adopted—from a mere 7500 in 1997 to about 3.5 million clients in 2007—points at the extraordinary capacity of these companies to penetrate deeply in a country that is characterised by a weak physical and commercial infrastructure. Mozambique is not the only poor nation where mobile phones apparently close the digital divide. The number of users has grown worldwide but the least developed countries show the highest growth rates (Scott et al. 2004). The rapid growth of the number of users has spurred a fl ow of",

    "title": "Epilogue: The Global Horizon for Technoscience",
    "abstract": "This special issue, in a sense, is an engagement with the global. But how do we define what is global? One way to approach the global is to follow Ong and Collier’s lead and understand global phenomena as ‘abstractable, mobile, and dynamic’ forms (Ong & Collier, 2005). Their articulations in specific situations produce what they called global assemblages. The articles in this volume show a clear affinity to this framework. But this epilogue is guided by a different curiosity. Is there another sense of the global also available in this volume? These articles hint at an additional understanding of the global, in my view, as something more than a form or quality of phenomena. They harbour, in a diffused way, a notion of the global as a horizon of observation. While there is no explicit discussion of this understanding of the global in the articles, its traces can be found scattered throughout this special issue. First, let me explain their affinity to the framework of global forms. In her article in this issue, Anna Agathangelou introduces the idea of bio-financialisation. She analyses the use of DNA-based forensics to identify missing persons in war and conflict zones. This DNA-based technology is a global form in Ong and Collier’s sense, and its connection with bodies and finance allows a new kind of biofinancial evaluation to emerge. The focus shifts from the valuation of life in terms of family and suffering to the selling, collecting and assessment of biological materials. Similarly, Matthew McCarthy’s article presents a global form of the artificial intelligence (AI) systems, whose entanglement in diverse knowledge bases, interests, networks and actors produces a global techno assemblage. In Saskia Sassen’s article as well, one can extract the global form of high finance, which seems to have",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study examines the response of the Quad countries (Australia, India, Japan and the United States) to People’s Republic of China (PRC)’s predatory acquisition of foreign technologies. This article looks at PRC’s science and technology (S&amp;T) policy and its relation to the grand strategy of attaining global superpower status. The meteoric rise of the PRC in the last four decades has amazed many. Innovation and technological advancement and their alignment with government policies are important factors in this rise. The study notes that PRC’s S&amp;T policy involves, among others, acquiring foreign technologies through illicit means that include stealing through espionage and sophisticated cyberattacks and forcing overseas companies operating in China to share intellectual property rights with local partners. Alarmed by PRC’s predatory strategy, the Quad countries have taken steps to regulate, and in some cases prohibit, the PRC’s targeted foreign investments and coercive and opportunistic takeovers. The article argues that the Quad countries need to coordinate their efforts to effectively counter PRC’s illicit acquisition of their technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Though the race toward introducing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in government machinery experienced a bumpy ride in its initial years, Bangladesh has taken a firm stance in favour of ICT since late 1996. During the last one and a half decades, Bangladesh has attained some major achievements in the ICT sector along with the adoption of the vision of establishing full-fledged ICT-driven governance, that is, Digital Bangladesh. However, Bangladesh’s performance in the global e-government index is not a satisfying one. This is to say that it shows a gap between initiatives and reality. This paper, therefore, explores the aptness of ICT frameworks comprised with legal, institutional and infrastructural components in establishing ICT-driven governance in Bangladesh. The arcticle is a study of the impact of the frameworks on sampled e-governance initiatives along with challenges. This artcile concludes that the ICT endeavours require more close supervision and effective coordination across the agencies to establish full-fledged ICT-driven governance in Bangladesh. </jats:p>",

Asian econ omies with high levels of high-tech infrastructure show high per capita income levels as well as high residents' patenting levels. High-tech endowments helped Korea and Chinese Taipei to generate substantial resident patents. The transitional economies enjoyed fairly strong high-tech endowments, which was not translated into strong resident patents owing to reforms and cutbacks on funding. China, India and Pakistan show weak high- tech endowments and resident patents, but still performed better than the South-East Asian second-tier newly industrialised economics (NIEs). The Arab economies, Malaysia and Thailand enjoy strong basic infrastructure, but lack high-tech endowments and, with that, resident's patenting capabilities. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Questioning Biodiversity Governance through Its Articulations",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Biodiversity Erosion has been subjected in the last few years to a whistleblowing and agenda-setting process. This trend has led to the emergence of governance entities meant to measure this crisis and to elaborate management and control technologies. Among these, having recourse to economic tools and to the market has been one of the most salient ideas. One may wonder how relying on economy and the market in biodiversity management has imposed itself as something evident. This article aims to contribute to answer this question. Firstly, it gives a general account of the historical shift in the field of environmental governance towards market-based policies. Then it tries to shed some light on the way this shift practically happened, focusing on the places where biodiversity management is elaborated. It insists on the fact that biodiversity governance networks are structured around places that articulate several social realms and several sets of norms, which may not be fully compatible. Therefore, the paper wonders how the articulation may be achieved. Focusing on a workgroup that brings together various actors of biodiversity governance, it shows that social, logical and normative contradictions can be neutralised through various practical means, allowing to establish a one-way-oriented common sense. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Knowledge innovation is the driving force and guarantee of regional development. Inspired by population ecology, this article uses symbiosis theory to explore the symbiotic relationship of subjects in the regional knowledge innovation ecosystem. The nonlinear Lotka–Volterra model is constructed with the main subjects to measure the knowledge innovation ability of knowledge innovation subjects. The symbiotic relationships among the knowledge innovation subjects in each region are identified. Taking Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as examples, a sensitivity analysis of the initial value and coopetition relationship is conducted. The results show that the initial value change has no significant effect on the development of knowledge innovation subjects. The interaction relationships among subjects directly affect the symbiotic evolution trend. The study extends the application scope of the symbiosis theory and develops a theoretical framework for the development of subjects in regional knowledge innovation ecosystem. It offers regions a reference to use Lotka–Volterra model adjusting the knowledge innovation structure in various regions. </jats:p>",

Discussions of science, violence, the Other and the nation-state are key words I would use to identify the book. But further generalisations are difficult because of the richness of details in each essay. This leaves me wondering, did I miss something? Perhaps that is precisely Visvanathan’s point, to overwhelm the reader with all the possibilities and to prevent him/her from making a clear pronouncement on the work. Thereby, he prevents the reader from mimicking science which leads to the various dangers of monoculture, memory loss and violence that he has chronicled.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Small developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa are still struggling with the institutionalisation and professionalisation of science. Many countries in these regions are yet to establish science communities. Singapore case becomes all the more interesting and exemplary as this small country was able to build a small but vibrant science community in relatively a short span of time. As will be shown through the case study on ‘Biopolis’ (cluster of modern biology laboratories and national university), there is indeed a unique Singaporean approach in building science community by attracting global talents. The process of attracting global talents or what may be seen as a case of brain gain was part of Singapore’s national science, technology and innovation (STI) strategy since the 1980s and particularly the 1990s. After exploring the most salient features of STI policies, the essay will focus on two major institutional developments, which were crucial for building Biopolis, based science community. First is on building of world class university and research ecosystem; and second is a empirical research on the structure and composition of scientists in eight major biological labs. </jats:p>",

The book gives an account of classroom meetings with engineering students during a spring term when Ms. Nair had to apply her verbal skills to teach the humanities option at IIT called ’Technology and Culture’ (T&C). The adoption of unconventional teaching methods led to broad student participation in a collective experiment to articulate what it is that sets engineering apart as a culture in modem society. The experience is recounted in the mode of ’laboratory studies’, with the lab in this case being replaced by the classroom. The tribal inhabit-",

In the coming decades we and our children are less likely to face absolute limits than difficult trade-offs, in which population size will be only one factor among many to be weighed in the balance. Indeed, if there is any inescapable constraint in sight, it is that solving such problems will take time.

In pursuance of self- reliance, it developed technological capabilities in some specific areas such as agriculture, civil engineering, architecture, metallurgy, water management, medicine, textile and paper manufacture, dyeing and food technology. Its isolation for over a century, coinciding with the Industrial Revolution in the West and colonial incursion in India, deprived the country from the advances in S&amp;T elsewhere. After the advent of democracy in 1950, the country embarked on the path of modernisation. An initiation in S&amp; T activities took place, along with the inception of a development plan, in 1956. The S&amp; T sector received its due impor tance in development plan in the Sixth Plan (1980-85). Nepal's new constitution, promul gated in 1990, has emphasised the importance of S&amp;T explicitly by including a Directive Principle to promote its advancement. Major S&amp;T organisations, including a science academy, the Ministry for Science and Technology, and several research centres and insti tutions for higher education in science have evolved during last five decades. However, with the low ratio of S&amp;T manpower (0.4 per 1, 000 population) and low R&amp;D expenditure (0.35 per cent of GNP), Nepal faces formidable challenges seeking political commitments with long-term vision and recognition of S&amp;T as the strategic variable for overall national development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> COVID–19 has not only resulted in nearly two and a half million deaths globally but it has also spawned a pandemic of misinformation and conspiracies. In this article I examine COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies in the United States (US). These misinformation and conspiracies have been commonly argued to be anti-science. I argue, although it is important to rebut false information and stop their spread, social scientists need to analyse how such anti-science claims are discursively framed and interpreted. Specifically, I show how the framing of the anti-science conspiracies utilise the credibility of science and scientists. I also explore how the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were given different meaning among different social groups. The article is divided into three sections. In the first section I analyse the discursive emplotment of the Plandemic video that had Dr Judy Mikovits presenting several COVID–19 conspiracy theories and went viral before it was taken down from major social media platforms. I show how the video draws on the credibility of science, scientists, and scientific journals to present misinformation and conspiracies claims against vaccination, mask wearing, etc. The second section explores how COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were interpreted among the African-American community by drawing on the history of black community’s experiences in the US and as such how their interpretations stand in contrast to the interpretations of the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies among the White community. The last section analyses the role of STS in engaging with anti-science and post-truth issues and emphasises the need to excavate genealogies of the present even with regard to misinformation and conspiracies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology foresight as a policy intelligence tool, can offer vital inputs for policy-making in various domains. The relationship between foresight and policy-making has been presented in the literature by the policy-related functions of foresight, but the literature reflects a theoretical gap with the systematic evaluation of the impact of foresight on policy-making. So this study tries to bridge the existing gap by development an evaluation model. The data collection tool is a questionnaire and in order to test the proposed model; a sample of fifteen experts is included. In this article a case study is conducted to implement the confirmed model in the real word and Partial Least Squares (PLSs) path analysis is used to advance our understanding of the relationships and the structure of the proposed model. The results confirm the proposed dimensions of the model and provide insight for those who are concerned with this topic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Technology studies in the West, including the specific case explored here of the ‘social shaping of technology’ (SST) perspective, has been patterned by the particular historical circumstances in which it emerged, in terms of both contemporary political concerns about the socio–economic implications of technological change, and the respective strengths and traditions of the various academic disciplines that contributed to this new field. This article points to the fundamental weaknesses in China's approach to technology development—the ‘utilitarian’ view of technology. Three key manifestations are that: (a) technology has been treated as merely a ‘tool’, detached from its social and political context; (b) technology is treated as a finished solution, diverting attention from the necessary processes of technological learning from advanced economies; and (c) a narrow focus is adopted of technical specialism in science and engineering at the expense of social, policy and managerial expertise, often associated with an elitist approach to technology development.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Bioprospecting and Commercialisation of Biological Resources by Indigenous Communities in India",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditional or indigenous science (IS) relates to both the science knowledge of long-resident, usually oral culture peoples, as well as the science knowledge of all peoples who as participants in culture are affected by the worldview and relativist interests of their home communities. Traditional science (TS) has been recognised only lately in Western science as a valuable source of products and treatments for health care. As a consequence, diverse components of IS have been appropriated under intellectual property rights (IPRs) by researchers and commercial enterprises, without any significant compensation to the knowledge’s creators or holders. This paper investigates whether novel forms of commercial uses of biodiversity and associated knowledge carried out by indigenous communities are possible. This understanding will be gained through the examination of the Indian Gram Mooligai Company Limited (GMCL), a community-based enterprise composed of women, which produces and commercialises phytomedicines using the local ethnomedicine knowledge. The paper aims to shows how an alternative representation of bioprospecting at the grassroots level can be an instrument to enhancing the local livelihoods of communities and promoting their empowerment and capacity building. The results show that positive outcomes of this innovative form of participative bioprospecting initiative are evident but that challenges remain. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Growing consumerism and population worldwide raises concerns about society’s sustainability aspirations. This has led to calls for concerted efforts to shift from the linear economy to a circular economy (CE), which are gaining momentum globally. CE approaches lead to a zero-waste scenario of economic growth and sustainable development. These approaches are based on semi-scientific and empirical concepts with technologies enabling 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and 6Rs (reuse, recycle, redesign, remanufacture, reduce, recover). Studies estimate that the transition to a CE would save the world in excess of a trillion dollars annually while creating new jobs, business opportunities and economic growth. The emerging industrial revolution will enhance the symbiotic pursuit of new technologies and CE to transform extant production systems and business models for sustainability. This article examines the trends, availability and readiness of fourth industrial revolution (4IR or industry 4.0) technologies (for example, Internet of Things [IoT], artificial intelligence [AI] and nanotechnology) to support and promote CE transitions within the higher education institutional context. Furthermore, it elucidates the role of universities as living laboratories for experimenting the utility of industry 4.0 technologies in driving the shift towards CE futures. The article concludes that universities should play a pivotal role in engendering CE transitions. </jats:p>",

Our study is based on 190 manufacturing firms which were surveyed from Bengaluru and Hyderabad cities in India. The results based on panel probit model reveal that exports and R&amp;D expenditure positively and significantly affect the innovation in case of manufacturing sector. Other key factors such as import intensity, manager’s prior experience, and conducting training sessions to the employee at firm level do positively affect the innovation activities. However, firm age and capital intensity negatively affect innovation. The results suggest the policymakers to concentrate more on export orientation policies and investing in R&amp;D through subsidising or creating more R&amp;D incentive projects which would significantly boost innovations in India. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the ways how to catch up with developed countries is through innovation. Companies can develop innovation in-house, but it has been determined that a more efficient approach is to acquire new knowledge and technology from external parties. In the meantime, relatively few companies choose to cooperate, therefore the aim of this research is to identify the key factors that need to be addressed in order to facilitate new knowledge and technology acquisition. In a systematic literature review, the scientific literature on technology transfer has been analysed, which determines an existing lack of holistic approach on the different impact of factors. Therefore, in this article, through the analysis of different sources, the innovation and technology transfer affecting factors have been summarised. The empirical research is based on a survey of sixty-five companies that hypothetically work with the technology transfer. Besides, an interrelationship analysis of the technology acquisition affecting factors was carried out. The research results indicate that acquisition of new knowledge and technology is closely linked with the internal research and development (R&amp;D) work and presence in a foreign market, as well as indirectly with the fact whether the company is a part of a group. In the final of the article, the acquired results and their implications have been explained. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Informed by Foucault’s governmentality, this article examines the making of the smart home in China. Operating within the nexus of security and risk, smart homes foster a discourse of the ‘the good life’ that accelerates AI’s integration into the population’s daily life. Taking Xiaomi (a renowned smart home technology company) as a case study, I trace how commercial practices formulate issues of security and risk in three smart home products: smart door lock, home surveillance camera and virtual home assistant. Drawing on visual and discourse analyses of Xiaomi’s promotional materials, this analysis is structured around three levels of relationships: (a) trust and ontological security; (b) the practices of government and the practices of self (c) and the technologisation of Chinese society. This analysis demonstrates that Xiaomi further advances the state-driven technologisation of Chinese society, in which subjects are guided to embrace the positive dimensions of technology for self-actualisation and self-management. However, the technology that makes domestic life and the physical home more reliable, less prone to risks and more secure has at the same time further eroded social relations and trust. </jats:p>",

The study shows that Ayurveda knowledge resides in the entrepreneur’s family tradition and mostly transfers in a tacit form. The entrepreneurs’ acquisition of symbolic capital intertwines with the discourse of ‘sustainable development’, which makes ‘natural’ fashionable and ‘traditional’ knowledge prestigious. Within this discourse, Ayurveda knowledge acquires symbolic value which makes entrepreneurs’ cultural knowledge valuable and legitimate. The analyses of representative cases show how cultural capital and symbolic capital impact acquisition of knowledge in ways that facilitate entrepreneurs to attain legitimacy through innovations. We argue that appropriation of different forms of capital by entrepreneurs reinforces the beauty field’s normative structure which in turn facilitates knowledge generation for innovation in cosmetics MSMEs. </jats:p>",

In this context, we want to answer the following research question. Is there any difference in open innovation effect on the firm according to the changing of belonging sectorial innovation system from catch-up to post-catch-up? </jats:p><jats:p> We statistically analysed the moderating effects of open innovation between catching-up, and the performance with the patents which were registered in United States Patent and Trademark Office, which were applied from China in telecommunication, from South Korea in Semiconductors, and from Japan in biotechnology on 1995–1999, and 2005–2009. We found three results from this study: first, from this research, as the signal of post catching-up, open innovation effects on the performance of firm, and the moderating effects of open innovation between catching-up, and the performance of the firm were found; second, the appearance of new dominant design after post catching-up was explained through the powerful open innovation and third, open innovation could be a useful new strategy for firms in the post catching-up to use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper unpacks the discourse of Singapore’s latest ten-year Masterplan called ‘Intelligent Nation 2015’ (iN2015), where pervasive computing plays a prominent role. This paper situates Singapore and the iN2015 Masterplan as an instance of ‘mutated capitalism’. It demonstrates how the operations of the market are not simply prioritized but rather become instruments of social control, leading to particular technological embodiments—ones that entail active consumption of information technologies and telecommunication, which in turn feedback and fuel the neo-liberal technological economy. It argues that the Masterplan’s promise of freedom, control, empowerment and inclusion are presupposed on pervasive computing’s inherent capacity for digitalization, surveillance, control and interaction. Hence, this paper critiques the iN2015 architecture in terms of ‘reversibility’—how and to what extent the positive effects of the iN2015 Masterplan and pervasive computing are exactly due to the negative effects of the technology and the grounding gestures that make this paradox invisible. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the confrontation between Taiwan and Covid in the period before the virus finally invaded and spread widely on the island in May 2021. While the general approach to Taiwan’s success in keeping the virus out is historical, stating the policy lessons learned from previous anti-pandemic experience, the study focuses on how these coping strategies were able to be made and conducted with little disruption from misinformation and conspiracy theories. Inspired by Sheila Jasanoff’s notion of how science and technology are received through different political and policy systems, and by Bruno Latour’s semiotic reflections on the actor-network theory, the STS take on post-truth politics here is institutional and discursive: instead of focusing on the scientific and the misleading in individual policies, I provide an ethnography of rumour and scientific discourse on Covid, capturing their interactions and net effects in the context of policy discussions. Following closely the daily press conferences held by the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), the only official information source for the Covid pandemic, I argue that discursive frames were made upon the limited information given and few confirmed cases found. Through the expert authority and ‘what if?’ scenarios seen at these conferences, Taiwan’s anti-Covid policies came to be presented as a narrative on crises and what the government was doing to get over them, and rumours were either ignored or marginalised. Meanwhile, though disputes and speculations on pandemic control did exist among experts, they only surfaced after the local outbreak, whereupon conspiracy theories flared up, challenging the already exhausted CECC. Together, the excessive information by experts, health professionals, policy analysists and talkshow hosts composes a ‘post-truth normal’ that has started to place Taiwan’s democracy and its trust in expertise on trial. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rethinking Innovation and Development Discourses in the Light of COVID-19",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has cast new light on worldwide socioeconomic susceptibility to exogenous shocks. This crisis has been framed unlike any other in modern memory (Schwab & Malleret, 2020). The virus was initially thought to be a mild outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 but soon spread to 216 countries (Ke & Hsiao, 2021). The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Covid dashboard indicated 540,923,532 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of June 27, 2022, resulting in 6,325,785 deaths globally. WHO declared the virus a global health emergency as it quickly moved beyond China. The United Nations Secretary—General Antonio Guterres stated that the pandemic is responsible for the largest economic catastrophe and highest unemployment since the Great Depression; COVID-19 has also endangered human rights (Ke & Hsiao, 2021). Yet, these circumstances are not exactly unprecedented. Jordà et al. (2020) investigated pandemics dating back to the 14th century and identified considerable negative macroeconomic repercussions as outbreaks persisted for decades. Some economists have conten-ded that this pandemic will lead to severe economic crises (Gans, 2020) as well. Subsequent studies (e.g., Jordà et al., 2020) similarly suggested that COVID-19 will have enduring consequences on the world’s economy, such as considerably lower return rates, with no nation escaping untouched. Susskind and Vines (2020) pointed out that this pandemic has triggered the most severe global economic consequences since the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720. Indeed, a World Bank analysis showed that COVID-19 caused economic activity to fall in nearly 90% of countries in 2020—exceeding the proportion of nations that saw similar declines during the Great Depression in the 1930s and the two world wars combined. Global economic contraction of almost 3% and a generation-first rise in poverty",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this think-piece, I reflect on what lessons innovation scholars and innovation policymakers in the developing world can draw from the COVID-19 crisis. While it has confirmed the fundamental importance of science and technology in coping with a major global challenge, it has also shown its limitations and the importance of institutions and organisational capabilities. While the crisis has demonstrated the necessity to build stronger national innovation systems (NSI) in the South, it has also simultaneously shown the need to go beyond national governance and move in the direction of a global innovation system. </jats:p><jats:p>  The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced new trends in technology and in global competition that challenge innovation system theory and innovation policy. The crisis stimulated the application and development of artificial intelligence and accelerated the concentration of intellectual capital in a handful of tech giants located in the US and China. While the volume of trade in digital services kept growing, there was a dramatic fall in the volume of global value chain trade in tangibles. These developments intensified the China-US rivalry and undermined transnational collaborations in science and technology. </jats:p><jats:p>  Countries in the South aiming at building stronger national innovation systems need to do so under new circumstances, where artificial intelligence is emerging as a strategic technology, where intellectual monopolies harvest data worldwide, where great powers are engaged in technological rivalry, and where linking up with global value chains for tangibles has become less of an option. One implication is that the issue of scale has become more critical than before; groupings of small and medium-sized countries need to integrate economically and politically in order to develop crucial digital capabilities and competitiveness. Such moves in the direction of forming transnational innovation systems are consonant with strategies to cope with global challenges. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been limited study on the role of the startup ecosystem in social entrepreneurship. This article addresses the gap by applying a theoretical framework of startup ecosystem to two social enterprises originating from a Singapore university, examining how they engage with stakeholders to create social impact. WateRoam Pte Ltd is a water innovation startup that deploys cost-effective water filtration solutions to rural communities and disaster-hit locations. Tware is a wearable technology startup with a range of therapeutic products for individuals with autism, stress or anxiety. The two cases provide insights on the ecosystem for social ventures in Singapore. The Finance domain is identified as a potential area of improvement, as there is uncertainty on the appropriate growth trajectory for funding. University incubation and mentor networks are found to be pivotal in extending the Markets domain. Finally, this study highlights the Supports domain in the form of university R&amp;D facilities and accelerator programmes that have been instrumental in strengthening connections. Extending beyond the university context, it is evident that infrastructural resources in the ecosystem are crucial. Policymakers may draw on the experience of countries, like Israel, which have successfully built such support facilities to nurture innovation-based social enterprises. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Hofstede (1980) developed the culture study of organisations in addition to a theoretical framework to guide cross-cultural comparisons, so to say value survey module (VSM). In a great deal of research interest in cross-cultural psychology, the topic of individualism-collectivism has been focused on because of it has been proved to be a more concise, coherent, integrated and empirically testable dimension of cultural variation by VSM. Therefore, the 1980s has been characterised as ‘the decade of individualism-collectivism’. According to Hofstede (1980), individualism emphasise ‘I’ consciousness, autonomy, private right, individual initiative, universalism and so on. Collectivism emphasise ‘we’ consciousness, collective identity, duties and obligations, group solidarity, particularism. On the surface, these two concept are at the opposite side and cannot be viewed as an integrated one.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the impact of innovation on labour productivity by using latest World Bank Enterprise Surveys data and compares the results between Chinese and Indian manufacturing sector. The article uses cross-section data based on two surveys that were conducted by the World Bank in 2012 and 2014 for China and India, respectively. By employing simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression technique, we find that innovation affects the labour productivity positively for Chinese as well as Indian manufacturing firms, but its impact on firm productivity is relatively weak in case of India as compared to China. Second, other factors such as average wage of the workers, education of production workers and training do significantly boost the labour productivity of Chinese manufacturing firms as well as for Indian firms. Third, our results based on firm size also indicate that the impact of innovation activities on labour productivity is higher in case of large firms as compared to medium firms. However, innovation does not affect the labour productivity of small manufacturing firms for both China and India. In terms of policy, it is important for both Chinese and Indian manufacturing firms to keep pursuing innovation activities, in order to spur productivity, which would strengthen firms’ growth. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The promotion of entrepreneurship requires an ecosystem where Higher Education Institutions (HEI) hold a crucial position in collaboration with all stakeholders. Such systems require a high degree of interaction, involving institutions, people and processes that work together with the goal of creating entrepreneurial ventures that are mutually beneficial and self-sustaining. The university setting may be an ideal starting point such that it would serve to recognise potential entre-preneurs within communities and play critical roles in developing and supporting thriving entrepreneurial ecosystems. They may serve as conveners and collaborators for entrepreneurs and support communities to promote the economic development of the region. Such energy derived from university promoted environments in which learning is encouraged and discoveries are made reflects on Higher Educational aims. Obstacles in this role of universities include a lack of provision of the best instructional methods and venues by universities, programmes and curricula that are not conducive to promoting entrepreneurship, a lack of information on entrepreneurial activities in the informal sector and a dearth of appropriate role models within both universities and the business environment. It is therefore apparent that universities are the missing link for the development of a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in South Africa. </jats:p>",

This paper studies anti-competitive behaviour with specific focus on the Indian Telecom Industry. With an extensive coverage of tacit collusion, predatory pricing and competition structures, this paper attempts to provide a strong economic explanation for why big telecom operators are inclined to involve in anti-competitive behaviour. Using concentration ratios, Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) and a unique measure of excess profits of individual firms, the paper tries to identify which firms have the potential to exhibit anti-competitive behaviour. Real cases of anti-competitive behaviour by firms are also documented. It is hoped that telecom regulatory and competition authorities will be more vigilant and use concrete information to act decisively and impartially. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ScIence and technology Studies usually consider social practices and their environments as dynamic socio-material relations where the stabilising processes of establishing facts, measures, rules, labels and/or standards are at stake. This sociological perspective bears a special interest to the deployment of actions. It considers them without referring to global structures, or to predetermined constraints (either cognitive, socio-political, etc.). These new sociologies take into account the process of understanding and agreement between people, but also their adjustments to things, technical objects and natural beings. They are based on the idea of a common world, which is permanently reshaped by complexity, diversity and conflict. As shown by Susan Leigh Star and Ruhleder (1996), any infrastructure relies on a particular ontological solidarism between socio-material entities.1 Following this approach, we define the ‘social’ as ontologically interdependent entities, which are constantly reshaped by controversies, demonstrations, shocks and attachments. Hence, we suggest describing the state preceding the shaping",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Countries differ in their economic performance due to the way their respective science, technology and production systems interact. The creation, adoption and transmission of knowledge are at the core of each of these systems. In developing countries knowledge is not uniform, but combines indigenous skills and know-how with modern ones. Policies promoting the prevalence of modern over traditional knowledge have resulted in the dependence on imported knowledge and the incapacity to create an endogenous know ledge base. At the same time these policies have accelerated the loss of valuable indigen ous knowledge that would otherwise help improve the capacities and quality of life of vast sectors of the population. Technical cooperation can play a critical role in building an endogenous science and technology base as well as in promoting the integration of indigenous and modern knowledge, technology and production. Three sets of policies are required to fulfil that purpose: those related to the domestic integration ofknowledge, technology and production; those that establish links with the global knowledge, tech nology and production systems; and those that create a favourable policy environment for the other two. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growing environmental difficulties triggered by enterprises’ activities have drawn academics and development experts’ attention to mechanisms to advance growth and development without compromising the environment. Discussions about eco-innovation have become topical as a result, yet there still remains a dearth of understanding on the subject. Eco-innovation emphasises the duality of technological innovation and environmental protection as long-term solutions to the inherent tensions between these goals. Despite this, there has been little research on methods to improve eco-innovation performance, taking into account internal and external factors. Cognizant of the external environment’s dynamics, this study, based on institutional theory, investigates how institutional pressure affects eco-innovation. We used a cross-sectional survey approach to draw data from 155 businesses. Results revealed institutional pressures, that is, normative, mimetic, and coercive, also environmental complexity (EC) has a positive role in promoting eco-innovation. While environmental dynamics was found to have a positive moderating effect on the relationship between normative pressure and eco-innovation, EC was revealed to have a moderating influence on the relationship between mimetic, normative pressure, and eco-innovation. In light of these seminal findings that have received little research attention, we propose policy, theoretical, and practical implications. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates whether Asian countries are becoming more active at the discovery stage, a higher stage of the drug development value chain. We conduct the first quantitative study to investigate these countries positioning in drug discovery activities. For this purpose, we draw on a database containing historical information on more than 61,000 drugs, for the period 1994–2015, and extract and analyse data on the drug discovery events in which a selected group of Asian countries were involved. </jats:p><jats:p> The results show that these countries are increasingly involved in activities of discovery and that, in some of them, these activities are predominantly conducted on drugs owned by local organisations. Along with this process, markets for discovery are being created, both through sub-contracting and through partnerships among local organisations (for their own drugs) and between local and non-local ones. Second, drawing on the strategies and organisational set-ups adopted in each country, we distinguish a number of profiles regarding the ways competences for markets for discovery are being built. Third, we identify the existence of a strong regional centre of competences, acting as a local–global articulation locus for markets of discovery. </jats:p><jats:p> These results provide new insights into the ways Asian countries are moving up the drug development value chain and contribute to our understanding of the learning processes underway in different contexts and the variety of configurations resulting from these processes, supporting a discussion on the potential role of policies to further expand markets for discovery. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research in Jordan is a university-driven activity, as in Lebanon, historically based on three public universities—Jordan University, Jordan University for Science and Technology and Yarmouk University. However, while recent development has seen the steady decline of scientific output at Yarmouk University, the more recently established public Hashemite University has increased its scientific output—particularly through its specialisation in environmental sciences. Even if the national scientific authorities work more through incentives than development plans, an overlap between national priorities and research specialisations can be observed. Indeed engineering, medicine and chemistry are especially important in Jordan, mainly through partnership with the US or, concerning Chemistry, with Germany. Gulf countries are a second important pole which attracts Jordanian professors for teaching, mainly for salary reasons. It is too early to call it brain drain since Jordanian professors only stay for one or two years before going back to Jordan. Moreover, the Jordanian official policy actively promotes the exportation of skilled staff. However, this situation may change if Gulf countries succeed in keeping this foreign staff. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the sequential relationships among motivations for online information disclosure, willingness to disclose and purchase behaviours on e-commerce platforms. The expectancy theory of motivation and social contract theory provide the theoretical basis, interpreting how anticipated disclosure outcomes and perceived fairness in the exchange process impact willingness to disclose and subsequent purchase decisions. This study employed a quantitative research approach with three sampling methods (e.g., purposive sampling, quota sampling and snowball sampling). The mass survey was distributed to students from five universities located in Ho Chi Minh city and Ha Noi capital, the two largest e-commerce markets in Vietnam. There were 695 valid cases used for theoretical estimation by using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Three driven forces of information disclosure were identified (e.g., flow experience, perceived information relevance and trust in platform), while the perceived Internet competency negatively impacts willingness to disclose. In turn, willingness to disclose had a significantly positive impact on online purchase behaviour. The study suggests that the behavioural and contextual factors causing online disclosure should be interpreted to design effective disclosure regulations and norms. It’s crucial for business providers to promote a sense of fairness and build strong customer relationships to enhance user decision-making. </jats:p>",

In the process, the article examines several hypotheses pertaining to the relation ship between quality research performance (dependent variable) and its empirical and objective predictors (independent variables). That apart, it also examines the well-known Ortega Hypothesis in the sociology of science. Derived from the body of published litera ture, the following is the set of independent variables being examined: (a) type of institu tion the scientist belonged to; (b) research environment at the centre/department; (c) reward system in science; (d) diversity in research activities; (e) motivation; (f) prestige of the graduate school attended; and (g) total quantity performance. All of the above inde pendent variables have been found to be causing significant variations in the dependent variable—quality research performance. Last, the verification of the Ortega Hypothesis brought in the apparently contradictory observation that many important contributions in science came from non-diligent, average scientists who even produce less in quantity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Nanotechnology is now increasing attention to inter-firm collaboration and alliances for developing nanotechnology commercialisation opportunities. This study explores and examines nanotechnology alliance networking behaviour to determine fully what types of factors drive nanotechnology alliance activities. The proposed research frameworks attempt to fill the gap in knowledge regarding emerging nanotechnology alliance behaviour and to explore the alliance decisions driving inter-firm nanotechnology alliances that are grounded in deeper knowledge of nanotechnology alliances. The primary focus of nanotechnology alliance activity for nanotechnology-based firms confirms that nanotechnology alliances are influenced directly by inter-firm R&amp;D ties and by joint interactions among inter-firm R&amp;D ties, network positions and technological uncertainty. Specifically, we propose that a nanotechnology-based firm is highly likely to engage in alliances regarding decision-making activity. Using an original dataset of nanotechnology-based firms in the emerging nanotechnology alliance activity, we found that the joint effect of a position of high network centrality and a high level of technological uncertainty weakens inter-firm nanotechnology alliances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Crowdsourcing enterprises increasingly seek to attract and persuade makers to contribute their creativity and wisdom through digital storytelling, however, what are the effective components of digital storytelling and the persuasive effect of digital storytelling on creative crowdsourcing intention are still unclear. To fill this gap, this study explores how digital storytelling persuades makers to generate creative crowdsourcing behavioural intention by utilising Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Results reveal that the persuasion activity of digital storytelling has a positive effect on creative crowdsourcing intention. The effective components of digital storytelling are mainly composed of aesthetic perception, narrative structure and self-reference. UTAUT and its four core concepts (performance expectation, effort expectation, social influence and facilitating condition) mediate the impact of digital storytelling on the creative crowdsourcing intention, which reveals the persuasive source of digital storytelling. We highlight the theoretical implications as well as the practical applications in creative crowdsourcing. </jats:p>",

Taking the establishment of Singapore’s dedicated biomedical research institution, Biopolis, as a starting point, the article raises several questions: the first concerns the role of biomedical research in Singapore in relation to its larger political economy; the second concerns the relationship between Asian bioscience in relation to international trends; the third concerns the deeper historical structures that, as I will argue, underlie the contemporary situation. After discussing the role of Biopolis in Singapore I outline some theoretical considerations towards an understanding of the kinds of immunological structure that characterize the relations discussed in the first part. I argue that the structure of relations might be understood as auto-immunological (or self-immunizing) and in making the case I draw selectively on disparate fields: mathematics, biology and philosophy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "RobeRt K. MeRton occupies a very special place in the study of science and techno­ logy, and I am humbled to be the first recipient of the award established in his honour by the International Sociological Association. When thinking about how to express my gratitude, I went back half a century ago, when I started working in the field of science, technology and development. A coincidence, clearly of the type Merton was fond of highlighting in his remarks about serendipity (Merton & Barber, 2004) led me to be in Lima at the time the National Research Council of Peru was created, and I was looking for a PhD dissertation topic in operations research and social systems sciences. Soon, I focused on how to design policy interventions and plan the development of science and technology capabilities in developing countries. This continues to be the most important issue, one of the most pressing in our times. While income and wealth inequalities between rich and poor countries have captured international attention, inequalities in science, technology and innova­ tion capabilities are much more pronounced. The average income per capita of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries— the rich countries club—is about sixty times greater than that of the low-income countries as defined by World Bank indicators; however, the number of scientific articles published per 100,000 inhabitants in rich countries is 170 times greater than that of low-income countries, and the number of patents registered in the former is 1,000 times greater than that in the latter (Sagasti, 2018). Bear in mind that rich countries have accumulated these advantages for a long time, and that the ‘Matthew effect’, clearly identified and reported by Merton (1968) and Zuckerman (1977),",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a genomic technology used to predict the chance of a foetus having a genetic condition. Despite the immediacy of this technology’s integration into clinical practice, there is a dearth of evidence outlining how both patients and professionals experience NIPT on the ground. In this article, we draw upon our collective empirical research—specifically on earlier screening technologies (BKR), Down syndrome screening (GT), genetic screening/testing (JL) and NIPT (HS)—to outline the most pressing and often controversial issues which, we argue, remain unresolved and vital to consider regarding NIPT. We begin with a brief introduction to NIPT as a prenatal technology and the bodies of literature which unpack its ‘social life’. In what follows, BKR discusses NIPT within the context of her research on ‘the tentative pregnancy’ and diagnostic testing in the USA. In the following sections, GT, HS and JL identify different, but related, concerns with respect to NIPT, particularly around routinisation, commercialisation, choice, abortion, and configurations of disability and ‘normalcy’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "For many years, Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars have had to make the case for the study of the interrelations of science, policy and society. By one stroke, the COVID-19 pandemic brought home this argument: topics at the heart of STS’s intellectual programme have occupied the public agenda and have spurred heated debates in politics, the media, and society. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the scientific community in unprecedented ways. Scientists have contributed their advice and expertise to pandemic response, they have influenced political and social decision making, and they have impacted people’s daily lives across the globe. More than ever, it appears, science’s powerful contributions warrant empirical, descriptive and analytical knowledge from the interdisciplinary field of STS. Indeed, this field of scholarship is likely to prosper in the aftermath of the pandemic. The pandemic, in turn, will leave its imprint on STS research and teaching. What will the next generation of STS scholarship look like? While the pandemic continues to ravage the globe, we currently have a brief historical window of opportunity to reflect upon the direction of our professional field and to consider routes ahead. Which topics are likely to receive STS attention? What concepts and methods will the STS community favour in addressing these topics? What will be the intellectual hallmarks of a post-pandemic STS programme?",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Thailand has achieved impressive and consistent GDP growth over the past half century in large part through extensive economic diversification. Despite these gains, there is growing evidence that Thailand suffers from a significant gap between the advanced nature of its export structure and the much more modest technological levels of its own firms and labour force. Weak university–industry linkages (UILs) contribute to this problem, though there were sporadic success cases in some key industrial sectors representing high-tech, mid-tech and resource-based industries. The state of Thai UILs is a reflection of weak downstream demand by indigenous Thai firms, limited commercial focus and capacity within the university system and bureaucratic fragmentation. These problems in turn reflect the country’s broader political economy, including Thai development strategy, weak labour as well as business emphasis for upgrading, political fragmentation and the relatively low level of pressures (foreign exchange, external threats and popular protests) on Thai leaders to promote institutions that favour innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides a critical assessment of the development of Taiwan’s ethical framework for regulating medical and biopharmaceutical innovations. Advancing science, technology and society scholarship that treats ethics as subject to modification, adjustment and negotiation rather than as an abstract set of principles, this article examines the dominant role of East Asian states in the development of the life sciences. It also looks at the logic these states utilise to legitimise their therapeutic standards and to support the biopharmaceutical infrastructure in order to increase their economic competitiveness. In particular, this article traces the establishment of legal regulations in different social settings where innovations in clinical practice and medicine are introduced. It argues that, instead of a comprehensive, coherent ethical framework based on the adoption of international conventions, Taiwan’s 2011 Human Subjects Research Act is a techno-political assemblage, an inconsistent legal product involving not only policy makers but also physicians, the pharmaceutical industry and the state. This article also takes a critical stance towards institutional review boards (IRBs), which resolve jurisprudential conflicts within this legal framework of human research. It argues that, rather than being passive organisations that protect research from unethical fraud, IRBs in Taiwan have been institutions in which negotiations among investigators, research sponsors and the government are conducted in the name of health governance. </jats:p>",

The article then explores how corporations consolidate wealth and perpetuate inequality, socialise many of their risks to the public sector, commodify human beings and the natural environment, and bestow massive external costs to society at large. Since many of these aspects of corporate activity are invisible, recognising them may offer an important first step towards their reform. </jats:p>",

Consequently, this article compares groups of firms with different technological capabilities in three innovation systems. Analysing innovation activities, cooperation behaviour and the perception of the business environment, conspicuous differences between the innovation systems are found. Contrary, the comparison of the different technological capability-groups brings about less conclusive results, which indicate only a limited interrelation between technological capabilities and innovation-related activities. </jats:p>",

The core of the challenge facing the institute at present is seen to lie in the successful resolution of three different problems that divide and reduce its effective contribution to the national well-being. One of the problems is its very source of success, its collective culture of basic science. In conditions like the ones of the present transition where scientific practice, the organisation of that practice and the target of such activity have been experiencing profound changes in contemporary science, the 'pursuit' of academic culture prevail ing in the institution may act as a break to more challenging pursuits. Another pressing problem is the excessive weight of labour issues compared to other issues that are related to its research mission, reflecting the overall 'malaise' of the public sector in the country. The last problem is connected with the new social demands upon an institution that set the traditional standards of scientific quality in a country that did not have them. This is another way of saying that the old 'social contract' is exhausted and a new one has to be agreed between the national society and IVIC. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "made by one of the internationally renowned Indian scientists who chaired the first session of the seminar on the problem of endogenous capacity building. He said that nothing was wrong with the training of scientists and technologists from the point of view of substance as these experts from the Third World excelled in their career in the developed, industrialised world. However, they failed to adjust in their own countries and contribute to the national development. The problem, therefore, is one of social commitment, of putting the Nehruvian scientific temper at the service of Gandhian ideals of social equity, dignity of labour, and cultural autonomy combined with a sense of global brotherhood. Already in developing countries, such as India, there is a kind of revolt against these experts and there is a call for scientists and technologists to redo their agenda, to include social considerations in their scientific quest. There was latent consensus that the present-day world is becoming increasingly non-liveable and non-sustainable. The achievements of science and technology have been peripheral to the developmental concerns of the people. It was pointed out that science and technology have mainly contributed to the growth of militaryindustrial complex; they have not consciously intended to enrich culture or eliminate poverty. No doubt, science and technology have their share in contributing to the progress of societies. But",

    "title": "The Changing Role of Research and Education in New Zealand Universities",
    "abstract": "The role of universities in conducting research and education has changed considerably in order to embrace twenty-first century knowledge and skills required for global economy. New forms of analytical reasoning and innovative thinking are required to meet future challenges. Most universities are not sufficiently equipped to make necessary structural adjustments or to cope up with these new challenges. Teaching and research activities that commensurate with production of skilled and knowledgeable work force for a modern economy requires repositioning of the higher educational system. This paper reviews the dynamic changes in New Zealand’s higher education system and revisits the role universities in producing reliable knowledge. It discusses the way in which education underpins economic and social development and its role in entirety as a hermeneutic package which is recursive, persuasive and a continuum of learning from primary, secondary, tertiary education through to lifelong learning. The universities have responsibilities to provide intellectual leadership in shaping knowledge economy for sustainable futures and environmentally responsible entrepreneurial nations—not as institutions just awarding academic degrees.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital traces are increasingly used as data with which to generate insights into social dynamics around complex issues such as the controversies surrounding biotechnology. Hyperlinks can, for example, be used to locate a network of relevant stakeholders around an emerging technology and a popular way to makes sense of this kind of data is to rely on software that can synthesise it and present it in ‘Web-based visualisations’. This short article presents a discussion of ways in which such visualisations can be made an object of social scientific study and it provides tentative steps towards a theoretical framework that allows us to conceptualise such visualisations as emerging ‘Digital Institutions of Knowledge’. This framework is rooted in discursive and process oriented institutionalisms and in the concept of ‘market devices’ which has been powerful within economic sociology. The ordinally ranked results of Google are presented as the simplest examples of a Web-based visualisation and its relevant theoretical characteristics are emphasised by juxtaposing it to FICO-scores which serve as an example of a market device. Similarities and differences between the two devices are used as a basis from which to ponder the institutional aspects of Web-based visualisations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ence, Technology and Development, draws upon diverse literatures to explore science and ’development’. The seven essays are based on events, writings and observations of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Most of the essays have been published elsewhere including two that appeared in the edited volume by Ashis Nandy Science, Hegemony and Violence: A Requiem for Modernity. The essays address development as a genocidal scientific project, the morality of science and violence, the history of nuclear power, bamboo, and what Gandhi might say about science today. The uniting theme of the essays is science and violence. The title hints that the collection could be a celebration of science, an indulgence of science or possibly a look at science as riotous and undisciplined. Visvanathan presents this ’carnival’ through writings that spotlight aspects of science often overlooked by mainstream thought. The first essay introduces the idea of science as an integral part of a modern nation-state’s identity and sets the stage for the second essay. Visvanathan perceives the formation of concrete boundaries and the maintenance of them as bringing violence into the forefront of a nation-state’s activities and responsibilities. He describes how",

In this study, a network was estimated and visualised to identify the relationship between occupational characteristics using the Gaussian graphical model method and to reveal the occupational characteristics linked to the potential for automation variable. As a result of estimating and visualising the network, it was found that the occupational characteristics with low potential for automation were art, decision-making, assisting and caring for others and working in cramped spaces, while those with high potential for automation involved repeating the same tasks. Furthermore, after analysing the shortest paths from each occupational characteristic node to the automation node, it was revealed that even occupational characteristics with high potential for automation can have varying levels of automation possibility depending on the mediators. Based on the results, education and vocational training policies for low- and middle-skill workers, young workers and potential workers are suggested. </jats:p>",

The role of exports in promoting faster growth is also examined, as are the channels of technological capability acquisition.

Furthermore, many users are not limited to their role as a user but evolve into business starters, thus becoming user entrepreneurs. This study aimed to reveal the important factors of successful user entrepreneurship by closely investigating two successful Korean user entrepreneurship cases. Based on this study’s findings, the importance of an entrepreneur’s caliber and networking ability was found. An entrepreneur’s innovation ability from expert knowledge and great familiarity and experience with the business as a user coupled with a strong will to entrepreneurship was the most important success factor at the early stage. In further developing user innovation technologically and commercially, the most important factor was an entrepreneur’s networking ability that can give access to complementary assets for successful development and commercialisation. With this, the innovation community—composed of related users and producers—has played a crucial role in the successful entrepreneurial process. </jats:p>",

In the first section, I look at two things simultaneously: a bio-humanitarian project—the Cypriot search for and DNA identification of the post-war missing—and clinical trials performed by the biotech corporate sector. I trace their respective methods of value and valuation as not only dependent social molecuralised practices but also as translation technologies of kinship, creation of new notions of life and death and governance. In the second section, I take a close look at the emergence of humanitarian and clinical labour as a global assemblage to show how humanitarian organisations and transnational corporations orient themselves towards certain labour assemblages in the search ‘anywhere’ to learn about, borrow and translate technologies supporting the ‘business’ of empire. I finish with broader theoretical implications of the humanitarian work post war and the clinical labour of patients in stem cell therapies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the so–called twilight of hierarchy, networks have been celebrated for their lateral linkages, which often lead to the development of lateral discursive spaces, especially in industries where the premium is on innovation and creativity. However, the two lateralities—technological and social—do not readily come together at the margins, and require considerable work. This article examines the efforts to translate lateral connectivity into lateral discursive space—the Tanami Network in Australia and Tribal Digital Village in the US—by native peoples, communities especially motivated to generate such spaces. These two grassroots efforts highlight facets of development such as ritual communication and liminality which are important for the intended beneficiaries, but are rarely seen in the projects designed by external experts that focus on economic development and delivery of services. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The selected evidence discussed in this paper suggests three interrelated propositions. First, there is no one best model for organising an industrial district or an industrial cluster, since a diversity of institutional arrangements is possible and each has proved successful in different circumstances. Second, clusters are not cast in iron, but they evolve over time. Third, globalisation reshapes the upgrading options for SME-based clusters, by providing a variety of international knowledge linkages. In a nutshell, globalisation changes both the concept of proximity and the scope of competition: a necessary prerequisite for competitive survival is the capacity to foster the co-evolution of local and global linkages and networks, and to develop new interactive modes of knowledge creation. This paper presents original evidence on Taiwanese and Italian SME-based clusters. A key explanation of the success of SMEs competing in globalised high-tech industries, supported by our survey evidence, is the co-evolution of domestic and international knowledge linkages. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While Responsible Research and Innovation has the potential for democratising the governance of research and innovation, translating it in the Global South would need dialogues and engaging with the plural knowledge systems and ongoing experiments on innovation at the margins that seek to construct alternatives. Entrenched power relations in the South do not allow for public dialogues that allows for society to engage with, if not speak back, to scientists in co-creating newer knowledge. Through the case study of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), an agroecological innovation that arose outside the formal research establishment, we show how vulnerable farming communities can proactively co-create alternatives to existing dilemmas in Indian agriculture. Re-imaging RRI in India, we suggest, requires closer attention to the role of civil society organisations in creating innovation spaces through informal and heterogeneous networks of social learning. Networks, we suggest, allow for better expression of creative dissent that could open newer vistas and alternative framing of knowledge. The RRI agenda is thus incomplete without an engagement with the politics of knowledge, and scientific controversies reveal technological lock-ins that hinders alternative framings and pathways. </jats:p>",

In each of these cases the growth of cross-border technical communities is transforming the brain drain into 'brain circulation' , and providing a more flexible and responsive mechanism for promoting transfers of technology and skill than traditional foreign direct investment. However, while policy makers in Taiwan and mainland China have aggressively promoted and facilitated the institutionalisation of these transnational networks, the more hands-off approach of Indian policy makers appears to contribute to India's lower rates of return entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The performance of the technological leaders of different Asian economies has been very impressive. Each of them has to keep improving its policies and the supporting skill and institutional base, since each is entering into the most difficult competitive areas of manufacturing where sheer technological and skill superiority, flexibility and speed count rather than just manufacturing capability. This paper describes the characteristics of the Asian economies, their size, growth, productivity levels, export orientation, and importance of foreign direct investments, as well as the qualitative basis for their competitive success. The paper goes on to examine the level and needs of human resources in terms of schooling, level of basic education, vocational training and in-firm training. The levels of research and development and some striking examples of policy tools oriented toward skill enhancement are also dis cussed. An assessment of the maturing process, the weaknesses as well as the possible future orientations of each group of countries is done. Whereas the old Tigers seem well on their way toward maturing, the newer Tigers, which have been quite success ful in creating efficient production structures, need to abandon their largely passive and dependent approach and follow a more active 'innovation culture' in industry. China and India need to resolve their serious production and infrastructure diffi culties rather than technology development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Till the end of 1980s, offshoring of R&D (Research and Development) by TNCs (Trans National Corporations) were mainly confined to industrially advanced countries, particularly among the ‘Triad’ (US, Europe and Japan). Even if TNCs moved to the developing countries, during the early to mid-1990s, their R&D activities were mainly restricted to ‘one way technology transfer’ or oriented towards ‘adaptive R&D’ rather than ‘creative R&D’. This study finds that during the last two decades, this paradigm has changed significantly. India has emerged as an important destination for about 471 TNCs with about 649 R&D units. Indian R&D and innovation threshold has moved up quite dramatically in the last decade to transform from ‘one way’ to two-way knowledge transfer. Now many foreign R&D units are developing products from India for their global product mandate. The exploration of TNCs and their impact in the Indian context advances the view that India is emerging as an important partner in the globalization of innovation. Another important trend of globalization and the global nature of innovation emerging is the rise of the Indian firms that expand business and link up with the global production networks.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines institutions and their role in supporting technical change as part of the development process, and asks how institutions shape the system of innovation (SI). The context of underdevelopment exhibits distinct system characteristics that differ markedly from those found under advanced economic conditions and as such deserves close empirical scrutiny. SIs differ significantly under the two sets of conditions, leading to uneven structural changes. The article, therefore, explores what functions must be served by systems in developing countries in order to generate technical dynamism. To compare different contexts, it introduces the idea of a ‘system of learning innovation in development’ (SLID) that emphasises individual and organisational competence building. The differences between ‘advanced’ systems of innovation (ASI) and two types of SLID are discussed. Infrastructure, one of the key components of institutions involved in development, is used as an illustration. The study found that dynamic SIs function best in a regime of high-quality infrastructure (telephone, Internet, computers and reliable electricity supplies). The case of sub-Saharan Africa serves to illustrate the point. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "too some important suggestions are made regarding a reorientation, predicated on the interests of stakeholders other than the state and monopoly capitalism. Technology policy for non-violent struggle requires a change in current priorities, and possible new roles for government, scientists and engineers, as well as community groups (both NGOs and looser networks). Various suggestions are spelled out, but some readers will be looking for a feedback loop to more familiar questions like that of ’a new social contract for science’ or the replacement of the linear model with models of ’the new production of scientific knowledge’ (for example, the so-called Triple Helix and Mode 2). Couched in these terms, some of Brian Martin’s discussion might have had a well-deserved and much-needed impact on current discussions in this field. But then again, the readership the author has in mind is more closely affiliated with a social movement, whence the popularisation of a ’social shaping of technology’ perspective is the main fort6. This also makes the work useful in courses that seek to introduce ethical and social dimensions into engineering curricula, where it is a welcome addition to",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the period between the two World Wars Senegal was the world's second largest peanut exporter. Plant breeding became the priority of agricultural policy in Senegal and by 1951 half of the peanut production was due to 'improved' varieties. This paper explores the research and agricultural practices in the agricultural station of Bambey, which stood in sharp contrast with the Sereer farming system. Also, the extension of 'improved' strains is analysed as a learning process rather than a diffusion process. During this process, some practices and constraints of the station were imposed on the farmers. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper finally reflects on the turning of African peasantries into objects of knowledge and intervention. At a time when colonial state control and knowledge of agrarian societies were very weak, seed intervention was a tool of the cognitive penetration of Sereer and Wolof communities by the state and its experts, and a means to render them more amena ble to state intervention. </jats:p>",

To harness these potentials, multinational hi–tech corporations are forming public–private partnerships with governments, development institutions and civil society organisations in the delivery of ICTs to the rural masses. This article analyses the work of the Hewlett–Packard Corporation (HP), in India, where its three–year i–community programme aimed to bring access to ICTs and resulting benefits to rural citizens of Andhra Pradesh. I will show that ICTs are not neutral tools of development as conceptualised by practitioners of ICTD, but are commodities produced by corporations with the ultimate aim to increase the corporate bottom line. They are imbued with relations of power that skew ‘partnerships’ and must fulfil corporate objectives that weaken their potential impact. </jats:p>",

Nearly half of the respondents (45 per cent) sampled during the Japanese Survey on the Public Understanding of Science and Technology in 2001 (J-SCITEK2001) stated ‘improvement of the educational system and class’ as necessary to understand scientifi c research correctly. The same question was asked to approximately 800 scientifi c researchers in the survey of the status of the research activities in Japan conducted by National Institute of the Science and Technology Policy in 2000. Slightly more than half of the respondents chose the same answer. Both surveys showed improvement of the education system and class as the second highest response. The role of mass media in supplying correct scientifi c information received highest number of responses.",

We challenge the idea that the only promotion of scientific knowledge is a legitimate and adequate method to overcome the social problems that many people in Latin America are subjected to. Instead, we propose to investigate the relationships among the social actors involved in the production and circulation of scientific knowledge. We take the case of Chagas disease, a recurring theme in the public agenda since the 1950s, to show how the issue has emerged and has been taken in by public policies related to the production of scientific knowledge. We analyse the different viewpoints and conceptions about the disease, and how they moulded the different institutional initiatives of intervention into the problem. We assume that the practices associated with these mechanisms condition the type of knowledge produced and its possible uses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mertonian norms of science have long been subject to various criticisms, one of which concerns a ‘story book image’ of science that those norms portray for science to justify the independence of science from social control. Despite much criticism of Merton’s work on the normative structure of science, little research has been undertaken on the degree to which practicing scientists indeed hold onto such norms. This study presents an empirical analysis of Mertonian norms using the survey of 633 Korean scientists. The Korean scientific community offers a strategic research site. With predominantly US-educated researchers, it contains a sizeable membership of academic scientists who have become sensitised to ethical and normative problems due to Dr Hwang’s notorious research fraud scandal. Our empirical analysis analyses scientists’ endorsement of Mertonian norms based on a framework incorporating demographic factors and the socialisation into science. Among the four Mertonian norms, we find communalism to be strongly influenced by professional conditions such as size of research funding, professional network and involvement of non-academic affairs.

Utilising data from 187 firms and 1,830 observations between 2015 and 2021, this study employs Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Meta-Frontier Analysis to examine how diversification strategies influence firm efficiency. The results indicate that vertical diversification, particularly in high-value sectors like biopharmaceutical equipment, shows a strong potential for enhancing firm efficiency. On the other hand, the effects of horizontal diversification vary, with efficiency improvements depending on the level of diversification pursued by each company. These findings offer strategic insights for optimising business diversification in the Korean biopharmaceutical sector and guiding decision-making for long-term competitiveness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is based on the findings of an EU-funded qualitative research project, entitled ‘From GMP to GBP: Fostering good bioethics practices [GBP] among the European biotechnology industry’, which seeks to improve the understanding of bioethical issues through the observation of the daily practices in European biotechnology companies and proposes a methodology approaching ethical issues. The comparative study was carried out in biotech companies in France, Italy, Sweden, Hungary and Belgium which develop a wide range of new technologies, all of them involving human materials or where human subjects participate (in clinical trials). Based on our findings in these local settings, we suggest that the notion of bioethics and the way its production is theorised need to be re-conceptualised. We argue that material practices and moral statements are intermingled in inextricable ways that render the formation of bioethical concerns fully dependent on the organisational landscape in which it is embedded. More precisely, the here presented co-production model of moral statements and organisational practices presents a set of common factors that influence how bioethical discourses are shaped, despite the heterogeneity of their epistemic cultures. For example, the procedural design of cell-based-products, the modes of collecting and storing biological specimen, the relationship between patients and companies and technological transfers to emerging countries are defining components that contribute to the shaping process of bioethical concerns. Thus, the path dependency of bioethical concerns relies on an already existing, specific infrastructure and existing relationships within and outside a company rather than on external judgement subsequently applied to its objects, or a collection of processes of reasoning coming from external institutions. </jats:p>",

It develops a perspective that takes into account the diversity of views among principle investigators (PIs) and scientists working in the laboratory. Deploying Eviatar Zerubavel’s notion of social mindscapes and the notion of mindsets, I elucidate the relationships between the personal and the professional, scientists and the public. Introducing the concept of mindset switching, I argue that scientists’ views of embryonic substances cannot be understood adequately in terms of the rhetoric of boundary making alone. The use of cognitive notions of social mindscape applied to situations in the life of scientists has far-reaching consequences for both the implementation of research regulation involving respect for the embryo and for the public discussion on the use of embryonic substances. The article is based on interviews with over thirty scientists working with embryos and stem cells during fieldwork visits in eleven science institutes in Japan. </jats:p>",

The article proposes a different approach from the standard analysis on firm behaviour, innovation competitiveness, and cooperative organisation and alliances that tend to disregard national environment, including national political developments and government ideological orientations. We make a case in favour of the analysis of the long-term macro-economic and macro-political trends and ideological orientations of a country, as well as how firms attempt to develop their competitiveness and the collaboration programmes supposedly taking place. We argue in favour of this approach in countries with high levels of political and economic instability, such as most underdeveloped nations. This is the case of several Latin American countries at present, especially of the Venezuelan oil-driven economy. A country now in a ‘u-turn’ economy, and maybe the only one since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union trying to impose a kind of planned economy and socialism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how assemblages of complex types of knowledge and technologies—including algorithmic mathematics, law and accounting, and high-level logistics—have generated complex predatory formations. The complexity of these formations tends to camouflage their predatory character. Further, such formations are systemic in nature. They are not produced by an elementary seizure of power. Predatory formations are often beyond the reach of ordinary policy responses, in good part because they tend to assemble elements of separate domains into novel configurations. The focus here is on one of the more powerful and complex predatory formations, (high) finance. And the effort is to explain how even the most sophisticated financial instruments require certain elementary and brutal steps, resulting in highly degraded socio-economic outcomes. The sub-prime mortgage developed in the early 2000s differentiates itself from the original 1970s concept in that its aim was not to enable access to housing. Its aim was and is to use the actual physical good (the house) to develop an asset-backed security for the financial system itself. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Scientific Multipolarisation: Its Impact on International Clinical Research Collaborations and Theoretical Implications",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article explores the contemporary dynamics of global scientific multipolarisation, and the empirical and theoretical implications of this trend for international clinical research collaborations. The focal point of the article is an ethnographic study of the China Spinal Cord Injury Network (China SCI Net), a transcontinental clinical research infrastructure that is active in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US. Based on findings from this case study, the author suggests that the transition toward a multipolarising science world is associated with significant changes in the ways international collaborations are initiated, organised and justified. For many years, clinical research collaborations between partners in high- and low-to-middle-income countries have involved geographically bound hierarchies between the sponsors, intellectual creators and facilitating technicians of the research. However, the data from the China SCI Net indicate that these boundaries are in important respects transcending, and that a new modality of international clinical research organisation may gradually be taking shape. Theoretically, this article engages in a reflective dialogue with post-colonial theory, and post-colonial science and technology studies. The author suggests that several of the analytical tools that post-colonial science studies offer remain of great relevancy also in the context of a multipolarising science world. Simultaneously, however, the conceptual, methodological and ideological presumptions embedded in post-colonial theory require careful scrutiny, and other complementary strategies are required to capture the impact of the current multipolarisation process in the sciences more completely. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Impact of the Use of Emerging Technologies on Organisational Knowledge-creation Capability by Task Complexity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the context of knowledge-based economy, an organisation’s ability to create knowledge is the most important factor in maintaining its competitiveness. Collective intelligence is posited as a paramount methodology not only for the generation of knowledge pertaining to multifaceted issues but also as a fundamental pillar within the framework of organizational knowledge management. The use of emerging technologies is an important strategy for improving the organisation’s ability to create knowledge through collective intelligence by adding depth and breadth of knowledge. However, excessive use of technology often has a negative impact on organisational knowledge management. Therefore, this study aims to identify the two-sided effect of using emerging technologies (big data analytics (BDA) and online platforms) on organisational knowledge creation according to the complexity of the task. The results of our study suggest that the use of BDA technology for organisational knowledge creation should be maintained at an appropriate level in general, but it is recommended to increase the use of BDA technology for low-complexity tasks. In addition, using online platform technology is difficult to consider as a strategic way to solve high-complexity tasks, but increasing the use of BDA technology can contribute to improving the organisation’s ability to create knowledge. </jats:p>",

Africa would have to increasingly rely on its own strength. Its future lies in its ability to design, forge and enhance a process of renewal of liberation and progress, without which it would not be able to participate as a credible, responsible and respected partner in international relations. Africa continues to be seriously handicapped by four centuries of slave trading and the weight of colonial and neo-colonial domination. It is true that from 1960 till present it has made undeniable progress in education, science, culture and communication, which can be fully appreciated when set against the performance of the colonial era, over a much longer sequence of time. But these achievements should not obscure the continent’s",

From the cultural perspective of STI policy, the article analyses the interactions between four policy cultures representing four groups of social actors (academic, state, business and civil society) that affect the formation and development of STI policy in Vietnam through four stages of development. From there, the article provides a general picture of the role of four groups of policy actors involved in the policymaking process, considering aspects including: (a) the nature of the policy; (b) policy objectives; (c) policy makers; (d) policy instruments; (e) policy specificity and (f) group of agents representing policy culture. Next, the article analyses the formation and development of an innovation-based startup ecosystem that represents the concerns of a third policy culture—an economic policy culture. Finally, the article proposes some initial recommendations to promote the interaction between the components of the STI ecosystem, especially those related to the innovation-based startup ecosystem. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The reaction to the pandemic has put in place some profound transformations. These transformations do not come entirely anew. They are rooted in the long-term process of oscillation between scientism and relativism. Yet, the fallout of the pandemic promises to work as a new global social regulatory system, different from the ones that predate it. Thereby, it preludes to a paradigmatic epistemological shift. I sketch out four dimensions of such a shift, which I refer to in terms of vectors, in order to emphasise the directional as well as orientational nature of such elements. A vector is a pattern of long-term and large-scale social change. It manifests as a historical configuration of power that organises the collective and individual activities of humans. The evolution of these four vectors designs trajectories of development. The four vectors of the shifting horizon of the pandemic are as follows: the normalisation of the colonial exception; the centrality of necro-politics as global technology of control; the displacement of uncertainty from the margin to the centre of the intersectional space between expert knowledge, political power and public opinion; the radicalisation of the word ‘theory’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social history of modern science, particularly the way it acquired social legitimacy, clearly depicts the science and society relationships emerging from the time of Galileo. The social institution of science has evolved as one of the most powerful, highly influential and sought out institutions. Knowledge as public good; peer review of science; prominence attached to open publications; and premium placed on professional recognition and scientific autonomy remained the hall mark of science for the last three centuries. Based on this ethos of science, the social institution of science evolved a unique social contract between science and society in the last six decades. As we enter the second decade of twenty-first century, the social institution of science is undergoing a major change. Three societal forces are responsible for the change: (i) globalisation; (ii) industrial and post-industrial society; and (iii) climate change. What is at stake? Is there a significant change? Is it transforming the very social institution of science? And what implications this has for our contemporary and future society? These are some of the important issues, which will be addressed in this article. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and Society Studies (STSS) Research Workshop was organised by the Centre for Studies in Science Policy, School of Social Sciences, Jawharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, during 25–27 March 2004. STSS is emerging as an important interdisciplinary field of studies. Broadly, the field of STSS covers historical and sociological studies on science and technology; economics of technical change and innovation studies; S&T policy analyses, including technology assessment and forecasting; public understanding of science; science and politics, including international relations in science and technology, scientometrics, and science and gender relations, among other related sub-fields or specialities. Whilst the writings of Karl Marx in the late nineteenth century triggered a debate over the social and economic processes of production and the central role of technical factors shaping our society, other scholars such as Joseph Needham, Joseph Schumpeter, J.D. Bernal, Michael Polyani, Karl Popper, Borris Hessen, Robert K. Merton, Thomas Kuhn and M.N. Saha 1",

    "title": "Chasing Success: An Empirical Model for IT Governance Frameworks Adoption in Australia",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past few decades, information technology (IT) has played a central role in transforming society and enabling the knowledge economy. Such transformation has also introduced new problems, leading to a growing need among organisations to adopt IT governance frameworks in order to provide assurance that their IT operations meet required standards and community expectations. However, the adoption of such frameworks is a complex phenomenon fraught with risks and challenges, and is yet to attract adequate research attention. This study explores factors influencing the success of IT governance frameworks adoption by proposing an integrated research model that draws upon the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework and the Delone and McLean’s information systems (IS) success model. Data were collected from 126 Australian organisations that have adopted IT governance frameworks through mail surveys and analysed using the partial least-squares (PLS) method. The findings demonstrate that ease of use, innovation compatibility, training and external pressures were significant to the success of IT governance frameworks adoption, assessed through user satisfaction; while ease of use, top management support, external support and user satisfaction were found significant to organisational performance. These findings are of relevance to researchers, practitioners and a broad range of organisational stakeholders, given the growing global importance and implications of IT governance frameworks adoption to organisations. </jats:p>",

It examines the influence of government policy, private sector strategies, intellectual property rights, regulatory frameworks, and programmes of foundations and other donors. The article leads to the conclusion that the most important factor to stimulate the development of products for developing countries is the creation of markets through, for example, the creation of international procurement funds to bridge the gap between real needs and effective demand. Intellectual property rights are often portrayed as a major deterrent to the availability of products for the poor in developing countries, but the hepatitis B case study does not support this assertion. On the national front, the most important inputs of the government are to support biomedical research, to provide transparent means of intellectual property protection and to support the development of national drug regulatory agencies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The establishment of university spin-offs differs across schools as a result of the interactions among different intuitional settings. This study examines the role of institutional factors in the context of state-controlled universities, which are the majority in East Asia, but have not been the focus of the existing literature. The University of Tokyo experienced a significant shift from an anti-industry university collaboration culture to a leading entrepreneurial university in the mid-2000s. This study proposes a chronological investigation of the policies and culture of this state-owned top research university and addresses its significant efforts to create an entrepreneurial environment. First, despite the regulatory constraints, the university has established an incubator and early-stage investment resource, benefiting from prior experimental experiences in an independent research centre. Second, it opened a special non-degree entrepreneurship education programme for students and postdoctoral researchers. These facts show the importance of an organisational initiative even in a state-controlled context. Regarding the reasons why such changes did not cause internal cultural conflict, our case studies suggest that the academic and commercial bicultural system introduced by the University of Tokyo balanced the fulfilment of traditional academic roles with the drive for innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article empirically explores whether the Korean research and development (R&amp;D) paradox has been intensified during the post-global financial crisis (2009–2018). We employ the augmented production function model to test the intensified R&amp;D paradox, which is defined as a continuous decline in a firm’s output elasticity of R&amp;D investment. Using a data set of 720 R&amp;D-active firms, which have ever received more than one government funding, this study drew the following major conclusions on the whole sample firms and two sub-sample firms (smart convergence and conventional industries). First, the R&amp;D paradox has been intensified in the post-global financial crisis over the past decade. Second, the smart convergence industry shows higher a firm’s output elasticity of R&amp;D investment than the conventional one does. Third, in recent years, R&amp;D investment failed to even have significant effect on the value-added. Last, a firm’s output elasticity of R&amp;D investment was found to be much more vulnerable in large and semi-large firms than in SMEs in Korea. In sum, this study confirms the intensified Korean R&amp;D paradox during the post-global financial crisis in Korea. We discuss the government’s role in resolving the R&amp;D paradox in Korea. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this conversation, Bharat Bhushan Tyagiji, national award winning farmer from western Uttar Pradesh, and social anthropologist Richa Kumar, together attempt to analyse the alternative perspective of Tyagiji on the current crisis of farming in India, especially Punjab. Unlike typical alternative perspectives that uncritically glorify ‘tradition’, romanticise nature, and dismiss science and machines, Tyagiji’s views are refreshingly different. His focus is on the present; he is not enamoured by tradition or by so-called traditional knowledge. At the same time, he seeks to put science back in its place—within a larger discourse and appreciation of the knowledge of living in this world with meaning and purpose. He argues for working with scientific knowledge rather than dismissing it entirely, and he wants to use technology as part of a system that also centrally values human labour. But before we can change agriculture, he argues, we have to first contend with questions of how we want to live, and what we want to value. This conversation is a small contribution towards helping us think through some of these vexing questions in the context of the future of farming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the increase in government spending on R&amp;D in South Korea (hereafter Korea), there have been limits in enhancing the impact and commercialisation of research outcomes. A new approach to the current mode of R&amp;D is considered necessary to tackle this problem. In 2014, Korea implemented a new competition policy on national R&amp;D by designating six R&amp;D programmes from four different government departments as Competition-type R&amp;D. The purpose of this study is to examine the actual conditions for adoption and to further promote early establishment and wide implementation of the new competition policy on national R&amp;D, and identify the ways for improvement. In this study, we have approached the case with a life-cycle perspective of plan–management–evaluation of R&amp;D. Multiple sources of data collection included documents, surveys and unstandardised interviews with the staff members in the government sector organisations and agencies responsible for the national R&amp;D management. Based on the results of the analysis, we bring suggestions on three areas of improvement: (a) materialising suitable projects to enrol in the R&amp;D competition programme; (b) suggesting competition models for each stage of R&amp;D life cycle; and (c) establishing the institutional basis upon which the policy may be widely adopted. Finally, we discuss possible improvements and the limits of this study. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Video games featuring violent contents have become more and more prevalent among children and teenagers. It is therefore imperative to ponder on questions such as ‘Are violent video games dangerous digital games?’ and ‘What negative emotions do they trigger in gamers?’ As such, this study aims to explore the negative emotions that violent video games trigger in gamers and determine the cause for each negative emotion. For the purpose of this research, Resident Evil, a violent video game, has been chosen as the focus. Taking the gamer’s perspective, the study aims to explore and construct a thorough network structure (game triggered event—gamer’s personal belief—feeling of negative emotions) of gamer’s emotions, the structure of gamers’ emotional cluster and the correlation and level of inter-influence between relevant factors. Results of the study reveal that the overall hierarchical value map (HVM) not only presents a comprehensive gamer emotional network structure but also offers a clear illustration of how key game activating events (enemies, stage mission, BOSS level monsters, horror atmosphere, third-person view) lead to the formation of gamers’ personal beliefs of character death, high difficulty, trigger negative emotion, being frightened, enemy ambush and tough enemies, which ultimately lead to negative emotions such as fear, worry, anger, disgust and frustration on gamers’ part. In addition, among the five gamer emotional clusters, the clusters of fear and anger had the heaviest influence on the gamers. The correlation between factors and influence showed different levels of significance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Peripheral countries tend to absorb new technology rather than produce it. They tend to adopt instead of create, and learn by introducing incremental innovations. In some cases, this technological trajectory based upon incremental innovation can lead to the emergence of radical innovation. This paper shows such a case in deep water offshore oil exploration, which was done by the Brazilian state-owned petroleum company. Petrobrás arrived at the technological frontier and is recognised as a leader in a field which now has competing technologies. The case permits an understanding of this competition, which, given the local nature of the learning process, is a competition between companies and even economic spaces. The paper examines the factors that affect the use of technologies with similar competing technologies. Finally, the paper examines the significance of such technological trajectories in peripheral countries. The strategy followed by Petrobrás is examined in order to understand how a company, in a mature technological sector and a not so innovative national context, has been so successful. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Entrepreneurship has emerged as an important career option in several developing countries, particularly in Africa. Consequently, entrepreneurship education and training has been sought out by people who have low or no formal education. Governments and donors have tendency to consider entrepreneurship as an instrument to lift up the most vulnerable population such as uneducated women, school drop outers and people with disabilities. However, there is a shortage of technological entrepreneurship in developing countries. This paper investigated the influential factors affecting the entrepreneurial motivation, intentions and decisions among African scientists and engineers’ postgraduates from China universities since 1995 to 2014. Only 6% of respondents are in technological entrepreneurship related to their field of graduation. Conclusion remark is given to encourage technological entrepreneurship which will provide more opportunities, create jobs and improve people’s quality of life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article attempts to explore the concept of scientific community at the macro-national level in the context of Iran. Institutionalisation of science and its professional growth has been constrained by several factors. The article first conceptualises the notion of science community as found in the literature in the context of Iran, and attempts to map through some indicators. The main focus, however, lies in mapping some institutional problems through empirical research. This was undertaken in 2002–04 in order to analyse the structure of the scientific community in Iran in the ‘exact sciences’ (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and earth sciences). The empirical work was done in two complementary perspectives: through a questionnaire and statistical analysis of it, and through semi-structured interviews with the researchers. </jats:p><jats:p> There are number of problems confronting scientists in Iran. Facilities provided by institutions is one of the major problems of research. Another is the tenuous cooperation among scientists. This is reported by most of the researchers, who deplore the lack of cooperation among their group. Relationships are mostly with the Ph.D. students and only marginally with colleagues. </jats:p><jats:p> Our research shows that the more brilliant the scientists, the more frustrated they are from scientific institutions in Iran. Medium-range researchers seem to be much happier about the scientific institution to which they belong than the brighter scholars. The scientific institutions in Iran seem to be built for the needs of the former rather than the latter. These institutions seem not to play a positive role in the case of the best scientists. On the whole, many ingredients of the scientific community, at least at its inception, are present among Iranian scientists: the strong desire for scientific achievement in spite of personal, institutional and economic problems. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem: A Case Study of the Central University of Technology, Free State",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2015 Global Report (GEM, 2015), South Africa (SA) had the lowest youth entrepreneurial propensity of only 23.3 per cent. Among the sub-Saharan African countries surveyed, Uganda recorded the highest youth entrepreneurs with 55.6 per cent of the youth population involved in nascent, new or established businesses. South Africa had the lowest youth entrepreneurship participation of only 12.8 per cent, and recorded the highest level of non-entrepreneurial youth with 63.9 per cent of the youth population (GEM, 2015). According to Puuka (2014), SA has not yet unleashed its entrepreneurial potential. Despite the importance of small- and medium-sized enterprises for the economy and job creation, SA’s established business rate is only 2.3 per cent—the second lowest in the world. South Africa needs new job creators to solve the job crisis. A new philosophy and approach to education in general are required; more specifically in a higher education sub-system of universities of technology in SA that is designed to lead to work opportunity-enhancing outcomes. The Central University of Technology, Free State (CUT), SA has, in line, with its Vision 2020 that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic developments set a goal of transforming CUT into an innovative and entrepreneurial university, and of becoming a robust agent for socio-economic development in the city and the region. This article gives an overview of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem established at the University, the city and the region; the creation of an increasingly robust innovation and entrepreneurship pipeline; and initiatives that started in 2012 in the field of curriculum innovation, and innovation and entrepreneurship education later in 2014. These initiatives, together with international examples cited, show that universities could pursue the path to innovation and entrepreneurship education with outcomes that impact the broader society. True to the universities of technology’s general philosophy of education, the path involves innovation, entrepreneurship education, research, idea generation and technology transfer. Based on a literature study of global perspectives on entrepreneurship education and lessons to be learnt, the paper discusses the enablers to promote entrepreneurship education at CUT and key elements of the University’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy. Furthermore, it shares successes and some challenges of these efforts at CUT, which are evident in the increasing national recognition of our innovation and entrepreneurship activities. The impact of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship ecosystem on the knowledge production from CUT in the past few years are also illustrated. The article concludes that the overarching challenge to ensuring high impact and relevance is dependent on the development and successful implementation of an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem, buy-in of all internal and external stakeholders and dedicated resources. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays, innovation management paradigm has been changed from internal development to networking and cooperation between Science &amp; Technology network. Open innovation approach is also one of the new approaches of new innovation management that has modified internal research and development suppositions to research and development through cooperation. Accessing an appropriate technological environment and continuous awareness require various tools and methods. One of these tools is monitoring of this technological environment by the use of technology intelligence system. The purpose of this study is surveying the effect of open innovation approach on technology intelligence application in Iran’s aviation industry. The sampling method in this article is the stratified sampling of experts from the aviation industry, which includes 81 experts, managers of industrial and researching institutions, designers and superior designers, managers of repairing and maintenance, and a Private company (Aviation Union members). The tool for data gathering is a questionnaire that has been used according to validation of the content validity by experts of industry and academic. In the present research, two standard models, Savioz ( 2004 ) for measuring technology intelligence and Hafkesbrink ( 2010 ) for measuring open innovation approach, have been used. Results show that these two elements can be applied exclusively in organisation for technology trend analysis and technology or idea acquisition approach. Finally, the relationship between the concepts of open innovation and intelligence was investigated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> States that claim responsibility for citizens’ healthcare try to deal with knowledge uncertainties while preserving a duty of care. Production of clinical guidelines in disputed medical conditions or where uncertainty is high, is difficult. Patient groups may advocate non-credentialed evidence, contribute to debates and form alliances with established policy actors. In this context, Lyme disease, especially highly contested ‘chronic’ Lyme disease is a good case with which to examine how official governance institutions are managing diagnostic uncertainty and evidence for tests. The healthcare state has been provoked to develop extensive policy for Lyme disease. In the UK, national Health Technology Assessment agency, NICE, began a consultation process in 2016. NICE and other policy actors are moving towards more participatory modes of decision-making. The article analyses NICE’s recently published guidelines and consultation documents; patient groups’ contributions; observations of consultations and of evidence review processes; and recent Department of Health systematic reviews, including patient group participation. We draw on concepts of participatory governance, patient group activism and guideline involvement. We find an increased level of participation by patient groups in recent policy and evidence review processes, and hence legitimation of them as ‘stakeholders’, alongside a strengthened state position on pre-existing diagnostic and testing standards. </jats:p>",

The results show compelling evidence of a structural relationship between sociopolitical/economic pressures and economic performance. Additionally, these pressures vary by industry, and activities to secure both social and economic legitimacy due to these pressures have a positive impact on overall firm performance. </jats:p>",

It is already clear from a number of efforts led by NGOs that, to be equitable and institutionally sustainable, the rehabilitation of both common and private lands needs action rooted in strong resource user groups capable of taking decisions in a participatory and resolving conflict. To build up groups in this way requires both time and skills, both of which have proven elusive in government projects and programmes. The key question addressed by this book is how far the approaches developed (or adapted) by the public sector have been applied on a wide scale, for without such approaches neither the ecological nor livelihood benefits of watershed rehabilitation will be achieved.",

    "title": "Symbol as Metonymy and Metaphor: A Sociological Perspective on Mathematical Symbolism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As a social practice, mathematics remains shrouded in mystery and seems inaccessible for outsiders. It comes across as a closed formal system that is largely considered independent of the people who practise it and hence totally impervious to sociological investigation. This article seeks to question these assumptions and is offered as a contribution to an emerging sociology of mathematics and abstraction. The argument unfolds on an ethnographic register and follows the reactions to a particular mathematical symbol in two different contexts. The first stretch of the description tracks the responses to this symbol on an online forum devoted to discussing mathematics and the other draws from a classroom context the author was part of as a participant observer. Thus focussing on just one aspect of mathematical practice, the way in which symbols are handled by practitioners, it attempts to underline the character of mathematics as a distinctive form of sociality. In the process it raises and seeks to address the following questions. What do controversies over and reactions to mathematical symbols tell us about mathematics as a practice? What roles do symbols play in the mathematical discourse? And, can a broader sociological perspective on mathematical symbolism be developed? </jats:p>",

    "title": "Consensus or Contestation: Reflections on Governance of Innovation in a Context of Heterogeneous Knowledges",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Governance of innovation needs to cater in a democratic way for heterogeneity of knowledges. Many initiatives in the democratisation of innovation aspire to some sort of consensus among relevant actors. However, consensus tends to silence dissenting voices, typically those of marginalised groups. In situations of high epistemic and epistemological diversity, this problem can be expected to aggravate. Against consensus-seeking theories of deliberative democracy, Chantal Mouffe has proposed the aspiration to grant the possibility of contestation. While one central principle in many theories of democracy is that it should never silence dissenting or minority positions, Mouffe elevates contestation, rather than the pursuit of consensus, to be the linchpin of democracy. I will explore what a contestation-oriented view of democratisation could mean in the case of governing innovation, specifically in the case of biogasification of rice straw. The latter is commonly presented as a potentially beneficial use of rice straw, which is currently considered waste and (illegally) burned by farmers on the Indian countryside. However, our research has shown that this view indeed unduly suppresses valuable yet marginalised knowledges. Lessons for frameworks such as Responsible Research and Innovation, and particularly an alternative to the dominant aim of democratising innovation through deliberation, will be drawn. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the tensions between the statist project of securing national bodies—geopolitics—and the governmental project of securing populations—biopolitics. It is based on historical, public health, and ethnographic evidence from a coastal region of India with high background radiation, due to large deposits of thorium in beach sands. Thorium is a critical resource in the Indian state’s long-term programme of energy independence; long-term exposure to radiation is also what comes to define this community as a biomedically-induced population. This article shows that once thorium becomes identified as a state resource, the social meaning of place decays and the ability to imagine local futures becomes increasingly strained. The article concludes that the imperative of establishing a secure future for the nation–state requires that the future of this community be rendered in terms of sacrifice, an increasingly unstable trope of Indian nation-building. </jats:p>",

We propose an individual-organisation-environment-process model, which we illustrate with the case study of Zhejiang University. Our findings pinpoint the importance of identifying the three basic mechanisms driving the AEE model, incentive, collaboration and capability mechanisms. The incentive mechanism is the driving force that could change the organisational framework, as well as individual research goals through the reform of the personnel assessment system and the entrepreneurial income distribution system. The collaboration mechanism is the vehicle of the AEE model that enables new entrepreneurial models and business start-up by improving university’s governance structures and building up entrepreneurial networks. The capability mechanism is the element for sustainable academic entrepreneurship through a combination of different entrepreneurial capabilities in a university. </jats:p>",

Our primary research question is: What are the impacts of open innovation, entrepreneurship and their synergy effects onto innovation performance, especially onto Korean Information Technology (IT) SMEs? To answer this question, a survey was conducted about open innovation, entrepreneurship orientation, business models and sales, and innovation performance for approximately 400 Korean SMEs in the IT sector.

R&amp;D statistics in developing countries are still scarce, particularly in Africa. Furthermore, they may not fully explain the characteristics of R&amp;D in developing countries, for example, the dynamics of R&amp;D systems, R&amp;D practices, informal behaviours and contributions, just to mention a few. It is, therefore, argued that beyond indicators, there is a need for complementary surveys to derive, inter alia, descriptors and narratives. In the concluding part, the particular characteristics of R&amp;D in developing countries and the resulting consequences for R&amp;D measurement are discussed, focusing on implications and recommendations, in view of a possible addition and/or future revision of the Frascati Manual. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The goal of this article is to map out attitudes towards animal experimentation in Europe (EU15 plus Switzerland), more specifically, to document the current attitudes, perform cross-national comparison of the trends of attitudes towards animal experimentation and of the explanatory factors of these attitudes. We assume that the conception of nature and science influences the perception of animal research. This study analyses a series of surveys that measure European public attitudes towards science and technology, the Eurobarometer (EB) 2001 and 2005. The majority of European countries refused animal experimentation in 2005 and we observe downward trend in every country, except Belgium and Spain. If the trend is similar among the countries the patterns of explanation of these attitudes are quite heterogeneous. Attitudes towards animal testing are explained in every country by attitudes towards science and nature, and by sociodemographic variables (except in Spain and Austria), and in very few countries by scientific knowledge (Belgium) or by values (Sweden and Switzerland). These results may have consequences for science and contribute therefore to the public understanding of science (PUS) research. </jats:p>",

The author argues that lock-in effects operate, placing Indian firms into a non-innovative dependent path because higher-end services are difficult to outsource. More importantly user- feedback linkages critical to innovation cannot develop with a distant client and a still more distant final user. Consequently, domain knowledge vital for innovation is not accumulated by Indian firms. He recommends diversification of export markets away from over-dependence on the USA and development of a vibrant home market. </jats:p>",

The development of plant breeding played a critical role in the professionalisation of Mexi can agronomy, and reflected larger changes in the Mexican political system, society and economy. Mexico's agronomists took advantage of political changes to establish and cement an alliance with the state and used it to advance the interests of their profession. The agronomists' struggled to find a place in society during the Age of Liberalism and finally obtained limited assistance from the state by offering to advance its economic pro ject. The Mexican Revolution (1910-20) gave them an opportunity to serve the state's political agenda by participating in its land reform and cultural programmes. During the 1940s and afterwards the agronomists maintained their alliance with the state by becom ing plant breeders and producing the Green Revolution, which contributed to the Eco nomic Miracle and deflected criticism of the land reform. Lastly, I evaluate the impact of the crisis of the revolution on Mexican agronomy and consider how the agronomists' path to professionalisation affected Mexico's agricultural development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The energy intensity of Indian manufacturing has declined signifi cantly since 1992. Between 1992–93 and 2007–08, it fell by about 50 per cent. However, it seems, there is scope for further substantial decline in energy intensity, since industrial energy consumption data across states indicate signifi cant inter-plant variation in the energy intensity of energy-intensive industries. The paper examines the factors that infl uence energy intensity in Indian industries. The results of the analysis indicate that the post-1992 decline in energy intensity of Indian manufacturing is attributable mostly to an improvement in energy use efficiency of energy-intensive industries, which in turn may be traced in part to hikes in the real price of energy paid by manufacturing fi rms. The results also show a signifi cant impact of technological change on energy intensity and presence of energy efficiency spillover effects from foreign fi rms to local firms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "WE ARE HAPPY to bring out this special issue on ’Social History of Science’ for two specific reasons. First, during the short period of our existence (now in the fourth year) we were able to publish three other special issues (volume 1, number 2 on ’Changing Trends in Science Policy’; volume 2, number 2 on ’International Mobility of Brains in Science and Technology’; and volume 3, number 1 on ’Comparative Perspectives on Technological Learning’). Volume 4, number 1 carried a special section-’Special Symposium on STS: Towards the Twenty-first Century’. Second, our interaction and collaboration with scholars towards bringing out these special issues of the journal, in a large measure, indicate the emerging professionalisation of the broader field of STS studies in the context of the developing world. This is indeed encouraging for our new interdisciplinary journal on STS studies. We sincerely hope and assure our audience that this journal (as indicated in the editorial of our very first issue) will continue to encourage STS themes and subfields defined in its broader sense of perspectives and parameters by the community. In doing so,",

    "abstract": "Feminism is a complex social phenomenon that has suffered misadventures and traveled down a number of blind alleys. Liberal feminism called for womens rights equal education pay and opportunity that provided them to make it in a mans world. However this has also led into certain blind alleys such as the tendency to: ignore or altogether deny sex and gender differences and the search for womens distinctive research methods. Feminists started developing the following three basic tenets of so called \"difference feminism\". First difference feminism diverged from liberalism in focusing on the differences between men and women. Second it also revalued qualities traditionally devalued as feminine such as subjectivity cooperation empathy and the likes. And finally it was argued that changes not only in women but also in science classrooms curricula laboratories theories priorities and research programs are needed for women to become equal in science. Feminism has brought impressive changes to science. Two examples are from the US where gender studies have had a massive impact on the content of science are medicine and primatology. However the question of who or what might create beneficial change in science has been confused by Americans mistrust in feminism. Moreover to test whether women or feminism will do or have done science differently would require a complex study of the history of science. Understanding the process of change can enhance efforts to open science to women throughout the world.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research technology organizations (RTOs) are undergoing a transition in their traditional role. This transition is driven by two key shifts in the environment within which RTOs operate: increasing pressure to commercialise research outputs and the internationalisation of the research endeavor, providing new opportunities for both funding and transfer of outputs. We note that these trends are felt in both industrialised and industrialising economies, acknowledging a need for properly framed comparative studies. Among the key questions addressed here: How do open, global R&amp;D networks affect RTO research portfolios? Does building national resources reduce international opportunities? Can Asian RTOs reorient their operations from doing basic research to producing commercialisable outputs as effectively as some of their European counterparts? Before reviewing important developments in the RTO literature, we distinguish several types of RTOs. The literature reflecting the abovementioned environmental shifts indicates that RTOs play an important role in helping industrialising economies catch up with their industrialised counterparts. We note also the role RTOs play in transferring university research outputs, and call for more studies of the role of RTOs in industrialization as opposed to agricultural development. We close with brief descriptions of the five studies that comprise this special issue. </jats:p>",

As opposed to the earlier strategies, these new networking strategies seek to encourage establishment of locally based research, development and design facilities to meet both the local and inter- ndtional demand for increasingly sophisticated spectrum of products. Developing nations stand to capture and gain from these advantages provided their structures are equipped to bed these new knowledge capacities into their national technology strategies. There is a series of various factor advantages behind these new demands of economic competition. </jats:p><jats:p> At the heart of capturing value-added advantage from the new economic and technological order lies the whole spectrum of reordering the S&amp;T skill base including the educational system which seeks to develop more strategically informed inter- and multidisciplinary S&amp;T programmes.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the turn of the millennium, Singapore has made significant investments in its biomedical research sector, with in recent years an increasing emphasis on efforts to ‘translate’ the fruits of research into clinical applications. In this paper, we investigate how translational research trajectories are built in present-day Singapore, through a case study pertaining to the use of retinal photography for disease screening. The circulation of such images in the context of a tele-ophthalmology pilot service designed to support the early detection of eye disease related to diabetes, helps attune research to clinical practice and vice versa, in ways that open possibilities for future medical innovation. Our case study points to an inversion of the typical characterization of translational research as a process that begins at the ‘bench’ and then moves downstream (to the ‘bed’) in a linear fashion. It also illuminates certain distinctive features of the current biomedical innovation landscape in the city-state that may provide insights for other countries embarking on medical research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Decoupling of the global value chains in the semiconductor industry under digital transformation has not been adequately investigated, although it is a popular topic with the emerging technological rivalry globally. This study empirically examines the following research question to contribute to the limited research. How do firms’ collaborations across regional and national boundaries moderate the effects of open innovation on performance in the semiconductor industry after digital transformation under the decoupling of the global value chain? This study analyses patents which had been registered at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) in the semiconductor industry during 2004 and 2020 at the representative terms of before and after digital transformation. Findings are as follows: First, digital transformation motivates semiconductor enterprises’ collaboration effects over regional and national boundaries. Second, the decoupling of the semiconductor industry in the global value chain negatively moderates the effects of open innovation on firms’ performance across regional and national boundaries. Therefore, by reconstructing the global value chain of the semiconductor industry, the negative moderating effects of the semiconductor industry’s decoupling could be diminished. In addition, by constructing a national semiconductor cluster in South Korea, the benefits of digital transformation in the semiconductor industry could be increased. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Small firms choose to innovate even in a challenging environment. Unlike stylised facts, innovation by small and medium firms in South Asia is not just technology-based but is rather human resource oriented. Using microdata from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we find that learning, research and development, and formal training impact innovation the most. We use a mix of frequentist statistics and machine learning algorithms. Learning is the core factor valid for all streams of innovation. Combining the learning with the other two causes a discernible increase in the chance to innovate. Any improvement in learning in the firm will make strides in innovation. However, to sustain this, there is a need for policies that combine innovation with research and development and with training. An innovation ecosystem that fosters these combinations through collaborations will be impactful. Learning is the tipping point of innovation to have new products and processes, an adaptive organisation and a new marketing strategy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social enterprises are considered to be at the heart of inclusive growth due to their emphasis on people and social cohesion that help effect social and economic transformation. In the Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011–2015), two out of ten objectives are on achieving inclusive growth. In this context, this article explores the ecosystem for social enterprises in Malaysia, raising the following research questions: (a) what are the attributes (features) of business incubators (BIs) and intermediaries (IMs) operating in the social enterprise sector in Malaysia? (b) What are the perceptions of BIs and IMs on various aspects of the social enterprise ecosystem in Malaysia? (c) What is the role of BIs and other IMs in fostering social entrepreneurship (SE) in Malaysia in general and meeting the inclusive growth objective of the country in particular? This study employs the qualitative approach and primary data gathered through interviews of six BIs and IMs and twenty social enterprises. This study found that the current social enterprise ecosystem is weak and still emerging and has yet to take a concrete shape. The absence of legal status for social enterprise is the single most important obstacle in unlocking the potential growth of social enterprise sector. This study suggests that the government initiates policy measures to give legal status to social enterprises in the country, in order to develop the ecosystem and facilitate a greater participation of the private sector. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Export is an important way to promote the innovation and growth of energy enterprises by learning new knowledge and technology. To explore the impact mechanism of energy enterprises’ export behaviour on technological innovation, this article uses the micro data of 8,548 energy enterprises in the Chinese Industrial Enterprise Database from 2004 to 2007 for propensity score matching analysis, from the two dimensions of technological innovation willingness and technological innovation capability. The empirical results show that (a) the export behaviour of energy enterprises has a significant promotion effect on the technological innovation willingness and capability of energy enterprises; export behaviour has a continuous promotion effect on the technological innovation willingness of energy enterprises, and this promotion effect has gradually increased. There is a time lag in the promotion effect of export behaviour on the technological innovation capability of energy enterprises, and this promotion effect is gradually increasing. (b) Compared with non-state-owned energy enterprises, export behaviours have a more immediate effect on the technological innovation willingness of state-owned energy enterprises; compared with small and medium-sized energy enterprises, export behaviours have a more positive impact on the technological innovation willingness and capabilities of large energy enterprises. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Biobanks are a growing phenomenon in global biomedicine, as they are key tools of precision medicine initiatives. National biobanks, however, collect data and biological material from populations in specific regions, and the knowledge that national biobanks yield can impact understandings of identity, origins and belonging. Drawing on ethnographic work and documentary analysis examining the Israeli and Qatari national biobanks, I find that these two Middle Eastern biobanks aim to contribute to global biobanking trends, while at the same time, they reinforce local ethnic and national identities. The Israeli biobank reflects pre-existing ethnic identities in Israeli society, while the Qatari biobank predominantly emphasises the emergent national character of the Qatari population. Neither of the biobanks assert a high genetic homogeneity of the national population; rather, they both emphasise a genetically diverse national cohort that is a valuable resource for biomedical research. Through a comparative analysis of global biobanking and ethnic identities, this article demonstrates that biobanks are a rich site for tracking emergent national identities in the Middle East region. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Provincialising STS? A View from Latin America: A Note on Workshop",
    "abstract": "In the recent ESOCITE Congress (Latin American Society for the Social Study of Science and Technology) in Santiago Chile, some of us2 made a call for a session to debate the topic: Provincialising STS? A view from Latin America.1 This was in response to some ideas put forward by several colleagues from developed countries in recent years suggesting some lines to think about science and technology studies (STS) in contexts that might be called ‘non-hegemonic’. Thus, John Law called to ‘provincialise STS’, while others like Sandra Harding and W. Anderson proposed to think on ‘postcolonial STS.’ Both explicitly include Latin America in their reflections. In this open session, we proposed to discuss some of these ideas, putting them in a dialogue with the development of STS in Latin America, although also looking towards other regions. The aim is to discuss critically from a historical perspective theoretical and methodological proposals, as well as empirical cases, to put them in the context of local historical developments. Contrary to the assertions of some authors from developed countries, who argue that post-colonial analyses in social studies on science are a recent phenomenon, we aim to show the diversity of studies in Latin America and how various theoretical-methodological references have been approached in the region, their uses and limitations. Given the time constraint, we decided that four colleagues from different countries would make brief presentations discussing this new attention to STS in peripheral contexts, while Lea Velho and Hebe Vessuri acted as chair and discussant of the session. As a set, we believe that the ideas presented contributed to enrich and refine the historical views of the Latin American STS field, taking into account its contextual, political, institutional cultural and cognitive dimensions. We include here all six views, with the promise of having full papers in the future.",

    "title": "Introduction: Asian Biopoleis—Biomedical Research in ‘The Asian Century’",
    "abstract": "In early 2010, a group of us at the National University of Singapore (NUS) began focusing on the phenomenon of biomedical research in East and South-east Asia, a topic which until then had evoked surprisingly little interest among local social scientists or humanities scholars despite the enthusiasm of colleagues in medicine and life sciences. Organised under the banner ‘Asian Biopoleis’, our project has, over time, enlisted researchers from countries throughout the region and around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China and Taiwan, Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands, India, Denmark, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Australia, as well as Singapore. Some collaborators were drawn into our orbit because they were already working on Singapore’s Biopolis (our premier collection of biomedical research facilities) as subject and field site. Others were induced to come here on the strength of our project, particularly its opportunities for funding. By ‘us’ we mean a core (though expanding) group of social science and humanities scholars associated with the Science, Technology, and Society (STS) Cluster at the Asia Research Institute (ARI), the largest STS research centre in South-east Asia, and the only one operating at an English-language Asian university. Asian Biopoleis soon became the ‘flagship’ project around which Singapore’s STS community, with otherwise diverse research interests, literally clustered. Now in its third and last year of funding under a Ministry of Education grant, the project looks set to continue on its own initiative, given the momentum established by three years of intense, productive and wide-ranging scholarship, and the ever-increasing presence of bioscience in this and other Asian societies.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Our main argument in this paper is that South African science is currently experiencing the third major transitional period in its long and interesting history. With the advent of a free and democratic South Africa in 1994, a new era dawned for science as well. We argue, in the main body of the paper, that it is appropriate to refer to this as the third transitional phase in the history of South African science. Two parallel challenges face the new government: first, to democratise the science system; second, to ensure that the national system of innovation is indeed sufficiently competitive to take its rightful place within a globalising science system. The paper discusses in some detail how South African science has attempted to address these two challenges over the past eight years. It concludes with an assessment of the current tensions and challenges in the national system of innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the unique dataset from the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of the People’s Republic of China, this study aims to provide a patent citation-based analysis of technological innovation in China. This study provides an overall description of Chinese invention patent citations, including citations added by both inventors and examiners. Specifically, our work analyses the inventor citations and examiner citations of both international- and domestic-granted patents in SIPO from four different aspects: citations per patent, foreign citation dependence, highly cited patents and current impact index. Our research results indicate the following: (a) the quantity of citations per patent added by foreign applicants was much larger than that of the Chinese applicants in SIPO, and both decreased year after year. (b) Chinese applicants cited many technological references from seven major foreign countries and drew greatly from external technology and science, but Chinese applicants tended to refer more to domestic technology. (c) The overall impact of Chinese patents became stronger, but invention patents in some developed regions had only relatively weak technological impact. (d) The number of high-quality invention patents surged in every province, but high-quality patents remain mainly distributed in four developed areas. Finally, we propose several suggestions from a policy perspective. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Management of risk perception, in addition to risk itself, is an important pillar of risk governance. Risk communication became pervasive in post-Fukushima Japan as the power industry grappled with the decline in support for and trust in nuclear power. Using case studies of risk communication programmes by the nuclear industry after the Fukushima nuclear accident, this article analyses the deployment of lay people, particularly women, in risk communication as an emergent characteristic of contemporary risk communication. The data are published documents, websites and videos made by two organisations affiliated with the electric power industry. Drawing on theories of neoliberal governmentality and post-feminist gender settlement, this article highlights how contemporary risk discourse refashions risk into something positive, rather than only potentially negative: risk becomes something to be bravely taken by savvy individuals, particularly women. This article shows how women are incorporated into risk communication not only as targets but also as messengers, and how the contents of risk communication weave feminist and post-feminist themes together in order to appeal to women. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The intermediaries are important organisations in mitigating systemic failures. Few of such failures are those of university–industry linkages (UILs). Although there are several previous studies, they did not pay adequate attention on how these intermediaries accumulate their capabilities that are necessary to perform their roles over time. This study will try to partially fill in such gap by investigating capabilities-building processes of intermediaries. The intermediaries in Hard Disk Drive (HDD) industry in Thailand was selected as a case study. Qualitative data was collected from 20 semi-structured and in-depth interviews of intermediaries’ management, university researchers and industrial companies in the intermediaries’ networks. The findings show that the intermediaries play consulting, brokering, mediating and resources providing roles. They assist to increase levels of interactions between university and industry, transform informal to formal relationships and nurture potential human resources for the industry. However, performing such activities depends on the intermediaries’ capabilities. Four key capabilities encompass network capabilities, coordination capabilities, knowledge-building capabilities and management capabilities. Underneath them, strategic capabilities, depending on leadership, engender the intermediaries’ visions and strategies. Human resources development is stimulated through individual and collective learning. These four capabilities are embedded into the existing organisational systems by using mentoring and on-the-job training for newcomers, building up the database system and arranging meetings for knowledge sharing on a regular basis. However, discontinuity of government supports leads to a decrease in network members, transformation of formal relationships back to informal ones and the close down of intermediary. </jats:p>",

A survey, including several items that assessed Turkish public opinion about nanotechnology and identified participant demographics, was used to collect data. The sample comprised 513 participants. The results of the dataset indicate that the Turkish public is unfamiliar with nanotechnology. In fact, most of the sample had heard little or nothing about nanotechnology. However, the respondents displayed positive emotions toward nanotechnology. The results of this study provide initial insights into the Turkish public’s perception of nanotechnology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines two important aspects of knowledge output: the degree of concentration in knowledge output and the nature of social network, taking the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), a known scholarly periodical in the social sciences, as a case. We analyse the author data, looking at the frequency distribution of authors against the number of papers published and the social network of authors during the period 1996–2005. While the degree of concentration is assessed using a power law, namely Lotka’s law, the co-author data is transformed to a symmetric sociogram. The study covers 1,803 authors who published research articles in the EPW, including contributions by social scientists, policy professionals and scientists. It appears the progress in Indian social science has an apparent link with the history of EPW, accounting for a significant part of intellectual output and scholarly discourses in Indian social science. Taking cues from scholarly lineages, which investigate knowledge as a social phenomenon including the sociology of science, economics of knowledge and social network theory, we examine an important question: What is the degree of concentration prevailing in the EPW, during 1996–2005? Does the social network of authors, captured from the data, provide explanations for the degree of concentration? Our analysis shows that a high degree of the concentration of the authors and a relatively organised social network of authors coexist, indicating that the concentration in knowledge output, perhaps, is inherently linked to the structure. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reports on the profiles of the National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) in the three Maghreb countries: Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, through their research policies, human resources, governance, funding and scientific production. A bibliometric study was carried out for the three selected countries based on the Scopus database covering the period between 2005 and 2019. The research shows the distinctive case of Tunisian growth of scientific production compared to the other two countries; it also stresses the universities’ emergence as a major research actor, thus challenging the predominance of the public mission-oriented institutions dedicated to agriculture and veterinary sciences. Finally, it indicates significant differences between the three countries concerning governance and funding, and human resources. Overall, the NARS in the three countries are still very fragile, and a need for significant changes in the research policy making is certainly required to overcome these shortcomings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study attempts to extend the definition of social innovation within the context of academic entrepreneurship. We consider how academic entrepreneurs can undertake commercial activities, and which ones, and how these activities contribute to the contexts of social innovation. We explore two cases that are derived from two premier universities in Taiwan in terms of research and academic entrepreneurship: OurCityLove from National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) and the Forest app from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). The two cases show how social enterprises achieved the financial ability to expand their businesses and create the desired social values. While the first case, derived from NCTU, focused on providing useful information on social spaces, and services for the elderly, parents traveling with babies and those with disabilities (and also creating job opportunities for the latter), the other from NTHU created an app to influence those addicted to playing with their smartphones. The cases illustrate how the two universities capitalised on their technological competencies and academic programmes to support graduates and researchers in venturing into social entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Medical policy analysts and oncologists have cautioned against the high price of anticancer drugs. They argue that the current drug development model that relies on patents and short-term shareholder value is proving unsustainable, since the cost of the new generation of drugs puts many of them out of reach for the average consumer. The high price of cancer drugs is especially troubling in the context of middle- and low-income countries, where the burden of cancer carries disproportionate impact. To analyse the pricing of anticancer drugs, we examined legal controversies, regulatory treaties and documents, as well as the history of pricing data in India. We also conducted interviews with policy consultants and surveyed financial data filings of major global and Indian pharmaceutical corporations. Our research revealed that global trade agreements have become key barriers to lowering anticancer drug prices. This article argues that in the shadow of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) imminent, serious policy changes are necessary to ensure the survival of generic production in the market for anticancer drugs. </jats:p>",

Through case study and patent analysis, this article draws lessons from Taiwan and further discusses the mechanisms in place for the successful commercialisation of university research. Lessons from the case offer insights for Malaysia on how university incubation intermediaries can be reorganised to promote better commercialisation outcomes. The Taiwanese experience illustrates that in the right institutional settings—and particularly with the presence of innovative science and technology parks—university incubators tend to promote favourable commercialisation outcomes. More importantly, the ability of university incubators to source for external knowledge and risk capital support positions them to be more effective as intermediaries. Other key success factors include establishing an adequate intellectual property management system and having adequate human resources equipped with intellectual property knowledge. This article further deliberates policy implications. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a study that placed Brazilian scientific production at the core of the debate, and Brazil as a member of BRICS framework emphasises its importance. It starts from the argument that scientific production is a key factor considering that it is through knowledge that societies evolve. This issue becomes even more relevant when pointing to the capitalist production model that transforms knowledge into wealth. That was the starting point for leading an econometric study to formulate a model to explain Brazilian scientific production from 1994 to 2014. The least square method was used to estimate the parameters of a production function to identify the variables that most influenced, statistically, the behaviour of Brazilian scientific production. The main variables that strongly explained the number of published articles, proxy of the scientific production, are number of post-graduate programmes, number of masters and doctors, Brazilian population and expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D). The present study showed that postgraduate programmes are the ones that most influenced the behaviour of Brazilian published articles. Therefore, it is necessary to equip Brazilian postgraduate system to create the basis of a structure, which, in the near future, will produce knowledge in large scale and with high competitiveness. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Higher educational institutions coupled with research and development (R&amp;D) and S&amp;T institutions are intimately intertwined with the rise of Asia in the global knowledge economy. First Japan, followed by the Dragon economies together with China, South Korea and India continue to play a dominant role in characterising twenty-first century as the Asian Century. In the last couple of decades, the rise of China has caught up the imagination of people and governments alike all over the world. This has happened not only because of China’s manufacturing prowess and skills that the country has mastered over the decades, but also because of her ability and potential to develop human capital, training, advancement of knowledge and innovation impacting the national economy. In other words, science, technology and innovation policies (STI) in the last couple of decades enabled a select band of Chinese universities to not only enhance their research intensity but scale up in the rankings of world-class universities. STI strategies were systematically deployed towards building human capital and promoting ‘triple helix’-based entrepreneurship and innovation in universities. China is second only to the USA in the global research output of papers in science and engineering as well as R&amp;D expenditure. It is the leading nation in the world not only in the production of science and engineering undergraduates and graduates but also PhDs. Chinese multinational firms such as Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and others, emerged to rival those in Japan and the USA in the last two decades. All this could not have been possible without harnessing education at all levels, but particularly in universities impacting advances in science and technology research. In the early 1990s, none of the Chinese universities figured in the top 200 list of World University Rankings. Within two decades, more than half a dozen Chinese universities were listed in the top 200, three in the Top 100 and two in the Top 50. More than any other factor, universities have come to occupy a very significant position in the Chinese national innovation system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study aims at investigating the factors that affected the degree of adoption of new technologies in Nigerian SMEs. New technologies are by and large dominated by ICTs. Data for the analysis come from sixty-seven SMEs located in Aba, Ibadan, Lagos and Nnewi. One of the major factors inhibiting ICT diffusion and intensive utilisation is poor physical infrastructure represented by adequate and uninterrupted electricity supply and communication connectivity infrastructure. Findings of multivariate analysis suggest that firm-level variables such as financial capacity and technological absorptive capacity influenced the intensity of the adoption of ICTs. The results also suggest that globalisation of the Nigerian economy also influenced the adoption of new technologies. The study concludes that SMEs need institutional support in terms of human resource development for the augmentation of their competitiveness in the domestic as well as international markets. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I compare two accounts of how biodiversity restoration, flood protection and bio-physical models are co-produced in the Netherlands. Both are historical accounts of the interplay between research practices, policy discourse and intervention practices, one focusing on rivers and the other on the coastal environment. Three questions will be central to my comparison of the two paths of co-production. First, how have institutional conditions of research contributed to shaping the bio-physical models? Second, how has epistemic indeterminacy been tamed in the two cases? Third, how do the models of rivers and coasts perform biodiversity? I conclude by arguing that adaptive approaches to biodiversity restoration require an adaptive epistemology, which implies tolerating a certain degree of epistemic indeterminacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Development studies are currently undergoing a fundamental transformation. Established theories, causal relationships, stylised facts and derived ideas about policy design and implementation are being challenged by the development trajectories of China and India. India, for example, has managed to build a software miracle from scratch in slightly more than a decade, and is now rapidly developing a strong pharmaceutical industry. And this rapid transformation is not only limited to high-tech rapidly growing industries. Recently India has developed its own white label car brand—Indica car—which competes with other Asian producers in the home market and is also starting to export electric cars to the Western world. China, on the other hand, has left behind the closed communist planned economy and is now rapidly entering global R&D value chains while out-competing manufacturers and producers in several other countries. Shoe production in Eritrea is but one example. The effect can be felt all the way from textile producers in Italy to Mexico’s ceramics industry. On a smaller scale we also witness Pakistani producers beating highly established and renowned German surgical producers (Nadvi 1999). Additionally, even developing countries in Asia are experiencing a disease normally associated with developed countries, namely, jobless growth. All these global developments have an impact on poverty in developing countries. In other words, there are good reasons to rethink development studies’ traditional question on how economic and industrial globalisation affect alleviation of poverty and inequality, especially in the new context of rapid growth of China and India. Kaplinsky’s latest book deals exactly with these themes. He pushes the theoretical frontier in development",

Such monitoring is likely to have an impact on the productive efficiency of these firms. The firms argue that additional costs to minimise environmental damage have reduced their efficiency. We try to find out whether these water-polluting firms in the chemical industry around Mumbai are actually unable to cope with the additional cost of pollution abatement, or whether by using cleaner practices, are able to improve their efficiency, and support the ‘win-win’ opportunities as claimed by the Porter Hypothesis. The study is carried out by estimating an Output Distance Function using a stochastic production function. The panel data of fifty water-polluting small-to medium-scale firms for three-year period of 2004–06 was collected in a primary survey of chemical industries around Mumbai. We find that the polluting firms are technically more efficient than those firms which adhere to pollution norms. Thus, the Porter Hypothesis does not hold for the sample. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article spans the domains of education, technology and geo-politics. It uses as an instance the Arab scholarship of education and technology, viewing its scholarly community through the geographical lens of regionalism. It enquires into the power relations among scholars in the Arab region and between scholars in the Arab region and their fellows from outside the region. It addresses the research question: to what extent have region-informed factors affected the scholarly community of education and technology in the Arab region? This question was answered by both qualitative and numerical enquiry, analysing documents, interviews and a survey of native Arabic-speaking scholars. Having analysed the data using the grounded theory approach, two categories of power relations among scholars were identified: power relations within a particular region and power relations across regions. Considering these two categories, a theoretical proposition could be posited that there could be power relationships among scholars that exist on a regional basis. The recommendation is therefore that research should further shed light upon the regionalistic (and thus geographically informed political) dynamics of scholarly communities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article the OECD (1997) definition of S&amp;T indicators is used, as well as the descriptive and comparative approaches to S&amp;T development in the Arab Gulf and Mediterranean countries. It was found that neither the Gulf nor the Mediterranean countries possessed sufficient financial and human resources necessary to promote S&amp;T for development. Hence, they have manifestly lagged behind the rapidly advancing Asian countries in terms of S&amp;T input and output indicators; the poor S&amp;T input indicators lead to poor S&amp;T output indicators. In both regions most R&amp;D and S&amp;T activities are allocated within the public and university sectors, with very small contribution from the private sector. When comparing S&amp;T indicators in the two regions, the great disparity in terms of S&amp;T input and output indicators is noted. Despite the high standard of economic development as measured by GDP per capita income and HDI in the Gulf countries, the Mediterranean countries show better performance in terms of most of S&amp;T input and output indicators. Moreover, there is very limited scientific cooperation within and between the Gulf and Mediterranean countries and between them and other Arab countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Technoscience, although largely a term of art that science and technology scholars use to signify the role of heterogeneous actors in the co-construction of science, technology and society, has slowly but steadily been permeating the colloquial vocabulary.1 The term was introduced by Bruno Latour to present a broader concern within science and technology studies: ‘Instead of black boxing the technical aspects of science and then looking for social influences...be there before the box closes and becomes black’ (Latour, 1987, p. 21). Latour’s intervention was not simply epistemological/methodological. It blurred the boundaries between epistemological and ontological, natural and social and humans and non-humans. Opening the black box of science and technology, according to Latour and other actor–network theorists, brought to the fore ‘the heterogeneous elements that make up technoscience, including the social ones’ (Latour, 1987, p. 62). Technoscience, to draw on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s terminology, represents an ‘order-word’—an enunciation that ‘in itself implies collective assemblages’ (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 82). The term technoscience, thus, ‘can be evaluated...as a function of its pragmatic implications, in other words, in relation to implicit presuppositions, immanent acts, or incorporeal transformations it expresses and which introduce new configurations of bodies’ (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 83). The issue then is not only whether ‘it is less epistemologically, politically, and emotionally powerful to see startling hybrids [of technoscience]...than to ask for whom and how these hybrids work’ (Haraway, 1997, p. 280; Star, 1991), but also whether the assemblages and the field that are implied in the Latourian enunciation of the term technoscience are exclusionary. We need to, as Deleuze and",

    "abstract": "THIS ISSUE OF Science, Technology, and Society signals a coming-of-age in Singaporebased STS scholarship, with all of its authors either working in Singapore or cycling through as visiting scholars. Singapore is not just an excellent subject and setting for STS research, but is emerging as a base (and partnering site) for such research elsewhere in Asia. A number of factors have conspired in the past couple of years to make this happen. One was the founding of two cooperative STS ‘research clusters’ at the National University of Singapore (NUS), one by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and the other by the university-level Asia Research Institute. With dozens of faculty members from several disciplines collaborating, and funding available for visiting scholars, Singapore has emerged as the main English-language site for STS research and teaching in Asia outside of India. The city–state has also benefi ted from being at the geographic nexus of three other dynamic STS communities—that of India, the ‘East Asian STS Network’ (a recent coming-together of scholars in the STS communities of Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan) and that of Australasia. With equally strong ties to North America and Europe, Singapore’s community is well-positioned to help make STS a more global domain by creating a larger and more accessible literature from and about Asia. The decision of this journal to increase its yearly issues from two to three manifests a similar commitment. With Asia increasingly full of laboratories, clinical trials, science policy papers, new devices, claims to discovery, funds for",

THE EFFORTS OF the last decade to harness science and technology (S&T) to human development and economic growth reveal a dismal performance by South Asia as a whole. In many ways, the underdevelopment of national scientific communities in much of South Asia is nothing more than a reflection of the low priority accorded to investments in S&T for development.’ It is thus not surprising to learn that biotechnologies, microelectronics, and information and communication technologies, among others, have simply bypassed most countries of the region. The ongoing globalisation and liberalisation processes have further compounded the challenges for South Asia. At the global level, access to new and frontier technologies has become both difficult and very expensive on account of intellectual property regimes. Further, increasing technological competition has led to market and technology protection in developed countries, making it even more difficult for developing countries to integrate",

    "abstract": "The origin, nature and development of knowledge has been the subject of speculation since the earliest period of human inquiry. Despite this long history, the scientific study of cognition spans barely four decades, when it emerged as a reaction to the behaviourists’ overemphasis on mechanisation of human behaviour. The cognitive approach is now firmly established, and promises to yield even greater insights into the components of human behaviour and mental experience. Based on the proceedings of the first international symposium on cognition, this volume provides an excellent overview of the current state of knowledge in cognitive psychology.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The usual crisis mode of economic operations in Palestine intersects with the adverse consequences of COVID-19 and necessitates an innovative response to survive. This research builds on potential synergies between industry and university to expand the Palestinian agriculture sector resilience. We report on an explorative study that sought to understand the reality of the university–industry linkages (UILs) by considering information and experience gathered from 29 interviews in January 2020 and April 2021. Interviewees represent five key actor groups: farmers and agribusinesses, private institutions, universities, the Ministry of Agriculture, and NGOs. Content analysis revealed a nascent collaboration scope and uncovered the lack of a confident attitude among farmers towards agriculture research efforts, the poor communication performance, and misalignment of purpose. University actors need to encompass the UILs in their mission and touch farmers’ needs by providing novelty evidence research. Yet, farmers and agribusinesses may take the initiative to communicate their problems and search for renovation. We developed a framework of underpinnings to enhance collaboration and a healthier agriculture sector. We suggest activating the cooperatives and diversifying farmers’ income as deemed more resilient to face the pandemic. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Introduction: Examining Lay People’s Responses to Risk: Knowledge Politics and Technosciences in the Asian Context",
    "abstract": "Up Until now, ‘risk’-related social processes have been a relatively unexplored terrain in this journal. With forty-five issues since its first issue in 1996 and with five to ten articles published per volume, so far only six papers have used the term ‘risk’ in their abstracts, and none has used the word in its title. Out of the aforementioned six papers, just two of them use the term ‘risk’ as a central analytical category for delving into questions that lie at the intersection of technoscience and society. It is thus reasonable to conclude that much of the social scientific discussion on risk has taken place outside this journal—largely within the communities of environmental sociologists and disaster studies scholars, spurred by the ‘risk society’ theory (Beck, 1992). Within the scholarship of science and technology studies (STS), social studies of risks have been undertaken in North America and Europe, influenced by such ideas as ‘post normal science’ and ‘an extended peer community’ (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1992) and by the cultural approach to the knowledge system (Wynne, 1996). However, when we consider the numerous experiences of technological and environmental disasters in Asia, such as the ones that took place in Minamata, Bikini Atoll, Bhopal and Fukushima (e.g., Fortun, 2001; Fujigaki, 2015; Johnston & Barker, 2008; Petryna, 2002; Walker, 2011), we can see that the notion of risk has a significant degree of descriptive relevancy to the region. In short, social phenomena that emanate from what people perceive as risk and danger are pervasive and present in everyday life, and thus the subject is important for scholars in the region and those who study the region. Finding such a void in the scholarship, this volume of Science, Technology & Society would like to fill in this gap, by focusing on risk and risk knowledge.",

This special issue draws on various developments related to the role of business incubators, academia and social enterprises towards achieving inclusive entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainable growth. A ‘successful entrepreneurship ecosystem’, which includes business incubation is fundamental for promoting economic growth. Over the years, business incubators are increasingly viewed as the facilitators of social inclusion and inclusive growth. Likewise, there has been an increasing focus on how society at large can gain benefit from the research activities of the academia and also how it can promote social and student entrepreneurship. Because of the positive contributions of the social enterprise sector in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), employment and positive social and environmental impacts, social entrepreneurship has gained recognition as a mainstream activity across the world. Consequently, many Asian countries have initiated a range of policies to support social entrepreneurship because of their perceived contributions towards inclusive growth. </jats:p>",

And yet, when the difference in economic conditions between alternatives is narrowed, psy chological and emotional factors are identified to be important. In particular, this study suggests that some Confucian values work as an underlying element in KSEs' decisions. Consequently, this study indicates the importance of including a cultural analysis in the study of brain drain issues. </jats:p><jats:p> The Korean government tried to repatriate as many scientists and engineers as possible in the 1960s and 1970s. Yet, the effectiveness of policy measures during that period was limited. As the Korean economy continued to improve, many of the foreign educated scientists and engineers intended to return to Korea by the 1980s. From this time on, the Korean government adopted a policy to utilise the needed expertise of Koreans abroad, while helping them choose their residences by themselves. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The looming figures of smog-choked cities, cancer villages and contaminated food have become iconic of a modernising China: the tragic, perhaps unavoidable, side effects of a voracious economy. In this article, I examine how the sperm bank—jingzi ku—in China has emerged quite literally as a sanctuary of vitality amidst concerns around food safety, air and water pollution, rising infertility and declining population quality. As a twist on Margaret Lock’s concept of ‘local biologies’, I argue that ‘exposed biologies’ have become a matter of concern in China in ways that have corroborated a place for hi-tech sperm banks within China’s restrictive reproductive complex. Exposed biologies are a side effect of modernisation processes, as industrially manufactured chemicals are increasingly held culpable for a range of pathologies, from cancers to metabolic diseases, disorders of sex development and infertility. Amidst concerns that pollution and modern lifestyles are deteriorating sperm quality in China, the sperm bank stands out as a repository of screened, purified and quality-controlled vitality, and as such sperm banking can be seen as a form of reproductive insurance, not only for individuals but also for the nation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Academic Migration to Poland: Policies and Paradoxes",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The skill-attracting policies encouraging the internationalisation of higher education are compatible with a modernisation discourse, at the heart of which lies a belief that international researchers are highly embedded super-achievers allured by targeted policies. By focusing on the life stories of foreign-born scholars working in Poland (100 in-depth interviews), and Polish department heads (20 interviews) this article revealed three paradoxes that should never have come to be according to the Western modernisation paradigm. The first paradox is related to the expectation that policies targeted at incoming scholars should be the first and foremost enticement for international scholars. The second paradox stems from the fact that some internationally mobile academics representing the humanities and social sciences—in their biographical narratives—highly criticise current academic policies focused on internationalisation. The third paradox is related to the fact that, counterintuitively, less embedded academic migrants perform better. This is an outcome of the life strategy of top-performing scholars, who decide to work in Poland only upon receiving a prestigious and temporary, often EU-funded, scholarship (e.g., Marie Curie). Building on the empirical material from Poland, this article introduces a new notion—the ‘internationalisation against the grain’ to embrace the paradoxes of internationalisation from many peripheral countries. </jats:p>",

Not only does the university or industry contribute to the knowledge production and transformation in the NIS as an individual actor but also the collaboration between these two institutions is increasingly a critical component of the NIS. This is truly illustrated either in developed countries or in developing ones. This article first reviews the current status of NIS in Vietnam to see the contribution of Vietnamese universities in knowledge transfer. Second, it describes the collaboration between university and industry in Vietnam by presenting the findings of a survey of 570 respondents, who are teaching at five Vietnamese technical and engineering universities to better understand the different types of university-industry (U–I) collaboration and motivations of and barriers to the university and industry linkage in Vietnam. Based on such findings, some recommendations to promote the university and industry linkage in research and technology transfer are proposed for the university, the industry and the government so that the Vietnam’s NIS will have more impact on economic development. </jats:p>",

Negative public perception and consequent reactions by government and judiciary have led to a virtual blockade of clinical trials in the country. This article dispassionately analyses the fiascos that happened in the past few years, describes how folklore disseminated by media, civil society and experts created a myth about ‘liberalisation’ of regulations and presents facts about regulatory amendments. The causes of recent non-compliances are discussed and real fault-lines are identified. </jats:p><jats:p> The article posits that territorial laws must remain harmonised with contemporary international standards for regulating global activities like clinical trials. Fixing what was not broken has already caused substantial harm and Indian regulators have done well by reversing the unnecessary tinkering recommended by some quasi-experts. Professional self-regulation along with implementation of existing regulations are proposed as the best solutions for gaining India’s place on the global clinical trials’ growth curve. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "THE SOCIAL STUDIES of science and technology are relatively new in Latin America. The first reflections, in the 1960s and 1970s, were very promissory and they even gave place to the idea of a ‘Latin American thought of science, technology and society’. Those works, written mainly by scientists and engineers, had a main political concern to find ways and instruments to develop scientific and technological knowledge locally, so that it could be suitable for the needs of the region. The objective of that generation, which was partially reached, consisted in making science and technology an object of public study, as a topic bound to a social and economic development strategy. Besides, there was an emphasis on the fact that science and technology are not neutral and universal, but that are processes with specific features according to the context in which they are introduced. Thus, as it was then said, there was a paradox: while the lesser developed countries try to produce scientific knowledge",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine the Indian context for software product development and build on the general literature on product development to develop an understanding of the software product development process in India. We do the latter by drawing from a detailed study of six specific software product development projects ofsix different Indian firms. The products were chosen to provide a variety of industrial contexts, types of firms, types of markets and levels of customisation. Based on a cross-product analysis on parameters such as product definition and positioning, choice of product, technology, product architecture and customisation, version management, marketing and product launch, reward and incentive systems, and quality systems, we draw implications for software product development by companies and for policy makers in the Indian context. </jats:p>",

The evolution of this field comprises both the changing discourse and the substantive evidence of a changing public understanding.1 In the first part, I will present a short account on how the discourse of PUS moved from Literacy, via PUS, to Science-in-Society. This is less a story of progress, but one of false polemics and the multiplication of concerns. In the second part, I will show some empirical evidence on how PUS has changed by drawing on mass media data and large scale comparative survey evidence. I conclude by stressing that the Science-Society relationship is variable both in distance between science and the wider society and in the quality of this relationship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the profusion of studies on innovation systems, there still is a scarcity of empirical treatment of this issue in the context of developing countries. This article examines the interactions between firm-level technological capabilities and supporting organisations of the innovation system drawing on a sample of forty-six firms and twenty-nine innovation system supporting organisations in northern Brazil. The study has found different types and levels of production-based and innovative capabilities in association with a large variety of knowledge-centred links established by firms with supporting organisations of the local innovation system. On the one hand such findings contribute to adding some new empirical evidence to the study of innovation systems in developing locations. On the other hand they contradict common perspectives that hold that such systems hardly exist in developing contexts. Indeed, such evidence provides a realistic view of the current nature of the interactions of different components of a local innovation system in a developing area such as this examined here. Such realistic view is crucial to design, redesign, and implement innovation policies. </jats:p>",

Based on the development characteristics of resource areas, the ‘micro-meso-macro’ view three-dimensional conceptual framework of FDI spillover, absorptive capacity and self-innovation capability was constructed. Then, the empirical analysis was conducted in three steps: first, the FDI technology spillover effects between Shanxi and three eastern provinces (Jiangsu, Liaoning and Hebei) were compared; second, the absorptive capacity and the relative factors were compared; third, by taking Shanxi province as an example, the relationship between FDI technology spillover and the self-innovation capacity was verified and the conduction medium role of absorptive capacity was investigated. Finally, by combining the theoretical and empirical analysis, three suggestions were put forward for reference. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Pursuing our mutual interest in innovation, we recently collaborated on a study to investigate the effects of a Dongguan government initiative to boost manufacturing in the area situated in Dongguan, Guangdong province, China, through automation. Dongguan’s policy, which it dubbed ‘Replacing Humans with Robots’, would provide financial support to manufacturing firms which upgraded their production processes by installing new machinery—in some cases involving robotics—to increase productivity and, ultimately it was hoped, profit. We wondered how manufacturers in Dongguan would respond to the initiative and how it might affect the labour force. After completing our research, we realised that we had happened on one aspect of a much larger phenomenon: the nature of work in East Asia was changing, in some cases dramatically, with significant consequences for relations of production in the region. This sparked our interest in marshalling a broader scholarly approach to what was happening, eventually resulting in this special issue of Science, Technology and Society, which comprises five studies on a range of related topics situated in several East Asian markets. We and the editors of Science, Technology and Society also share an interest in advancing social constructivist critiques of technological determinism. To this end we sought studies that would situate such a critique in the context of rapidly changing employment relations in East Asia. Technological determinism implies that",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper employs RRI’s mandate of ‘commitment to care’ to understand the ‘problem’ of rice straw burning in India and the possible ways of engaging with it. Straw burning is often framed as a linear technology or policy deficit ‘problem’ in need of an immediate and quick fix. Interventions and solutions emerging from such framings have so far remained ineffective. The ‘commitment to care’ approach enables us to situate the current practices of straw burning in a complex web of relationalities, dependencies, vulnerabilities, and affect. By doing so, the ‘problem’ of straw burning is rearticulated and redefined as a cumulative effect of multiple interventions, transformations, and contradictions that led to the shaping of modern agricultural systems in India. This re-articulation demands for a rethinking of engagement, remedies and responsibilities in ways that move beyond the individualization of blame and action. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Realpolitik of Nuclear Risk: When Political Expediency Trumps Technical Democracy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, a growing number of researchers in science and technology studies have begun to examine the relationship between science and politics. Specifically, they focus on citizen participation in highly technical policy problems and explore the possibility of a technical democracy that avoids pitfalls of technocracy. This focus, however, downplays a possibly more serious obstacle to technical democracy than technocracy, namely, realpolitik. Based on ethnographic and textual data on citizen–government interactions in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, we first show how citizens mobilised radiation detectors and counter-experts to force the Japanese government to admit scientific uncertainty about the permissible dose limit. We then explain why this successful mobilisation nonetheless had only a small impact on evacuation and compensation policies in terms of the pre-disaster structure of Japanese politics: the dominance of commission-based policy-making allowed the bureaucratic government to play realpolitik in the face of scientific uncertainty to expediently pursue its own interest, circumventing both democratic deliberation and technical rigour. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> COVID-19 forced many nations, including the largest country in the Arabian Gulf region, Saudi Arabia, to fast-track the adoption of new technologies and work practices to cope with the pandemic. We find the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMoH), in less than a year, introduced several innovations to transform healthcare planning, management and delivery. We reflect on these changes in the Saudi Arabian context and suggest what needs to be done next to retain the developmental momentum generated in the innovation system beyond the pandemic for sustainable and positive impact on the healthcare system. To do so, the Ministry should regularly assess the appetite for change, prioritise problems and areas of intervention, collect evidence of need and impact, build confidence by educating the public and healthcare professionals about the importance of adapting to new ways and methods of healthcare delivery, collaborate with the private sector to efficiently sustain these advancements and gain the public’s trust through stakeholder participation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines the impact of governmental interventions on the performance of local innovation through technological leapfrogging. Local innovation is defined under the framework of Schumpeterian innovation, encompassing the emergence of high-tech de-novo firms. Additionally, we investigate the potential correlation between national R&amp;D investment and the emergence rate of de-novo firms in a specific region. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the effects of a nationwide scheme in China known as the Jingjinji project; the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Joint Development Project, on the formation of de-novo firms dedicated to cutting-edge technologies. We employed panel data from 212 locales in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei to evaluate the policies’ impact on Hebei’s innovation, as well as the role played by government R&amp;D investment. Based on the difference-in-difference results, the Jingjinji project was found to have a statistically significant positive impact on innovation. However, the emergence of de-novo firms had a negative impact on the project’s success due to decreased R&amp;D investment. This study emphasises the significance of government intervention in promoting local innovation, not only in China but also in other nations. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Socialist Origins of Artificial Carp Reproduction in Maoist China",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The Maoist era has often been portrayed as a hindrance to China’s biotechnological development due to Lysenko doctrine and the communist government’s animosity to basic academic research. Yet some of China’s most developed sectors in biotechnology have been made possible by socialist enterprises in agriculture and science under Mao. One such example is China’s world-leading aquaculture biotechnology and genetic research on Asian carp. Although some associated China’s success in the area with the booming Asian market and a globalised biotech industry, the field’s advancement has been deeply rooted in earlier socialist history in reforming aquaculture and science. This article takes one essential technology used by biotech and aquaculture industries–the hormone-aided method in artificial carp reproduction–as a major case. By tracing the political, scientific and sociocultural lineages that made its invention and dissemination possible, this article unpacks the complex local and historical underpinning that defies prevalent understanding about the method as simply a variation of biotechnology’s global form. Particularly, the initial invention of the method was catalysed not only by state economic concerns but also by a socialist understanding of fishery and Maoist attempts to remold scientists. The two successful breakthroughs described in the article demonstrate two ways that scientists and technicians of different social and professional standings have appropriated available scientific and political resources to achieve personal and institutional goals. The dissemination of the method was further cemented through mass involvement during the Cultural Revolution. By delineating the concrete processes that have ‘assembled’ and maintained the artificial carp propagation method, the article contrasts its entanglement with the socialist regime then with the way the method has become decontextualised in its current use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the firm- and regional-level determinants of a firm’s adoption of open innovation practices. In particular, we categorise sixteen Korean regions into seven regional innovation types to account for each regions’ varying innovation conditions. Using data from the Korean Innovation Survey and a hierarchical linear model, we find that firm-level factors such as firm size, R&amp;D innovation capability and the number of networks for absorbing external knowledge and regional-level factors such as local government R&amp;D funds matching had a significantly positive effect on open innovation. We also find that of the firm-level determinants, the number of networks had a strong effect on open innovation, and that this differed by regional innovation type. Based on these findings, we argue that innovation policy should strive to stimulate open innovation through measures that take each region’s innovation resources and environment into account, rather than attempting to look for a single optimised model for all regions. </jats:p>",

THE MOVEMENT OF scientists and scholars throughout the world is as old as science itself. From the very beginning science has been built up through the circulation of men and ideas. In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, however, this mobility applied increasingly and more massively to the developing countries. Embedded in an ideology of Third Worldism that gave it the aura of a problem, it soon became the subject of many impassioned discussions, and it was addressed in numerous studies.’ Thus, brain drain as a term came to be used regularly to condemn the flight of good _minds from the developing countries to the rich countries, and as a oneway phenomenon, because it often hastily combined and confused the notion of loss conveyed in the term drain with the migration of educated and professional people. In this context, the United Nations defined the term brain drain as a one-way movement, or",

This paper seeks to determine the size of professional networks for scientists in less developed countries (LDC) as well as the distribution of their ties across organisational contexts and locations. Professional contact networks of scientists in Africa and Asia were determined in personal interviews with 293 researchers in universities, government laboratories and non-governmental organisations. Contrary to expectations, researchers in the least devel oped countries do not have the smallest networks. Results indicate that: (a) international and domestic networks are inversely related, (b) education abroad increases contact with the developed world for scientists in state institutes and non-government organisations, but not for academics, and (c) there are reduced returns to education for researchers in the least developed research systems. Our primary conclusion is that the characterisation of LDC scientists as 'isolated' is misleading when their professional networks are concen trated in local arenas. </jats:p>",

Exploring causes, consequences and solutions, the volume provides operationally useful information on cost-effective ways to reach, hear and respond to the needs of vast numbers of impoverished families, especially mothers, with diverse cultural values and practices. The focus is on what in fact works, what does not, and why. Nineteen experts offer current knowledge and perspectives from nutrition, public health, epidemiology, agricultural and consumer economics, anthropology, child development, rural sociology and community development. Combining academic perspectives with practical experience, they spell out ways of implementing simple nutritional/growth promoting strategies that are financially and technically feasible. Technology can and does play an important role, the authors believe, but it has to be proved to be effective, by itself, in addressing protein energy malnutrition. The volume concludes that effective and sustainable solutions to malnutrition must be found through a careful analysis of the behaviour of individuals, households and communities-preferably with community -involvement in the analysis~to identify the ways in which community-based or external",

    "title": "Globalisation and the Changing Functions of Australian Universities",
    "abstract": "In this brief review we show how the functions of Australian universities – teaching, research and enterprise and community engagement – have changed dramatically over the last two decades or so. We focus on three aspects of change: globalisation and international engagement; marketisation and competition, especially in overseas student recruitment and in collaborative research; and the entrepreneurial response by universities. Marketisation, globalisation and entrepreneurialism are watchwords for all Australian universities, each provoking the need to demonstrate competitive standing in learning, in research and in industry and community engagement. While particular modes of regulation, process and structure are characteristically Australian, we find that these changes, with their consequence of competing academic and systemic structures, carry lessons for academic careers and higher education policies in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> For reviewing science and technology policies of a country, an advisable beginning point is a pragmatic evaluation of its current state in technology progress. An appropriate tool used to measure the technology progress is the composite index of technology achievement which enlightens the level of technological progress and the readiness of a country to participate in knowledge-based economy. Technology achievement index (TAI) assists a country to check status of its technological progress relative to others. In the current study, TAI 2014 of OIC member states (TAI-14-OIC) is developed to analyse the situation of technological progress of OIC countries. Countries have been ranked on the basis of TAI which stands on four pillars, namely, technology creation, diffusion of old innovations, diffusion of recent innovations and development of human skills. Ranking of countries in these dimensions on the basis of their indices is also presented. Comparative analysis of some S&amp;T indicators of OIC countries with OECD countries is presented which should be very helpful for S&amp;T policy makers in the OIC countries. Some concluding thoughts for development of technological capabilities in OIC countries are presented at end of the article. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the ways scientists from the world peripheries can attempt to overcome isolation and lack of visibility is by networking and associating themselves at different aggregate levels, both nationally and internationally. Scientific meetings are specially apt grounds where scientists have a chance to make contacts and become more visible. Taking as its point of departure the fact that meetings constitute a pervasive yet neglected aspect of science, this paper concentrates on the analysis of participation in a type of scientific meeting of a regional scope that has taken place periodically since 1968 and is still an ongoing operation. It is argued that meetings of this sort deserve the attention ofstudents for a variety of reasons, especially because through time one may observe the evolution of the cognitive field and its institutional and group correlations that the series of meetings helped to create in the particular space configured by the periodical meeting. </jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to turn to other kinds of spaces and work in the production of high-tech electronics. I focus here on three kinds of spaces in Shenzhen: the Huaqiangbei electronics market, small-scale factories and industrial design workshops. The electronics economy depends critically not just on ‘makers’ but on all kinds of other labour. In particular, it depends on lower middle-class and low-class work—devices made by small factories and shops, sold by small enterprises and designed for the less wealthy, especially in developing countries. The human networks that connect these individuals are critical to the size, speed and density of the markets, allowing devices to be built and shipped rapidly, for parts and customers to be available. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "As an economist, the late V.M. Dandekar made significant contributions to public policy debates in a career spanning four decades. His name has for long been synonymous with an aggregative estimate of the incidence of poverty in India, made in association with Nilakantha Rath. Naturally, because of its immense implications for planning and policy formulation, the Dandekar-Rath exercise inspired an intense debate, which continues to resonate through academic and policy-making circles. The second volume of Dandekar’s study of the Indian economy deals directly with this domain of research. Three of the chapters focus on the measurement of poverty. Another five examine the question of employment and labour deployment, which in Dandekar’s framework is an aspect of poverty. Underlying the entire treatment are the two opening chapters on population and family planning which provide a fair reflection of the author’s system of priorities. It is almost axiomatic in his perception, that the population explosion is fundamental to the problem of poverty and unemployment. In the transition from his consideration of population to the analysis of poverty, Dandekar provides a chapter",

Based upon in-depth interviews in more than fifty companies, the study con cludes that both industries have experienced an important learning process, although in some cases it has been limited, which has enabled many companies to accumulate important productive capabilities but scarce technological capabilities. The market position of the companies has been maintained or has been better off as a result of this technological learning process. </jats:p>",

This article provides an overview and interpretation of the evolution of science policy in Portugal—a relatively less industrialised and a peripheral European country with a number of contrasting features with the developing countries. </jats:p><jats:p> Policy analysis has emphasised the nature of public policies as dynamic processes that are influenced or determined by various contextual factors, institutional con straints, interests and policy cultures of the actors involved. Such a set of factors seem to be particularly distinctive and explanatory in countries marked by strong socio cultural and institutional idiosyncrasies sometimes deeply rooted in political and economic history, as in the case of Southern Europe. </jats:p><jats:p> In the political and legal discourse, the importance of science and technology and the role of the state in their stimulation has been recurrently acknowledged in Portugal. Despite the manifestation of S&amp;T policy issues in the political discourse, science and technology policy remains of secondary importance to the overall eco nomic policy area as such. The reason for this apparent contradiction between political discourse and practical realities appears to be rooted in the political and social cultures, particularly in the way science and its applications are perceived and utilised (or not utilised) by most of the enterprises, social organisations and political administrative structures. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Social Construction of Leprosy in Colombia, 1884-1939",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Colombian physicians saw leprosy as an important area of inquiry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In order to convince the government of the need to wage a battle against the disease, physicians unfolded a rhetoric where nationalist considerations as well as exaggeration played a principal role. They accepted the conclusions adopted at international conferences on leprosy, and adopted segregation as the only way to prevent the spread of the disease. The racist image of leprosy as an extremely contagious disease inflicting inferior peoples, arose from the imperialist expansion of Europe and the United States in the late nineteenth century when Westerners discovered leprosy in their colonial territories. Between 1903 and the 1930s the Colombian government imposed several regulations ordering the isolation of the sick, and established special institutions for lepers. Around this time, isolation continued to be the main strategy to manage the disease, but medical rhetoric began to change. Doctors regarded leprosy as a curable disease and rejected compulsory isolation. The emphasis shifted to prevention and research. This new approach was connected with liberal ideas that were dominant at that time in Colombia. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Existing studies find that exploratory innovation requires both access to heterogeneous resources for the establishment of novel knowledge combinations and high-quality cooperation to strengthen the absorption of heterogeneous knowledge. Therefore, structural holes and prominent positions exert critical effects on exploratory innovation. Few existing studies have investigated the influences of the two positions on exploratory innovation simultaneously. This study aims to identify the influence of network positions on exploratory innovation and the contingency mechanism. Basing on joint patent filing relationships identification belong to IPC Green Inventory, R&amp;D collaboration networks in China consisted of 215 firms in the technological field of low-carbon energy were constructed. Negative binomial regression was used to analyse the influences of networks positions on exploratory innovation and the moderating effect of network density. Results reveal that network prominence and structural holes have inverted U-shaped effects on exploratory innovation. The simultaneous occupation of prominent positions and structural holes hinders exploratory innovation. Network density exerts positive and negative effects on the relationships between network prominence and exploratory innovation and between structural holes and exploratory innovation, respectively. The conclusions drawn in this study provide a reference for R&amp;D network structural optimization toward exploratory innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Entrepreneurial education has received a fair amount of attention locally and internationally. Interestingly, disparities continue to exist in the quality of entrepreneurship education programmes on offer, particularly in curriculum design, delivery methods and forms of assessment within higher education institutions in South Africa. We examined the relationship between the entrepreneurial content of the curriculum (ENTCC), attitude towards entrepreneurship, general self-efficacy and students’ intentions towards entrepreneurship. The study is located within a quantitative research paradigm and the sample of 263 was drawn from final year students from the Faculty of Management at a South African university of technology (UoT) who were studying various business-related programmes in 2014. Data were analysed using correlation and regression analysis. The results indicate that the ENTCC, students’ attitude towards entrepreneurship and students’ self-efficacy exhibit significant predictive relationships with students’ intentions to venture into new business creation. Our study makes two major contributions: (i) it fills the gap in entrepreneurship education in order to revisit our curriculum to make the module/s more ‘hands on’ and (ii) it provides an avenue to further explore the feasibility for a fully fledged entrepreneurship programme with mandatory, elective and incubation start-up practical training in conjunction with the Science Park, Technology, Transfer and Innovation Centre within the university. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paradox in the Arab world is that one comes across obvious talents, pulling greatly the output upwards, while no specific goal is commonly ascribed to research. The social inscription of science remains unsteady and the proper function of research is vague. Moreover, there are great differences between sub-regions (the Gulf countries, Machreq and Maghreb) and even between countries as for the age and context of scientific activity, the socio-cognitive blocs supporting it, the nature of institutional arrangements, financing and organising solutions. Following repeated warnings from experts on the region, a new concern for research has been rising since a few years. Behind Tunisia (which is well ahead) Maghreb countries are moving towards the building of a ‘research system’, with its own organisation and funding. Several Gulf countries are developing ‘Singaporean strategies’, resorting to world knowledge and industrial resources with a view to innovation. The pressure of globalisation and the need to discover new resources may induce a higher regard for science, the improvement of its environment and the hope for setting up scientific communities. </jats:p>",

Likewise, we found that institutional support positively moderates the relationship between organisational learning and TMT innovation orientation. The implications draw TMTs’ attention to consider enriching their innovation orientation by leveraging institutional support for their organisational learning and explorative and exploitative innovation performance. Lastly, government-tailored policies are essential to augment TMT innovation orientation to benefit their organisational learning and innovation performance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the evolution of clusters and ‘interactive learning’ in upgrading manufacturing capabilities. We analyse the upgrading process in line with key concepts constituting ‘interactive learning’, which include clusters and agglomeration (regional) innovation systems, open innovation and localised learning. On the basis of analysis at firm and industry-wide levels, this paper contributes to current literature concerning clusters and innovation that relate to technological upgrading in locally based firms by (1) examining the role of governments in promoting clusters and regional development; (2) identifying the conditions important for firm agglomeration and how agglomeration leads to knowledge-sharing at horizontal, vertical and institutional levels; (3) discussing the role of foreign firms in transferring technology and encouraging their suppliers to share knowledge within the production network; and (4) reporting on the characteristics and determinants of R&amp;D cooperation within the Thai manufacturing sector. The main findings reveal that developing countries, including Thailand at this moment, may have limitations in their science and technology base. This can hinder their upward progression on the global value chain. It is of particular importance for government policy to be more supportive, rather than regulative, in order to strengthen the scientific knowledge base and promote cooperation between indigenous firms and innovation in supporting organisations. </jats:p>",

As THE SOCIAL history of science and technology unfolds its contemporary phase, we witness that developing countries (DCs) are rapidly passing through what is termed as the era of globalisation. The social and economic impact of the present phase of globalisation is not something which is just influencing the economic context of science and technology. Unlike earlier phases, it has brought about a new economic framework which is set to transform the social institution",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the early 2000s, the question of access to medicines at affordable prices for Southern populations has appeared as one of the major challenges for the international governance of health. But what is at stake is the creation of market for medicines in the global South, particularly countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa. These markets are new in nature in the sense that they are driven by international organisations where Southern firms, especially from India, occupy an increasingly important position. However, the specificity of these markets and the way they are constituted have been little analysed. In this article, we suggest focusing the attention on the constitution of the market of antimalarial drugs and highlighting the role played by Southern firms in this market. Our study focuses on the public sector market of antimalarial drugs. We provide an institutional and quantitative analysis of the creation of this public market. We then discuss the growing importance of the Southern firms, mainly Indian and Chinese, in this market. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the evolving University–Industry–Government (UIG) linkages pattern in Taiwan, a latecomer catch-up country in terms of its late technology development and pursuing a targeted strategy of catch-up. The focus is on the funding sources available to universities and on their significance in defining the essentials of operating entrepreneurial universities. The results demonstrate that both public and private funding sources are important for assisting the build of entrepreneurial universities to reinforce such linkages, but their effects are divergent. The essential role of private research funding is not determined by the amount of funding, but is rather one of a guide to fill in the gaps in technological development between universities and industries. In comparison, public funding is a pre-requisite to and catalyst in attracting private research funding to bridge the gaps between university and industry research and to correct the misalignment of its impacts. The results also suggest that the UIG linkages available to an entrepreneurial university are closely associated with patterns of regional innovation and industrial development. </jats:p>",

To investigate the key driving forces for sustainable development of the collaborative ecosystem, this article evaluates the technological innovations and the ecosystem of Science Parks in Shanghai based on historical data obtained from Shanghai Zhangjiang Science Park (Zhangjiang Park in short). Systems thinking and causal loop analysis are adopted to explore the structure of the collaborative ecosystem and reflections of the policy impact on the science park. The role of the government in science parks and innovation ecosystems is identified with systems mapping and empirical study. The economic impact of Zhangjiang Park policies and the performance of innovation activities in Shanghai are further evaluated. Lessons learnt from the benchmarked science parks and policy implications for facilitating the innovation ecosystem are addressed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The present paper contributes to a growing body of philosophical, sociological, and historical analyses of recent nanoscale science and technology. Through a close examination of the origins of contemporary nanotech efforts, their ambitions, and strategic uses, it also aims to provide the basis for a critical theory of emerging technologies more generally, in particular in relation to their alleged convergence in terms of goals and outcomes. The emergence, allure, and implications of nanotechnology, it is argued, can only be fully appreciated if one looks beyond its immediate technical and scientific payoffs to its infrastructural and ideological aspects. While nanotechnology aims to reshape the world ‘atom by atom’, its most tangible result so far has been the profound effect it has had on the organization of science-at-large, not least as the result of a thorough reshaping of the ‘soft’ funding infrastructure that places significant constraints on the pursuit of long-term scientific research programmes. The paper concludes by noting a persistent, and perhaps deepening, gap between the utopian visions of some of nanotechnology’s most vocal proponents and the realities of contemporary nanotechnological practice, which continue to be marked by global inequities. </jats:p>",

The phenomenon marks a significant development not in terms of facilitating mass upheavals or radical reforms as elsewhere in the world, but in terms of contributing towards the construction of counter narratives to the historically articulated and previously uncontested discourses of progress, efficiency, productivity and success that in part have legitimated the political establishment in Singapore. By critiquing the regime’s myriad narratives of accomplishments and constructing subversive counter narratives through ‘series tweets’ that were infused with wit, sarcasm, parody and satire, the political twitterati in Singapore has expanded the vistas of democratic participation while remaining loyal to the country’s non-Western liberal democratic framework. </jats:p>",

Nationalism motivated Tùng to join the Việt Minh fight against the French in the First Indochina War, but it was his colonial-era training as a surgeon that made him invaluable for the resistance. The widespread recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in 1954 gave Tùng, in turn, access to human and material resources that would not have been available otherwise. With these resources, including equipment and human livers, Tùng developed surgical techniques that enabled him to publish in internationally recognised journals. In return, Tùng trained doctors for the state, focusing on knowledge that helped the DRV battle the Republic of Vietnam’s and the United States’ (US) armies. During the 1960s, Tùng engaged in medical diplomacy that allowed those against US intervention, yet uncomfortable with DRV politics, to support the North. For his part, Tùng tapped into his far-flung network to access the latest medical advances as well as obtain training for his students. These developments, international and domestic, came together in Tùng’s struggle to identify and treat the effects of exposure to herbicides and their contaminant dioxin, popularly known as Agent Orange. </jats:p>",

In terms of magnitudes, increase in size by ‘10 million raises the amount of R&amp;D, on average, increase by ‘0.3 million. The evidence is also supportive of the fact that both the intensity of R&amp;D as well as innovation activity is lower for leveraged firms. Finally, the findings fail to discern any significant improvement in R&amp;D intensity in the post-reform period; although there is a noticeable decline in innovation activity after reforms.

On the basis of two case studies of innovations for disaster management, this paper investigates innovation processes within social contexts and the role of innovation actors such as government, private sector and citizens in the development and diffusion of the innovations. Through these cases its shown how innovations in emergency/disaster management could be developed under social contexts utilising ‘open innovation’ frameworks popular in private sector. The cases also show how end-users can participate in the innovation processes in public sector. Finally, the paper suggests implications to accelerate and increase innovations for social welfare and social change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Microfinancing is widely perceived to contribute towards social innovation for poverty reduction. We examined the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction (CFPR) programme implemented by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) between 2002 and 2007, as it used an innovative approach to microfinancing by transferring assets rather than cash to ultra poor participants. We examined two aspects: (i) the impact of microfinancing through asset transfer instead of cash on social innovation leading to poverty reduction; (ii) the factors that contributed to positive or negative impact on the economic conditions and poverty levels of the participant households and the trajectories of changes experienced by the success and failure cases. For this, we employed survey data from twenty-one beneficiaries and eight in-depth interviews among these households. The study found that participants who demonstrated proper planning, hard work and personal interest in the enterprise through microfinancing have witnessed improved quality of life and poverty reduction, while lack of motivation, absence of proper planning and certain social barriers resulted in failure. Our study makes two major contributions: (i) it fills a gap in the literature on microfinancing of social innovation to help ultra poor households to graduate out of poverty; (ii) it provides policy alternatives for designing appropriate microfinancing programmes for ultra poor which can produce high success rates in reducing poverty through social innovation not only in Bangladesh, but also in other developing countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public engagement with science and technology is a central theme in the field of Public Understanding of Science (PUS), particularly in Europe. Alongside public consultation exercises and similar activities aimed at generating engagement, there is a need for good survey indicators of the general climate for engagement with science and technology among the public. With internationally focused PUS studies increasing in prominence, such survey indicators should ideally characterise engagement in approximately the same way across a range of countries, to facilitate sensible cross-national analyses involving this construct. </jats:p><jats:p> This article presents cross-national analyses of two sets of questions posed in the Eurobarometer survey on public perceptions of biotechnology, conducted in 2002 in fifteen European countries. The items analysed capture a range of elements of the concept of engagement, both with science and technology, in general, and with biotechnology, in particular. Latent class models are used to explore typologies of types of engagement: substantively, to understand their content, and methodologically, to identify items which do not work well in these classifications. The analyses are also used to assess the statistical cross-national comparability of such typologies, and consequently to describe variations in levels of engagement across countries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> If Singapore has rapidly become known internationally for its work in recruiting large numbers of elite foreign scientists—or ‘foreign talent’ (FT) in Singapore’s terms—there remains much to learn about the state’s current biotech programme through prior work conducted at National University Hospital (NUH), recognising that recent ambitions derive in part from a much more modest set of origins. Specifically, Dr Ariff Bongso’s career mirrors this same series of incremental transitions, as he would move from working with in vitro fertilisation (IVF) per se to working with HESC (human embryonic stem cells) in the early to mid-1990s (1987–1994), at which point he came close to experiencing success in isolating HESC, a result which he qualified carefully with the language of ‘stem-cell like’ objects. This article considers the implications of reframing recent Singapore’s biotech efforts by re-examining the state family-planning initiatives of the mid-1960s. In fact, many of the biological materials Bongso worked with in his research derived from the hospital’s IVF programme, providing a material link between distinct research agendas possessing very different trajectories. Many of the same policy issues now being debated at Biopolis and in Singapore policy circles—how to mobilise productive international collaborative networks of researchers, as well as appropriate treatment and storage policies for a diverse range of human tissues—date to this earlier period (1966–1987) when precedents were first being established, suggesting that current policy can and should continue to be informed by the decisions of the past. </jats:p>",

They are compared in terms of the technological efforts, nature of competition, competitive strategy, outward orientation, research and development intensity and export intensity. First part of the article gives the economics of clustering and the second part analyses the inter-cluster differences, if any, between the firms belonging to 13 clusters drawn from Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram. The analysis reveals that the firms in the technology cluster are more outward oriented and R and D intensive compared to their counterparts in the industry cluster. They also differ in terms of the type of competitors and the competitive strategies. While the firms in the technology cluster face competition from established foreign firms, those in the industry cluster from established local firms. Process innovations are used by firms in the technology cluster whereas productivity improvements are used by firms in the industry cluster for sustaining competitive advantage. In the regression analysis, the nature of cluster, use of technology/business collaboration (Networking) and market share emerge as significant variables in explaining the R and D intensity of firms. Export intensity is explained by the R and D intensity and scale of operation. </jats:p>",

It was found that universities are an important research partner of private firms, although industrialists often do not trust the research capabilities of universities. It is evident that universities are accustomed to receiving agents rather than giving agents in R&amp;D activities. This fact implies that a give-and-take culture should be cultivated in universities in order to develop university–industry R&amp;D collaboration. It may bring about university-generated cooperative R&amp;D with private firms if universities contract out more of their research projects to private firms. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of our study also revealed that government policies to promote university–industry R&amp;D cooperation have been strengthening.

The government R&amp;D budget has been increasingly allocated to specific policy programmes focusing on interdisciplinary cooperative R&amp;D activities between universities and private firms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The traditional innovation function, focusing on extrinsic motivations such as economic benefits and returns, has neglected the side of intrinsic values and public motivations for innovation function. Recent innovation examples in an era of mobile network and web-based information environment pursue open connected innovations such as open source movement and crowding source. Such open, collective and social innovations result from strong public motivation and trust network. Although previous studies argue the potential effects of intrinsic values on innovative attitude, research has not yet provided a comprehensive empirical evidence on how innovative attitude is associated with intrinsic and public motivations. Little empirical research remains for the impact of public motivations and intrinsic values on innovative attitudes. This study, relying on nationally represented survey (n = 3,188) in South Korea, explores an empirical link between public motivations and innovative attitudes to explore and allow new ideas. We found that public interest, empathy, altruism and job involvement facilitate innovative attitude to pursue and accept new ideas and suggestions. This implies that both intrinsic values (job enjoyment and satisfaction) and public motivations (public interests, empathy and altruism) are crucial factors to promote innovative attitudes. We also found strong non-linear relationships between satisfaction, trust and innovative attitude. We discuss implications for future innovation function of intrinsic and public motivations in terms of the process of social construction. </jats:p>",

The results show that both complementary knowledge coupling and substitutive knowledge coupling have significant positive impacts on organizational resilience, and the proactive market orientation positively moderates the relationship between complementary/substitutive knowledge coupling and organizational resilience, while the responsive market orientation negatively moderates the relationship between complementary knowledge coupling and organizational resilience.

However, some developing countries decided to invest a significant part of their rather modest science budgets in building many-million-dollar facilities. A comparative approach to the study of the first stages of the Argentine TANDAR heavy ion accelerator and the Brazilian National Laboratory Synchrotron Light (LNLS) projects may help understand specificities in patterns of organisation of big science in peripheral contexts. Oversimplification of the decision-making processes linked to authoritarian political contexts—which allowed to overcome the lack of consensus within the physics community as well as financial uncertainties—seem to have been a necessary condition for TANDAR and LNLS, which differentiated them from big science in developed countries. Additionally, the different ways in which the institutionalisation of the nuclear area took place in Argentina and Brazil seem to have been responsible for the different paths followed by experimental physics between the 1960s and 1980s: nuclear physics in Argentina and particle physics in Brazil. </jats:p>",

Although some scholars consider ANT to be now closer to sociomateriality studies, we claim that ANT differs from sociomateriality in that it suggests a different notion of power. In ANT, power results from actors’ associations enacted into being rather than the sociomateriality claim that power results from existing power structures. We draw from our work on information technologies and social movements to illustrate this important distinction, and to show how ANT can be further strengthened by including the study of histories, memories and trajectories, in order to better understand power relations as associations enacted into being. In this way, we offer a deeper understanding of ANT and its utility for STS research in general, and information studies in particular. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Government subsidies are important to the improvement of innovation level and sustainable development of biopharmaceutical firms. This paper empirically analyses the impact of government R&amp;D and non-R&amp;D subsidies on the innovation output of biopharmaceutical firms. We establish static, and dynamic panel mediation effect models using 2013–2019 data from China’s listed biopharmaceutical companies. Additionally, we further explore the mediating role of R&amp;D investment between R&amp;D subsidies and innovation output. The findings show that, first, R&amp;D subsidies contribute to the innovation output of biopharmaceutical firms, while the effect of non-R&amp;D subsidies is insignificant. Second, the study of the mechanism shows that R&amp;D subsidies can significantly promote firms’ innovation output through R&amp;D investment in the static mediating model; but interestingly, the R&amp;D subsidies fail to promote innovation output in the dynamic mediating model through R&amp;D investment, perhaps due to the sustainable impact of innovation. Based on the above results, this paper provides suggestions and insights for the formulation of different types of subsidy policies and the improvement of the innovation level of biopharmaceutical firms. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Antinuclear Radicals: Scientific Experts and Antinuclear Activism in Japan",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the role of scientific experts in the post-war Japanese antinuclear power movement. It argues that experts and their movements have influenced the development of nuclear power in Japan, albeit in an indirect, constrained and sporadic way. Experts like the nuclear chemist Takagi Jinzaburō stimulated an upsurge of antinuclear protest and public opinion, especially after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, which made power plant siting more difficult, contributed to longer construction lead times, and forced state and nuclear industry officials to devote considerable resources to atomic energy public relations (PR) campaigns and compensation for nuclearised communities. The antinuclear advocacy and activism of scientific experts arguably helped to slow down nuclear power development, resulting in a less nuclearised Japan than imagined by its advocates. Antinuclear experts and their movements, however, never became players in mainstream nuclear policymaking and had to be content with pressure tactics from the political peripheries. After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster of March 2011 some observers pointed to this lack of direct political influence as evidence of the failure of the antinuclear movement. Rather than outright failure, however, this article presents a more ambivalent history marked by both achievements and shortcomings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article attempts to discuss through detailed ethnographic description, the manner in which scientists in a leading Indian scientific research institute defined and practiced religion. Instead of posing science and religion as dichotomous categories, this article demonstrates its easy coexistence within the everyday lives and practices of Indian scientists. The ‘religious’ scientists did not perceive their religiosity in opposition to science, nor did they accept the complementary view of science and religion. Likewise, the ‘atheistic’ scientists did not find any contradiction in following a ‘religious’ lifestyle and simultaneously identified themselves as atheists or non-believers. This article questions the tacit acceptance of the distinctions between science and religion and seeks to evolve new vocabularies to talk about these categories. It attempts to look at science and religion from a non-dualistic perspective. It argues that a productive way of understanding science and religion is to go beyond the conflict and complementarity models. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The biometric identity project in India called Aadhaar was established with the purported intent of giving every resident of India a unique ID to ensure that social security measures and other welfare mechanisms would reach the last mile. The collection of biometrics (fingerprints, eye scans and photographs), it was emphasised, was to ensure that no duplicates were created and each ID would be unique, and thus was built the world’s largest data management project. However, since then, there have been several problems of duplication, implementation issues, failure of infrastructure, security breaches and privacy issues. Buttressing the digital identity project have been several moves to push digitalisation in other spheres as well. The article intends to study this digitalisation of individual identity in India and posit that there are several pockets of resistance that challenge this framing of the digitalised citizen as a data subject and the reduction of individual identity into biometrics alone. There are two people’s movements that show how this digital turn towards a technological understanding of citizenship is being challenged: the widespread peaceful protests of 2019–2020 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and the 2015–2016 Save the Internet campaign for net neutrality. This author hopes to show that both online and offline, the ideas of what it means to be a citizen of India remain in flux, challenging the notion of a passive data subject and positing a political, rights-bearing citizen in opposition to it. </jats:p>",

The ban on the importation of chewing gum in the early 1990s can also be set within this context, that substance having emerged for infrastructure builders as not just a nuisance, but a tool of low-level sabotage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the Chinese public’s risk perceptions of genetically modified (GM) food from the 1990s to 2015. We adopt socio-psychological and cultural approaches to investigate factors underlying the change of the Chinese public’s perceptions of the risk of GM food in this period. The analysis involves surveys of ‘Chinese publics and biotechnology’, Chinese newspaper coverage of GM food and website and social media sources. Our main finding is that the Chinese public’s risk perceptions of GM food have gone through three different phases: from ‘ignorant of the risk’ in the 1990s, to ‘tolerant of the risk’ between 2000 and 2009, to ‘mindful of the risk’ from 2010 to 2015. Among a variety of factors, social, economic and political transformations in China occurring over the same three decades as our investigation are major factors underlying the change of Chinese public’s risk perception of GM food. Furthermore, with the prominence of risk perception in recent years, as of yet there are no effective mechanisms for coping with the problems of risk communication and management that we have detected; this lack may impede the future development of GM food. We suggest that more studies are necessary to further investigate risk communication and risk governance issues, thereby contributing to better decision making with regard to GM food and risk governance of science and technology. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that government subsidies increase total productivity directly as well as indirectly by increasing R&amp;D investment. The positive effect of government subsidies on TFP is higher in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) than in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), higher in central SOEs than local SOEs and higher in enterprises with lower rather than higher TFP. Furthermore, the mediating effects of R&amp;D decisions also differ among different enterprises. Therefore, the government should implement differentiated subsidy policies to promote enterprises’ TFP. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Technovisions for Food Security as Sweden Restores Its Civil Defence",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> After three decades of demobilising the Swedish defence sector following the end of the Cold War, Sweden recently revived civil defence planning, including new instructions to plan for food security in the event of war. This policy shift has raised questions as to how farming’s vulnerability to disruptions differs today from in the Cold War era, as well as how this vulnerability might best be mitigated. This article presents and discusses key vulnerabilities in Swedish farming as perceived by farmers and some technological solutions to these envisioned by rural entrepreneurs. The focus is on technologies that could increase farm-level self-sufficiency and decrease vulnerability to trade disruptions. Using a sociotechnical imaginaries framework, to which we contribute the concept of ‘technovisions’, we highlight how farmers’ perceptions of potential technological solutions are embedded in social, material and moral values. We conclude that the technovisions presented, based on the production of renewable fuels, can contribute to reducing dependency on imported fuel and fertilisers and thus decrease vulnerability, and that these technovisions are placed firmly within a productionist imaginary of how food security can be achieved. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Aligning Competing Risks? Global Food Security as a Trade-Offs-Based Approach to Risk and Food Policy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 2008 food price crisis, many initiatives have emerged at the intersection between scientific, economic, humanitarian and political fields with a view to ‘feeding 9 billion human beings in 2050’ and to taking up the global food security challenge. Those initiatives have often been criticised for promoting a neo-productivist agenda. By studying the case of the UK Global Food Security programme, this article shows that ‘Global Food Security’ approaches not only re-legitimise production as such, but also looks to invent new ways of confronting production issues with health and/ or environmental issues, and thus of setting priorities. Potentially, this has major consequences for food policy and risk regulation. From this point of view, the UK GFS programme has become part of a movement which goes far beyond food security or agricultural issues as such. This movement includes balancing principles of protection with economic imperatives. Whilst other approaches (such as agroecology) look for integration between these different objectives, this approach is trying to achieve coexistence between objectives perceived to be contradictory. It assumes that sustainability can only be achieved at a global level, and that science must provide the right tools to constantly find the right trade-off between competing objectives. I conclude by discussing how this approach pertains to a re-structuring of capitalism towards an extractive economy, the related forms of regulation and the challenges of this approach for social critique. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the increase in climate variability, creating knowledge networks becomes important for leveraging the embedded resilience in the communities through cross-pollination of ideas, resources and institutional linkages. Communities have developed knowledge systems around climate-mediated environmental changes since time immemorial. Some social groups have capacity to cope with stress better. They have homeostatic advantage due to either accumulated surplus (Burton, 2001, Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the drylands, United Nations Environment Programme) or access to institutions, technology and social networks (Adger, 2003, Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change. Economic Geography, 79(4), 387–404). However, these knowledge systems often remain limited as isolated islands of expertise or small local networks resulting into asymmetries of knowledge at inter- or intra-community level. Intermediary organisations/platforms become important to bridge the gap that exists among communities within the informal sector and also between the formal and informal sectors. The platforms like the Honey Bee Network (henceforth, the Network) have been able to facilitate both horizontal exchanges, people-to-people learning and sharing, and vertical exchanges, connecting the informal actors with the formal system. The variation in different components of an Open Innovation System is studied in this article through their degree of openness in sharing, self-governance and self-regulation. We explore different activities and institutions of the Network to study the degree of openness and how they contribute to make the 26-year-old ecosystem more sustainable. We draw lessons for other institutions, organisations, communities who strive towards an autopoietic system, that is, a self-designed, self-organised and self-governed system with a feedback system from within and outside. This may make the whole innovation and knowledge ecosystem resilient in dealing with changing climatic conditions and fluctuating environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, experts and policymakers mobilised various slogans to compel the public to help defeat COVID-19. By comparing Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States, this study shows how dominant sociotechnical imaginaries tied to the slogans were mobilised. We argue that the blind spots of these dominant sociotechnical imaginaries contributed to subversive sociotechnical imaginaries and made room for COVID-19 scepticism. In Brazil, calls to ‘take care of yourself’ contributed to a sceptical stance that individualised responsibility. In the United Kingdom, calls to ‘protect the NHS’ contributed to sceptical accusations of whataboutism and the neglect of other vital social institutions during the lockdown. In the United States, calls to ‘flatten the curve’ contributed to scepticism that challenged public health interventions through discourses of individual choice and freedom. By paying attention to the blind spots of dominant sociotechnical imaginaries, we argue that experts and policymakers should be sensitive to how public health messaging may have feedback effects that detract from the initial aims of interventions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the process of transitioning from closed to open innovation, regions in developing countries need to understand how to choose the most effective path within the complex innovation system while considering their own innovation factors. Based on provincial panel data from China’s high-tech industry and the improved dynamic threshold model, we introduce the threshold of knowledge accumulation (KLA) into the non-linear mechanism between innovation paths and innovation performance to compare the dynamic threshold effect and its heterogeneity. This research provides interesting insights into innovation paths, showing that the relationship between the innovation path and innovation performance is significantly influenced by the threshold effect of KLA. As the level of KLA strengthens, its effects on each innovation path change. Overall, this article shows how KLA affects the relationship between the innovation path and innovation performance. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these insights for innovation management and policy. </jats:p>",

The theory of nudge illuminates how individuals may be nudged towards healthy behaviours without restricting individual freedom of choice.

We do so by comparing different policy contexts where women must opt in to screening (Australia) or opt out (Scandinavia). </jats:p><jats:p> We conclude that information is used to nudge women towards screening. Alongside focus on the ease of being screened, tensions exist in simultaneously portraying women as being at risk of breast cancer and providing reassurance of their healthy state.

Technological adoption is a highly social process, which involves resistance and failure to adapt by individuals in the midst of it. Therefore, there is a need to understand the everyday experiences of individuals who are impacted by technological changes in their work practices. Through ethnographic accounts of five field sites, this article aims to examine the effects of technology on work cultures in food centres in Singapore. Food centres were observed to be heavily dependent on complex human interactions, which often hindered technological implementations that were meant to simplify work processes. Nonetheless, the challenges can be mitigated through consultations with relevant social groups to improve technological incorporation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Korea, being one of the leading producers of automobiles, has been shifting its attention to eco-friendly new energy vehicles (NEVs) facing the threat of global warming. Since the 1990s, Korea has tried to promote the electric vehicles industry by providing various subsidies and infrastructure. The Korean government’s active NEV promotion policy has stimulated the expansion of production scale and commercialisation of NEVs. Korea’s domestic automobile producers could develop technologies needed in producing fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) ahead of the other large producers of automobiles. The Korean government announced the roadmap to promote FCEVs facing the hydrogen economy. The policy measures implemented by the government may contribute to the Korean producers to be able to gain from the first-mover’s advantage. Korea’s active NEV promotion policy provides policy implications to the other countries in overcoming the global warming phenomenon. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research examines FDI-mediated domestic firms’ technological catch-up by considering institutional differences between home and host countries, the role of marketing capabilities, and the joint effects of institutional differences and the degree of foreign ownership. Using firm-level panel data for Indian manufacturing industries, we find that FDI-mediated technological catch-up in domestic firms is conditional on institutional differences between the home and host country of multinational enterprises and the level of marketing capabilities of foreign-owned affiliates. In addition, we find that technological catch-up in domestic firms is likely to be positively influenced by the presence of wholly foreign-owned firms from institutionally close countries, whereas we find some evidence that the presence of minority foreign-owned firms may have a negative effect on domestic technological catch-up, regardless of institutional differences. We also provide theoretical and policy implications of our findings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article explores salient features of the link between labour market and urban agglomeration, using National Sample Survey unit level data and field data. To capture the role of labour market in urban agglomeration, the authors present a case study of Peenya Industrial Estate of Bangalore, India considered to be the largest industrial estate in South Asia. An interesting pattern that emerges is that the odds in favour of participating in the formal work are much higher for persons with technical education in global cities in India. The nature of the labour market for highly skilled occupations is distinct from the labour market for low-skilled occupations, showing different flexibility conditions. While firms tend to use simple ways for lower occupations, strategies like referrals are applied to source persons for higher occupations. Obtaining job information through informal sources like social contact does not turn out to be the significant determinant of odds in favour of on-the-job-search. As shown by the results, on-the-job search is rather driven by basic demographic variables like age, showing a discernibly inverse relation. Moreover, this inference is limited to the group of workers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning to cope with the Indian population dynamics is the central issue of the remarkable book edited by V. Gowariker, The Inevitable Billion Plus. The paper discusses the feasibility of Gowariker's proposals by examining first the science and technology policy experiences of the so-called developed countries, and then the lessons that can be drawn for a developing country such as India. With the end of the Cold War, the grounds for the support of basic science are everywhere reconsidered. This may be an opportunity for India, doomed to remain a 'mixed economy' whatever the fate of the liberal reforms, to design an alternative path of development aimed at reconciling the economic and strategic imperative of innovation with the nonetheless pressing imperative of social improvement. Such a policy is not so much to train Western-style researches as to increase and spread basic technical skills in line with local needs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how lay people’s response to risk can be shaped by their relationships with activists, by revealing the dynamics behind publicly expressed concerns. To do so, the article analyses data from the participant observation of ‘ban-asbestos activism’ in South Korea, as well as from interviews with activists and patients who are deeply involved in that activism. Operating from an understanding of lay people as a heterogeneous group of constantly interacting actors with a diverging understanding of, and concerns about, risks, this article shows that patients’ concerns about asbestos risk have been marginalised by the activists involved in ban-asbestos activism. In translating individual disease experiences caused by asbestos exposure into a risk faced by the general public by extracting generalisable data, activists’ popular epidemiology has largely disregarded patients’ voices that are rooted in the lives lived with ill bodies. In this regard, this is similar to the epidemiological studies conducted by the government. Thus, this article argues that a power relationship exists between activists and patients within the ban-asbestos activism, similar to, if not identical to, that of the expert–lay relationship. This study emphasises the importance of regarding bodies—that is, bodily experiences of living with illness—as valuable evidence in risk governance and policy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that understanding currently dominant technological change models in low-and-middle income countries is important to addressing challenges to sustainable development with enhanced knowledge and effective policies. Combining such understanding with using systems thinking, as a theoretical framework, helps in illuminating techno-social systems and their overlaps with economic and human development systems, therefore highlighting possible leverage points for interventions to usher technological change towards sustainable development objectives. The proposed conceptual synthesis between technological change models and systems thinking is then critically applied to case studies related to digitalisation in Africa, where challenges to sustainability are amplified by continuous pressure for technological advancement, making local capabilities a central issue. The case studies examine how continental digitalisation indicators are ahead of industrialisation and human development indicators, with similar issues in digitalising agri-food ecosystems. We show that, while Africa is currently increasing in digitalisation, correlations between digitalisation and sustainable development are not as direct, or necessarily positive, as initially assumed. Similar trends are seen in digitalisation and agri-food ecosystems, where farm-raised data is monetised off-farm, thus removing opportunities for farmers to realise return on their knowledge investment. Examining the cases, using the proposed synthesis approach, reveals that digitalisation can contribute to development indicators when coupled with enhancing employment in productive sectors and that the prevailing order of ‘technology-push, demand-pull’ models suggests more investment in technological improvement. The article contributes to theory by illuminating overlaps between two theoretical/conceptual areas and to praxis by informing alternative policy directions. </jats:p>",

One of the main goals of National Socialist policy was the ’purging’ of the entire civil service and public sector of Jews and those with left leanings. Since all general and technical universities in Germany were (and still are) state institutions, the laws and decrees concerning the civil service applied to professors and lecturers at universities. The first and most important of these was the Law for the Restoration of the German Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933. As a consequence, all Jewish (non-’Aryan’) and a few outspoken liberal or left wing university teachers were dismissed. This was followed by dismissals from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes.

    "abstract": "Given the prevailing neo-liberal economic atmosphere, there is’ a growing demand for deregulating agricultural markets in India. The assumption is that agricultural markets are both competitive and efficient. This timely study takes an opposite position and explains in considerable detail why deregulation may be dangerous for both efficiency and equity. Based on extensive field research on the marketing system for five major commodities and using an approach grounded in institutional economics and political economy, this book examines the technological and logistical systems defining agricultural markets. Further, the author analyses the linkages of agricultural markets with money, labour and land, stressing the way in which power is institutionalised. This focus helps explain the crucial shift characterising Indian agriculture today-that the ’masters of the countryside’",

    "abstract": "The eighT articles in this special issue address culture-based aspects of health, medicine and medical research in five East and Southeast Asian countries: China, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and Myanmar. The seven articles are products of the social science and humanities project entitled ‘Asian Biopoleis’, which begun in 2010 at the Asia Research Institute (ARI) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), but involving researchers from fourteen countries inside and outside the region (Clancey & Chen, 2013; Clancey, Graham, Bishop, & Fischer, 2013; Coopmans, Graham, Gelfert, & Clancey, 2012). At least two aspects of this project were globally unique. One was in the focus on medicine and public health as Asian practices and ways of living which had not previously been explicit in studies of the region. The other was in bringing together scholars based in and outside of Asia on a co-equal footing. Asian research sites have a long history of serving as points of comparison to Western ones, or as the targets of ethnographic trips funded by universities in other parts of the world.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The benefits and challenges associated with cell-based meat (CBM) influence actors’ perspectives on the importance of its development and production. We build on Boltanski and Thévenot’s framework to analyse the values that start-ups and investors address to a responsible innovation (RI). In an uncertain and complex context, interactions among actors shape innovative enterprises. Our research question is as follows: In what ways do the justifications employed by start-ups and investors converge (or not) in order to foster investment in the CBM industry? By identifying the prioritised values by start-ups and investors concerning the importance of developing and producing CBM, we demonstrate how two key groups are providing justifications, shifting from conflicting interests and towards the observance of the common good. Twenty-two start-ups were analysed alongside ninety-four investors. The analysed justifications were obtained from start-ups and investors’ official websites and interviews. Moreover, this study aims to provide an interdisciplinary study of a RI phenomenon, insomuch as there is insufficient research on this topic. </jats:p>",

Following the ‘biographical’ approach developed by Van der Geest and his colleagues (1989, 1996, 2002), the article shows how the appropriation by local people of biomedical drugs is very much determined by the social, cultural and economic reality in which people live, their personal biographies, their past experiences, as well as the relation they have with the medicines deliverers and the degree of trust, familiarity, socio-cultural affinity and geographical proximity characterizing relations. This analysis intends to fill a gap in the anthropological literature on contemporary Myanmar where the topic of biomedical drugs remains largely unexplored. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technology transfer offices are ubiquitous institutions within American universities. Most are underfunded and understaffed, will never turn a profit, drain limited university resources and potentially hinder innovation and knowledge transfer. Yet, inexplicably, new offices continue to be established. This article suggests that the continued hype over rare but lucrative blockbuster patents fuels much of this unnecessary expansion. These new offices, essentially mandated to discover the next big one, tend to make poor patenting and licencing decisions that effectively impinge on university knowledge transfer capabilities. This article suggests that although these offices may be necessary for some major research institutions, the bulk of academic research universities ought to share regional transfer offices that can benefit from economies of scale and experienced technology transfer officers. This article further suggests that the current status quo is the result of the somewhat arbitrary granting of patent rights to universities by the Carter era Bayh–Dole Act. Instead, this article proposes, in addition to a general overhaul in the methodology for transferring university knowledge, that a hochschullehrerprivileg or ‘professor’s privilege’ be established: academic inventors, not their bureaucratically bogged-down universities, should retain the patent rights that can then be licenced through the regional technology transfer offices without the, often ineffectual, university intervention. In addition to streamlining the current technology transfer process, such a system will also create strong incentives for research scientists to transfer knowledge and become more entrepreneurial. Although an overhaul of the American structure, while necessary, seems unlikely, such a system can nevertheless be implemented in both developed and developing countries that are futilely seeking to reproduce American successes through mimicking the current American Bayh–Dole arrangement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and green human resource management (GHRM) are gaining attention across industries but remain underexplored in hospitality and tourism. This sector heavily impacts the environment with substantial water use, high energy consumption, and waste generation. It faces increasing pressure from stakeholders for greater environmental responsibility, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of green initiatives and their effects. To address this gap, this article investigates how companies pursuing green initiatives influence sustainable business performance. Utilising data from 293 respondents in the hospitality industry in Vietnam, the study employs a partial least squares-structural equation model. The results reveal that CSR, GHRM and green employee behaviour positively impact sustainable business performance sustainability. Moreover, environmental regulation, green culture and green transformational leadership enhance CSR and GHRM. This study offers valuable insights into green initiatives, environmental regulation and CSR for governments, practitioners and academics. Managers can integrate green strategies into their operational practices, complying with environmental compliance, pursuing CSR and ultimately promoting sustainable performance. </jats:p>",

I show, specifically, how the new value of innovation is being incorporated into Singapore’s older narrative of national survival in a way that changes this narrative’s mode of emplotment from one of comedy to one of satire. Through this shift, promises of collective prosperity and progress, which are integral to the nation’s founding era of industrial manufacturing-based development, are withdrawn, while new notions of individual and financial risk and reward are introduced. I argue that attending to modes of emplotment may be a useful way to identify the broader entailments of different governments’ innovation policies and programmes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Founder’s prior experience has been considered crucial for growth and success of venture firms. Despite the extant research on entrepreneurial experience, little is known about how entrepreneurs’ prior experiences are imprinted on them and the differences in knowledge these experiences shape. Based on the theories of entrepreneurial learning and effectuation-causation, this article investigates the influence of entrepreneurs’ prior firm founding and industry work experience. We tested hypotheses regarding the impact of these two types of entrepreneurial experience on the perception of long-term growth expectations and competitiveness of venture firms they found. The analysis was conducted on 1,610 newly founded venture firms in Korea surveyed over a four-year period from 2014 to 2017, and the ordered logit model was employed. The results show that prior firm founding experience results in positive long-term growth expectation. On the other hand, prior industry work experience has a positive effect only on organisation management competitiveness and has no statistically significant effect on technology competitiveness. This study extends the discussions of existing literature by focusing on the impact of founders’ prior experience on perceptions of their venture firms.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses two projects in the early life of the Indian chemist, P. C. Ray, rightfully considered the founder of the 'school of chemistry' in modern India. Ray scholarship has often considered these years of his life as important from the point of view of an appreciation of the history of alchemy in India, but not in terms of his scientific contributions. It is only after 1907 that the Ray legend became the subject of serious scientific consideration. This paper discusses Ray's evolution till 1907, by examining the relationship between his project on the history of chemistry in India and his scientific researches on mercury. Further, it goes on to suggest that this effort was part of the larger programme of the cultural legitimation of modern science, and the two projects otherwise considered distinct, mutually informed each other during these years. While identifying the context of Ray's project, this exercise in social epistemology locates the factors that have clouded the recognition of the thematic unity of Ray's endeavour. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Phasing Scientific Migration in the Context of Brain Gain and Brain Drain in India",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Five decades of India's experience of migration of highly qualified personnel (HQ P), as presented in this paper, broadly falls into three distinct but overlapping periods, namely: 1940s to 1960s; 1970 to 1980s; and 1990s and beyond. In the post-indepen dence period up to the 1960s, India did not really experience the trend of brain drain. The demand pattern created by the official policies to expand the university sector and strengthen the infrastructure in science and technology determined the human resource policies in training, higher education and even attracted some established Indian scientists from abroad during this early phase. Beginning with the 1970s, India began to experience the problem of brain drain, for which several economic and sociological factors were responsible including the oversupply of HQP and the lack of demand for these personnel. Even though different trends are discernible during the 1980s and 1990s, the case discussed here illustrates that India continues to lose its scientific and technical human resources—despite the new opportunities created by the present trend of globalisation. Any relative short-term gains visible in the form of brain gain and arresting the process of brain drain are likely to be neutralised by the lack of appropriate long-term policy measures. The paper calls for such policy interventions, rather than ad hoc measures, to address the problem of India's brain drain. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study aims to explore how to measure firms’ open innovation from financial statements. So, our research question is as follows: How can we determine firms’ open innovation signals directly or indirectly from financial statements? This study used data from the US financial statements and patent registration database from 2016 to 2018 to answer this research question. Three manifest signals of open innovation in financial data were found. First, subsidiary or related firm investment in financial data may have a negative relationship with open innovation because open innovation (i.e., the co-application of patents) could decrease subsidiary or related firm investment. But there are differences between the top and bottom twenty firms. Second, internal R&amp;D investment (I R&amp;D) in financial data may have a positive relationship with open innovation because I R&amp;D could trigger inward open innovation. If I R&amp;D combines with an open innovation strategy, it increases the size of subsidiary or related firm investment as a kind of inward open innovation. Third, free cash flow (FCF) in financial data may have a positive relationship with open innovation because high FCF could support outward open innovation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "resource productivity can be achieved by careful rehabilitation. Many watersheds contain both private and common land. It is already clear from a number of efforts led by NGOs that, to be equitable and institutionally sustainable, the rehabilitation of both common and private lands needs action rooted in strong resource user groups capable of taking decisions in a participatory and resolving conflict. To build up groups in this way requires both time and skills, both of which have proven elusive in government projects and programmes. The key question addressed by this book is how far the approaches developed (or adapted) by the public sector have been applied on a wide scale, for without such approaches neither the ecological nor livelihood benefits of watershed rehabilitation will be achieved.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public interest litigation questioning risk regulation of emerging technologies has been a mechanism through which the Supreme Court has become increasingly involved in the national narrative on technology, development, risk and the role of the state. Such litigations include biotechnology and nuclear technology which have also been identified as important ingredients of the national development agenda. This is similar to other developing countries where identification of emerging technologies that help the economy leapfrog, have become part of the development agenda. Understandably the focus of the state is on development rather than on risk regulation. This has attracted considerable criticism from civil society groups and legal challenges to the regulatory framework. The Supreme Court despite its stated lack of competence to understand and address technological issues and its innate restraint to comment on what it deems to be policy matters, has been forced to address issues of risk regulation and in the process play a critical role in constituting the technology and shaping the imagination of that technology within the national narrative. The aim of this article is to examine and evaluate the role of the Supreme Court in this context through an analysis of two case studies of nuclear technology and biotechnology. </jats:p>",

The 1% goal was duly re-affirmed at the African Union Ministers’ Conference of 2003, in Africa’s Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action 2005, and in the 2014 Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa. The contribution presents a high-level assessment of the extent to which these various efforts are revealed in the present continent-wide status of science, technology and innovation (STI). To this end, a high-level appraisal of STI inputs, focus and outputs is assembled. In so doing, the limitations of data and STI indicators must be acknowledged. While there are signs of progress, STI policy has greater rhetorical than operational outcome, raising concerns for African states’ capability to attain the SDGs and shape their participation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. </jats:p>",

The article picks up where the Human Sciences Research Council study on the mobility of knowledge workers left off by examining new data, and innovation and immigration policy. It argues that there has been a considerable shift in researcher demographics, but that this has been through a policy of substitution rather than growth. The ongoing shortage of skills thereby creates a price premium for that skill, the more so as immigration policy dictates that the considerable investment in developing foreign students returns little by way of local capacity development. Despite a dysfunctional school system the innovation system shows resilience, with increased publication outputs largely pulled up by international collaboration. The odds are that the innovation system will remain starved of foreign staff, yet be ‘open’ for collaboration. The beach is open, but the gate is closed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ANY NEW INNOVATION is actually an incremental improvement on existing innovations based on past experience (Rosenberg 1982). Existing innovations and past experience are held in a structured arrangement that can be called the national innovation system (NIS). It accommodates the whole dynamics of institutional and organisational arrangements and interrelations among different institutions and organisations that are supposed to create an environment conducive to innovations. It also accommodates the way knowledge is generated and accumulated in the system to function as the fountainhead of innovations. It is within this structure and hierarchy that knowledge is accumulated, stored and many related additional innovations take place. The NIS has nation as the unit, a geopolitical and cultural boundary within which it is supposed to function. At the same time, it is not an amalgam of firm-level arrangement of innovations, but a nationallevel arrangement that is built upon the firmas well as university-level capability.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The global techno-assemblage shapes the continued lagging of southern countries and firms behind those from the global north. The biotechnology industry is one form of this assemblage and operates according to inter-related logics (i.e., economic, hybrid and social) which are shaped by particular governmental policies and corporate decisions to minimise risk and philanthropic efforts. Within this form, a non-profit ophthalmic consumables manufacturing company, Aurolab, in southern India creates new innovations. According to the ‘technology follower’ conceptual framework by innovation studies and management scholars, biotechnology firms have two options to ‘move up’ the international value chain of invention: they must either ‘catch up’ at a very high rate, or ‘leap-frog’ up through research, design and development. Aurolab innovates to heal eye diseases. They focus on affordability issues through research and development as well as design and development. At Aurolab, they shift between these two strategies depending upon the drug or device they are working on. This article considers additional incentives to refocus firms on local needs-based technology according to a social logic. As Aurolab demonstrates, a new focus on technology to address structural inequality may be necessary to get ‘undone technology’ done. </jats:p>",

The author stresses first the interest to bring fresh and accurate data on this region, where S&amp;T institutions are rapidly changing and poorly documented. A second main point is that in such intermediary countries, where the institutionalisation of science is in progress, usual concepts like ‘scientific communities’, research and innovation ‘systems’ or ‘the role of the scientist’ do not readily apply. Other notions have to be coined to account for the motivations of the actors, the aim of policies and the paths to change. Finally the article distinguishes a variety of scientific landscapes, from Maghreb to the Gulf States. It insists on two main factors of dynamics: the social grounding of science, which derives from images of knowledge and from the ambient values; and the social support science has acquired (through an implicit alliance with specific groups). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Stem cell research on cardiac patients at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which was disclosed through the media in 2005, created a storm. On the one hand, it was celebrated as a ‘global first in pioneering stem cell medicine’. On the other hand, not only the AIIMS study, but, more broadly, stem cell research and therapy in India was criticised for ‘tall claims [and] questionable ethics’. The responses of the policymakers and regulators in India were equally divergent. How are we to understand the contingency and unpredictability of the regulatory regime in India? The answers to this and other related questions are often presented through a regulatory fix—countries such as India need to tighten their regulatory regime. The need for a legally binding regulatory regime is undeniable; nevertheless, a narrow focus on a regulatory fix fails to explain several issues. In this article, I analyse the stem cell research on cardiac patients at AIIMS. Through a focus on epistemic, ethical and juridical assemblage of stem cell research, I highlight the inescapable contingency in the translation between ‘governmental rationality’ and ‘the practice of government’ and show how this reflects biopolitical excess. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, young people have acquired a more active role in different areas of public life, such as culture, politics and gender debates. However, the relevance of their role in innovation processes has remained largely undiscussed. Are young people, in particular those from working class backgrounds, a forgotten actor for innovation and technological change policies? This study aims to understand whether the youth population—who are widely connected to the Internet, who do not necessarily participate in formal educational spaces but are increasingly acquiring digital skills autonomously—can be considered as an agent of innovation. Specifically, this study aims to propose and define the concept of Digital Grassroots Youth Innovation. It is based on both empirical and theoretical sources. On the one hand, it relies on a compilation of experiences of innovative activities related to digital technologies led by young people in Argentina. On the other hand, it is supported by a theoretical discussion on (a) the different types of innovations and their subjects, (b) the specificities of the ‘marginal mass’ in informational capitalism and (c) the characterisation of the young population in Argentina as ‘NEET’ (not in education, employment or training). Finally, we ask about the role played by digital technologies and non-formal learning in these particular innovation processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, the defense budget, which includes the cost of purchasing weapons, has continuously and significantly increased in South Korea. This increase, which is entirely financed by the government, has raised the issue of the socioeconomic impacts of spending on the defense industry in areas, such as production, added value and job creation. In this regard, it is necessary to more accurately measure the impact of spending on the defense industry on domestic industry, but the Bank of Korea’s industry inducement coefficient, which measures industrial spillovers, is quite limited in measuring the industry inducement impact caused by weapon production. Therefore, this study explores how to estimate the industry inducement coefficient of the production of a specific weapon by utilising the current Bank of Korea input–output table, which is focused on private industry, and applies this methodology to the estimation of the input–output coefficient of the production of a specific weapon. As a result of the analysis, the input–output coefficient of a specific weapon was estimated to be approximately 1.18 times higher than that of the products of similar industries in the private sector in terms of production, 1.03 times higher in terms of value-added and 1.03 times higher in terms of employment. This suggests that the effect of fostering domestic industry through weapon production is somewhat greater than that of private industry and proves the efficacy of government investment in this sector. </jats:p>",

The article presents the importance of the European Union as a reference for this monitoring activity. It also shows that the new tools, for example, innovation surveys, are a part of the policy process itself. Finally, it presents the main characteristics of public policies, their recent turn toward innovation and the effects that these policies have had on the institutions and actors promoting innovation which we propose to call the ‘innovation world’.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Considering the high unemployment rate among Namibian youth and a lack of job opportunities, the promotion of entrepreneurship has gained wider attention in the country. A number of initiatives have been started such as entrepreneurship trainings and workshops, business idea competitions, etc. All these aim to inspire young people to think of alternative income sources. As part of a two-year funded community outreach research and development (R&amp;D) project, we have investigated participatory approaches to engage marginalized youth into conceptualizing their own context, imparting skills, and deriving new career paths. This article reports and reflects on one of the interventions we have recently concluded with a group of youth in Havana, an informal settlement in the outskirts of Windhoek. We conducted what we entitled “The Havana Entrepreneur”, a series of interactions inspired upon the model of the American reality game show “The Apprentice”. Over a number of weeks two youth groups were given challenges to tackle by means of competing against one another. After completion of each challenge, groups were rated by a number of judges on skills demonstrated such as marketing, presentation, reflection and creativity among others. We observed an increase in, and improvement of skills revealed along tasks’ completion, besides an openly expressed self-realization and discovery of abilities by participants. Moreover, the youth are currently engaged in the continuation of activities beyond the initial entrepreneurial interactions. Thus we suggest replicating “The Havana Entrepreneur”, including the recording on camera of it by the youth themselves as a new mode to instigating a wider entrepreneurial spirit in informal settlements. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Assessing the Institutional Legitimacy of Research and Technology Organisations in South Korea",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the institutional legitimacy of public Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) in South Korea (Korea hereafter), a catching-up economy. It reports the results of content analysis carried out on 200 articles, columns and interviews appearing in major Korean newspapers from February 1998 to October 2008 to assess the degree of institutional legitimacy that Korean RTOs enjoy. The results indicate that these RTOs have not achieved sufficient institutional legitimacy to maintain organisational sustainability. Not only have the governance and management systems of these organisations changed following each election of a new government in Korea, but the results also reveal discrepancies in opinions of RTOs amongst government policymakers, RTO researchers/managers, and opinion leaders in the country’s science and technology societies. Periodic policy direction inconsistencies are also identified. Taken together, these factors have hindered the institutional legitimacy of Korean RTOs. Drawing on the results of this analysis, this article suggests new policy directions for increasing the institutional legitimacy of RTOs in catching up and developing countries </jats:p>",

Methodologically, by looking at qualitative networks, charismatic leaders and research strategies, this essay proposes a finer grained, meso-level, ethnographic analysis that allows for multi-scalar tracking and juxtaposition as generators of comparative insights. It deploys a social hieroglyphic analysis of the leaders of BGI and an updated account of the post-2010 ‘industrial re-alignment’ of GIS to highlight the role of cross-national networks in the construction of what are usually seen as national science projects, as well as the roles of mixed state and market strategies, and mixed clinical, basic science, biotech and big pharma protocols and platforms of the contemporary life sciences. It pays particular attention to the small worlds of the scientific republic and the charismatic voices of leaders forging new institutional arrangements. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Visions of Hungarian Artificial Intelligence Specialists About the Future of Work and Their Roles",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an international context where social effects and ethics related to artificial intelligence (AI) are receiving more attention, there is a dearth of research about how AI specialists perceive the future of work and their role in bringing about the respective future. Does the fact that ethics and social issues are receiving more publicity impact AI specialists’ views? The current study advances knowledge about this issue by describing a deep qualitative investigation of the visions of AI developers and researchers in Hungary, a country on the semi-periphery concerning the development of these technologies. In recent years, social and ethical challenges linked to AI have been covered in the Hungarian media as well, although they are less of a hot topic than in some Western countries. The twenty AI specialist interviewees’ accounts were characterised by their perception of the current period as one of hype, expectations of a slow and limited amount of technological change, techno-optimism, as well as a distancing of responsibility. Notably, the change in the media climate does not appear to have affected their thinking: social consequences and ethical issues associated with technology were neglected in their accounts. Potential drivers of their views and the potential effects of the country context are discussed, as well as the consequences of the experts’ expectations and implications for AI research and development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of intra-product specialisation on the innovation ability of the high-technology industry in China. To achieve this research goal, we use the generalised method of moments (GMM) with a dynamic panel data model in our empirical research. Total factor productivity (TFP) and its decomposition variables are used to measure the innovation ability. The Malmquist index is employed to calculate TFP and its decomposition variables, namely, technology progress, technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Previous studies show that intra-product specialisation can raise TFP, but our empirical results reveal that the impact of the intra-product specialisation on the TFP is uncertain: it decreases TFP in the initial period but increases it in the lag period. Results also indicate that an increase in the proportion of state-owned property rights exerts a positive influence on TFP and the change in pure technical efficiency. Technical efficiency is greatly influenced by intra-product specialisation, whereas intra-product specialisation exerts a slight influence on technological progress. The capital investment in research and development (R&amp;D) has a positive effect on TFP, and the contribution rate of R&amp;D labour input to TFP is relatively low. The main conclusion is that China need to improve the degree of intra-product specialisation, accelerate the evolution of industry technical standards and reduce the coordination cost of intra-product specialisation to enhance the innovation ability of the high-technology industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Amit PrAsAd (AP): Thank you Warwick for the interview. It is indeed a pleasure and honour to have this opportunity to further engage with your vast intellectual contribution. I am hoping to use this occasion to further explore some of your analytical and methodological interventions. Let me start by taking you back nearly one and a half decades. In the special issue that you co-edited in 2002 you deployed the phrase ‘postcolonial technoscience’, which acquired a trajectory of its own and has been commonly used in various articles and books thereafter. Obviously, you were juxtaposing postcolonial analytics and sensibility and the Latourian concept of technoscience. In fact, you candidly asserted in your introduction to the special issue: ‘A postcolonial study of science and technology might offer new, and more richly textured, answers to many of the questions posed in actor-network-theory’ [ANT] (2002, p. 649). Thereafter, in another article, you wrote: ‘While they [actor-network-theorists] shy from any direct engagement with postcolonial studies, they seem to have picked up and amplified the vibe’ (2009, p. 392). More recently, you have celebrated Wen-yuan Lin and John Law’s call for ‘balance of betrayal’ in STS (Lin & Law, 2014), calling their contribution ‘an enticing prospect’ that opens new possibilities for postcolonial investigations. Can you elaborate your intellectual affinity and connections with ANT? And do you think with Lin and Law’s intervention ANT has not only embraced postcolonial concerns, but is also charting new trajectories in that regard?",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article a series of variables referred to the general public's valuations of science and technology are analysed. These valuations refer to different dimensions of science and technology—as a utility of scientific knowledge, their legitimacy, their bond with the cultural matrix of everyday life. The analysis is based on information from a survey carried out in a great urban conglomerate of a little scientific developing country, Argentina. We see that valuation variables discriminate the public according to their positive or negative responses about science, but that there is no evident association between them. We consider one variable in particular dividing the public into those who are ‘trustful’ and those who are ‘cautious’ regarding the advances of science, and we see how it is related to other significations of valuation. The pre-eminence of positions of ambivalence or contradiction in the population's perception regarding this topic is discussed. A factor analysis is presented that comprises these variables and that presents a set of ‘valuation orientations’ towards science as a result. Finally, it is interesting to see how education and the level of understanding of scientific knowledge affect the public's valuation, which questions the basic supposition of the tradition of public understanding studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides a high-level review of the performance of the S&amp;T system in South Africa. All the indicators suggest that, at a high level, performance has not been strong. This is despite the fact that more resources have been devoted to S&amp;T and that there has been extensive policy experimentation. The argument advanced is that the key factor explaining this weak performance is poor provision of skilled labour. The article critically examines the recent OECD review of S&amp;T in South Africa in this light. Finally, the article examines the proposed future direction of S&amp;T policy in South Africa as reflected in the twenty-year plan of the Department of Science and Technology. The plan is highly ambitious, considerably expanding the scope of S&amp;T policy and projects. While it recognises the critical importance of increasing high-level skills for innovation, it fails to give adequate recognition to the fact that this will take time. Accordingly, new projects will need to be undertaken after, and not contemporaneously with, the expansion in the supply of skills. </jats:p>",

Our results show—for the Mexican case—that innovation is a method used to meet international standards and is therefore necessary in order to compete in export markets. This relationship has been observed in both developed and developing countries, although the exact configuration differs, probably due to the different role innovation plays in each. We used several sub-samples showing that different types of firms are associated with distinct independent variables. These variables could quite possibly explain many of the differing and often contradictory results in existing literature. </jats:p>",

Many countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and China have invested heavily in this field but the negative aspect of such scientific breakthrough draws little attention. Since the harms synthetic biology can cause is not certain, it is neither safe nor proper to leave it to the hands of only experts. Currently researches on synthetic biology are being conducted without proper public discourse and consideration. One of the reasons for the lack of public discussion on synthetic biology is the speed of the development in the field. The field is innovating so fast that people have little chance to digest the consequence of such advances. Also the confusion on the definition of synthetic biology contributes to the lack of proper public discussion on the issue. </jats:p><jats:p> This article provides a new typology for definition of synthetic biology conceptualised by the authors and analyses the current state of synthetic biology in major countries. In addition, ethical issues associated with synthetic biology are discussed. Scientific transparency and participatory process are suggested as policy options to deal with them. </jats:p>",

This collection brings together eighteen of the world’s most exemplary rural development stories. Significantly, there are more case studies from Asia-seven are from South Asia and three from South-",

    "abstract": "Most post-colonial societies are engaged in a serious process of introspection. This has resulted in some sort of a bending over backwards in order to seek indigenous sources of inspiration for the present sociocultural and scientific development in their respective pasts. Perhaps this is a valid and natural reaction to almost a hundred years of imperialism that ran roughshod over the sensibilities and identities of the subjugated colonial societies. The relationship between science and imperialism, which has of late been the concern of the science and empires programme, comes in for the severest criticism.",

    "title": "Introduction: Ambidextrous Open Innovation in the 4th Industrial Revolution",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the popularity of artificial intelligence, big data and Internet of Things, business nowadays is featured with technology advancement, open innovation and collaboration. This happens particularly in the manufacturing sectors, known as the Industrial 4.0 or the 4th Industrial Revolution. Alongside this trend, there is also a movement towards servitisation and service innovation. In the financial service sector, FinTech firms, traditional large firms, intermediaries, users and regulators are actively engaged together to develop a smart system of banking, investing and insurance service. Nevertheless, the sector is facing challenges in relation to security, trust and external disruptions. To solve this, first, this article builds an ambidextrous open innovation model with multi-dimensions, which are motivated by the arriving of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Second, this article applies the ambidextrous open innovation model with multi-dimensions to the financial sectors to validate the model basically. Third, this model is applied to several research studies to obtain additional validation of it. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Redefining the Brain Drain",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> For many years, China's government worried about the ‘brain drain’. But beginning in 1992, China began to encourage students settled abroad to return for short visits and en-gage in various programmes on the Chinese mainland. Then, in 2001, the government adopted a new policy, encouraging overseas mainlanders to contribute to China's modernisation, even if they stayed abroad, and outlining various ways they could help China. This policy mirrors the strategies of other countries who encourage ‘brain circulation’ and develop a ‘diaspora option’ in order to overcome the loss of talented people. But what forms does this assistance take? Why do people contribute to China's modernisation while remaining abroad? What are the characteristics of those who ‘serve China’, as compared to those who do not? We employ data from a survey in Silicon Valley, as well as two Web-based surveys carried out in Canada and the US with mainland Chinese academics to answer these questions. </jats:p>",
