    "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays we are faced with an enormous development of digital, information and communication technologies. Together with numerous phenomena, which are the products of activities that belong to the biotechnosphere, these technologies build a complex corpus called cyberculture. In this context art has an important, critical role to play. In particular (multi)media art can serve as an experimental laboratory, not only for new technologies but, especially, for studies of the new social relation(ship)s created or fuelled by those technologies. Media and multimedia information and communication technologies generate new promises, problems, and threats; and artists undertake efforts to examine this emerging area that has been repeatedly considered as a ‘post-biological syndrome’. In other words, artists do not only use media technologies, but also scrutinise and challenge them. In this sense the new (multi)media art could be deemed a successor of the avant-garde movement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents the main results of an exploratory qualitative study on the functions and meanings of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in young people's everyday life. Specifically, this study concerns teenagers' cultural ways of interpreting the mobile phone and its uses, as they become part of their social world. Through their accounts and narratives about 'young people's use of the mobile phone', teenagers construct their specific cultural model of this communication technology: it is seen as a radically social performance. Insofar as it is conceived as such, the mobile phone (MP) becomes a detonator of social thinking: it provokes reflective thinking on the ethics, etiquette and aesthetics of everyday action and social life. Reflecting upon the forms of use of the mobile phone, teenagers also explore the identity-making processes involved in the presentation of oneself on a public scene. In other words, they interpret and make the uses of the MP work as a social grammar through which people are supposed to define themselves and those around them. In this sense, using an MP in a teenage-appropriate way is not a matter of technical competence; it requires larger communicative skills that are cultural knowledge of when, where, why and, moreover, how to use this technology. Interpreted in the frames of teenagers' specific culture, the uses of the MP are also a tool for constructing the main dimensions of this culture and are used as a laboratory for the development of the skills needed to become competent members of their own community. </jats:p>",

Training is a staple in the operation of algorithmic systems, and artificial intelligence more generally; it is a practical methodology by which these systems become intelligent. Training is also a key feature of how workers throughout history came to perform their labor, and how, during the 20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>century, machines came to acquire this human ability, that is, automation. And lastly, drawing on Immanuel Kant’s theory of aesthetic judgment, Hannah Arendt offers a political theory where training is key to political judgment.

It is argued that the marketization of an innovative use of new media platforms happens in early phases of the innovation processes, and the success of new media technologies such as virtual worlds hinges on the creation of expectations, which are intertwined with the discursive construction of future users. Drawing on the sociology of expectations and the sociology of technology, the article argues that the configuration of expected users is a central part of the communication about the innovation. It is demonstrated that the creation of markets does not begin when innovations such as Virtual Worlds Architecture are settled, but is intertwined with early expectations about their promises and limitations. Rather than seeing virtual worlds as settled and secluded sites for social and cultural innovation in themselves, we have examined how actors involved with them try to sell them as such. A crucial challenge for these actors turns out to be the interpretative flexibility of the innovation, since arguments designed to attract one kind of expected user might problematize the configuration of other types of users. </jats:p>",

As I navigate this wildly diverse, sometimes confusing landscape of computer-based art, I find myself searching for works that truly take advantage of the capabilities that, from my experience as a designer and programmer of interactive virtual characters, I know the computer can offer.",

Analysis of Knight Ridder's Philadelphia Online &lt;http://www.phillynews.com&gt;, the web site of the Philadelphia (PA) Inquirer and Daily News, from November 1995 to May 1997 indicates that most readers accessed the site from their offices: the highest traffic occurred on weekdays, with the steepest spike around noon, dropping by half during evenings and weekends. The study also found that web traffic increased 874 per cent over 18 months; users spent an average of fewer than 14 minutes per visit, viewing an average of seven pages each time; and most users accessed the site from commercial (38 per cent), network (29.9 per cent) or educational (24.1 per cent) domains. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Through its three research articles, this issue focuses on social media and its use in identity creation, professional communication and civic participation. Leading this section, Lee Farquar has undertaken a one-year Cyber-ethnographic study to examine identity presentations and interpretations of 346 Facebook users. He has observed that Facebookers sought social acceptance with their presentations and display an over-simplified imagery to reduce ambiguity and align with specific social groups. Farquar’s analysis is particularly interesting in its insight into the use of Facebook and the creation of identity within the platform’s construction of the social sphere. Following on from this, Lily Canter’s article takes up the use of social media in the professional context. Canter was the winner of the Convergence prize for best article by a research student at the Media, Communications and Cultural Studies Association (MeCCSA) 2012 conference held at the University of Bedfordshire. In her article ‘The interactive spectrum: the use of social media in UK regional newspapers’, she analyses the content of multiple social media profiles at two daily regional newspapers in the United Kingdom to determine how interactivity between journalists and readers is being shaped. Her study identifies a spectrum of interactivity which indicates that individual journalists are engaging with their readers in an informal, personal and reciprocal manner via social media platforms. It raises questions about whether journalists are particularly adept in their use of social media by comparison with other professionals’ engagement with this form of communication. Canter",

    "title": "Identity and social media",
    "abstract": "Given the quantity of data social networks produce – millions of data points and in some cases billions on the scale of big data analysis – how do we frame the quantitative analysis of this data in terms of theoretical models of identity? In 2008, Vincent Miller’s article in Convergence recognized in our ubiquitous and pervasive media the essential role of phatic communication which forms our connection to the here and now. Social media has become a native habitus for many and is a place to perform our various roles in our multimodal lives, as a professional, a parent, an acquaintance, and a colleague. The current generation has grown up with social media and like the 10-year-old Facebook, Twitter too has become part of some people’s everyday here and now. In this issue, Nicholas Carah, Sven Brodmerkel, and Lorena Hernandez focus on how Facebook works not just as a platform to harvest data but also as a platform to manage the circulation of affect and creation of social connections around brands. Looking specifically at drinking culture and Facebook, they argue that some social media engagement practices allow for circumventing regulatory regimes by prompting connections between mediations of drinking culture and the brand that would not be possible in other media channels. Yet do we understand the aspects and patterns of identity development in virtual worlds? As Margaretten and Gaber (2014) have proposed the concept of ‘authentic talk’ identified as ‘spontaneous, unrehearsed discourse’ on Twitter, in this issue Bernadett Koles and Peter Nagy offer an alternative conceptual model to researchers of a virtual identity developed to capture this complex conglomerate of personal, social, relational, and material aspects. While Tamara Shepherd and Thorsten Busch argue that Twitter has acquired the critical mass of users necessary to successfully establish a robust and financially viable social network. Employing a business ethics perspective, Shepherd and Busch examine Twitter’s ethos in relation to debates around democratic communication in relation to corporate social responsibility. ‘This issue becomes all the more pressing because online social networks to a certain extent have taken on the role of quasi-governmental bodies today, regulating what their users can and cannot do, thus raising questions of accountability and legitimacy’ (2014: 294).",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In early 2008, what started as a small report in an online conservative outlet on the Xbox 360 videogame Mass Effect was picked up by a number of news outlets and blogs. In particular, Fox News’s ‘Live Desk with Martha MacCallum’ produced a segment on the game, claiming it was fully interactive digital pornography. One of the show’s guests, pop psychologist Cooper Lawrence, argued that the game’s sexual content was harmful, but did so with no firsthand knowledge of the game, incensing fans of the game. Those fans proceeded to respond in various ways, particularly on the internet. The present research examines three distinct areas of these fan responses — forum discussions, YouTube videos, and the ‘review bombing’ of Cooper Lawrence’s books on Amazon.com. The various ways in which fans expressed their anger at, displeasure with, and opinions on the story and how the game was treated in the media present a chance not only to look into the mindset of these fans toward the various institutions involved in but also paint a picture of fan and gamer cultures in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many reasons have been suggested for the lack of female participation in technologically complex digital game play. A previously unconsidered factor is that of cross-gender competition. Rigid gender divisions are the norm in most analog/traditional games and sports. Societal penalties for breaking these norms are severe for both males and females. This article suggests that the virtual certainty of cross-gender competition might be a factor in deterring females from digital game play. The ease of transgressing traditional play taboos in virtual words, however, allows both males and females to explore and possibly transform rigid gender configurations. Policy implications for using play as a way to break down stereotypes and encourage the participation of females are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Resonating Sound Art and the Aesthetics of Room Resonance",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Sustained acoustic resonance has been explored by many sound artists and, in some works, it is the central or sole mechanism of sound production. Instances are identified among the work of Ros Bandt, Garlo, Alan Lamb, Alvin Lucier, Gordon Monahan, Roger Winfield and others. In addition to shared formal elements, such works tend to share auditory phenomenological characteristics. It is hypothesised that sustained resonance in general exhibits a type of sound with particular aesthetic connotations, which are largely derived from psychoacoustic factors. This article outlines the terms of and discusses the findings from my experimental investigations into acoustic and psychoacoustic aspects of room resonance. The range of room resonance sounds available from one particular room was explored using a procedure adapted from one of Lucier's works. Listening tests were conducted on the resulting sounds, eliciting descriptive, evaluative and emotional responses from 13 subjects. There are some correspondences between the listening test results and apparent characteristics of resonating sound art. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In this collection of essays, eight ’new media poets’ look back on what they have been doing with electronic technology, in some cases for over a decade, and, since defining their work in contrast to paper poetry seems important to some among their number, what the new media can do that, in John Cayley’s re-orientating word, ’codexspace’ can’t. The poets are all from the Atlantic Rim: Jim Rosenberg’ (USA), Phillippe Bootz (France), E.M. de Melo e Castro (Portugal), Andr6 Vallias (Brazil), Ladislao Pablo Gyori (Argentina), John Cayley2 (based in England), and the editor, Eduardo Kac’ (based in the USA). Eric Vos (from the Netherlands) concludes the collection, summing up and suggesting new directions. Jim Rosenberg suggests that his use of hypertext and his open-ended diagrammatic work might lead to thinking of the electronic technologies as ’a medium of thought’, a suggestion that warrants further scrutiny. His article focuses on his work on the ’juxtapositioning’ of text. To this reader ’superimposition’ would perhaps be a better word, as what seems to be meant is the selective obliteration and revelation of texts as successive text-based filters are placed on preceding ones: like looking down on traffic jams of words on a complex of unstable motorway flyovers and slip roads.",

The history of the idea of virtuality shows that policy, personnel choice and placement, and research and development aimed to implement this vision for VR.

It is becoming evident that art theory will have to develop a new instrumentarium for tackling the particular conditions of production and reception of digital media art, based on the particularities of digital technologies. The present essay will first discuss some examples of contemporary digital media art practices and will then suggest elements of an aesthetics of digital media art. It will focus on the notion of 'heterogenesis', of making different, and will point to forms of subjectification which are specific to the dispositive of digital media. In the conclusion, the concept of the 'war machine' (Deleuze/Guattari<jats:sup> 1</jats:sup>) is brought into play as a possible model for describing the specific form of machinic agency that is made possible by the use of digital media. The suggestions of this essay are prescriptive insofar as I feel there is a need to work towards a more critical understanding of the way in which media art intervenes in existing cultural and social processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how the unique characteristics of Marvinter, an inclusive transmedia Advent calendar, affected its production and the individual media workers involved in this. In the native transmedia Marvinter project, a radio series and a mobile game were created and released simultaneously. Using ‘partly shared’ resources, the project was developed by two collaborating, non-profit organisations. Each chapter of the digital game had to match the corresponding radio episode. The whole had to be designed to provide a shared cultural experience that included people with hearing or visual impairments. The authors of the present article were part of the game development team and thus directly experienced the complexity of developing a digital game as part of a transmedia project. This article presents the results of a case study with an insider perspective. It is supplemented by semi-structured interviews with key people in the project. The transmedia nature of Marvinter was justified by the need to include people with complementary disabilities. Although sometimes associated with negative connotations of ‘naked commercialisation’ in transmedia contexts, the marketing strategy was here an important element in promoting inclusivity. However, owing to the concurrent work processes, game production became overly complex. </jats:p>",

This work introduces the possibility of building a language of MAR based on the notion of scale, which is common to both media and pattern languages.

    "title": "Book Review: The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power",
    "abstract": "In Internet governance, there is an overarching question that speaks to us all. If we thought the Internet was open and emancipating, then how and why can private companies and governments control and influence the Internet? This broader puzzle runs like a thread through Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. The author nicely ties together these seemingly dispersed instances of closure under the unified and comprehensive framework of surveillance capitalism. Surveillance capitalism is a logic in action that ‘unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data’ (p. 8). Zuboff sets out the argument in three parts: the foundations, the advances, and the outlook. In the first part (Chapters 2–6), the author sets the stage for surveillance capitalism. Zuboff starts by arguing that behavioral data by private companies are used beyond service improvement, to constitute a behavioral surplus (p. 75). Via the analysis of vast amounts of data that companies like Google own, private companies can produce predictions of future behavior. Due to this behavioral surplus, private companies can trade prediction products to customers on new markets in future behavior (p. 96). This is the extraction imperative: economies of scale in the extraction of behavioral surplus (p. 87). This chain of components between behavioral surveillance, prediction products and markets in future behavior converges into surveillance capitalism: ‘a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales’ (‘the definition’). Although this provides a helpful theoretical lens through which one can observe Internet markets, it frequently remains uncertain what (and where) surveillance capitalism actually is. Zuboff mainly conceptualizes surveillance capitalism as a new economic order or a logic in action. However, the author also argues that it is a new actor in history, invented, a new market form, and a logic of capital accumulation. Although not all of these conceptualizations might be mutually exclusive, quite ironically, identifying surveillance capitalism is – in real life and in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism – like nailing jelly to the wall. In the second part (Chapters 7–11), Zuboff takes the argument further by stating that surveillance capitalism is not only a matter of new behavioral future markets but the certainty of those futures. Hence, the author moves from an extraction imperative to the prediction imperative, which engages in the question: ‘what forms of surplus enable the fabrication of prediction products that Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies 2021, Vol. 27(1) 284–288 a The Author(s) 2020",

Throughout this essay, we argue that spoiler avoiders embrace post-network era reception practices but use network era norms to evaluate their own experience and regulate the television conversations around them. We see, however, an erosion of those network era norms in people who either use spoilers to enhance their narrative pleasure or who do not actively police television conversations around them. These findings suggest that television conversation norms and individual evaluations of narrative pleasures are slower to evolve than reception patterns. Our study brings convergence culture questions of narrative pleasure, discursive patterns, active audience behaviors, and contested grounds of power to the surface. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mediatization of tabletop role-playing: The intertwined cases of <i>Critical Role</i> and <i>D&amp;D Beyond</i>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Tabletop role-playing has grown from a niche of analog gaming into a mainstay of popular culture. The original face-to-face way of playing has been complemented by online play using dedicated digital tools, and play itself has become spectator entertainment. In this article, I explore the process of mediatization of tabletop role-playing on the example of Critical Role – the most successful ‘actual play’ show, in which performers broadcast tabletop role-playing to audiences. I highlight the importance of commodification as a force in the process of mediatization, involving licensing, merchandising, and advertising. Empirically, the article is grounded in an analysis of Critical Role’s sponsorships and embodied player practices, focusing on the political-economic aspects of the show. While Critical Role presents a profoundly mediated form of tabletop role-playing, it promotes a traditional face-to-face way of playing using physical accessories both by cast members’ preference of such accessories (except for the digital toolset D&amp;D Beyond) and sponsorships from manufacturers of these products. Mediatization of tabletop role-playing thus happens through an economic-driven process of addition – new mediated options for players with new opportunities for commodification exist alongside analog modes of consumption. As shown on the example of Critical Role, the digital and mediated forms of the analog hobby can be harnessed to promote physical consumerism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through the case of MUBI, this article inquires into the changing audience habits with the proliferation of video-on-demand services and the discourse of control and choice, increased mobility, and democratic access. Drawing on in-depth interviews with subscribers of MUBI Turkey, this article explores the ways the audience relates to the imagined audience that MUBI assumes, promotes, and celebrates as a cultural gatekeeper and artistic patron/expert; and how, in turn, being a MUBI user becomes a sign of cultural taste. This study argues that even though users appreciate MUBI’s limited choice model compared to Netflix, they still experience feelings such as frustration, stress, and inadequacy. These feelings mainly result from MUBI’s artistic authority over them, established through the discourse of expertise/artistic patronage and limited-time model. On the other hand, users do not automatically accept the service’s expertise. Some are more critical of it than other VOD services (such as Netflix) because they consider watching MUBI a form of ‘intellectual labor’. Even though MUBI discursively maintains the long-standing dichotomies of niche-mainstream, arthouse-popular cinema, or high-lowbrow culture, the users experience these dichotomies more complexly according to their multiple subject positions. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ever since their appearance in the early 1990s, hypertext novels were presented as the pinnacle of digital aesthetics and claimed to represent the revolutionary future of literature. However, as a literary phenomenon, hypertext novels have remained marginal. The article presents some scientifically derived explanations as to why hypertext novels do not have a mass audience and why they are likely to remain a marginal contribution in the history of literature. Three explanatory frameworks are provided: (1) how hypertext relates to our cognitive information processing in general; (2) the empirically derived psychological reasons for how we read and enjoy literature in particular; and (3) the likely evolutionary origins of such a predilection for storytelling and literature. It is shown how hypertext theory, by ignoring such knowledge, has yielded misguided statements and uncorroborated claims guided by ideology rather than by scientifically supported knowledge. </jats:p>",

The concept of enriched presence information helps users to harness such complexity by showing which device and modality is currently being preferred by their contacts. Operators can offer enriched presence information by utilizing recently developed converged communication standards like Rich Communication Suite–Enhanced (RCS-E). The present article tests the usefulness of enriched presence features for two prototype applications built upon RCS standards. A quasi-experiment shows that users become more positive about the usefulness of enriched presence information after trying out the two applications. Whilst findings suggest operators should introduce services that offer enriched presence information, our troublesome and lengthy prototyping process indicates that operators will not get the services to the market in time to hold off Internet players offering similar functionality. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Television by the numbers: The challenges of audience measurement in the age of Big Data",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines recent innovations in how television audiences are measured, paying particular attention to the industry's growing efforts to utilize the large bodies of data generated through social media platforms – a paradigm of research known as Big Data. Although Big Data is considered by many in the television industry as a more veracious model of audience research, this essay uses Boyd and Crawford's (2011) `Six Provocations of Big Data' to problematize and interrogate this prevailing industrial consensus. In doing so, this article explores both the affordances and the limitations of this emerging research paradigm – the latter having largely been ignored by those in the industry – and considers the consequences of these developments for the production culture of television more broadly. Although the full impact of the television industry's adoption of Big Data remains unclear, this article traces some preliminary connections between the introduction of these new measurement practices and the production culture of contemporary television. First, I demonstrate how the design of Big Data privileges real-time analysis, which, in turn, encourages increased investment in ‘live’ and/or ‘event’ television. Second, I argue that despite its potential to produce real-time insights, the scale of Big Data actually limits its utility in the context of the creative industries. Third, building on this discussion of the debatable value and applicability of Big Data, I describe how the introduction of social media metrics is further contributing to a ‘data divide’ in which access to these new information data sets is highly uneven, generally favouring institutions over individuals. Taken together, these three different but overlapping developments provide evidence that the introduction of Big Data is already having a notable effect on the television industry in a number of interesting and unexpected ways. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an effort to further understand the nature of the productive consumption of media fans in an era of digital connectivity, this article expands on Lévy’s (1997) concept of the knowledge community as it applies to fans of the digital-game series Fallout. Lévy proposed that the age of digital-connectivity would usher in knowledge communities where participation was voluntary, aggregate, and democratic. I argue that Baym’s (2000) interpretive and informative practices, which serve as the lynchpins of fan discourse, may be understood as the lynchpins of the knowledge community as well. Further, here interpretive and informative practices are not only used to build community and negotiate values, but also to define status and position within the contested Fallout knowledge community. By testing the knowledge community against such an environment, and integrating it into previous research on the role of fan labor in an era where producers are increasingly interested in that labor, this article proposes an understanding of the concept that may well add nuance and context beyond the theory’s utopian roots. </jats:p>",

Digital and social media text is conversational text that fulfills the phatic needs of typical social interaction: ‘keeping in touch’ does not in any way constitute a cultural regression but represents the fundamental ground of human cognition, which is inescapably both social and technologically dependent. An analysis of examples from the popular microblogging service Twitter serves to illustrate the gestural functions of digital media text, including the enactment of mediated social ‘spaces’. The closing section explores the theoretical implications for identity and agency of connecting embodied nonverbal communication to digital media communication that is all too often erroneously understood to be or implicitly approached as ‘disembodied’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Belfast Exposed is a small group of amateur photographers from all parts of the City, the vast majority unemployed’ (O’Reilly, 1985). ‘Belfast Exposed is Northern Ireland’s principal gallery of contemporary photography, commissioning, publishing and showing work by artists and photographers from Northern Ireland and across the world’ (Belfast Exposed, 2013). In 2013, Belfast Exposed celebrated its 30th anniversary. As these quotes indicate, in this amount of time the ethos and focus of the organization has shifted considerably, from originating as a grass-roots, community-based photography initiative to becoming a significant international photographic art gallery. A key aspect of the change in its raison d’être was the gallery’s move from analogue to digital media. By 2005, over 3000 images from the analogue archive were digitized, with the aim of opening the archive to wider audiences, and by 2007 the gallery had launched two digital libraries, one offline and one online. This article seeks to explore the implications of this process of change for both the organization and its analogue and digital photographic archives, combining archival theory with psychoanalytic social theory. Interviews with staff members, content analysis of the digital libraries and a first-hand engagement with the process of re-housing the analogue archive have assisted the research process. Furthermore, several works of art based on the archive, and commissioned by Belfast Exposed in the last decade, have been analysed as examples of new modes of engagement with archive material. Acknowledging the political agendas and policy-making context to which both the organization and the archive are impacted by, a major trend is identified, that is, new cultural meanings of the post-peace process have replaced old interpretations influenced by artists’ responses to the archive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the active role of image collections in supporting platforms and their operations. Large image collections are increasingly present on media, scientific and other platforms. A case study of Facebook’s predictive modelling of satellite images of human settlement exemplifies how image collections are changing. The treatment of images in a predictive model – a deep neural network – constructs a condensed indexical field, a field that allows the platform to generate referential statements about the world. Under platform conditions, image collections function less as archives or records and more as densely woven indexical fields that orient, position and embed the platform. In describing the transformation of image collections, the paper points to important changes in how platforms use images to position themselves in the world. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Virtual reality (VR) immerses users in others’ lives, creating empathy and understanding long after the VR scenario has finished. As VR technology has matured, VR scenarios have begun to be used in complex real-world areas such as education, health and organisational change. These scenarios can be of variable technical quality, with limited interactive capacity, unrealistic environments and clunky or absent avatars. In this study, three scenarios related to gender inequality training were constructed with glitches in the core immersive qualities of presence, interactivity and plausibility in order to understand their effect on the immersive experience. Using a multi-step in-depth series of qualitative interviews to examine the whole immersive process, the results show that immersion is not compromised but changed by glitches. Limited interactivity led to uncomfortable interactions that allowed participants to process difficult emotions; implausible situations surfaced buried norms and prejudices; and avatar variation gave rise to a sense presence that also included distance, which gave the user opportunities for critical reflection. These results point towards immersion as a robust and richly textured concept, while interactivity, plausibility and presence can best be understood as dimensions rather than goals. Totally seamless and immersive experiences may not only be utopian but also unnecessary. The glitches in low-end productions can produce powerful communication without expensive technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores closed-circuit television (CCTV) and its ‘bright promise stage’, as it was contemplated, marketed, and implemented as a low-cost classroom tool. After the Federal Communications Commission issued the 1952 Sixth Report and Order, many schools and communities sought to bring educational television to the classroom. However, this model was financially out of reach for most. CCTV was a more affordable version of educational television that could cater to specific classroom needs and allow schools to create their own in-house network. CCTV represents just one of many new technologies that have been promoted as ideal for classroom instruction over the last century. Using articles and advertisements from popular press magazines, educational journals, books, and archival materials, this article seeks to illuminate the ‘social practices and conflicts’ that contributed to the conversations around CCTV’s classroom utility. It concludes by connecting CCTV’s promotion in the 1950s to more recent new media technologies. </jats:p>",

Gaming paratexts are accessible communication and media artifacts that influence what new players learn about games as cultural and ludic texts. In this work we examine ‘official' and ‘unofficial' gaming paratexts about drow, D&amp;D’s dark elves. We highlight authorship, circulation, and accessibility as key impact factors, then identify common themes such as insider knowledge, transmission of expertise, and knowledge acquisition. This analysis reveals how – beyond information about the game itself – gaming paratexts can lead players to receive biased or incomplete impressions of issues with D&amp;D, such as racism within the game system. We find that this specific form of online discourse about TTRPGs influences popular conceptions about D&amp;D and often parallels forms of fannish practise through its affective connections, citational politics, and modal variety. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Netflix has significantly reshaped the global production, distribution, and consumption of audiovisual content. While Netflix claims its algorithm-driven platform provides superior services and limitless choices, it raises concerns about human agency, autonomy, and data justice. These concerns are especially pressing in the Global South, where predatory data extraction practices are prevalent. Research on this issue faces challenges, including a dichotomy between algorithmic power and human agency, limited exploration of user perspectives, and a lack of studies in non-Western contexts. This paper addresses these gaps using a socio-constructivist lens, centering users’ experiences in understanding algorithms as sociotechnical systems. Through reflexive in-depth interviews, it examines Netflix users in Egypt, UAE, Morocco, and Jordan. Drawing on Domestication Theory and a relational view of agency, it explores how users engage with, interpret, and resist algorithmic impacts. The paper argues that while users interact with these systems, their engagement is shaped by asymmetrical power, where algorithms control the parameters of user agency. It highlights the often-overlooked relational nature of agency, co-constructed through everyday interactions with these systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the use of digital media by irregular migrants in their preparation to cross the Moroccan–Spanish border. Based on long-term exploratory research that includes active participation and in-depth interviews, we analyse the videos produced by sub-Saharan young males while they live in the settlements near Ceuta. By focusing on processes of self-representation and border crossing, we highlight the role of digital media as it embodies a liminal physical experience against the violence applied by the Moroccan border security forces and the surveillance systems implemented by the Spanish Guardia Civil. Departing from recent contributions to digital migration studies, this article develops the concept of digital placemaking as an assemblage of discourses and spatial practices that serve opposite interests and generate an extremely violent confrontation through the use and control of borderspace. Therefore, we claim that the migrants’ placemaking strategies can be understood as mobile counter-discourses against border control. In this sense, the physical and digital activities of the migrants in the settlements are examples of what we call tactical placemaking, insofar as they become ways to stay alive and link their persons and futures to discussions about access to place and its consequences. To examine the migrants’ spatial tactics and their social meaning, first we will offer a brief infrastructural and historiographical account of the Moroccan–Spanish border in Ceuta. Second, we will explain our methodological perspective to shed light on the modes that placemaking experiences are created and circulated among migrants during and after their stay at the settlements. Finally, we will study the self-recordings shot in the clandestine camps of the forest in Fnideq and the border of Ceuta and consider how these videos materialize legal, cultural and physical imaginaries on migration while they simultaneously disrupt official attempts at controlling placemaking. </jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to delve into how the graphical user interface (GUI) integrates into contemporary audiovisual discourse, focusing on its potential as a spatial metaphor. To that end, a theoretical framework is built on the concept of space as a tool and its instrumentalization in the GUI throughout the years, with a view to design a taxonomy in relation to the different ways in which the GUI integrates into digital image composition. The article concludes that the ability to operate in the virtual and physical space, moving between the logic of the tool and its potential as spatial metaphor, provides the GUI with the necessary specificity to be considered a key cultural element for analysing new media’s visual identity. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Negative Reinvention of Cinema",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Hollywood has recently produced a cycle of films that take an extremely critical view of digital media. This essay tries to unpack the logic of cinematic cyberphobia in an era in which the film industry has consistently appropriated digital technologies for both production and promotional purposes. Cyberphobic films rehearse cultural myths that interactive media are intrusive and disruptive, thus providing an outlet for dissent (not to mention paranoia) regarding the institutionalisation of new media. However, cyberphobia can also be understood as a defence mechanism against the challenge to cinema's individuating spectator address that interactive media represent. The article reads films from The Lawnmower Man (1992) to The Truman Show (1998) as allegories of contemporary Hollywood's dialectical struggle to define itself: cyberphobia denies cinema's contamination by interactive technologies, while its engagement with digital myths displays interactive media's fading chance to engender alternative media publics, and recalls cinema's own early history as a distracted, emphatically public experience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 2000s, so-called cloud computing infrastructures have had a profound impact on the capitalist relationship among labor, software, and organizations. This infrastructuring did not only affect the outsourcing of servers and databases but extends to the on-demand delivery of middleware and operating systems through so-called platforms-as-a-service (PaaS). As a result, the capitalist relationship between labor, organization, power, and software has shifted – both regarding the ways in which software development is organized and the ways in which work processes are organized through software. Such a shift is particularly evident in the development and application of so-called customer relationship management (CRM) software, which is used to plan and record sales and work processes. No longer limited to performance measurement and automated management within sales processes, the widely used Salesforce CRM software is leveraged to document and assess the work performance of employees meticulously, among other applications. To demonstrate how PaaS became central organizational media by reformatting labor and power asymmetries, the paper provides a critical analysis of the CRM software of Salesforce and the various actors and interfaces entangled with its PaaS. Thereby, the paper develops a critical media theoretical framework to analyze how the political economy of adapting PaaS is entangled with power dependencies between organizations and the labor of coding and implementing. Drawing on a platform historiographical analysis of Salesforce developer interfaces, the paper shows how organizational hierarchies and asymmetries manifest in the work of implementing specific sets of operational rules in software development (the work of formatting) and the platform capitalist standardization of work coordination in existing organizations (the formatting of work). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Amid growing calls for greater collaboration between journalism and computer programming, this article examines a salient case study that reveals processes of communication, exchange, and work production at the intersection of these social and occupational worlds. We focus on a key stage of the Knight-Mozilla News Technology partnership – namely, an online ‘Learning Lab’ through which 60 individuals sought to coordinate around a shared interest in the innovation of journalism through open-source software. Drawing on the science and technology studies concepts of trading zones and boundary objects, we explore how distinct understandings about news and technology converged, diverged, and ultimately blended around three thematic ambitions: making news more process-oriented, participatory, and socially curated. This window onto boundary negotiations in journalism provides a glimpse into the future development of news and its norms and values, as programmers and their ethics assume a greater role in the journalistic field – in the very heart of some of its leading institutions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Deepfaking Keanu: YouTube deepfakes, platform visual effects, and the complexity of reception",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> On July 14, 2019, a 3-minute 36-second video titled “Keanu Reeves Stops A ROBBERY!” was released on YouTube visual effects (VFX) channel, Corridor. The video’s click-bait title ensured it was quickly shared by users across platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Comments on the video suggest that the vast majority of viewers categorised it as fiction. What seemed less universally recognised, though, was that the performer in the clip was not Keanu Reeves himself. It was voice actor and stuntman Reuben Langdon, and his face was digitally replaced with that of Reeves, through the use of an AI generated deepfake, an open access application, Faceswap, and compositing in Adobe After Effects. This article uses Corridor’s deepfake Keanu video (hereafter shorted to CDFK) as a case study which allows the fleshing out of an, as yet, under-researched area of deepfakes: the role of framing contexts in shaping how viewers evaluate, categorise, make sense of and discuss these images. This research draws on visual effects scholarship, celebrity studies, cognitive film studies, social media theory, digital rhetoric, and discourse analysis. It is intended to serve as a starting point of a larger study that will eventually map types of online manipulated media creation on a continuum from the professional to the vernacular, across different platforms, and attending to their aesthetic, ethical, cultural and reception dimensions. The focus on context (platform, creator channel, and comments) also reveals the emergence of an industrial and aesthetic category of visual effects, which I call here “platform VFX,” a key term that provides us with more nuanced frames for illuminating and analysing a range of manipulated media practices as VFX software becomes ever more accessible and lends itself to more vernacular uses, such as we see with various face swap apps. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Hackathons are techno-creative events during which participants get together in a physical location. They may be hosted by civic communities, corporations or public institutions. Working individually or in teams, usually for several days, participants develop projects such as hardware or software prototypes. Based on a digital ethnography of two events in the Netherlands and Denmark, this article investigates project development practices at hackathons. In particular, it analyses how participants organized their project work and which technologies were used in support of their creative endeavours. Hackathons are increasingly competitive rather than collaborative events, involving time pressure, inducements such as prizes, and requiring efficient skills utilization. I argue that this facilitates the following tendencies: Firstly, strategic effort is put into final presentations. Projects need to be convincingly presented, and persuasively pitching an idea becomes crucial. Secondly, there is only limited time for personal learning, since participants’ existing skills need to be efficiently applied if a team wants to stay competitive. This encourages division of labour within groups: a tendency which seems especially problematic given that IT skills biases are often expressed in terms of gender. Thirdly, participants are more inclined to use technologies that are proprietary but appear ‘open enough’. In light of this observation and by drawing on the concept of technology as resource and opportunity, I discuss the techno-political implications of utilized technologies. With this analysis, I aim at contributing to the critical debate on hackathons as productive but likewise ideologically significant fields of ‘hacking cultures’. </jats:p>",

This article presents findings from a study on digital platforms’ higher threshold for protecting public figures in contrast to everyday users. Presenting a summary of extant literature on the experience, impact and harms of online abuse of public figures, we analyse 31 platform terms of service and related policies to understand the extent to which platforms openly differentiate between public figures and other users. We focus on platforms’ use of ‘newsworthiness’ and ‘public interest’ to justify the differential threshold. Using a cultural-informed approach, we analyse platforms’ reliance on ‘newsworthiness’ and ‘public interest’ justifications to argue that these justifications are utilised without regard for the histories, risk assessment, ethics and labour-intensive processes in which the concepts of newsworthiness and public interest became familiar among more traditional media forms such as news organisations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the widespread adoption of smartphones, mobile users today have an increasing number of ways to communicate about their location; the practice of ‘checking in’, thereby broadcasting one’s location to one’s network of friends on Facebook, is one such way. Previous research has indicated that the social sharing of location information in mobile social media may be associated with significant consequences, for instance, in the areas of coordination, self-presentation, network presence and social capital. An interview study conducted with 31 ‘ordinary’ young Danish smartphone and Facebook users, however, indicates that this specific use of location sharing, despite being well-known and despite the potential of the technology indicated by previous research, has come to play a relatively minor role in their everyday lives. Drawing on the domestication approach, this article examines the meaning making associated with the use and particularly the reluctance towards use of the technology and discusses the discrepancy between the existing literature and limited use found in the present study. </jats:p>",

I explain web APIs before showing how they relate to media studies through the TV show Psych’s forays into designing social media experiences. Additionally, I will explain how web API-connected digital environments are used to facilitate what Tiziana Terranova calls soft control as web APIs embody Web 2.0 ideologies that celebrate information sharing between businesses that track audience attention. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As social platforms become essential in promoting songs, many artists create an official channel on YouTube and encourage their fans’ engagements. However, little is known about the effectiveness of official videos in generating fans’ media engagements. We conduct two empirical studies to investigate the relationship between official video attributes, media engagements and channel subscribers. First, we propose a model to explain how music video attributes facilitate the relative social media engagements of a video. Second, we test whether three types of social engagements are associated with an increase in official channel subscribers. To do so, we collect social media engagement data for the 2896 music videos uploaded between May 2016 and April 2019 by 105 artists who own their YouTube official artist channels. The empirical evidence shows that the official videos incorporating visual, performance and storytelling components can generate more positive engagement from the viewers, while audio-only videos exhibit lower overall engagement intensity. Furthermore, we find that active media engagement, such as leaving ‘comments’, contributes to the increase in channel subscribers beyond the effect of the number of registered videos. Our results suggest that highly involved music fans may show the active types of social engagements, such as leaving a comment on live and follow-up videos. In practice, our findings imply that YouTube creators need to incorporate visual-focused platform characteristics to stimulate in-depth social engagement. </jats:p>",

In response, these practitioners operating in converged newsrooms shifted their on-the-job routines and roles to align with the increasing centrality of machines in journalistic production. Using an actor-network approach, this research integrates in-depth interviews to explore how American newsroom librarians interface with machines in acting as guardians of institutional knowledge within news organizations. Examining the modern duties of newsroom librarians can provide broader context for the next generation of industry automation in journalistic practice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "However, as we debate the nature of ’interactivity’ we frequently forget the implications of presenting interactive works in a traditional exhibition or art gallery context. Although the degree and type of interactivity varies from artwork to artwork, it’s possible to argue that the quality of the experience of any kind of interactive artwork even with those offering only a very limited level of interactivity ultimately rests with the user’s willingness and ability to fully engage with the work. This might sound obvious but it is, I think, a point frequently overlooked. And I want to suggest that if we are to maximise the quality of that experience we have to address the implications of staging interactive art in a traditional exhibition or art gallery context.",

Rooted on the crossroads of UGC and Witnessing studies, this article provides a definition and a proposition of operationalization of tUGC in a case analysis, using two protests against former Brazilian president Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 as case of study. Results suggest three main patterns of tUGC production, named as political, journalistic and expressive. Quantitative analysis points to a high frequency of production but to low levels of diffusion of tUGC overall in the context of the analysed case. Finally, results suggest external factors seem to have effect on general patterns of tUGC production and circulation. Discussion and further developments are offered. </jats:p>",

In recent years, a few Korean female digital creators have become visible by producing and sharing gender-bound football media content on YouTube. Based on a critical discourse analysis involving the channels of four female Korean chuktubers, I found that this user-generated media platform offers these female digital creators the opportunity to capitalize on their unpopular and unconventional characteristics and narratives, allowing them to transform their creative practices into collective resistance against gender norms and hierarchies in the football media industry. However, YouTube also limits these chuktubers’ creative possibilities to the extent that it does not fundamentally intervene in the existing gender architecture within society. This study concludes that user-generated media platforms invigorate the social dynamics of creative practices while simultaneously controlling the social potential of creative imagination. </jats:p>",

This study mainly explores participants’ behaviors, attitudes, and engagement in-game grounded on an analysis framework that consists of eight constructs in three consequent stages. Further, while investigating how game mechanics and narrative affect their player experience, we also question whether there is a possibility for a queer-play.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, the term ‘conspiracy theory’ became a buzzword in the news media, public communication and everyday discussions. The pandemic also demonstrated that conspiratorial narratives disseminated online are not benign, obscure and eventually harmless ideas, but can mislead policy making, hinder crisis relief and public health efforts, or undermine trust in institutions and science. Factors contributing to the prevalence of conspiracy theories are complex and include psychological as well as socio-political factors. This special issue focuses specifically on the role of digital media and how they shape the dissemination and mitigation of, as well as research on, conspiracy theories.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Plague Inc. is an enduringly popular mobile video game in which players create diseases and attempt to eradicate humanity; it has been downloaded more than 60 million times and been met with largely positive critical reception, with many reviews praising the game as a ‘realistic outbreak simulator’. This article explores Plague Inc. as both an artifact, and productive, of ‘pandemic culture’, a social imaginary that describes how the threat of pandemic increasingly shapes our day-to-day life. Ludic and narrative elements of the game were identified and selected for analysis, along with paratexts surrounding the game. Three aspects of Plague Inc. were used to structure the analysis: its politics of global scale, its viral realism, and its visual culture of contagion. The article examines how the ways in which Plague Inc. articulates ideas about pandemic may not only explain the game’s immense success but also provide insights into public perceptions and popular discourses about disease threats. The article argues that the game is an incomplete text that depends on preexisting familiarity with other disease media. It concludes that the popularity and longevity of Plague Inc., as well as its broader social relevance, can be explained by placing it within the context of public anxieties about vulnerability to infectious diseases. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on ethnographic research among former Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front combatants, militia, and supporters, this article addresses the complex ways in which the incorporation of cell phones among rural populations in northern Morazán contributes to the reconfiguration of class in postwar El Salvador. Countering the dominant paradigm of the so-called digital divide as the new incarnation of the promise of development for the Third World, I propose that these societies are experiencing a process of subordinated digitization. Drawing on the Marxist analysis of the commodity form, I suggest that cell phone incorporation in the Latin American Third World is subordinated to the capitalistic logic of profit seeking. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Search engines play an important role in the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, accentuating the power of global platform companies such as Google to contribute to the digital (information) divide by providing search results of lesser quality in certain countries. We investigated this phenomenon by asking what kind of results users see when they search for information on eleven popular conspiracy theories (CTs) via Google. We analysed links from Google search results ( N = 1259) in 12 Western and non-Western countries and 10 languages. Overall, users are more likely to encounter neutral or debunking content when using Google to search for prominent CTs. However, for some CTs, strong country differences in the quality of search results emerge, showing clear correlations between categorical inequalities and unequal access to reliable information. In countries where journalists enjoy less freedom, people enjoy fewer democratic rights and are less able to rely on social elites, Google also provides less enlightening content on CTs than in developed and prosperous democracies. The countries thus disadvantaged are precisely those countries where there is a high propensity to believe in CTs according to comparative survey research. However, in countries where a global language is spoken, for example, English or Portuguese, there is no correlation between structural, country-specific factors and the quality of search results. In this sense, structurally disadvantaged countries seem to benefit from belonging to a larger language community. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital marketplaces are standard and pervasive sites to trade and exchange material consumer goods worldwide. Yet the media characteristics of different, situated marketplaces have received relatively sporadic attention from the field of media and communication studies, despite the otherwise prominent disciplinary interest in digital technologies, platforms and processes of mediatisation. This paper coalesces perspectives from social, geography and retail studies with mediatisation approaches to extend a theorisation of digital marketplaces as ‘mediatised marketplaces’, focusing on the discussion of interactions between digital media and place involved in the distribution of material goods. We use illustrative examples of two different local marketplaces – the Swedish Tradera and Facebook Marketplace – to demonstrate how mediatised marketplaces challenge a range of distinctions, including between offline and online, material and immaterial, local and global. Mediatised marketplaces such as Tradera and Facebook Marketplace are grounded in place and local market identities, even as they operate on or are owned by global platforms; they rely on communicative as much as logistical functionalities of media; and are transformative of media and consumption practices. The paper contributes to studies of mediatisation and its impacts. </jats:p>",

It discusses sound space and perception through a brief study of technologies such as stereo sound, Dolby SR (Spectral Recordings) and digital sound. It examines the ways in which the development and introduction of these technological advances in film sound recording, mixing and cinema reproduction have affected the role of sound in film diegesis. 'Open' and 'compact' sound spaces are explored in relation both to these technologies and to the way in which film spectators respond to the events on the screen. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media convergence has afforded users an increasing amount of options regarding the media they consume, available at the click of a button. This has led some to clamor about the potential for media to bridge previously existing inequalities and decrease social stratification not just in media use, but in other realms of society as well. Skeptics have argued that while the convergence of media has given users more options in their own media repertoire, social stratification persists. Moreover, if media do increase a user’s possibilities to participate in other realms of society, the persisting stratification of media use risks enacting a Matthew effect whereby the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Using data from the Flemish participation survey, this article seeks to contribute to this discussion by exploring Flemish media use by constructing media repertoires using latent class analysis and exploring their sociodemographic profiles. Following this analysis, we compare the cultural participation patterns of the six Flemish media repertoires using negative binomial regression analysis. We find that social stratification of media use persists in Flanders, with broad and ‘highbrow’ repertoires predominantly restricted to higher status groups. Moreover, we find a structural homology between the structure of media repertoires and cultural participation, whereby broad repertoires exhibit a similar openness to cultural practices, and repertoires tailored to highbrow media exhibit a similar preference for highbrow cultural activities. As a result, we find that social stratification persists in media use and cultural participation but argues that media repertoires offer a potential entrypoint. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Gazing or glancing? Mapping student engagement when film studies moves online",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents the findings of a study undertaken by a team of three film studies teacher-researchers working with undergraduate students in a course titled ‘Histories of Film Theory’. In the context of the transition from face-to-face to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors observed that students’ approaches to understanding relevant film theories became increasingly inflected by their experiences of contrasting methods of course delivery, such as that between the cinema theatre or home viewing environment. To investigate this effect, the authors conducted a study of student experience across the 2020 and 2021 cohorts; the purpose was to understand how the shift to online learning shaped students’ engagement with set film texts, by analysing the behaviour exhibited when accessing film texts remotely. The study is grounded in the observation that there is an existing body of film theory on screen spectatorship that has potential significance to a scholarly understanding of the pedagogical complexity of online learning and multimodal literacies. This scholarship ranges from analyses of ‘traditional’ reception environments (Baudry 1974), to accounts of the differentiation in modes of attention introduced by new media (Ellis 1992, Cavell 1982), to analyses of the multiplying second screen practices of the digital era (Casetti 2011). A governing distinction highlighted in the results is between ‘gazing’, the mode of spectatorship associated with the traditional cinema experience, and ‘glancing’, the mode associated with home viewing and second screen use. Were the students in the course gazing or glancing, and how did this affect their encounters with films and characterize their remote learning experience more broadly? In asking these questions, the article demonstrates how the intellectual resources of film studies might be applied to contemporary digital pedagogy scholarship to reveal a complex scenario in which remote learning practices both hinder and enhance learning experiences, sometimes simultaneously. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Google data breach (leading to fines from the European Union (EU) and France in 2017 and 2019, respectively) and Cambridge Analytica Facebook data harvest in 2016 (pp. 80–81) are highlighted. The penultimate chapter dwells on ‘The Case of Social Media’ and privacy issues. Examples of Facebook’s role to influence the political behaviour of Americans during the 2010 midterm and 2016 general elections are discussed (p. 90). This has led to the delete Facebook movement and the rise of non-users (pp. 91–93). The chapter also discusses how people assert their authority over social media. On one hand, some interviewees restricted social media by either time spent or the number of platforms to be on. This is in a bid to balance using social media. On the other hand, non-users saw social media as a platform for a superficial relationship and expressed concerns about the safety of their personal information. The final chapter discusses the ‘Status of Opting Out’ from digital technologies. As a class status, some people decide to opt out of digital media. This group of people can afford to do so because they have people to use such technologies on their behalf. This well-structured book provides insight into how Americans make conscious efforts to control their use of digital media (p. 114). In spite of few cases of misspellings, Brennen achieves her aim of providing an understanding of specific reasons why some people choose not to engage with digital technologies and how others make decisions on which technologies to use (p. 3). Two missing elements in the whole discourse are the author’s projection for the opting out movement and privacy concerns. To what extent can the opting out movement be successful in opposing digital technologies in this digitized era? How can legislations by national governments and/or supranational organizations ensure privacy concerns are solved? Generally, the message throughout the book rehashes the power of a potential user of digital technologies to determine how, when, why and what they use it for. Although this book is primarily centred within a US context, Brennen draws on relevant non-US examples – Singapore, England (p. 14); Australia, Tanzania (p. 21) and EU, France (p. 80). Based on these examples, the book is a relevant material for anyone interested in new technologies, digital media researchers and graduate students.",

    "title": "Humanising gaming? The politics of posthuman agency in autobiographical videogames",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> For many commentators autobiographical videogames represent a step towards a more human vision of digital play, promising to transform a medium still widely associated with mindless and dehumanising virtual violence into a vector for self-expression, empathy and understanding. Viewed through the lens of life-writing theory, however, the situation looks somewhat different. As scholars in this fieldhave shown, works of auto/biography and life-writing have been instrumental in propagating ideas about agency, politics and the human that remain both pervasive and pernicious. Their work suggests that if we are to talk about ‘humanising’ videogames we must first address how understandings of the human are constituted and who they have historically excluded. Here developments in life-writing theory align with recent scholarship on how videogames undercut the liberal humanist conception of the autonomous agential subject by implicating players in complex assemblages of human and non-human actors. This work holds out another way of reading the encounter between gaming and auto/biography: as a catalyst for new forms of posthumanist life-writing, in which the autobiographical mode co-exists with what this article dubs the ludobiographical mode. If games are autobiographical to the extent that they involve creators giving an account of episodes from their own life, they are ludobiographical to the extent that they foreground the challenges videogames pose to humanism’s vision of autonomous individuals in possession of their own bodies, stories and identities. This idea is elaborated through an analysis of That Dragon, Cancer ( Numinous Games, 2016 ). Created by Ryan and Amy Green, the game documents the death of their developmentally disabled son Joel and their consequent crisis of faith. Controversial and widely discussed, it constitutes a rich case study in how autobiographical videogames raise irreducibly political questions about agency, identity and the (post)human. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores processes of co-creation in the media industry, particularly in the context of magazine media brands. We discuss the content and practices of creative collaboration between editorial teams and online audience communities. Based on two empirical case studies using analytical interviews and focus group discussions, we introduce a new model and framework for analysing co-creative processes. The model of co-creative collaboration is focused on three areas of media work: production, marketing and development. We conclude that co-creative processes between editorial teams and audience communities have a definite impact on the future of media work and media management. Importantly, the work of editorial teams is transformed from content production through creating platform concepts to coordinating, managing and nurturing audience communities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "more engaging and accessible. In this regard, it should mark an important turning point in the scholarly understanding of contemporary film viewing. In addition, each of the case study chapters provide valuable insights into the interplay between the exhibition and reception of contemporary Hollywood cinema. That said, for this reviewer at least, the choice of case studies, while fascinating, is a little frustrating and more seriously, methodologically somewhat inconsistent. Of course, each chapter is concerned either with a different feature of contemporary home exhibition or with different film viewing practices and this only amplifies the sense of inconsistency and unevenness in its methodology. A mix-bag of methods is deployed to garner evidence and it is a major weakness of this book that more audience research was not carried out. Chapter one, for example, examines cinephilia without interviewing cinephiles. This is a real missed opportunity, given the ease with which one can find such self-identified groups on the internet. Chapter two would certainly have benefited from interviews or focus groups with AMC’s viewers. Klinger’s conception of the Fortress of Solitude, introduced early on and returned to in her conclusion, seems at best unnecessary and at worst somewhat overstated and pretentious. This conception is meant to help the reader better understand the ‘ambiguities between public and private that characterize the home as an arena of media consumption’. For Klinger, the Fortress of Solitude describes how the home as site of media consumption is on the one hand perceived as a refuge for viewers ‘increasingly armoured by technology’ who control ‘the ebb and flow of media’ (p. 9). On the other hand, this Fortress is also connected to the world outside, ‘linked to an arsenal of goods produced by social, industrial, and economic forces’ (ibid). There seems little point in using this conception, since Klinger’s work would be sufficiently clear – if not clearer – without it. In spite of the weaknesses discussed, Klinger’s book is to be commended for its scope and for its attempt to underline the importance of home exhibition. It will be of use to students and scholars of film, media, cultural and audience studies. It also points the way to some very fruitful areas for the future study of home viewing cultures and contemporary Hollywood cinema.",

    "title": "Finding the future in digitally mediated ruin: #nostalgiacores and the algorithmic culture of digital platforms",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The #nostalgiacores are a series of interrelated hashtags on Instagram and TikTok where users recirculate content from the digital and consumer cultures of the 1990s and 2000s – childhood play centres, dead malls, long-gone toys, and superseded game consoles and phones. In this article, we explore these digital cultures using a critical platform studies approach that involves a combination of network analysis and close textual analysis augmented with purpose-built machine vision tools. We scrape a collection of 359,150 images from Instagram that used one or more of 30 ‘-cores’ hashtags (such as #y2kcore, #webcore and #childhoodcore) that we chose following a period of immersive qualitative investigation of #nostalgiacore scenes on Instagram during 2021 and 2022. 10,000 Instagram images were then randomly selected and processed using a purpose-built unsupervised machine vision model that clusters images together based on their similarities. This research is part of a multi-year project where we develop hybrid digital methods for critically simulating and exploring the interplay between our image-making practices and the algorithmic systems that cluster and curate them. By combining computational approaches with critical platform and cultural studies approaches we speculatively explore both practices of curation and their interplay with the algorithmic classification and recommendation models of digital platforms. Our platform-oriented mode of textual analysis helps us to explore how our digital cultures are both symbolically and technically nostalgic. Instagram users in the #nostalgiacore scene recirculate images from the past as part of practices of critically reflecting on digital platforms and consumer cultures. At the same time those images are recuperated as archives used to train the algorithmic models that optimise attention on digital media platforms like Instagram. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Multichannel networks (MCNs) are intermediary companies that sell advertising, cross-promote affiliated YouTube channels, and develop video brands. They have often been criticized as driving YouTube’s commercialization, a seemingly recent phenomenon that sees hithertho informal practices of video making and sharing being increasingly formalized. This article challenges such beliefs about YouTube’s sudden makeover, based on archival evidence that allows to reconstruct YouTube’s long commercial history and on fresh field study data relating to one specific MCN and its content providers. Debunking the myth of ‘cocreation’, the article uses simple analogies – market, infrastructure, and franchise – to describe how MCNs contribute to establish asymmetrical relations between users and emergent industry systems online. It demonstrates how MCNs since 2006 have streamlined and standardized production inputs, reorganized cost per mille–based ad sales, and redefined the value of video in line with a more general financialization of media markets. The methodological framework for this empirical inquiry into YouTube’s first decade is based on economic sociology and infrastructure studies, and the argument itself framed by critical research on ‘connected viewing’, a larger trend across the media industries to integrate digital technology and socially networked communication with traditional screen media practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Released in late 2015 for the Wii U console, Super Mario Maker (SMM) is an extension of Nintendo’s two-dimensional (2-D) ‘Super Mario’ series that offers the ability to create new stages using a suite of level design tools. However, despite initial appearances, I argue that SMM is not a Super Mario level maker, per se. The game creates a complex web of relations between professional and amateur design that simultaneously venerates Nintendo’s designers and provides a platform for the creation of designs informed by an ethos standing in opposition to the principles it espouses. On one hand, appropriating the products and modalities of ROM hacking allows Nintendo to demonstrate its awareness of its games as they are played and played with while simultaneously neutralizing the practice of ROM hacking which it codifies as an ‘illegal’ act of software piracy. Most interestingly, however, is how Nintendo balances the celebration and reinforcement of its core design principles of player advocacy, inclusivity and accessibility alongside the altogether more ruthless, even openly hostile, designs evident in the genre of ROM hacks known as ‘Kaizo’ designs. That Nintendo explicitly showcases such levels in its promotional materials for SMM seems, prima facie, utterly at odds with its game design principles and the celebratory nature of the SMM package. However, following Wilson and Sicart’s (2010) work on ‘Abusive Game Design’, I suggest that SMM operates as a ‘dialogical’ platform. By foregrounding the level creators’ identities and their status as amateur designers, SMM allows and encourages the production of ‘unfair’ level designs, while simultaneously sanctifying Nintendo’s authorial principles and the underlying player-centric design ethos of the Super Mario canon. As such, in addition to operating as a totemic object celebrating Super Mario’s 30-year anniversary, SMM can be read as part of Nintendo’s project to reclaim Mario as an object of design. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The stories that museum objects convey change on social media. This narrative shift is analyzed through the development of social media methods that track the dissemination of the Viking helmet from the Swedish History Museum to personalized YouTube search engine result pages (SERPs). Social media methods are used to compare the narratives and meanings produced on YouTube SERPs with the narratives and meanings sanctioned by the Swedish History Museum. The hermeneutic process at the core of the methodological approach reveals how personalization algorithms targeting user identities through IP addresses influence the meanings of objects, which are mediated and commercialized via social media SERPs. This research demonstrates that personalized search engine result pages have an algorithmic impact on the narratives of objects that counters the social justice goals integral to contemporary museum practices. The meaning curation of museum objects is not customized to individual preferences and identities. Museums advance selected interpretations of objects to endorse a variety of vantage points so that the fixity of identity categories can be questioned. </jats:p>",

At the same time, the remediations of TV are at the core of broader discussions on media change, particularly since the popularization of media consumption through the Internet. TV retains a position of centrality for understanding what it means to live in a connected environment. This article contributes to this debate through the analysis of the co-viewing practices within the specific context of Brazil’s most popular cultural product, the telenovela. After an overview of the key themes and scope of the research, we will situate the practices of co-viewing in the context of some of the key issues regarding connected viewing. We will deal with the particularities of the Brazilian telenovela as a cultural product and finally we will outline our empirical research on co-viewing practices in unofficial Facebook groups surrounding the controversial prime time telenovela ‘Babilônia’. </jats:p>",

Building upon the notion that the specific power of the movement was exercised via a situated understanding of representation, this essay investigates how a digitally mediated sensibility made the broader critiques at the core of the Occupy movement not only intelligible to those inside and outside the movement but also offered a mode of subject constitution that pushed against liberal notions of political subjectivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In July 2015, a crowdfunding campaign launched to revive the notoriously unprofitable video game series Shenmue closed with the record figure of above US$6 million, to date the highest amount ever raised on Kickstarter for video game funding. This article takes this campaign as an endemic case study of the changing funding mechanisms concerning video game production in the digital ecosystem of Web 2.0. Although the campaign displays some of the participatory elements often attributed to crowdfunding and digital convergence, it also sheds doubts on accountability and the effective capacity of crowdfunding to substantially challenge and de-hierarchize power relations in the video game industry. In particular, the Shenmue III campaign illustrates how the crowdfunding initiative was instrumentally mobilized by its organizers to attract further corporate sponsorships and stakeholders outside crowdfunding. This controversial episode shows how commercial platforms like Kickstarter are increasingly facilitating a process of financialization of crowdfunding, whose main effect is not so much the equal coming together of media consumers and producers as the minimization of risks for large video game corporations. By mapping the history of the Shenmue franchise from its original failure in the era of physical distribution to its recent crowdfunded success, this article argues that the empowering potentials of crowdfunding cannot be readily assumed without a contingent analysis of the cultural and political economy underlying Web 2.0 and its digital platforms. </jats:p>",

The chasm has its origins in human perception, epistemology, and ontology: factors which have evolved over millions of years and been subjects of inquiry for at least two millennia. However, the shifting technological vegetation in this chasm can obscure its underlying topology. To understand the two forms and make sense of their differences, it is helpful to look at the relation between virtual reality (VR) and telepresence: it bears a similarity to the relation between painting and photography.

Although skeptics abound, no one can answer this question with certainty now. But, if we consider this phrase from a different angle, it promises a more immediately revealing analysis of contemporary 3D cinema. Despite its appearance of born-again novelty, 3D has quickly established a highly codified stylistic repertoire. This repertoire is evidenced in the relationship that 3D US feature films have to classical Hollywood and contemporary film and image-making strategies. As it achieves its spatial effects, 3D obeys, wrestles with, and amplifies certain standard aspects of storytelling, visual style, and genre. Studying recent movies, including blockbusters, this article argues that 3D’s mixture of media heritages distills a highly conventionalized 3D aesthetic or a new stylistic normal. </jats:p>",

What is fascinating in the period 2005—2011, however, is that two highly non-convergent portable game consoles — the Nintendo DS series (DS/DSi/DSiXL) and the Sony PlayStation Portable series (PSP/PSPgo) — existed in parallel to the emergent growth of a smartphone market which would go on to threaten the traditional macro-economic business model of games retail. This article argues that the concept of the ‘portable’ can be productively distinguished from ‘mobile’. Two game design case studies — of Pokémon HeartGold/Pokémon SoulSilver and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite are used to demonstrate the idiosyncratic relationships between game, platform and player. The design and play of these portable games are discussed, and the deep engagements they offer are explored in contrast to the design and play of mobile games. </jats:p>",

Such a change requires the recognition that stereoscopy is a technique applicable across media, not a continually dying and reborn medium. Arguing that the stereograph laid some of the groundwork for the ‘cinema of attractions’ before it suffered from cinema’s capacity to supply precisely such spectacular modes of visual engagement on a grander sale, this article suggests that there is much to be taken from understanding early stereoscopy as a prototypical attraction. In the current context, in which not just three-dimensional (3D) cinema but also 3D television and 3D gaming all offer new forms of stereoscopic attraction, the content of early spectacular stereocards offers a wealth of source material with which to understand a newly resurgent form. </jats:p>",

Analogue tools are generally associated with creative openness and fluidity whereas digital tools are discursively constructed as a technological other to the analogue. ‘Older’ creatives (born before 1980) tend to apply some of the media-inflected discourse around the balinghou generation (born 1980–1989) to their younger competitors, including an assumed affinity with digital media and technologies (the pinning on of a generational identity badge).

The current literature explains this trend by examining users’ limited knowledge of, concern about, or even resignation to surveillance. Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews ( n = 16), we explore how young adult Alexa users make sense of continuing to use the VA while generally distrusting Amazon. We identify three strategies that participants use to manage distrust: separating the VA from the company through anthropomorphism, expressing digital resignation, and occasionally taking action, like moving Alexa or even unplugging it. We argue that these individual-level strategies allow users to manage their concerns about Alexa and integrate the VA into domestic life. We conclude by discussing the implications these individual choices have for personal privacy and the rapid expansion of surveillance technologies into intimate life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> User-based research into the lived experiences associated with smartphone camera practices – in particular, the taking, storing, curating and sharing of personal imagery in the digital media sphere – remains scarce, especially in contrast to its increasing ubiquity. Accordingly, this article’s detailed analysis of open-ended questionnaires from ‘millennial’ smartphone users elucidates the varied experiential, compositional and technological aspects associated with smartphone imagery in everyday life. It argues that the associated changes do more than just update previous technologies but rather open space up for emergent forms of visual communication. Specifically, our close interpretive reading indicates four key factors underlying the moments privileged when using smartphone cameras, namely: they deviate from the mundane, are related to ‘positive’ emotions, evince strong social bonds and encompass a future-oriented perspective. Relatedly, in terms of photographic composition, visual content tends to circulate around: the social presence of others, boundedness of event, perceived aesthetic value and intended shareability. Our findings question certain formulations about the gradual disappearance of media from personal consciousness in a digital age. If ceaselessness is a defining characteristic of the current era, our analysis reveals that the use of smartphone cameras is indicative of people affectively and self-consciously deploying the technology to try to arrest the ephemerality of daily life, however fleetingly. This article thus pinpoints the theoretical and methodological value of research approaches moving beyond a narrow focus on the usage patterns to uncover the spatio-temporal specificities shaping (and being shaped by) smartphone imagery and its communicative resonances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> By going through a history of electronic visuality, from fluorescence glows in European laboratories in the nineteenth century to the computer screen in the twentieth century, this paper discusses technical image operations in the interaction between media machines and media people. Examining this set of apparatus from the evolution of a neglected technical object – the vacuum tube, it traces the history of the screen and the temporal-spatial composition of electronic graphics in television, radar, and early computer systems. In doing so, it outlines the entangled history of analog and digital displays and demonstrates the impossibility of neglecting the role of the human observer in the technical invention of visuality. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rhetorical Figures and the Digital Editing of Radio Speech",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the age of authentically digital radio, traditional semiological approaches to radio speech may have outlived their usefulness. Such approaches cannot adequately describe the workings of today’s most ambitious radio producers, although they remain dominant in both the language of radio production practice and radio’s critical discourse. An alternative approach, more suited to radio’s digital present and future, is offered and investigated in this article. Rooted in the critical histories of rhetoric and poetics, this article profiles a radio constructed not as linear narrative but as a set of palimpsestual and polyvalent opportunities for interpretation. It borrows the notion of auricular figures from the early-modern courtier George Puttenham’s writing to help describe and analyse numerous permutations of the digital audio editing of radio speech found in the work of contemporary practitioners such as Christof Migone, Gregory Whitehead, John Oswald, Sherre DeLys, Antony Pitts, Bonnie Greer and Miguel Macias. Ultimately, this article proposes a new, open-ended taxonomy for the tropes of digital audio editing. This taxonomy expands our understanding both of the digital potentials for aural density and montage, and of how the digital audio edit activates a novel relationship with a radio audience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digitisation is arguably an inevitable feature of contemporary urban development, yet privacy issues arising from the mass data collection, transmission and processing it entails continue to be a poorly understood and contentious issue for people living in cities. This article uses a case study approach to provide new evidence of the detailed perspectives of citizens and policy makers on data privacy in rapidly digitising urban environments, with a focus on one of the UK’s most prominent smart cities: Manchester. It adds to the literature on smart cities through the application of complementary scholarship from two areas – trust and participation – in order to analyse comparatively citizens’ views and concerns on data gathering activity in their city with efforts of policy makers to incorporate data privacy matters in their digital city planning. The article finds a clear – but reparable – data privacy disconnect between people and digital policy makers and explores how citizen data privacy concerns may be addressed through a lens of trust and participation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Over ten years ago in The Second Self,’ Sherry Turkle examined the personal computer as ’a machine to think with’: that is, as a machine to think about ourselves with. Now in Life on the Screen she explores this territory again, taking into account important changes in computer technology and the machines’s place in our culture. In 1984 there were mainframes accessed from terminals, and there were personal computers usually functioning in a standalone mode. In general, widearea networks were available only to technical experts working in universities and research institutions. In this context, Turkle showed how children, hackers, and computer scientists made metaphorical sense of the computer as a machine capable of seemingly human, autonomous action. They wondered whether computers could think and, if so, what made human beings different from or better than these machines. Today, in what Turkle calls ’the age of the Internet’, the technologies and therefore the questions have changed. Computers have become in large part channels for communication among human users, such as email, multi-user domains (MUDs), and chatgroups. These technologies also raise the issue of identity, but what is now in question is the definition of one’s identity within a community of human beings who are interacting in a digital environment.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A central strategy in selling information technology has involved the appropriation of earlier historical notions of the ether: as an immersive environment, communicative medium and electronic presence. Just as telephony was connected to the ‘wireless ether’, virtual reality and cyberspace have been connected to the idea of a virtual, electronic sphere, represented as an informatic space, through which a mode of (digital) being is conducted. However, as this paper will argue, while the data trails generated through ‘dataveillance’ technologies, or the information collected by wearable computers, may indeed situate the individual within a digitally rendered ‘ether’, these technologies are based on the generation of knowledge more than the creation of a space, installing an epistemological, rather than an ontological framework for understanding telepresent agency. With reference to recent works by Canadian artist Catherine Richards, this paper will discuss both research into new ‘reality mining’ and ‘affective computing’ technologies and the discourse of posthumanism, as it elaborates the transformation from autonomous liberal subject to post-human hybrid currently underway, and the developing relationships between humans and embodied, emotionally intelligent machines. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Further on down the digital road: Narrative design and reading pleasure in five New Media Writing Prize narratives",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2006 and 2010, I published papers in Convergence, which analysed readers’ responses to several interactive narratives: From this research, I formed a set of ‘assessment’ criteria for such narratives, intended to be of use to writers, academics and teachers, looking for ways to understand how readers might react to the very new and changing forms of digital storytelling, which continue to surprise, delight and puzzle readers. Despite huge technical advances, and although some recent examples are doing well commercially, digital interactive narrative remains largely unknown to the general reading public (who nonetheless love their novels, films and games). This article reviews a very specific set of interactive narratives – those which have been shortlisted for the international New Media Writing Prize – against the criteria I established in the 2010 paper. These are cutting edge, exemplar works, which one might suppose demonstrate the best of everything that new-media storytelling can offer. I revisit my criteria in the light of technical and creative developments over the past 5 years, using the responses of volunteer readers to aid my own evaluation of the pieces under discussion. Overall, I argue that many of the issues I previously found to be a barrier to readers have been overcome, but that there are still problems for readers, which writers/developers need to consider.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The potential of the Internet to act as a global distribution outlet for screen content has long come into conflict with the nationally focused strategies of producers, broadcasters, governments and Internet service providers. Online viewing therefore acts as a useful case study for interrogating how tensions between ‘global’ and ‘local’ manifest within an increasingly digitized media landscape. This article examines the online viewing markets in three countries at different stages of digital maturity (South Korea, Brazil and India) to consider how online viewing has evolved in each. It then examines audience questionnaire and interview data generated in each country to explore how viewers are making sense of and valuing online viewing services. By interrogating all three samples before focusing specifically on India in more detail, it examines two tensions within the global expansion of online film and television distribution: between global trends and local infrastructures and between the ideals of online viewing services and the grounded realities of their daily use. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I draw from anthropological fieldwork in Spain and secondary research on Tunisia and Iceland to explore the connection between Internet freedom activism and post-2008 protest movements. I introduce two new concepts: ‘freedom technologists’ and ‘protest formulas’. I use the term freedom technologists to refer to those social agents who combine technological and political skills to pursue greater Internet and democratic freedoms, which they regard as being inextricably entwined. Far from being techno-utopians or deluded ‘slacktivists’ (Morozov, 2013, Skoric, 2012), I argue that most freedom technologists are in fact techno-pragmatists, that is, people who take a very practical view of the limits and possibilities of new technologies for political change. I also differentiate among freedom technologists, singling out three main specialists for their strong contribution to the new movements, namely hackers/geeks, tech lawyers and online journalists. The second new coinage I develop is protest formulas. This term refers to the unique compound of societal forces and outcomes that characterizes each protest movement – as well as each phase or initiative within a movement. In this article, I track the influence of freedom technologists on emerging protest movements as they interact with other agents within these political compounds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The eSports industry is growing at a rapid pace. The expansion of streaming services such as Twitch and YouTube Live played an important role in this leap and greatly contributed to the rise in popularity of electronic sports. Despite this success, there is no research on the topic of streaming demand of eSports to date. This paper aims to fill this gap using a demand approach of traditional sports to analyze the streaming demand of an eSports discipline, the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The dataset comprises 865 matches between 2018 and 2021. Multiple Linear Regressions are taken as econometric tools. Main findings indicate that eSports enthusiasts value factors such as quality of tournament, match quality, and individual skill of the athletes when watching matches. In addition, the obtained results reveal that the Uncertainty of Outcome plays a significant role at streaming broadcasts of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, where viewers prefer to watch those games in which there is a high level of competitiveness between the participants. Current research contributes to the existing eSports literature with a new framework for analyzing streaming demand. The empirical findings could be of the interest of tournament organizers as well as streaming platforms for maximizing audiences. </jats:p>",

The decision is a landmark moment in the history of BBC Television and has significant implications for BBC planning in relation to the continued transition from broadcast television to streaming and download services. In this article, the original proposals for moving BBC Three online are assessed and discussed within the wider context of current BBC policy. It is argued that the rationale used for moving BBC Three online is based on arguments that vary in the extent to which they are backed by evidence. It is also argued that the plans have significant regulatory implications for the future of BBC Television and for the television licence fee in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article advances a holistic framework that aims to facilitate a better understanding of the nuanced impact of the internet on contemporary creative participation. Functioning simultaneously as the context, locus, and medium for creative activity, the internet affects each stage in the life cycle of a creative product – creation, distribution, interpretation, and remix. In addition, this influence is felt in a wide range of creative products: off-line and online, professional and vernacular. Previous research has not examined these different processes and types of creative output in conversation with each other; by advancing an integrative analytical approach and synthesizing research from multiple domains, this work attempts to address this gap. As a way to illuminate this impact and demonstrate the value of the proposed framework, the article applies this framework to three case studies: a work of off-line art ( The Artist Is Present), online art ( Moon), and online nonart or vernacular online creativity (Pepe the Frog memes). This analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of these interrelated processes, attends to the complex ways in which new media blurs the borders between those categorizations, and discusses the potential implications of these complex contemporary dynamics. </jats:p>",

Such beliefs are now being interrogated, an endeavour this study continues by analysing data on the consumption and characteristics of television programmes viewed on a channel’s VOD service and – for comparison – via its linear broadcast. Crucially, our analysis incorporates characteristics – like programmes’ prominence on the channel’s VOD interface – that represent how platforms seek to steer users’ attention. Our analysis also incorporates other programme characteristics, like genre – which serves as a proxy for the deliberate viewing choices users make. Our results lend empirical weight to ideas about the limits of online users’ agency. This study is also of relevance to television scholars and executives who are interested in the specific predictors of television programmes’ success, both on VOD platforms and on linear television. </jats:p>",

I contend that contemporary television style does not just constitute a response to the demands of technological convergence — it is rather an integral component of that which allows television to merge with new devices in the first place. When we engage with style as a precursor to these developments, important continuities emerge between the aesthetics of the small screen and those of the new smaller screens. These continuities underscore that convergence is at once a technical and aesthetic process that entails the hybridization of hardware and cultural forms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Political social media influencers are taking increasingly central and agenda-setting roles within contemporary media ecologies; however, little in-depth research has been conducted with regard to their agency and the practices of the specific agents involved. This article examines Scandinavian Instagram feminists’ practices and experiences in light of the #MeToo campaigns. Building on observations and interviews with feminist influencers whose followers exceed 10,000 each, the article seeks to contribute new insights about social media user agency, concentrating on some of the most powerful voices in digital activism. By regarding #MeToo an assemblage of various homogenous and shifting elements, the article highlights how feminist influencers in the Scandinavian context have taken positions as defining agents of feminism through employing Instagram’s user options for performing affective acts of labor. Though they do not utilize Instagram as a means for making money through advertising the way mainstream influencers do, nonprofit influencers such as microcelebrity feminists have large social media followings and are still arguably important players in the platform economy because of their significant reach and ability to influence political agendas. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this article is to explore how unboxing videos on YouTube contribute to the domestication of privacy-invasive technology. Further, the objective is to show how consumer influencers on YouTube adapt to the flexible persona of the online warm expert (OWE) which expands the concept of the ‘warm expert’ from the domestication literature ( Bakardjieva, 2005 , Internet Society: The Internet in Everyday Life. London: Sage Publications). I argue that the OWE and unboxing discourse advance corporate interests of surveillance capitalism in home environments by promoting the circulation of emergent consumer technologies and eschewing meaningful discussion of privacy and surveillance issues. A case study of the Amazon Echo smart speaker and Alexa, its voice-activated personal assistant, is presented. The research consists of a qualitative thematic analysis of unboxing videos ( N = 73) and viewer comments on YouTube. Unboxing discourse reflects normative consumer culture values that are detached from critical discussions of surveillance or the informational privacy framework of end-user agreements. As a practical implication, the study helps look beyond the household and traditional social relationships in the domestic sphere to understand how technological domestication is being shaped in a paradigm of consumer culture that is fused with the infrastructural and cultural logics of the Internet and social media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Widespread use of locative media and its integration with social media applications has provided individuals with the new ways of identity practices. Through checking in at locations, uploading still and moving images of/with certain spaces, and adding hashtags to proliferate meanings, space has turned into a stage where self-identities are digitally practiced. Within this context, this article explores the production of space through these practices on Instagram in the case study of Mavibahçe Shopping Center in Izmir, Turkey. The analysis based on questionnaires and digital media surveys targets the converged space of the same digital and physical location of Mavibahçe with the aim of providing insights into the use of space for identity constructions. The study concludes that visitors reproduce space through transmediated identity practices in Instagram in order to demonstrate their affiliations to certain lifestyles as part of their digital habitus. While they perform these acts, they prefer to use the spatial attributes that they favor as the background setting of their spatial self and tag only affirmative hashtags for their spatial experiences along with these representations, which reproduce the space of the chosen architectural settings in the digital media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This project explores social psychological factors and motivation involving vlogs, filling gaps in the understanding of viewing needs and outcomes of this new cultural practice. An exploratory online survey asked over 400 knitting vlog viewers about expected outcomes of viewing, loneliness, identification, perceived homophily, parasocial relationship strength, motivation to knit, and motivation to view knitting vlogs, addressing hypotheses involving common expected outcomes and viewing motivation, how well loneliness predicts parasocial relationship strength, and how these feelings predict motivations to view vlogs and to knit. The results showed that feelings of activity and social connection most strongly predicted motivation to view and to knit. Loneliness did not play a role in parasocial relationship strength. These findings suggest that the social qualities of knitting vlogs may play an important role in motivating viewers to watch and to knit. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The coverage of sports has formed a key component of media content throughout the different stages of the development of communication technology. This article investigates to what extent the rise of online live text commentary of sporting events extends or departs from existing forms of representation in media sports, and thus whether it constitutes a form of technological evolution or revolution. The article argues that online sports commentary further advances the transnational distribution of sporting content and the rise of global sporting cultures, and thereby contributes to the globalisation tendencies of other electronic media such as television. At the same time online live text commentary in its minimal representation of the game event through facts and figures moves beyond the visual spectacle that has coined the televisual representation of sports, and thus requires modes of readership based on fan identification. Online live text commentary thus extends and alters the symbolic basis of sports coverage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing dissemination of conspiracy theories on social media has challenged the well-being of societies. This study aims to understand why individuals would engage with conspiracy theories and what role specific beliefs, but also individual factors such as personality traits play. To answer these questions, we conducted surveys in six countries (Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, the UK and the U.S.) and investigate three motivations (conviction, entertainment and reaction provocation) behind the dissemination of conspiracy content on social media. Our findings demonstrate that across issues, individuals who indicated they would engage with conspiracy theories do it mainly because they are convinced by the message. Political orientation and issue attitudes proof to be connected to individual engagement with conspiracy theories out of conviction, while dark personality traits such as narcissism and psychopathy are valid predictors for why individuals would disseminate conspiracy theories out of entertainment reasons or to provoke reactions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Creativity has been widely studied across various disciplines such as psychology and education from a variety of perspectives and has been argued to provide a range of different benefits such as the development of transferrable skills. However, not much is known about how creativity is conceptualized within digital entertainment games from the perspective of the player. In addition to providing a scoping review of the field, this study aims to address current gaps in the literature by answering the research question: how do players conceptualize creativity within digital entertainment games? Data from 24 semistructured interviews and 14 narrative surveys with regular players of various genres of digital games were analyzed using qualitative methodology. Thematic analysis was performed, resulting in three main categories of conceptualizations: ways of thinking, constructing in games, and games as an art form. By providing an insight into how players view creativity in digital games, this article aims to illuminate this understudied facet of player experience and pave the way for future studies seeking to explore how digital games may promote creativity in those who play them. </jats:p>",

His intentional role as a cultural intermediary between Korea and the U.S. highlights how he strategically employs his Whiteness to enhance visibility. When targeting Korean viewers, Oliver-ssaem not only praises and endorses the excellence of Korean culture and products but also highlights negative aspects of U.S. culture. The perceived value of his endorsement and mediation of U.S. culture is rooted in Oliver-ssaem’s embodiment of a desirable, objective, and progressive Whiteness, inadvertently perpetuating global White hegemony. By examining his visibility strategy through the lens of the historical and cultural relationship between the U.S. and Korea, we argue for a localized and contextualized analysis of the commodification of Whiteness, particularly in Asian digital spaces. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This theoretical and empirical investigation builds upon the concept of ‘slantwise behavior’ to further complicate notions of the ‘digital disengagement’ of subjects within technological infrastructures such as Facebook. It has been previously suggested that the ubiquity of the data privacy paradox is the most common reason for disengagement practices. Our study contributes to this discussion by examining subjects’ disengagement on Social Network Sites (SNS). While numerous concepts concerning disconnection and disengagement from SNS have been conceptualized by media theorists, largely based on a binary construct of resistance or domination, our work proposes an alternative conceptualization of subjects’ disengagement. By employing a qualitative methodological approach and using 30 semi-structured interviews to capture subjects’ discursive patterns, we illustrate that disengagement on Facebook can be seen as a hybrid reaction and a complex phenomenon in which certain disconnection practices cannot be easily classified as resistance practices or as indications of the internalization of domination but rather are best understood as slantwise behaviors, that is, actions that may unintentionally lead to obfuscation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Data visualisations are intimately connected to the emergence of public health as a discipline and policy area. Besides the mapping of cases and deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen an explosion of attempts to track policy responses. They have come from actors sometimes initially unfamiliar with public and global health. In this paper, we analyse seven of the most successful tracker initiatives that have sought to map governments’ reactions to COVID-19 and reflect on our own. When not led by international organisations, the trackers primarily rely on networks of volunteer country expert contributors (who need to be incentivised in the medium term). The vertical crowdsourcing approach means that, despite good intentions, contributors have a relatively limited agency in shaping the trackers. Maps and timelines comparing countries are the most popular visualisations; they suggest that (some) policy solutions can be found abroad and rely on policy taxonomies established by the trackers’ core teams. We contend that such taxonomies, which compete with each other, constitute attempts to frame the complex issue of which policies matter in responding to COVID-19. All the projects are large and complex and often without a well-defined intended audience. We hypothesise that the popularity (in terms of backlinks) of the most successful tracker arises from the fact that it sums up COVID-19 policies in one easily visualisable indicator. We suggest that the trackers are a more helpful emergency policy tool when they provide contextual information, keep policy details or refer to them (rather than only reduce them to categories), and suggest ways to link different elements—including the relationship between health or societal outcomes and policies. </jats:p>",

For some, the development of blockchain technologies and smart contracts suggests an opportunity for artists to protect their work from misuse and expropriation. For others, it suggests the possibility of stronger forms of digital rights management, going forward, that may negatively impact digital culture. However, this article argues that the aim of limited editions on the blockchain is not usually to institute stronger restrictions over use or a new form of digital rights management but rather to create new kinds of tradable digital assets. In turn, this trend implies a different operation of intellectual property rights with respect to digital culture, one where alienation rather than exclusion is significant, and a different operation of scarcity with respect to digital cultural goods, where their free circulation is not necessarily antithetical to profit. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay argues for the utility of a platform-studies approach alongside textual analysis when studying the politics of sexual representation in contemporary television programming. Using a corpus of four LGBTQ+-themed programs that represent queer and trans sexualities and HIV/AIDS, the paper argues that funding mechanisms play a constitutive role in determining the kinds of sexual diversity that can circulate via streaming technologies. Comparing and contrasting content created for SVODs, BVODs, and video-sharing platforms, the essay considers the impact that the economic diversity of television’s multiplatform ecology has on the sexual diversity of content that circulates there. Purposefully combining an analysis of online TV with social media entertainment, the essay casts ‘streaming television’ as a wide, varied category whose relationship to questions of representational diversity is more complex than existing scholarship on these issues sometimes suggests. Situating its analysis in the literatures of platform studies, media industry studies, and television’s politics of LGBTQ + representation, the essay shifts the purview of ‘diversity’ away from representations of identity and toward diversities of funding mechanisms and diversities of sexual acts and practices. The essay argues for the necessity of textual analysis to properly articulate the relationship between platforms and the politics of sexual representation in the content that they circulate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the concept of interactive and participatory journalism in news through the lens of gatekeeping theory. It aims to shine a light on newsrooms that have been early adapters in the trends and technologies of interactive content between journalists and their audiences. It explores what the managers and employees of those newsrooms believe has been successful, what has not been successful, and what other journalists can learn from their experiences. It also examines how these efforts have affected the process of gatekeeping in these newsrooms. The researcher employed in-depth interviews with 12 employees in three newsrooms in the United States. The interviewees included general managers, news directors, anchors, and digital producers. The research identified three major themes that contributed to the success of exploratory interactive efforts: newsroom culture, a focus on the audience, and finding balance between attracting those who want interactivity without alienating those who don’t.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Joe Rogan v. Spotify: Platformization and worlds colliding",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In May 2020, the music streaming service Spotify acquired exclusive rights to The Joe Rogan Experience, one of the world’s most popular podcasts. While the music streamer had started its foray into the podcasting world with acquisitions in 2019 of podcasting networks and production companies, the investment on Rogan was widely seen as a strong commitment. Rogan’s podcast is known to be humorous, crass, and often controversial. As the show dealt with highly contentious issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, criticism emerged, both from medical professionals, from artists and from within Spotify. The most widely published pushback came from artist Neil Young in January 2022, as he posed an ultimatum: ‘They can have Rogan or Young. Not both’. The Joe Rogan v. Spotify case can be seen as indicative of how the platformization of podcasting creates tensions and conflicts: Worlds collide as the logics of music publishing and news publishing crash with Rogan’s free reign podcasting world. As a result, Spotify, as a podcasting platform and publisher, finds itself in unfamiliar terrain. This paper connects the details of the case with theories of platformization, looking specifically at the role of Spotify as a comparatively new distributor of podcasts and a driving force to connect various audio formats. Drawing on media industry studies and scholarship on media policy and regulation, the paper ends with a discussion on how to understand the complexity of Spotify’s role as a publisher and a platform and Rogan’s role as a platform creator. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the cross-media dynamics related to controversies surrounding the Tour de France 2017. It posits sports controversies are prime cases for studying how mainstream media and online platforms impact each other. Based on a large data set of tweets and combining a digital methods approach with a close reading of tweets, we show how the often discussed potential of sports’ live events to synchronize different media becomes intensified in case of controversies, which trigger an influx of users and spawn additional moments of shared attention. Additionally, controversies in sports incite visual activities of fans using and augmenting material from different sources to support their take on the issue. We suggest to understand this as an example of ‘forensic fandom’ and show how it entangles different temporal and visual affordances: the liveness of television, the ad hoc publics of Twitter and the archival function of YouTube. Adding to prior cross-media and cross-platform research, we argue that media (including their seemingly specific temporal and visual qualities) are always dependent on and shaped by particular cultural practices, topics and events that trigger connections between different media and platforms. </jats:p>",

But recent technology allows for more weakly market-oriented newsrooms, an under-researched area of inquiry. This study, utilizing long-form interviews with 23 journalists at digital news organizations with weak market orientations, examines journalist perceptions of market orientation. The data show that journalists perceive positive effects of this orientation on their organization through more time for stories, more ability to engage with the audience and more overall autonomy. However, the journalists believe negative effects include a lack of innovation, an unstable funding structure, and a lack of perceived credibility from the audience. These results are discussed through the lens of market theory for news. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media convergence is not a new concept in journalism studies, though available evidence indicates that convergence studies have been explored more in the global north than the global south. This study, contextualised in Nigeria, joins the media convergence conversation by exploring the sustainability of Facebook-radio convergence for distributing broadcast programmes by seventeen (17) licenced radio stations in Oyo State, Nigeria. As a computational content analysis study, researchers analysed 85 purposively selected programmes of the stations as broadcast live on their Facebook pages alongside the 9527 likes, 10,314 shares, 7007 comments and 170,681 views the programmes generated. Stakeholders’ interviews were also conducted for a broadcasting expert, presenters of some of the stations, together with audience of the selected stations. The main finding shows that programmes that focussed more on socioeconomic problems and opportunities, and were broadcast in the afternoon, evening and at night received more digital engagement than other programmes’ formats and time belts. Although high cost of Internet data subscription in the country, absence of Internet-enabled mobile phones among many adherents of radio programmes (both in rural and urban areas), epileptic power supply that sometimes leave many people with unpowered mobile phones as well as weak Internet broadband connectivity common to many locations in Nigeria threaten the sustainability of Facebook-radio broadcasting in Oyo State. Deployment of 5G network, installation of more network masts with strong bandwidth and training of radio presenters and radio stations' social media handlers on innovative and audience-participatory programme production are recommended. </jats:p>",

This article explores patterns in this media use surrounding the Øya festival in Norway and focuses, in particular, on music streaming and social media activity. It presents statistical analysis of listening sessions via the streaming service Wimp and social interactions via the micro-blogging platform Twitter. The juxtaposition of these unique access points allows the analysis to explore the impact of physical live concerts on the digital music experience. It also enables a nuanced examination of how the festival audience responds to different artist segments, from international headliners to local acts. One key finding is that local artists that are positively evaluated via Twitter have the greatest boost in subsequent music streaming. The article argues that in-depth studies of the intersection of live and mediated music are essential to understanding the encounter between artists and audiences that is facilitated by contemporary live music events. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws on work from a 6-month project with 12 young mothers in which we mapped and tracked ourselves and our infants. The project employed a range of methods including digital ethnographies, walk-along methods, hacking and playful experimentations. We explored, broke and tested a range of wearables and phone-based tracking apps, meeting regularly to discuss and compare our experiences and interrogate the sociotechnical systems of postnatal healthcare alongside the particular politics of certain apps and their connective affordances. In this article, I use the project as a springboard to explore what I call algorithmic vulnerabilities: the ways that the contemporary datalogical anthropocene is exposing and positioning subjects in ways that not only rarely match their own lived senses of identity but are also increasingly difficult to interrupt or disrupt. While this is not necessarily a new phenomenon (see Clough et al., 2015; Hayles, 2017), I argue that the particular algorithmic vulnerabilities within this context, which are forged in part through the ideological enmeshing of the long-running atomization of maternal and infant bodies within the healthcare systems (Crowe, 1987; Shaw, 2012; Wajcman, 1991) and the new and emergent tracking apps (Greenfield, 2016; Lupton, 2016; O’Riordan, 2017) create momentary stabilizations of sociotechnical systems in which maternal subjectivity and female embodiment become algorithmically vulnerable in affective and profound ways. These stabilizations become increasingly and problematically normative, partly because they feed and perpetuate a wider ‘taken-for granted’ sensibility of gendered neoliberalism (Gill, 2017: 609) which, as I argue, is coming to encapsulate the contemporary datalogical anthropocene. Secondly, the sociotechnical politics of the apps and the healthcare systems are revealed as co-dependent, raising a number of questions about long-term algorithmic vulnerabilities and normativities which predate the contemporary datalogical ‘turn’ and impact both practices and methods. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Assisted by the technological advances of the past decades, stereoscopic 3D cues are being integrated increasingly in both interactive and non-interactive media. Arguably, the main focus of this effort is placed on the creation of an increased sense of visual depth. Considering that human perception relies heavily on the audiovisual integration rather than on visual information alone, it is rather surprising that relatively little attention has been given so far to the potential effect of the soundtrack on 3D depth perception in contrast to the evident interest towards the study of realistic 3D audio spatialisation techniques and technologies. The multisensory nature of human perception suggests that the potential of sound design as a means to influence depth perception in the stereoscopic 3D visual environments may be worthy of further exploration. This study reports on our research into the possibilities of using alterations of the volume levels of the soundtrack in order to influence the perception of visual depth while viewing stereoscopic 3D animation clips. Based on previous findings indicating that the volume level of the soundtrack may be related to the perception of visual depth, a series of experiments further explored the effectiveness of this auditory cue. Results suggest that, under certain conditions, differences in volume levels of the soundtrack could influence the judgement of visual depth in a way that frequently contradicts real-life expectations. It is suggested that different, more metaphorical perceptual mechanisms may be in play when viewing stereoscopic 3D presentations than in real life. In this context, we conclude that stereoscopic 3D media can benefit from further exploration of the effectiveness of certain auditory cues as a means to influence the perception of depth within the stereoscopic 3D environment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "would have enhanced the book. Duffy’s subjects are producers and innovators of culture, and it therefore would have been illuminating to analyse what they do, in addition to what they say they do. Closer attention to the media texts borne out of this industry might have helped readers to make sense of what is at stake in the production of a culture so heavily wedded to brands logics, considering particularly the majority young female audiences of such content. I found myself wondering exactly what types of culture these women are producing and sustaining via their blogs, vlogs and Instagram accounts, and how these might be analysed or critiqued within the feminist framework of the book? As a PhD student myself researching YouTube content creators, Duffy’s final chapter ‘The Aspirational Labour of an Academic’ had a particularly profound impact. She details the striking comparisons between the work of social media producers and scholars, namely the necessity of carrying out free labour and self-promotion, as well as increasingly unstable working conditions. Duffy’s willingness to turn the critical lens upon her own profession, and her desire to build bridges between these two seemingly disparate industries, highlights both her high regard for her interviewees and her critical thinking. It encourages readers to take this form of labour more seriously, further challenging the popular representations of social media creators as narcissistic, entitled or lazy. This highly accessible and engaging book is a must-read for students, researchers and indeed anyone interested in the intersections of creative labour, social media and gender.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research article undertakes a timely interrogation of the anti-woman digital practices on social media environments, particularly Twitter – specifically, practices seeped in gender bigotry and ageism. It introduces the relatively unexplored concept of digital temporality vis-à-vis digital feminist analysis, and relies, to a limited extent, on empirically examining Indian Twitter primarily and American and Australian Twitter to a lesser extent. The article analyses how image-aesthetics for women, dependent on their age (manifested in appearance and perception of women’s digital image), are a patriarchy-propped digital trend and how that promotes a culture of digital ageism, predicated on women’s appearance. This study also examines and establishes how women users on Twitter are susceptible to continual ageing as images on the digital screen and how digital ageing is a gendered phenomenon. The scope of this article is to examine digital ageism from theoretical perspectives, and offer empirical examples from news portals and Twitter media to substantiate some crucial arguments. This project, of course, also opens more scope to quantitatively account for digital ageism through detailed empirical studies as is also the scope to examine the various subversive tools that could potentially be utilized in gendered rubrics to defy or negate sexist ageism on social media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Considering the impacts COVID-19 has had on travel and many economies, developing virtual experiences that are well-received by different publics has become even more prominent. This paper shows how a multimodal discourse analysis can be used to as a bottom-up approach to identifying narrative themes that can be used in virtual experiences for cultural heritage sites. A case study on 11 UNESCO World Heritage Australian Convict Sites shows how diverse sources of user-generated content, tourism marketing materials and historical information can be analysed and then remixed into a virtual tour of the sites in the form of an interactive web documentary (iDoc). Although this case study involved a total of seven narrative development phases, this paper focuses on two phases, namely how the user model and content model were determined. These models were later used to develop the resulting iDoc prototype. The user model focused on the prospective audience of cultural heritage tourists, and a content model of narrative themes for the iDoc was developed through a multimodal discourse analysis. This bottom-up approach of analysing existing cultural data allows for the discovery of the prospective audiences’ interests as well as narrative themes that can be included in virtual heritage experiences. It also provides a new creative methodology that can prevent issues that may arise with top-down narratives that focus too heavily on one institutional perspective or national narrative and lack direct engagement with or understanding of today’s publics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how maps in location-based mobile games are used as surfaces on which players can inscribe their whereabouts and other local information while being on the move. Using different examples of location-based games (LBGs) to which the map is central, our main argument is that such cartographical LBGs foreground the fluidity of mapping and emphasize the performative aspects of playing with maps. As such, we wish to move away from a conception of maps as representational texts and will show that it is far more productive to approach such cartographical games as processual and navigational practices. Instead of conceiving maps in such games as ‘mimetic interfaces’ (Juul, 2009), they should therefore be approached as what we will call navigational interfaces. To understand them as such, we will combine perspectives from game studies with non-representational understandings of maps as technological and spatial practices as developed in human geography and science and technology studies. By doing so, we wish to instigate a productive interdisciplinary debate about the relation between play and mapping as to deepen our understanding of LBGs as cultural cartographical practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyzes the phenomenon of digital voice search queries against the background of the fluid and changing balance in the orality–literacy osmosis of different historical eras. In attempting to theoretically conceptualize the unique oral characteristics of this new digital feature, this article argues that as the result of technological considerations, voice querying manifests an attempt to discipline oral words – to pronounce them while thinking of their written form. The article also considers the oxymoron of ‘looking up’ information through spoken words; the effect of an interface that stresses the use of the oral words as an event; the devocalization of queries, as they transform into a written form; and the implications of browsing the Internet through oral word searches, especially for young children. It concludes that the integration of these oral features can be explained by the affordances of digital media on the one hand and the ‘revival’ of intuitive preprint features attempting to ease the cognitive demands of print culture on the other hand. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘ASMR’ autobiographies and the (life-)writing of digital subjectivity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> For years now, a growing online subculture has been exchanging videos designed to induce ‘autonomous sensory meridian response’ (ASMR), a mysterious, blissfully relaxing tingling sensation held to alleviate anxiety, pain, insomnia and depression. Emerging from online health forums, ASMR culture today centres on YouTube, where ‘ASMRtists’ have used the feedback mechanisms built into social media platforms to refine a repertoire of ‘trigger’ techniques. Exemplifying a wider trend for using ‘ambient media’ as mood modulators and task facilitators (Roquet, 2016 Ambient Media: Japanese Atmospheres of Self. London: University of Minnesota Press.), ASMR culture’s use of the word ‘trigger’ is telling, gesturing towards what Halberstam ((2014) You Are Triggering Me! The Neo-Liberal Rhetoric of Harm, Danger and Trauma. Bully Bloggers. Available at: https://bullybloggers.wordpress.com/2014/07/05/you-are-triggering-me-the-neo-liberal-rhetoric-of-harm-danger-and-trauma/ (accessed 8 August 2018)) sees as a shift away from the Freudian notion of ‘memory as a palimpsest’ towards one of memory as ‘a live wire sitting in the psyche waiting for a spark’, whereby digital subjects become black-boxed nodes in a cybernetic circuit. This shift has serious implications for the humanities and is particularly resonant for scholars of life-writing. As McNeill ((2012) There is no “I” in network: Social networks sites and posthuman auto/biography. Biography 35(1): 65–82.) argues, digital technologies ‘complicate[] definitions of the self and its boundaries, both dismantling and sustaining the humanist subject in practices of personal narrative’ (p. 65). The resulting friction is highlighted in ‘ASMR autobiographies’: texts narrating the author’s experiences of ASMR and their discovery of online ASMR communities. Echoing familiar auto/biographical forms, from medical case histories and coming out narratives to tales of religious conversion, these texts show that the models of subjectivity we have inherited from Enlightenment philosophy, religion, psychology and Romantic literature retain some cultural purchase. But they also suggest digital media are fostering new understandings of personhood informed by cybernetics, evolutionary psychology, behaviourism and neuroscience. Focusing on works by Andrew MacMuiris, Andrea Seigel and Jon Kersey while also addressing a range of other texts, this article asks what ASMR autobiographies can tell us about digital subjectivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / Cylinder recordings as an early form of reproducible sound media were first used in 1877 and continued to be produced commercially up until 1929 by Edison. The many cylinders that exist today in various states of decomposition have become objects of concern for those with an interest in historical sound recordings. With this concern leading to preservation efforts converting cylinder sounds into digital form, how should a cylinder sound and with the transformative potential for digital manipulation readily available, how should a digital file of a cylinder record sound? This article discusses the production process of both cylinder recordings and their digital conversions, revealing how fidelity never actually existed in the production process. The University of California Santa Barbara's Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project exemplifies a digital preservation project that reveals what is valued during the digital conversion process. By describing how the cylinders are imbued with meaning through the concerns of manufactures, archivists, internet users and collectors, this article proves that processes concerned with the objectification of sound are motivated by specific social and technological desires motivated by nostalgia for an imagined sound fidelity. </jats:p>",

By tracing screenshot’s origins to photographic techniques used for capturing medical imaging, oscillograms, and first applications of computer-aided design, I show a lineage of a straightforward mode of representation built on the assumptions of indexicality and iconic resemblance. However, this initially mechanical act of image reproduction has given rise to transformative practices of promotional and artistic screenshots (represented in this article by in-game photography), which subvert the conventions of accurate representation. By contrasting these visual phenomena, I argue for the redefinition of screenshot and show the need for critical literacy of screenshot-based images. </jats:p>",

Against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, we consider a case in Shenzhen, China, and demonstrate the impact of visualization as intermediation for data on policies and society. We propose an epistemology of visualization as infrastructure. In China, visualization has been developed as a technological system to support information dissemination and collective action in public crises. Three characteristics are proposed to describe China’s data visualization politics during the pandemic, in particular, to summarize the power relationships between visual brokers, policymakers, and public users in data visualization. Further, based on the conceptualization of the links between visualization, infrastructure, and data politics, visualization serves as an important component of information infrastructure, and is an easily overlooked technical process. The creation and use of data may seem like normalized actions, but data visualization in fact supports the perception, participation, proposal, and critique of data politics issues. Via a focus group discussion with members of the Shenzhen public health sector and in-depth interviews with Shenzhen residents, we developed a qualitative effectiveness measurement framework highlighting the potential for the involvement of visualization in politics and activism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A devastating earthquake struck the Gujarat region of India on 26 January 2001, killing an estimated 20,000 people. Almost immediately, online news media began publishing details of the earthquake along with pleas for donations of money and other aid. In effect, a disaster-response community had formed in cyberspace. This study explores the role of the news media in the formation of that community. It examines how the online sites of three leading English-language Indian dailies - The Times of India, The Hindu and The Hindustan Times - disseminated information about the disaster to the outside world. The study shows the media followed good professional practices in focusing on human needs and not overemphasising foreign help. The media helped in the formation of a disaster-response community based on common interests as well as a geographic location of concern. This study illustrates the important role the online news media play in bringing together people concerned about one specific issue - in this case, the tragic earthquake in Gujarat. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Users across media",
    "abstract": "It is an empirical fact that audiences, or users, as we prefer, are inherently cross-media (Schrøder, 2011). Media users combine, juggle and move almost seamlessly between various media platforms and services to pursue information and entertainment, carry out professional responsibilities, communicate about and act on demands in their everyday lives, and not least to interact with each other. Mobile media, such as smartphones and tablets with ubiquitous Internet access, epitomize this development by converging various media on a single multipurpose platform. A key observation in the current, digital media landscape is that media use, from television to telephones, is increasingly personalized, fragmented and connective (Holt et al., 2016). Traditional conceptions of media users – understood as the individuals or collectives (audiences, publics, spectators, etc.) at the receiving end of mediated communications – are put under pressure by the convergence of mass and interpersonal media on digital platforms and services. Users are increasingly seen as productive and participatory; they curate, share, comment and create digital media content for diverse purposes and in diverse contexts. Studying cross-media from the point of view of users and the roles they undertake when engaging with media, we contend, involves a decentring of media and a centring of the analysis on communicative practices as crystallized in patterns of cross-media use. Various notions of cross-media have emerged in audience and user studies to the enrichment of our theoretical, as well as empirical, understanding of the contemporary media user. As some of these efforts are beginning to consolidate, taking stock of the user’s perspective on the study of cross-media practices appears to be timely. Together, the seven articles compiled in this special issue do exactly this. Thus, we hope this Convergence special issue on ‘Users across media’ will form an important baseline for the future development of conceptual lenses and empirical approaches to studying users across, rather than within, media.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This explorative study focuses on the performance of gender and sexuality in World of Warcraft (WoW), an online game, following Butler’s performance theory. Through interviews with female WoW players, gender and sexuality is analysed. The article argues that we cannot study gender online without also looking at sexuality. Gender performances are discussed within the framework of four themes: the avatar; strategies; sexuality, and the contextual importance of WoW. Results show that gender identity construction in WoW is an ongoing process highly dependent on the social context of play. The women interviewed created gendered and sexualized identities constrained and empowered by the rules of the game and the opportunities it offers as well as of their social relations. Although a heterosexual norm rules, there are possibilities hitherto unrecognized for queer performance within the gendered role play in WoW and the game offers the possibility of multiple and alternative performances of the self. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cyber Nuts and Bolts: Effective Participatory Online Learning, Theory and Practice",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents emergent findings from an empirical research study conducted during Covid lockdown with 52 undergraduate students at a UK university November 2020–April 2021. The research study, which adopts a teacher-practitioner stance, builds on a 2012–2019 programme of research (represented by publications including Barnard 2019) which explores the potentials and dangers that digital technologies hold for pedagogy and education. It is located in the field of Creative Writing and uses the discipline’s pedagogical practice of ‘workshopping’ as a case study. The Creative Writing workshop centres on the exchange of information and critically informed comment by participating students (generally in small groups), and, as such, has similarities with seminars in other disciplines. Hence it is hoped that this article will be of benefit both in the home discipline and more widely. The contention of this article is that, to maintain quality in the delivery of participatory online teaching, it is necessary to ensure an ongoing feedback loop between individuals’ bodily existence ‘IRL’ (‘In Real Life’) and the section of cyberspace that they carve out and inhabit collaboratively during virtual seminar groups. It considers how the cliché of the ‘digital native’ can inhibit learning and the role of affect in enabling productive online and engagement. In taking initial steps towards development of a pedagogy of affect in which a ‘neutral terrain’ is established that enables students to apply and develop close reading skills in an online environment, it presents a new theoretical position on what constitutes effective pedagogy in the context of participatory virtual classrooms. </jats:p>",

Through face-to-face, in-depth interviews of 19 high-ranking Chinese policymakers, this study provides unusual insight on these issues from an inside perspective. A ‘push and control’ internet policy suggests that the leadership has relaxed in its ideological claims, yet still wants to control online content. China has also shifted the media policymaking process from the Party to government operation. The Party's road map for economic prosperity has been a key driving force in this shift and ensures that internet policy is heading in a positive direction, though it is not straightforward. Finally, the policymakers’ attitudes toward the new media and value transformation have had a significant influence on policy formation. The study proved premises from both communication and development and media dependency theories with regard to the case of the internet in China. It is the first research project of its kind on the topic. </jats:p>",

However, success was constrained by the centralised-services architecture and applications of the time, and by undue belief in the revolutionary potential of the technology. A decentralised approach, both in technology and in applications, enabled the success of the World Wide Web - and proved many early predictors to be prescient about applications that would be popular on an interactive network. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on in-depth interviews with users of Netflix and the local streaming service BluTV as well as analysis of press releases, and original TV series produced by these platforms, this study explores the emergence and impact of Video on Demand (VOD) in Turkey. It examines how VOD is adopted, negotiated, reformulated, and received in a non-Western context where global and local VOD platforms compete, substitute and emulate each other. We ask the following research question: What are Turkish audiences’ social, psychological and technological needs and expectations from global and local VOD platforms? In order to respond to this question, we explore Turkish audiences’ insight into what VOD means to them and offers them as content, in comparison with platforms’ marketing discourse. The article argues that a) the local content that platforms offer is a central juncture through which audiences articulate their larger expectations from VODs, and b) Netflix’s localization attempts do not always correspond with the audience demand, it is heavily critiqued and at times rejected by the local audience. The findings of this research indicate that the expectations, needs, and gratifications of Netflix and VOD audiences depend on three factors: Their interpretation of VODs’ local content in relation to their cultural experience with broadcast TV, their technological needs such as instant access to global content and time/space shifting opportunities, and lastly the political context and policies such as the internet regulation and censorship. The significance of this is study is in showing, as distinct from the abundant literature on localization of Netflix, the complexity of local taste. Audiences’ evaluation of a VOD is shaped simultaneously by multiple factors including their experiences with network TV, other VODs, media regulations as well as informal networks/piracy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of data to profile and make decisions about data subjects for citizenship, targeted advertising, job recruitment and other reasons, has been eminently normalised, which is an emerging threat to protected spaces for personal subjectivation and identity formation. The ‘right to the subject’; or to agency via personal subject formation outside bilateral profiling; is at stake. This is especially true for workers. Algorithmic management infused with worker control mechanisms occurs in structurally and objectively unequal conditions within subjective, and unequal, social relations. Data harms protections in European privacy and data protection law, despite being heralded as the strongest in the world, are insufficient to protect workers’ right to the subject. Indeed, structural features of inequality within the capitalist data political economy mean that workers experience different power relations to consumers and citizens. Analysing the social relations surrounding policy features of ‘consent’, and ‘risk’, with focus on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the negotiations for the AI Act, it is not difficult to see that these policies do not protect all data subjects’ rights to the subject identically. Indeed, workers never have the capacity to truly consent at work; and the risks workers face are different from that of other data subjects, such as consumers. Data subjects do not, across categories, have equal access to equality, within, and because of, the social relations of data production. From a cross-disciplinary perspective and with contributions to sociology, critical theory, media and policy studies, this article argues that workers’ right to the subject is at stake, in datafied social relations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a wide range of interest in gamification – with game design elements being used in an increasing number of non-game contexts. Yet, despite these developments, there has been little interest from the academic community in the potential opportunities that gamification presents in the research context. Law in Children’s Lives is an innovative project that has explored the use of a specially designed tablet-based game, Adventures with Lex, as a data collection tool. The game, developed using participatory design techniques, has been used as a means to investigate children’s perceptions of the law in their everyday lives. This article presents a case study of the processes and challenges involved in the development of the game which leads to a discussion of the implications of this study for the wider use of game-based research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores thumb-typing as a cultural technique stemming from the mutual development of typing interfaces and practices. Focusing on the work of the typing fingers, it examines how the assignment of thumbs to be the primary writing digits is an innovation that correlates—and in some respects causes—textual and social changes that are central to digital culture. It argues that thumb-typing embodies recursive relations between behavioral patterns, technological infrastructure, and textual creation. The analysis shows how the invention of the typewriter keyboard introduced the fingers to typing, and how developments of digital media refined the finger-work in interacting with the device, resulting in thumb-typing. The new functionality of the thumb as an executing rather than supporting finger, promotes a novel equivalency and interchangeability in finger employment to typing. This, I propose, problematizes traditional concepts of textuality, its performance, and authorship. </jats:p>",

The lack of a consistently reliable revenue stream and failure to satisfy information needs are two major reasons why. Of concern is displacing existing revenue streams with a new medium. This study, the first to look at industry trade publishing on the internet, is an attempt to find out whether recipients of daily email news updates from furniture industry trade publication Furniture/Today spend less time with the weekly print edition. To find the answer, 678 recipients via email of FurniturelToday's eDaily news update each morning were surveyed in March 2001.

Created by a group of young adults at Knowle West Media Centre in Bristol, the project follows three teenagers with the aim to change perceptions of social isolation. This interactive documentary was used as a resource in a Critical Media Literacy intervention which deployed the methodology of Participatory Action Research and took place in Coventry in partnership with the creative production company Imagineer. Based on the outcomes of this research, I argue towards a Pedagogy of Difference 2.0, which is a new and more nuanced approach to teaching and learning with interactive media in complex environments. This innovative pedagogy embraces the limitations of interactivity on young people’s media production and does not take young people’s familiarity with technology for granted. In this regard, Pedagogy of Difference 2.0 acknowledges the contextual nature of teaching and learning, moving beyond the often abstract discourse of Critical Pedagogy. </jats:p>",

From its formation in 1998 until 2009, when the US Department of Commerce effectively released the corporation from its official supervision, ICANN assembled a regime for the management of digital identity, which is itself an infrastructure for a global identity industry. By adopting an infrastructural disposition, this article situates global Internet governance in relation to the academic corpus on digital identity, interrogating the discursive conditions by which we have come to understand ourselves in relation to the Internet’s most basic addressing schema, the enclosures within which all virtual communities congregate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2014, Google announced a new initiative for its Cultural Institute. Called the Street Art Project, the online database was seen by many (Google included) as a continuation of the Google Art Project, in that it sought to make street art from around the world more easily accessible to interested audiences. The company acknowledged that such art was temporary, and that, by virtue of the artwork’s eventual disappearance, it would eventually become an important record of preservation for the practice. However, in its focus on the physical artwork, the project unwittingly highlights a problematic trend in street art’s protection as intangible heritage: one where its safeguard often becomes overpowered by the tangibility of its material elements. Exploring Google Street Art through the lens of Melbourne, a city that has long negotiated with street art and graffiti as forms of cultural heritage, this article outlines the consequences of such tangibility for the intangible artwork. It argues that any protection of intangible heritage requires a tacit acknowledgement of the subjectivity which surrounds its experience: those community reactions and responses whose wide variability help define that heritage as something intangible. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile applications for transgender voice training seek to help trans people alter their speaking voices, often with the goal of alignment with one or another pole of binary gender expression (i.e., voice ‘feminization’ or ‘masculinization’). These apps offer instruction, audio tools and feedback mechanisms that allow users to record, evaluate and track their progress relative to a desired – and gendered – goal. As with digital technologies generally, however, these apps draw on and reproduce particular ideas of both the needs and capacities of imagined users and broader social and political phenomena – in this case, voice, gender expression and gender transition. In the following paper, we undertake a critical discourse analysis of five mobile voice training apps for transgender people. We find that rather than offering expansive or open-ended conceptions of gender, these apps reproduce ideals of gender as not only binary but also white, affluent and able-bodied. We also offer a critique of the apps’ characterization of transition as reifying the normative authority of clinical and technoscientific knowledge and conditioning ‘authenticity’ on an ability to conform to (racialized, classed and ableist) binary gender norms. </jats:p>",

This article examines this situation, looking at what remix now means when it is, for the most part, just an accepted part of the media landscape. I argue that remix should be looked at from an ethnographic point of view, focused on how and why remixes are used. To that end, this article identifies three ways of conceptualizing remix, based on intention rather than content: the aesthetic, communicative, and conceptual forms. It explores the history of (talking about) remix, looking at the tension between seeing remix as a form of art and remix as a mode of ‘talking back’ to the media, and how those tensions can be resolved in looking at the different ways remix originated. Finally, it addresses what ubiquitous remix might mean for the way we think about archival material, and the challenges this brings for archives themselves. In this way, this article updates the study of remix for a time when remix is everywhere. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2011, sports media outlet ESPN launched Grantland.com , a sports and popular culture Web site edited by blogger-turned-ESPN.com columnist Bill Simmons. Taking inspiration from magazines like GQ and Esquire, the Web site specializes in long-form journalism; boasts a roster of noteworthy writers and editors who established their renown in print media; and is named after Grantland Rice, the ‘Dean of American Sports Writers’ whose work composes the foundation of America’s sports writing canon. Moreover, it teamed with the hip, independent publisher McSweeney’s to produce Grantland Quarterly, a collection of the Web site’s best works packaged as books. Grantland.com and Grantland Quarterly use print’s relative prestige among media to situate ESPN’s online content as exceptionally literary. This essay uses Simmons and Grantland’s engagements with print to examine and critique ESPN’s transmedia efforts to cultivate prestige that broadens its demographic reach and sustains its carefully crafted institutional identity as ‘The Worldwide Leader in Sports’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / The playing of computer games in the home is ubiquitous in contemporary life. Research that examines young children’s computer use confirms that playing computer games is a dominant form of activity. While computer game playing has important social effects for children, how children accomplish their social activity during computer use is very much taken for granted in the game-playing literature. This article addresses young children’s computer game playing through a detailed analysis of two children’s interaction while playing a Wiggles game in their home. Conversation analysis is employed to describe and explicate the social accomplishment of playing the game through a sequential analysis of data. Discussion considers the local organization of the game, its occasioned complexity, and the management of identity-related activities during game playing. The study provides a description of the ways that social interaction accomplishes the children’s game playing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This conversation started in Prague, the Czech Republic, during a panel moderated by Irena Reifová at the symposium ‘On Empowered and Impassioned Audiences in the Age of Media Convergence’. The event was organized by the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University. The text contains a series of discussions. First, there is a conversation about the nature of the participatory democratic utopia and participatory culture and how groups take (or do not take) advantage of the affordances of new and emerging media. It also emphasizes the political nature and potential of popular culture and touches upon its connection to institutionalized politics. Three other key areas are mentioned: the role of different cultures of leadership, the significance of organizations in structuring participatory processes, and the need to enhance civic learning, providing more support for participatory cultures. This is combined with an interlocking discussion about the definition of participation and how it is tied up with power. It covers the differences between participation and interaction, engagement, interpretation, production, curation, and circulation. Finally, there is an underlying strand of discussion about the role of academia, focusing on the relationship between critical theory and cultural studies, the need to deconstruct our own frameworks and the question of which language to use to communicate academic research to the public. </jats:p>",

By bringing to the forefront concepts of how subjectivity and sexuality are produced within the computer/internet apparatus, I hope to diversify the focus in cyberporn research away from social science approaches and pre-Foucauldian assumptions of the subject that obscure understandings of new media and cyberporn use. Through a summary of visual culture studies and reception studies of pornography, I argue that cyberporn must be understood as contingent within the encoding and decoding processes and discourses of sexuality in which it is produced and consumed. My focus here is the home office/terminal as the site of reception/cyberporn use. While there is potential for a great variety of critical cultural approaches to the study of new media, pornography, and sexuality, I end with specific suggestions for researching cyberporn reception. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates a redefined socio-cultural role of European public service broadcasting as an infrastructure of translation in times of globalization, migration and the proliferation of new media providers. Drawing upon research into multilingual broadcasting in Europe and Australia, and in particular a case study of Special Broadcasting Service Australia (SBS), it argues for an ongoing relevance of European public service broadcasting (PSB), albeit within wider conceptions of translingual, transnational or European citizenship. It is proposed that of the two versions of translation, institutional in the EU and mediated in Australia respectively, the mediated version has achieved higher success in communicating diversity across hybrid communities. The main point raised here is the importance of `connections' and, within the framework of `cultural diversity' and `multilingualism' in Europe, arguably at the expense of `Europeanness'. The concept of translation allows thought beyond a single language but also beyond diversity and towards interlingual communication and `mutual intelligibility'. As such it is useful to inform a community-building media policy for Europe as a necessary alternative to the historically dominant top-down EU language policy. </jats:p>",

This paper tries to explore some of these issues by discussing the type of activity involved in offline and online affairs. A central contention of this paper is that most online affairs are more similar to flirting than to actual sexual affairs.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The case of the 2010 municipal elections in Calgary, Canada, is used here to explore the discursive construction of social media in relation to political engagement. This article examines the way in which 59 undergraduate students at the University of Calgary discuss political engagement through Facebook and Twitter. Participants enthusiastically constructed a vision of ‘engagement’ fostered by social media’s alleged intrinsic features. Social media, it was argued, create a feeling of community, provide access to information as well as the ability to share it, and open up new means of building personal connections between politicians and citizens. In this articulation, social media appeared as both the tool that produced engagement and the space where this engagement unfolded. The focus of the article is on questioning the implications of this discursive construction by asking what political possibilities are opened up or closed down in this articulation? The construction of social media as the solution to the problems of democracy remains highly problematic, yet also indicative of a deep preoccupation with the conditions of modern life, and particularly the desire to find solutions to the increased complexity of the social systems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The rapid and ongoing advances in technology are leading to significant transformations in the world, making it even more connected. The educational sector is also responding by developing new models to face and adopt these changes. Learners are exposed to new media technologies which have set the scene for more collaboration, participation and engagement in the learning environment. As research points towards an eagerness for the acceptance of social media in developing countries, there is a need to further explore its implication for education. In an era of globalization which creates more association among universities from developed nations and small island developing states (SIDS), the significance of investigating learners’ social media engagement level is even greater. This article documents the development of a Learner Social Media Engagement Level model for higher education institutions in SIDS based on a research in Mauritius. The analysis results in the identification of five main levels of participation, namely Curator, Consumer, Communicator, Collaborator and Producer. The article concludes with the social profile of each category of learner and highlights how the small state experience could be significant for a wider international community. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Jenny Wolmark is correct when she states at the outset of her Reader on feminist theory, cyborgs, and cyberspace that ’[o]ver the past ten years or so, there has been a great deal of general interest within feminist and cultural theory in two related but distinct metaphors, that of cyberspace, and the cyborg’ (p. 1). She sees cyberculture and cybertheory as social phenomena that have moved beyond science fiction and film studies to offers tools to a broader political project of theorising our relationship with a variety of information technologies. She offers an interesting collection of texts exploring feminism, embodiment, technology, and postmodern subjectivity.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Bleeding Through: Layers of Los Angeles 1920—1986, is a DVD-ROM produced under the auspices of the Labyrinth Project at the University of Southern California, and directed by the scholar/artist Norman Klein. Drawing on hundreds of photographs, newspaper clippings and films from the archives of USC, and the Los Angeles Public Library, among other sources, this DVD offers us the chance to reconsider our understanding and vision of Southern California. This database narrative proposes a multi-perspectived and critically informed exploration of Los Angeles, which to this day remains surprisingly unexamined. This article analyses this unconventional project and examines its objectives. Klein's experimental flânerie invites us to a renewed urban experience that relies on a set of distinctive formal characteristics. I will therefore discuss this project's exploration of mediatic combinations, and its resistance to narrative closure, in order to demonstrate that Klein tries to reinvent the way to engage with art and to write history. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While academic blogging has emerged as a distinct genre in the past few years (Walker, 2006), a notable gap exists between those who blog from secure positions within the profession and PhD and junior faculty bloggers whose employment status is more marginal. This article draws on subcultural theory to discuss the unique features of these two latter types and the functions they serve for their authors. The analysis demonstrates that blogs are important sites of support for those who aspire to and currently work in academia at the same time as they are a powerful indictment of the job conditions experienced therein. The article therefore concludes by suggesting that the positive aspects of collegiality and solace taking place online for a new generation of scholars risk remaining disconnected from an effective labour politics — one that could change the very nature of the grievances blogs appear so well designed to express. </jats:p>",

How might publishers’ traditional role as gatekeepers of literary culture be similarly usurped in an environment characterized by networked books, wiki-novels and fictional ‘rip and burn’ practices?

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyses YouTube videos about delivery riders in Spain as well as the channels in which the videos were uploaded. The aim is to understand the ways that riders are represented in the videos and determine the labour imaginaries that emerge in the context of platformization, which includes work that depends on platforms that use computer architecture and automation systems to arrange exchanges between people, goods, and corporations, such as the work of delivery riders. This article shows how platformization of labour intersects with cultural production because delivery riders’ work has become a video theme in the YouTube platform. Moreover, in some cases riders (or aspiring ones) use YouTube and other social media to interact, share knowledge and organize their job. Based on a thematic analysis of delivery riders' YouTube videos ( n = 40) from 26 channels mined with YouTube Data Tools, this study presents a typology of channels in which riders appear. It also categorizes the main representations of riders as well as the imaginaries that emerge about this type of labour in YouTube videos. The analysis indicates that delivery riders’ work has a transitory nature, which is expressed in the analysed videos. Moreover, the study demonstrates that immigrants are the people who tend to do this type of work in Spain, and shows how being an immigrant plays a particular role in the way riders are represented or gain their social conceptions and aspirations about this kind of work. </jats:p>",

Based on the field trials of the interdisciplinary LocaNews project, the article discusses locative media’s potential for spatially sensitive news journalism. </jats:p><jats:p> In 2009 researchers in Norway made a medium design called LocaNews, and tested it out with pre-planned procedures for the two fundamental activities: production and reception. Of those who participated, 12 people worked as journalists, editors, technicians, and they generated 93 journalistic stories that were read and watched by 32 test-users who were interviewed. The present article deals with findings regarding the production of news content, and presents the strategies used to reinterpret the traditional news criteria of journalism to be fit for a GPS-equipped smartphone. First, the article discusses the connection between journalism and cartography, and then introduces the experimental method used for this research. The bulk of the article consists of an evaluation of the experimental attempt at practising location-dependent journalism. It deals with four issues: putting stories on the map, the characteristics of ‘zoom in stories’, the construction of an implied position for the readers, and finally the formulation of news criteria that focus on spatial proximity instead of temporal actuality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Conflict within local communities is an under-researched theme in Community Informatics (CI). This article therefore aims to contribute to the development of CI as a field of study by analysing forms of internal conflict within Moseley Egroup — a CI initiative developed in Moseley, Birmingham (UK). Ultimately it is argued that conflict is an inherent part of local community and is important to CI for a number of reasons. Conflict impacts on the appropriation and social shaping of internet technology by local communities, and has broader implications on the extent to which CI regenerates localities and empowers citizens. In this sense conflict is identified as a productive force, shaping and reshaping both local community and internet projects mobilized in its name. Conflict also draws attention to the contested and mutable relationship that exists in CI between the online spaces that are created and the localities they are set up to serve. It is concluded that conflict and forms of social struggle within communities should form a central part of the developing CI research agenda. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses the theoretical and historical implications of three dimensions (3D) by revisiting Marshall McLuhan’s famous distinction between ‘hot’ and ‘cool’ media. McLuhan’s characterization of cinema as a ‘hot’ medium relies on its capacity to produce ‘high-definition’ imagery, and the pursuit of 3D in cinema in the 20th century had to do with approximating the total vision that only cinema was expected to offer in comparison with television as a ‘cool’ medium marked by a ‘low-definition’ image. By contrast, today’s resurgence of 3D in its digital form signals that high definition, hitherto regarded as specific to cinema, now involves other screens and interfaces that operate under the logic of media convergence and invite their users’ multisensory behaviors. In this context, we argue that this pervasiveness of 3D across different platforms, including mainstream digital 3D cinema, is symptomatic of the broader tendency of contemporary culture to become ‘hotter’ (i.e. to intensify human senses) and that certain experimental films provide an antidote to the tendency by incorporating low-definition images and offering the viewer a perceptual distance from which to reflect on their status. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The limits of transactional identity: Whiteness and embodiment in digital facial replacement",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Focusing on a series of YouTube creators, this essay interrogates the persistence of the hegemonic power of the white male hardbody, arguing that digital facial replacements – in particular those of 1980s action stars – produce a mode of white, masculine identity that is essentially exchangeable and transactional. These bodies are capitalist commodities, fundamentally interchangable and asserting the same bundle of ideological traits. The technology of digital facial replacement allows creators to visualize this exchange value. As opposed to the pornographic, invasive, and misogynistic face swap videos originally posted on reddit.com by user ‘deepfakes’ in 2017, the facial replacement videos found on YouTube are more playful in nature, imagining alternate histories and using face swapping as a mode of comedy. This case study of 1980s action stars opens up to a broader examination of issues of identity in digital facial replacement. In the videos under analysis, gender swaps are relatively common, but ethnic swaps are scarce. The reluctance of the YouTubers to ‘blindcast’ their revisionist videos reveals a subtle critique of the fantasy of a post-racial world. Racial difference – and, perhaps, cultural specificity – remains intact, and the creators take a seemingly apolitical, comical, ‘safe’ approach to identity rather than an explicitly critical stance. By denuding the more threatening and destructive aspects of deepfakes, these YouTube videos produce a more palatable version of facial replacement. This version, however, is no less ideologically complex than its more explicitly political and misogynistic counterparts. These contemporary facial substitutions not only continue to ‘reboot’ white male hegemony, but they also function as an ideological reclamation of masculine power in the present through modified images of the (revisionist) past. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "New media technologies, especially mobile technologies, have come to the fore in the public eye on the recent wave of global protests. However, it is not the technologies themselves that have enabled the uprisings from the Arab Spring to the Occupy Wall Street Movement to #YoSoy132; it is the new algorithms, organizational structures, and unique gatherings that have given rise to technological innovation and the repurposing of existing tools. John Postill, in this special issue of Convergence, calls this phenomenon ‘protest formulas’: ‘the unique compound of societal forces [ . . . ] that characterizes each protest movement’. Entirely organic structures, these new protest formulas morph, realign, and reconstitute in each context through their specific constellation of actors. The scope of the protests and their technological contexts addressed in this issue’s articles reveals the utter fluidity and adaptability of protest in the networked world of the 21st century. The ‘global crowd’, as Susan Buck-Morss (2014) calls it, and countercultural insurgency supported by independent and social media have played a pivotal role in political change at least since the arrival of accessible networked communication. When the Canadian anticapitalist magazine Adbusters posted a call to arms on its blog on July 13, 2011, with the creation of the hashtag #occupywallstreet, Adbusters’ founder Kalle Lasn called on the magazine’s network to implement what he called a ‘Shift in Revolutionary Tactics’. Inspired by the radical revolt in Spain with the Indignados and in Egypt with the Arab Spring, he invoked protestors to occupy that soon-to-be-famous square at the center of the financial world. Within 2 weeks, the call had gone viral and the revolution began in Zuccotti Park on September 17. The origin of the revolution and the spirit at its heart, however, originated not from the Middle East or from Spain but from Mexico from contemporary protest’s spiritual progenitors, the Zapatistas. The media-savvy tactics the Mayan Zapatistas initiated on January 1, 1994, in protest of North American Free Trade Agreement were at that time a revolutionary form of protest that sought not to pull down regimes but to restore a voice and dignity to a people. These new methods have been powerfully influential. In her debates piece in this",

    "abstract": "This issue of Convergence opens with an extended special Debates section, edited by Irena Reifová and Jaroslav Švelch, which – as they explain in their Introduction – brings together a selection of papers resulting from a symposium they held in June 2012 in Prague. At the heart of the symposium was discussion about and investigation of media audience ‘participation’ in the digital era, which generated post-symposium the wide ranging and illuminating conversation between Henry Jenkins and Nico Carpentier that opens and frames the Debates section. In particular, the symposium organisers, together with Jenkins and Carpentier, were keen to not only interrogate the ‘grand narratives’ that have emerged in the ‘age of media convergence’ but perhaps more importantly focus in more depth on the kinds of participation that have developed, under what circumstances and for what purpose. In both Jenkins and Carpentier’s opening conversation and the shorter pieces that follow, the contributors to this special Debates section explore a wide range of participatory practices, from those with more overtly political aims, like the Invisible Children group discussed by Jenkins, through to the supposedly more playful, ‘just for fun’ Bollywood flash mobs studied by Sangita Shresthova. However, what emerges from these Debates is the complexity of participatory practices. For instance, it involves Jenkins and Carpentier in a detailed discussion of how we define ‘participation’ – and related terms such as interaction, engagement, interpretation and access – and prompts recognition by Jenkins that inequality of access to technological infrastructure, opportunities, skills and knowledge make it more difficult for some groups to participate than others, while Carpentier asserts that full participatory culture will never be realised. But the Debates section also raises the thorny issue of participation in what? As Jenkins notes, although many new platforms, such as YouTube, describe themselves as participatory, the emphasis remains on individual self-expression rather than facilitating or supporting a participatory community based on shared values. In the course of their conversation, Jenkins acknowledges that his research tends to start with specific case studies and look for conceptual tools to explain what’s being observed, whereas Carpentier begins with abstract definitions and assesses their applicability to specific cases. Yet editors Reifová and Švelch argue that their Debates section precisely demonstrates that our",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Criticism of commercial drones as violators of personal privacy or unsafe public annoyances continues to influence public and academic discourse. At the same time, the commercial drone’s benefits for humanitarian, conservation, industry, and emissions-reduced delivery have also become evident. That such a powerful technology which enhances vision, movement, and force-from-afar could have ambivalent properties appears contradictory. Drawing from the physics and diplomatic work of Niels Bohr, the article argue that drone dualities are complementary rather than contradictory. This theory of complementarity is supported by Bernard Stiegler’s theories including technicity, which argues for hominization or the coevolutionary complementarity of humans and technology, and pharmacology, a bifurcation of technicity into complementary sanitive and poisonous possibilities. This article brings complementarity into the present by linking it to the theory of technoliberalism which situates technicity’s bifurcation in the context of liberalism, namely, the complementary relationship between social liberalism for the collective good and economic liberalism for market benefit. This theory of technoliberal complementarity is examined through ethnographic research into humanitarian, conservation, and economic dronework on the Indonesian islands of Bali, West Papua, and Java in 2018. Complementarity does not elide the importance of dissonance. Instead, it reframes it as a result of interdependent tensions, not their opposition. In this manner, complementarity is a synthetic theory about the generative frictions inherent in technocultural production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The talking book offers a case study in the transition of cultural forms into new media. As the technology for recording books has developed from sound recording into the downloading of books from the internet, the encounter between new technologies and literary texts has implications for cultural and literary theory. This article offers an analysis of the talking book, with a particular emphasis on the novel. Although books on tape did arouse some media interest around the 75th anniversary of the production of the first recorded novel, Agatha Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, there has to date been no academic research on the growing phenomenon of books on tape. This article begins by charting a history of the talking book, from the first tape recordings for the Royal National Institute of the Blind to the impact of the MP3 player and the iPod. It makes use of Raymond Williams' work on television and of Stuart Hall and Paul De Gay's case study of the Sony Walkman as offering methodologies for the analysis of new technologies as sites of cultural contest, and develops this work into a study of the recorded book. The article also employs a textual analysis of the catalogues and websites used to promote the talking book as a commodity. The study demonstrates that the talking book, as with other forms of cultural encounters with new technologies, builds on already existing categories of literary and cultural capital. </jats:p>",

The paper argues that in redefining PSB, it is difficult to reconcile cultural and market objectives, and that the situation is further complicated by the involvement of the European Union and its concern for fair trading and competition. </jats:p>",

With the launch of digital broadcasting in many European states, the key drivers were considered to be its subscription and pay-per-view components. Little attention has been given to content policy.

Such provisions will be subject to equitable and non-discriminatory access on each network.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the hybrid ontologies that typify networked and mobile location-based games, exploring some of the phenomenological, embodied or somatic aspects of the practices and perceptions of ‘mixed reality’ game-play. In particular, it focuses on the potential cultural and corporeal effects of mobile gaming since the introduction of the iPhone and subsequent touchscreens, and the specific technosomatic arrangements such devices demand in everyday life. Mobile media and game-play in both urban and domestic places evoke particular kinds of embodiment, indicative of emergent habitual and quotidian behaviours, gesturings, positionings and choreographies of the body, at times partially determined by the culture of the user, at others by the technical specificities and demands of the interface. Location-based mobile games and applications also modify our experience and perception of ‘being online’, and effectively disassemble the actual/virtual dichotomy of internet ‘being’ into a complex and dynamic range of modalities of presence. Finally, this article suggests that the kind of ontological and ‘containment’ metaphors we use to describe the space of screen-based game-play — in particular, the magic circle, and tropologies of the screen as a fixed window or frame — are ill-suited as descriptors for the complex layering of material and virtual contexts specific to mobile location-based and mixed reality gaming. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates how the home is performed by two differing groups of women in Australia through gendered care practices and domestic representations in digital spaces. Specifically, it examines the ways Australian women craft bloggers use Instagram and older Filipina-Australians use Facebook to enact diverse modes of mediated care in and beyond the home setting. The analysis draws on two separate ethnographic studies. The first study involved six Australian women to investigate their craft blogging practices on Instagram from 2014 to 2019 where they engaged their varying sized online audiences ranging from 1000 to more than 100,000 followers. The second study included 15 older Filipina-Australians in Victoria, Australia in March 2023 to understand their digital care practices using Facebook to maintain transnational connections among family members and peers. The studies utilised in-person research interviews, visual methods and a digital ethnography. This article extends the model of the moral economy of the household to highlight a range of mediated domestic and care practices carried out across physical and digital spaces shaped by gendered labour practices, transborder care expectations and digital platform affordances. These practices reveal the role of the home as a site and symbol for these different groups in negotiating the tensions of the unequal division of social reproduction and care within the Globalised Care Chain. </jats:p>",

Yet, little research has been done on their aesthetic and formal attributes, especially on how they operate within the frameworks of the attention economy and embodied interaction specific to social media interfaces. This paper examines recipe videos published on Tasty, one of the most popular Facebook pages in the world. We analyze these videos through a three-dimensional model that integrates their semiotic characteristics (visual, auditory, and textual), their interactive and haptic qualities, and their invitation to perceptual engagement and sensorimotor response. We conclude that Facebook recipe videos are exemplary of a broader category of social media videos which we call hyper-sensory videos: these create heightened multisensory experiences that take precedence over informational use or narrative involvement. Hyper-sensory videos present a cultural response to broader questions regarding materiality, presence, and embodied relations within a highly mediated social reality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although digital radio broadcasting has undergone significant development over the last quarter-century, no single protocol is poised to break out as a bona fide replacement for traditional analogue radio services. This article illuminates the history and status of radio’s digital transition in an effort to understand its stagnancy. The current state of affairs is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of regulatory engagement with the transition, political and economic shifts in the balance of power between the various broadcaster constituencies involved, and the recalcitrance of receiver manufacturers and listeners to adopt any digital radio broadcast technology. The questions raised by the technologically agnostic nature of radio’s digital malaise beg for deeper scrutiny by media scholars, especially those involved in broadcast research as well as technology and policy studies. </jats:p>",

A detailed analysis is undertaken of the online responses to a 2013 Facebook post by the United States Ambassador to Australia, chastizing Australians for their ‘illegal’ behaviour. This analysis is used to critique the dominant framing of the activities of file-sharing, torrenting and unauthorized downloading as criminal and those involved in the activity as being influenced by sociological factors. In contrast, the research found that many of the justifications for these behaviours contained in the Facebook comments demonstrated an informed critique of the market mechanisms at work in the distribution networks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "States: France, Germany and the UK. The main premise of the book is that although technological change is often assumed to promote policy convergence and globalisation and Europeanisation to erode the importance of national policy-making, broadcasting policy has resisted this trend due to the cultural and political significance of the industry at the national level. Levy argues that, as cross-national broadcasting is not yet a reality and since legislation remains national, attempts by the European Commission to legislate the broadcasting market have thus far had limited success. His analysis adopts an intergovernmentalist approach which sees Commission policy as having been steered and sometimes blocked by three dominant EU Member States: France, Germany and the UK. The book is divided into four parts. The first presents an overview of the technological changes in the broadcasting market that Levy views as driving legislative change. The second part covers the regulation of analogue television by the European Commission and the three Member States, focusing on the different ways in which cultural and political factors have shaped national legislation. Part Three examines the",

In the field of cultural heritage it is often difficult to access archival materials from public institutions and overcome barriers to what could and should be mutually enriching relationships. In this context, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has traditionally been seen as a problematic institution – publicly funded and immeasurably rich – yet distant and patrician. Working with Head of BBC Archive Development Tony Ageh, the project team is focusing on issues such as copyright and institutional voice as a means of facilitating a more open and collaborative audience relationship. As part of our current dialogue, we have also been examining the traditions within the BBC that might act as a block to these activities. Our initial conclusion is that a major part of the problem lies in the lack of partnership between the BBC and its licence paying audience, and we have made that a key focus of our study. This article outlines the background to the Pararchive project and the specific focus within it on the relationship between the BBC and its audiences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper traces the development of children’s multiplatform commissioning at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in the context of the digitalisation of Australian television. Whilst recent scholarship has focussed on ‘post-broadcast’ or ‘second-shift’ industrial practices, designed to engage view(s)ers with proprietary media brands, less attention has been focussed on children’s and young adults’ television in a public service context. Further, although multiplatform projects in the United States and Britain have been the subject of considerable analysis, less work has attempted to contextualise cultural production in smaller media markets. The paper explores two recent multiplatform projects through textual analysis, empirical research (consisting of interviews with key industry personnel) and an investigation of recent policy documents. The authors argue that the ABC’s mixed diet of children’s programming, featuring an educative or social developmental agenda, is complemented by its appeals to audience ‘participation’, with the Corporation maintaining public service values alongside the need to expand audience reach and the legitimacy of its brand. It finds that the ABC’s historical platform infrastructure, across radio, television and online, have allowed it to move beyond a market failure model to exploit multiplatform synergies competitively in the distribution of Australian children’s content to audiences on-demand. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The appearance of the blogging platform created a new epistolary form for writers, with an inbuilt means of instant publication. Blog fiction could be serialized in real time, distributed between multiple online spaces and supplemented in commentary sections by other bloggers, real and fictional. Bad Influences (Segar, 2013a) was an experimental blog fiction making narrative use of these distributions in time, space and authorship (Walker Rettberg, 2004) as well as many other formal blog characteristics, including character avatars, interactive quizzes, aggregated feeds and blog design elements. As the story progressed, it became apparent that the processes of writing, reading and interacting, both within and outside of the text, created relations between the writer/creator and readers/participants who were an essential factor in the realization of the narrative. This led to the conclusion that blog fiction has a relational poetics. Coined by van Rooden (2011) after Bourriaud’s Relational Aesthetics (2002), this term is used here to describe a narrative process that relies on the human relations surrounding the text as much as on the text itself. Similarly relational forms of fiction are developing on the newer social networks, particularly Twitter, and transmediality holds yet more potential. </jats:p>",

Theorists Erwin Panofsky (1991) and William Ivins (1975) to Lev Manovich (1993) and Don Ihde (2009) have argued that the emergence of Renaissance perspective structured a new relationship between the image and the object: contributing to the initiation of industrialisation and science. Whilst Manovich describes the impacts of Renaissance perspective in terms of its effect upon scientific and industrial structures, Jean Louis Comolli has argued that its advent was both a cause and a consequence of a shift to a humanist social regime. This article argues that Google Earth and its corollaries now complicate the visual and discursive constitution of the cultural and ecological environment. The contemporary computer-generated ‘visual nominalism’ of Google Earth results in a photomapped representation of the earth that can elevate environmental awareness through visualised data sets at the same time as it reduces the earth to a product design–engineered object. As Comolli’s Machines of the Visible becomes Machinima of the Visible, this article asks whether public and scientific calls for a turn towards geoengineering can be viewed through a product design–engineered interface that reconstitutes the social machine as an engineer of the earth object itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how the digitally manipulated family photograph functions as a means of understanding the temporal instability of the use and interpretations of photographic images. It begins by taking a close look at scholarly debates on how ‘credible’ the documentary value of a still photograph is, as well as how it is able to emotionally resonate with spectators. From this discussion, it becomes important to look at a key example of how an image can produce an emotional effect on a viewer; in this case, photographs of individuals’ deceased family members. While exploring how this allows the spectator to reconnect with their relatives, it is also crucial to acknowledge that readings of images like these are often determined by reductive interpretations of their stillness. As the consideration of photographs as ‘documents’ has been contested for an extensive amount of time, it is illuminating to turn to the properties of digital photography by inspecting the photo manipulation feature ‘Deep Nostalgia’ on the MyHeritage app that circulated around TikTok in 2021. I look at a YouTube compilation of people reacting to seeing photographs of their family manipulated in a way that gives the impression that they are moving and emoting, alongside discussions about this in recent pop culture articles. By taking a Barthesian reading of the extended temporality of these family photographs, it is important to recognise that the connection between the subject and the image is severed both iconically and indexically from its original context. However, by understanding this photographic image in the context of being digital it must be understood differently. I will therefore use the MyHeritage phenomenon as a means of arguing that the digital image is not inferior to the ‘realism’ of analogue photography and must, instead, be read in relation to the history of technological change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The digitalization of culture and creative industries has presented both challenges and opportunities. To effectively engage audiences and ensure their constant interest, these industries must continually adapt their circulation strategies. The objectives of this study are threefold: 1) analyze the strategies employed by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to engage with the fan community; 2) examine the interplay between fiction and reality based on the relationships between characters and actors, as shown in social network posts; and 3) determine how the discourse in the film ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ is reconstructed on TikTok, leveraging its particular ‘affordances’ (Gibson, 1979). A mixed methodology approach was utilized, combining the use of Analisa.io software to provide a comprehensive view of the Spider-Man official account’s activities and user engagement with a detailed analysis of the thematic, multimodal, and discursive aspects of TikTok videos published by the account. The findings reveal that the MCU employs TikTok as a marketing tool for the new movie, utilizing three main strategies that align with the characteristics of transmedia storytelling and enhanced audience engagement: 1) strategic selection of publication moments for the growth of follower engagement; 2) extensive use of teasers; and 3) leveraging the presence of actors as a key element to facilitate fan identification. </jats:p>",

Such a debate has, for instance, been ongoing in the pages of this very journal.’ The notion of ’interactivity’ has become an elusive object of scrutiny. indeed, interactivity is no longer attractive in itself. Rather it is the design of that interactive work which is crucial, how its pathings relate to the content and aesthetics, and more importantly, how the choices made by the viewer feed back to them through the text.

The first part examines the advantages and drawbacks of digital switchover, and identifies a number of challenges and policy dilemmas of making switchover an achievable objective. Part two presents an overview of current developments of digital television in the UK and outlines various measures proposed for encouraging digital take-up. The third and final part deals with the contribution of the new BBC services to digital take-up, considers free terrestrial platform Freeview’s likely effect on commercial rivals, and assesses the effectiveness of the proposed free satellite platform FreeSat to accelerate digital adoption. The paper concludes that the new digital BBC services have played a significant role in enhancing consumer interest in DTV services. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "All contributors must read the Convergence Instructions to Authors before submission. Research interest on peer-to-peer file exchange through services such as BitTorrent and file lockers such a MegaUpload have tended to view piracy as a product of legislative, criminal, behavioural or business contexts. It has often adopted a priori assumptions that consumers of pirated goods are ‘deviant’, ‘unethical’ or demonstrate consumer ‘misbehaviour’. Little work has yet approached piracy from an ethically neutral, bottom up, perspective and explored it through established literatures on routine consumption, everyday practice, and consumer engagement with cultural media and new technologies. Quantitative research on piracy has demonstrated that demand for cultural goods – such as music, videogames and films – parallels that of consumption of legal versions of those goods. Moreover, research has shown that consumers of illicit downloads are also the very same people who purchase legitimate digital goods in significant quantities. In other words, piracy is profoundly linked to the ‘doing’ and ‘experiencing’ of other forms of (legitimate) consumption, rather than standing apart from it. This special issue of Convergence seeks to bring together innovative theoretical and methodological frameworks which explore piracy through work on the socio-economics of consumption, media research and cultural policy in a manner thus far underexplored in broadening our understanding of piracy whether from a empirical, theoretical or policy relevant perspective. We invite contributions that engage with online piracy within a cultural context addressing themes including:",

    "title": "Videogame as Media Practice",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Our aim in this article is to explore videogames as new media practices, not in isolation but as part of broader media transformations related to the development of current digital technologies. Videogames are the product of a hybridization process between audiovisual media forms and game cultures, rapidly gaining popularity among kids and the elderly population. The experience of audiovisual consumption and aesthetic pleasure is enhanced by interactive and game amusement components not found in previous audiovisual genres such as cinema or TV. In fact, videogames situate `play' at the core of the audiovisual experience, introducing innovative changes in audiovisual production and reception patterns. Our proposal is that videogames introduce a new relationship between subject and representation that goes far beyond the `spectatorship' position, pointing to a playful relationship with images that may be useful for understanding new forms of media practices. Videogames, thus, as a new media practice, can be seen as an exponent of greater change not only regarding how media are produced and consumed, but also in the way leisure is organized and in the role of play in our everyday life.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This investigation of the discourse of Australian women in the ‘new media’ context of online special interest advice fora contributes to theory about the ways in which language encodes cultural practices and mediates the social construction of identity. The linguistic self-presentation of participants in 588 asynchronous written posts to wedding planning fora was analysed. Prevalent themes were identified inductively and the degree to which each identified theme was evident in the data was measured. The study uncovered ways in which group membership criteria were expressed and found that traditional ideals of feminine perfection were reinforced. A focus of the investigation was the ways in which the participants spoke about the wedding dress. At times, it was referred to using personification as though it were a proxy for a lover. On other occasions, it appeared to function as a representation of the writer’s idealized bridal self. It emerged as a highly significant cultural object which conferred a special but temporary identity.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of conspiracy theories has often taken a normative perspective. Recently, sociology and cultural studies have argued for a neutral view of conspiracy theories, urging for a nuanced understanding of conspiracy theories. Building on a growing body of scholarship addressing conspiracy theories in relational terms, this article considers the advantages of analyzing conspiracy theories as controversies or issues, as formulated in Science and Technology Studies. Our primary focus is on the political uses of castrochavismo and how the digital objects are shared and reconfigured, shaping the dynamics of the issue. The core conceptual premise is that conspiracy theories are formed as particular cases of controversies, where the factions in dispute deploy repertories, and we identify the empiricist and ironizing ones. Drawing on a data collection from Twitter, we present the case of study of castrochavismo, with a particular focus in the Colombian electoral cycle. The case highlights the importance and challenges when analyzing a conspiracy theory from the lens of controversy studies, promoting a symetrical, non-normative, research of the topic.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Concept of Narrative: An Analysis of Requiem for a Dream(.com) and Donnie Darko(.com",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article will discuss the concept of narrative and how this idea has been defined by writers from various academic specialisations such as film studies, literary studies, narratology and new media studies. This initial discussion of how narrative has variously been conceptualised leads to an analysis of several test case examples of 'official' websites from the films Donnie Darko (dir. Richard Kelly II, USA, 2001) and Requiem for a Dream (dir. Darren Aronofsky, USA, 2000), both still available at www.donniedarko.com and www.requiemforadream.com. The issue of establishing narrative in terms of its defining qualities and limits becomes important in assessing whether these particular test case websites qualify as narratives themselves and how they extend, supplement, reorient and supplant the cinematic texts. The analysis will apply various approaches and techniques from film/literary studies and narratology in an in-depth, close reading of the websites and films. In probing cases that are liminal in terms of the boundaries of narrative, the article suggests that some websites and films may be considered types of non-narrative assemblages that however still retain the emotionality and catharsis usually associated with narrative. The affective power of mainstream cinema and other media is usually assumed to be conveyed by patterns of narrative development through an arc-like, three-act structure and a highly-expected, final outcome, but this emotionalism may not be connected to narrative elements themselves. Lastly, the article will explore some of the methodological problems of analysing both film and computer media, as some writers tend to see the latter as ameliorating the supposed deficiencies of the former in way that instantiates and furthers a progressivist ideology and a technological determinism. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Analysing podcast intimacy: Four parameters",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents a case study study of a proposed analytical framework for dissecting and analysing intimacy in podcasts. The podcast medium is increasingly perceived as inherently intimate, but this discourse is still unprecise and has never been clearly outlined. It is furthermore essential to better define podcast intimacy because of its effective and widespread impact on podcasters and listeners. Over time, a self-reinforcing discourse and self-fulfilling prophecy of intimacy has built up around podcasts. Based on podcast literature (Berry, 2016; Euritt, 2023; Lindgren, 2021; Meserko, 2014; Spinelli and Dann, 2019; Swiatek, 2018) and podcast intimacy’s roots in, respectively, Web 2.0 and radio, four parameters for analysing podcast intimacy are outlined: Intimacy in listening, intimacy in what is said, intimacy in how it is said and intimacy in cross-media interactions – most significantly via social media. Each parameter contains several subcategories and questions for analysis which are collected in a schema. The schema is a tool for media researchers and students to identify how and why a podcast creates intimacy. It is also valuable for increasing the awareness of how podcasts work and impact the world. And it finally offers opportunities for podcast producers and publishers to learn more about how their podcast create intimacy and how they can attract listeners and followers through the creation of intimacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Toxicity continues to have a strong presence in online environments. This is particularly true for digital entertainment like online games. Toxicity is an important topic as it impacts game development, consumption, popularity, public perception, and player health and well-being. Most of the existing literature on toxicity in gaming is descriptive and exploratory; it often sets out to map milestones and inherent drivers of toxicity. In this article, an alternative perspective is advanced, drawing from a foundation in media and culture studies. Data (streaming online chat, user-generated content, and forum discussions) were collected daily for 4 weeks from Twitch.tv and Steam channels about the popular online game DOTA 2. Results were processed with a content analysis relying on the driving concepts of toxicity and social affordance. The case study and related platforms were selected for their relevance and pertinence with the theme addressed. Findings point to peculiar interactive patterns in framing, supporting, and overturning toxicity and resulting harassment in these extended settings. Implications are noteworthy for scholars and practitioners who intend to shed light on how diffused audiences negotiate toxicity in digital gaming and beyond. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Relocating the mobile",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> While the 20th-century media practice was marked by the focus of visual and audio screen cultures, the 21st-century media can be characterized by three key features: locative, mobile and social. With the transformation of mobile media from a communication tool into a multimodal device accompanied by global positioning systems (GPS), the significance of location-based services (LBS) has taken centre stage. Google maps, Facebook places and Foursquare are but a few of the locative media, a phenomenon creating new forms of co-presence that disrupt old binaries between online and off-line. In this transformation, a paradoxical relationship between identity, personalization and place occurs. On one hand, we see new ways for engaging with people, place and co-presence. On the other hand, we see the potential for corporations to create new levels of surveillance – a type of ‘überveillence’ – that put into question individual’s sense of privacy and identity. If ‘social networking sites don’t publicize community, they privatize it’ as Andrejevic notes, then second-generation locative media further challenge these distinctions. In this paradoxical struggle, we see that locative media highlight the pivotal role place has played in the evolution of mobile media practices. In each location, various factors such as sociocultural and technonational inform the types of media practices. One location experiencing a covert paradoxical struggle with locative media is South Korea. As one of the centres for technological innovation and tech-savvy youth, Seoul provides a fascinating case study for the tensions around localized notions of identity, privacy and sociality as it plays out through locative media. </jats:p>",

Feminists have much to say about such scientific and technological developments and the gendered logics that underpin them. In Cosmodolphins Bryld and Lykke use the cyborg as a metaphor to think with, more specifically as a matrix in which to imagine and chart a set of critical relations between the unlikely bedfellows of the dolphin, the horoscope and the spaceship. Their book is a detailed study of how discourses of the sacred and the technological overlap and intersect within and across these three tropes. They use these ’extraterrestrial’ categories, these positions of estrangement, to expose a fundamental ambivalence within",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article foregrounds the significant transformations within the nature and role of Indian intermediaries such as talent agents and multichannel networks (hereafter, MCNs) in the new screen ecology. Building on previous findings (Cunningham and Craig, 2019; Boyle, 2018 ; Lobato, 2016; Roussel, 2017 ), I contend that intermediaries exercise a strong influence over streaming platforms as well as content creators through role playing as producers, facilitators and enablers of media talent and content. Through diversification in media management activities across traditional and new media, the intermediaries have successfully readjusted their image from marginalized invisible middlemen to proactive media industry trendsetters. The MCNs and talent agents have been instrumental in developing revenue circuits through their distinct industrial and cultural practices. In doing so, both these entities have diversified from their defined business operations to create their niche by identifying the demands of the evolving Indian media landscape. In charting out their evolving dynamics, my study critically analyses intermediary transactions to offer a revisionist account of their industrial practices. </jats:p>",

Each variety of virtual experience, from text-based discussion forum to immersive virtual reality environment presents challenges to traditional assumptions about space and its inhabitation. These challenges require design theorisation which extends beyond the notions of design within the virtual, or projected, space (the layout of the chat forum, the appearance of the virtual realm etc), and require a reconsideration of the entire apparatus of the mediating devices (the physical spaces which facilitate the interaction, the connection between them and the virtual space etc). This paper presents both an experimental framework for understanding the space of the virtual and outlines a current research project addressing these theoretical challenges through the spatial implementation of a synthetic environment. </jats:p>",

Elite football is no longer consumed merely through ‘traditional’ media as television or radio. By comparing the ‘big five’ football leagues (the first divisions in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), this article examines how these leagues have adapted to an algorithm logic (monetization strategies/content strategies) on YouTube. Drawing from data collected (64,247 YouTube videos) using YouTube Data Tools, we argue that the ‘big five’s’ content creation on YouTube work in a complementary manner to ‘traditional’ platforms, allowing for the testing and adaption of their content practices based on instant consumer feedback. This article makes a contribution to the literature on the symbiotic media/sport relationship with its analysis and insights into the digital transformations occurring in a ‘platform society’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Commercial game makers at all scales of production have increasingly come to incorporate livestreaming into every stage of the game development cycle. Mainstream hits like Fortnite and League of Legends owe their ongoing success in no small part to their massive uptake by streamers, and triple-A releases from major publishers can reliably expect significant attention on streaming platforms. But what about smaller, lower budget games? For independent game developers, the costs and benefits of streaming are less clear. Based on interviews with small commercial indie developers in Toronto and Montréal, this article critically examines different discourses around streaming and commercial indie games, focusing on developer perceptions of the benefits and risks of streaming and its impacts on indie game-making practices, including production, promotion, and community-building. Contrary to persistent popular myths about streaming as the key to ‘discoverability’, commercial indie game development remains a precarious form of cultural work, and indie games collectively attract only a tiny fraction of the overall audience on streaming platforms. There is a high level of uncertainty about the factors that led to a given game’s success, leaving many indie developers ambivalent about leveraging influencer attention and even as they commit significant time and energy trying to doing so. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Korean travel selfies as contested placemaking practices",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Selfies allow us to exert control over how we are seen and to construct our identity through the people, places, and activities that we imbue with value. The composition of the image, situation, and location photographed indicate aesthetic and ontological choices that reveal cultural values, performances of identity and social position of the person taking the selfie. When read as digital placemaking practices, travel selfies become salient to producers and audiences as political and performative expressions of identity and one’s place in the world. This article examines the travel selfie within the South Korean context and argues that thinking about selfies as placemaking practices informs the productive and potentially empowering nature of these photographs, which simultaneously conform to and contest neoliberal consumerist ideologies. The authors analyze a case study in which the placemaking practices of selfies are represented and critiqued. We argue that these digital placemaking practices become sites where young people’s imaginations, aspirations, and frustrations about social hierarchies, national imaginaries, and class status are expressed and debated through representations of international travel. Through textual and discourse analysis of the images and virulent public criticism faced by South Korean females who travel abroad and document their experiences on Instagram and Naver, we examine the tensions that emerge regarding expressions of the ‘spatial self’ online. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital pedagogies post-COVID-19: The future of teaching with/in new technologies",
    "abstract": "Pedagogies in the 21st century still exhibit certain uneasiness in relation to digital technologies. Instead of rapid speeds and rhythms of networked technologies and their endless streams of information, these pedagogies are marked by a strong preference for what Hayles (2007) refers to as deep attention. This form of attention is able to focus on one single object for longer periods of time, has the capacity to tune out distractions, and a high tolerance for boredom. Hayles depicts this cognitive mode with an image: ‘picture a college sophomore, deep in Pride and Prejudice, with her legs draped over an easy chair, oblivious to her ten-year-old brother sitting in front of a console, jamming on a joystick while he plays Grand Theft Auto’ (2007: 187–88). The disciplinary norms upheld by education at all levels are still univocally grounded in this form of attention, while the restless excitement-seeking mode of attention associated with playing video games, but also with browsing the web or scrolling through different feeds, is seen as the enemy. This adversary mode of attention, characterized by constantly switching between different tasks in pursuit of stimulation, is referred to by Hayles as hyper attention, and is, as she rightly points out, regarded by educational institutions as ‘defective behavior that scarcely qualifies as a cognitive mode at all’ (2007: 188). One of the aims of education today, it would seem, is to remedy the influence of digital media and immunize us against it. Yet, pedagogy is not alone in its mistrust of the digital. As aptly summed by Paasonen (2021: 1), according to ‘a plethora of cultural diagnoses, networked devices, apps, and social media are atrophying our attention spans, eroding our capacity to focus and think, addicting us, boring us, and stealing our time, as well as stopping us from truly relating to one another, engaging in critical thought, or contributing to public life in a meaningful way’. Paasonen, who maps some of these accounts, draws attention to a range of such analyses put forward by journalists, critical theorists and",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) encroaches on new terrains of human activity by dint of its efficacy and an expanding ability to autonomously incorporate information from many disciplines and sources. In this paper, we focus specifically on how AI affects the communicative practices associated with creativity. AI has the capacity to reshape discipline and taste communities by providing new content that competes with human production and by mediating between human activity and information sources. To frame these issues, we turn to the influential systems model of creativity devised by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1996) , which Csikszentmihalyi and Daniel Gruner (2018) recently extended to incorporate AI, redubbing it Creativity 4.0. The model assesses how AI affects the social structure of creative practice without overly accentuating the similarity between humans and AI, or questioning whether computational devices will replace creative jobs. The paper examines Gruner and Csikszentmihalyi’s revised systems model, arguing that it does not sufficiently take into account the variety of ways that AI can be incorporated into creative practice. Prompted by a theoretical reflection on the nature of the model and the emerging features of AI, we propose a new version of the model that highlights how embedded AIs play a key role in filtering and gatekeeping, as well as the importance of generative systems in informing creative practice. We propose that any discussion of AI and the future of creative practice should look at where and how AI supported technologies are used. We examine how AI can reduce and shape the qualitative diversity of sources of inspiration drawn into the creative process, with the associated technological biases, as well as provide an emergent platform for the development of novel ideas. </jats:p>",

Aiming to re-contextualize digital disconnection outside of digital detox resorts, social media, and elitist activism, this article asks how the ongoing disconnection turn affects how we (think about) work. With cues taken from digital disconnection studies and (digital) work/labour research, I inquire three facets of disconnective work. I elaborate, firstly, what disconnection might mean for work, as I scrutinize ideals pertaining to “deep” and “slow” work. Secondly, I unveil how disconnection may materialize at work, as I inspect “the post-digital workplace” and “disconnective technologies of work.” Thirdly, using “The Post-Digital Housewife” as a rhetorical figure for grasping the daily, typically unpaid, work that the disconnection turn makes acute, I recognize disconnection as work. The article concludes by presenting four dialectics of disconnective work, which serve to remind us of the paradoxical role of disconnection in processes of empowerment and exploitation. </jats:p>",

Its contributions ask about the role media play in forecasting the future and their part in bringing it about. And they are interested in the expectations and anticipatory visions that accompany the formation and spread of new media. Along these lines, the eight articles in this special issue explore the future-making dimension of new media. As a whole, they provide an empirically grounded analysis of the ways media reconfigure the relations and distances among present, past, and future times. The contributions delineate imaginaries of futures related to digital media. Furthermore, they attend to interventions into the plans and efforts of making futures and they inquire about the creation of differently vast and (un)certain horizons of expectation. Together, the articles share the assumption that mediated futures are actively accomplished and enacted; they do not simply appear or wait for us to arrive in them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Blockchains have inspired imaginaries of a new iteration of the internet, hailed as Web3, where the power of centralized platform companies would be limited and the ownership of personal data and content could be retained by their individual owners and creators. Web3 is expected to facilitate the emergence of novel protocols and platforms that enable decentralized coordination of data and digital assets. This article examines critically the experiences and imaginaries of creators working on two blockchain-based video-sharing platforms: Theta.tv and Odysee. Building on the studies of creator culture and institutionalist blockchain economics and based on open-ended interviews with the early adopters of these platforms, the paper investigates how the creators experience these decentralized social media applications in terms of their processes of governance, community creation, and career development. We show how the affordances of blockchains and creator expectations can result in further convergence of community management and career-building functions potentially benefiting creators. We also show that the new wave of decentralization, against optimistic blockchain visions, has not yet led to the distributed ‘ownership’ of social media networks. Rather, while blockchains seem to have increased creator autonomy and added career opportunities, novel forms of platform governance and power have also introduced new perceptions of precarity among creators. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital and mobile games are an important part of many children’s daily media usage and are used by children for, among other things, entertainment and relaxation purposes. Mobile games are commonly ‘free-to-play’ and have revenue models based on in-app purchases and advertising. These revenue models affect the content and structure of mobile games and, consequently, also the gaming experiences. Drawing on group interviews with 9- and 12-year-old children, this article analyses how children view and engage with advertising in mobile games, and what consequences in-game advertising have for children’s game experiences. The results show that children’s engagement with in-game advertising takes the form of a struggle and that children both resist and resign themselves to the advertising strategies. Advertising brings about negative experiences of deception, enforcement and confrontation, and interrupts moments of enjoyment, achievement and immersion during gameplay. These results suggest that playing advertising-based free-to-play mobile games is a demanding environment for children. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Immersive storytelling (IST) is usually conceptualized within the framework of technologically immersive tools such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. While these tools offer some unique features (such as visual fidelity, interactivity, and embodied, first-person perspective), their level of technological immersion (based on the system’s objective qualities) might not directly translate to the psychological immersion experienced by the user. Such tools also tend to require access to digital or financial resources unavailable to many schools. We propose a low-tech alternative approach leveraging storytelling’s power for learning through affordable, accessible, and familiar classroom technology – Google Slides. We used the Participatory Learning framework to generate curricular design principles that aim to create a sense of psychological immersion through active participation in technology-mediated storytelling. In this design case study paper, we describe the design of a 10-day unit on Native American history implemented across nine teachers’ elementary school classrooms in the US. We examine the interplay between pedagogical and technological constraints in the design process, the role of the theoretical framework in the design, and conclude by detailing future directions for research on low-tech immersive storytelling environments.</jats:p>",

The authors argue that this is most likely to occur when there are some norms of acceptable behavior in a virtual world and when players see avatars as constitutive to their identity. Other than online environments characterized by a ‘caveat emptor’ approach, Second Life is governed by certain norms of acceptable behavior. While Second Life inhabitants do not see a need for an additional code of ethics for their community, they do have notions of wrong and right behavior. However what exactly constitutes norm violating behavior and ethically relevant avatar harm is often times contested, as the example of online reactions to an avatar upskirt gallery in Second Life illustrate. Players who see their avatars as extensions of themselves are more at risk of ethical harm when a norm violation occurs than players for whom their avatar constitutes an entity distinct from the self. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Winning and losing on social media: Comparing viral political posts across platforms",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on social media use during election campaigns has largely focused on Twitter. Building on recommendations from previous scholarship, the work presented here provides comparative insights into party and citizen engagement on several platforms – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube – during the 2017 Norwegian elections. Results indicate that the themes of popular, ‘viral’ posts vary across platforms, suggesting the need to adapt political messages to each specific outlet. The findings are discussed in the light of the suggested ‘analytics turn’ – when political actors can gauge the minutiae of how their online efforts are engaged with, how do those types of insights influence the shape and content of political campaigns? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The penetration of social media platforms in the cultural production and consumption circuits of sport mega-events means that organisations like the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are afforded new and alternative channels to engage with their audiences. TikTok, one of the largest platforms, is characterised by a higher degree of playfulness and humorous content and has been used to mobilise audiences for prosocial political aims. Using TikTok’s Research API access, this article relies on automatically collected metadata from all IPC posts between May 2023 and May 2024. After consolidating and manipulating the data through Python, statistical analyses were performed on SPSS to understand how certain content becomes more visible on the platform. In a second stage, videos with most virality underwent visual discourse analysis. We hold that the IPC, to challenge invisibilities, arguably one of the biggest obstacles for disability sport, engages in the circulation of humorous content with the aim of promoting inclusion and social change for persons with disabilities. While TikTok and the circulation of humorous content afford the IPC wider visibility to new audiences, it might provoke unintended consequences through further stigmatisation of disability sport as non-serious activity.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Narrative virtual reality as a memory machine",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 2014, a new narrative medium has been emerging that is delivered through virtual reality headsets. This paper theorizes narrative virtual reality as a new filmic medium with new and unique affordances that facilitate narrating and sharing memories. In contradistinction to the much-discussed concept of VR as an ‘empathy machine’, we propose to think of VR as a memory machine. This capability of VR is reflected in the proliferation of memory-related content in narrative VR and its early adoption in public history. Narrating and sharing individual and collective traumatic memories have featured prominently in narrative VR. Three unique properties enable a recipient of narrative VR, the immersant, to experience someone else’s memories: embodiment, immersion, and interactivity. First, embodiment allows the immersant to assume the role of the person who remembers or a person that is being remembered. Second, immersion enables the virtual transportation to a past setting that is remembered. Third, since VR always offers at least some form of interactivity, narrative VR permits the immersant to have agency within the remembered narrative. These three aspects combine to provide a qualitatively richer experience of memories in VR than was possible in conventional narrative media. We show how creators have leveraged these specific affordances of VR in support of narrating memories by analyzing two case-studies. First, we look at an example of traumatic collective memory in The Book of Distance (2020), which narrates a family history of forced removal and internment of Japanese immigrants in Canada during World War II from the perspective of the victim’s grandson. Second, we discuss Is Anna Ok? (2018), which lets the immersant experience two sisters' memories of traumatic brain injury, once from the perspective of the injured victim and once from the sister who witnessed the accident.</jats:p>",

This article examines how these features are experienced within negotiations of music as personal and social through the acts of sharing music and of following others. The analysis relies on 23 focus-group interviews with 124 Spotify and/or Tidal users and a mixed-method study including music-diary self-reports, online observation and interviews with 12 heavy users. Our findings suggest that users incorporate social awareness in non-sharing, selective-sharing and all-sharing approaches with strong, weak and absent ties. These ties are characterized by different configurations of social and music homophily. Negotiations of music as personal and social shape how music-streaming services are experienced.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The gaming industry has seen dramatic change and expansion with the emergence of ‘casual’ games that promote shorter periods of gameplay. Free to download, but structured around micropayments, these games raise the complex relationship between game design and commercial strategies. Although offering a free gameplay experience in line with open access philosophies, these games also create systems that offer control over the temporal dynamics of that experience to monetize player attention and inattention. This article will examine three ‘freemium’ games, Snoopy Street Fair, The Simpsons’ Tapped Out and Dragonvale, to explore how they combine established branding strategies with gameplay methods that monetize player impatience. In examining these games, this article will ultimately indicate the need for game studies to interrogate the intersection between commercial motivations and game design and a broader need for media and cultural studies to consider the social, cultural, economic and political implications of impatience. </jats:p>",

This paper aims to define and evaluate those characteristics that serve as determinants of invention. It analyses research performed on 14 different hackathons with the following ethnographic approach: 1000 h of observation, 36 semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography (netnography). Collected data has been analysed with the use of grounded theory methods and machine learning, which has been introduced as a triangulation method. As a result 9 main characteristics within the hackathon method that serve as invention determinants were discovered and holistically described. The identified elements have been backed by different theoretical backgrounds, but as one they form a flexible and unique mixture that helps to understand the hackathon phenomenon, potential hazards and its inner mechanisms. The discovered characteristics can help in effective organization of hackathons in the future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Japanese animation, widely known as anime, has a global reach. It is simultaneously broadcasted by traditional media and easily distributed and discussed among fans in the digital and online realms. However, non-Japanese audiences’ motivations for watching this kind of content remain almost unstudied in some countries, with Portugal being one of them. This article presents and discusses the outcomes of an online survey completed by 568 respondents, most of them young and regular watchers of anime. A scale by Rubin and Perse (1987), originally used in regard to the audiences of soap operas, was adapted in the scope of this article. Five main motivations were found for anime viewing, with entertainment being the strongest. Age and gender are relevant predictors for the sample’s motivations and also influence audience preferences regarding genres. The survey’s outcomes are complemented by nine in-depth interviews conducted during an anime convention, further exploring the motivations derived from the survey. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Platformed solidarity: Examining the performative politics of Twitter hashflags",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper conceptualises platformed solidarity, describing how platforms change their affordances to support particular social justice causes, sometimes temporarily, and often in response to current events. Such actions allow platforms to perform their support of different interests in response to issues such as racial and gender equality or pro-democratic aims, among other examples. In each case, a specific feature of the platform is modified to visibly promote support, altering how their users experience these spaces. In doing so, these interventions highlight how major platforms demonstrate their politics, raising questions about the differences between the politics that they publicly portray and policies they enact. This paper explores platformed solidarity through an extended examination of Twitter hashflags, typically temporary visuals attached to hashtags of particular commercial, social, and political interests and offering affective emphasis to selected content. While the bulk of hashflags are commercial products, created in partnership with brands to encourage engagement and promotion of a campaign or product, there have been a number of hashflags for major events and causes, from elections to selected social justice campaigns. We suggest that examples of platformed solidarity can elucidate what global platforms see as their role and influence in public communication. However, this raises important questions about what causes, events, and groups are deemed worthy of platformed solidarity? What values do they represent and how – if at all – are these supported by platforms’ policy decisions regarding the same issues? We suggest that, whether cynical or well-intentioned, these surface-level interventions do not always necessarily align with higher-order corporate priorities and decision-making. As such, we suggest that platformed solidarity is a corporate tactic that can have overlap with considerations of ‘woke capitalism’, where visible gestures towards causes and issues are made but underpinned by platforms’ missions to maintain high user numbers, grow engagement, and profit. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science &amp; technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Surveying narrative applications of artificial intelligence in film, games and interactive fiction, this article imagines the future of artificial intelligence (AI) authorship and explores trends that seek to replace human authors with algorithmically generated narrative. While experimental works that draw on text generation and natural language processing have a rich history, this article focuses on commercial applications of AI narrative and looks to future applications of this technology. Video games have incorporated AI and procedural generation for many years, but more recently, new applications of this technology have emerged in other media. Director Oscar Sharp and artist Ross Goodwin, for example, generated significant media buzz about two short films that they produced which were written by their AI screenwriter. It’s No Game (2017), in particular, offers an apt commentary on the possibility of replacing striking screenwriters with AI authors. Increasingly, AI agents and virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant are incorporated into our daily lives. As concerns about their eavesdropping circulate in news media, it is clear that these companions are learning a lot about us, which raises concerns about how our data might be employed in the future. This article explores current applications of AI for storytelling and future directions of this technology to offer insight into issues that have and will continue to arise as AI storytelling advances. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article interrogates political brokerage on YouTube by examining the platform’s role in the construction of political discourses and in configuring the action of a new genre of political actors advancing a political agenda through historical revisionism. Using assemblage theory and drawing from technography, we propose the concept of “networked political brokerage” to characterize the mutually affirming relationship of YouTube’s governance mechanisms and alternative political influencers’ microcelebrity practices in building, complementing, and magnifying historical revisionist narratives through and within a network of algorithmically sanctioned videos. We illustrate how this interplay of platform logics and ‘cultures of use' privileges and legitimizes political content into knowledge without accountability. We argue for the importance of examining YouTube as a socio-technical driver of this political brokerage process in curating political information in this contemporary political scene. </jats:p>",

Based on in-depth interviews with 49 racial/ethnic minority immigrants in the U.S. Midwest, this study examines how they navigated online health information related to general health issues and in particular COVID-19, how they encounter online misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccination and their willingness to get vaccinated. Results show that participants use online health information from both the U.S. and their home country to stay informed about the pandemic, but often encounter misinformation and hate speech online. Further, participants are hesitant to correct misinformation due to contentious online environment. Additionally, findings revealed that younger participants tended to be less willing to get vaccinated due to low perceived benefits. The study suggests scholarly and practical implications for those who work in the area of health communication, digital media messaging and minority communication. </jats:p>",

Drawing on Jörg Niewöhner’s co-laboration approach, we show how frictions within interdisciplinary work can be made productive for reflection. We then show how software development environments can be repurposed to infrastructure reflexivities and to make co-laborative engagement with AI-related technology possible and productive. We document our own co-laborative engagement with machine learning and highlight three exemplary critical technical practices that emerged out of the co-laboration: negotiating comparabilities, shifting contextual attention and challenging similarity and difference. We finally wrap up the conceptual and empirical elements and propose Reflexive Data Science (RDS) as a methodology for co-laborative engagement and infrastructured reflexivities in contemporary AI-related research. We come back to Agre’s ways of operationalizing reflexivity and introduce the building blocks of RDS: (1) organizing encounters of social contestation, (2) infrastructuring a network of anchoring devices enabling reflection, (3) negotiating timely matters of concern and (4) designing for reflection. With our research, we aim at contributing to the methodological underpinnings of epistemological and social reflection in contemporary AI research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent scholarship indicates that the rise of networked grassroots protests points to a new mode of organizing activism, connective action. Unlike social movement organization-led collective actions, connective actions are organized by non-human agents – digital networks and platforms – because of the latter’s inherent connectivity in assembling people, information and resources scattered across digital spaces into relatively cohesive protest networks. Yet, not all digital platforms are designed to afford unlimited connections; ‘walled gardens’ and proprietary systems disconnect more than connecting. WeChat, a China-based social media platform, spearheads in engineering an enclosed digital ecosystem, due to China’s political economy. How can protest networks develop in such an insulated environment? This study examines a WeChat-based protest campaign organized mainly by Chinese Americans to illustrate the organizing dynamics on disconnected platforms. Relying on interviews, observation and textual analysis, the findings show that WeChat, instead of acting as a non-human organizer, disorganized the mobilization by impeding the free flow of information and resources. To head off the platform-led barriers, activists performed articulative labor to cross boundaries, bridge gaps and broker resources, which finally articulated the protest network in this digitally disconnective environment. As contemporary digital landscapes become increasingly fragmented, this study not only sheds light on the significant yet hidden articulative labor in networked activism but also prompts us to rethink connective action and other technological deterministic models’ valorization of non-human agency and to reconsider the relationship of human and non-human agency in constituting collective actions and sociality in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smart home futures predicted and promoted in the discourses and practices of industry increasingly figure forms of automated decision making (ADM) into existing narratives of technological solutionism. This article interrogates how these narratives are constituted, the futures they imagine, predict and promote, and how people and households are presented within these futures. Our discussion is based on a content analysis of technology industry reports. The reports emphasize that the key to business success in the future is to use ADM to instantly satisfy individual preferences and to tailor products and services to the “market of one.” While the role of AI and algorithms in the creation of personalized media—particularly social media feeds—has garnered attention for its role in increasing political divisiveness around the world, less attention has been paid to the consequences of this individualized logic when applied and recreated in the design and installation of automated smart home technology. The technology sector’s emphasis on personalization treats the household as an individual self-motivated decision-making entity, despite the home being a complex socio-material assemblage shaped by constantly negotiated power differentials, such as by age, gender, and species. Thus, the discourse of “personalization” underpinning the imagination of emerging technology for the home and the individualized conception of human behavior which underpins it, lead to significant oversights when situated in the complexity of domestic life. Further we argue that this risks embedding an alienated understanding of human behavior—techno-hedonism—into ADM systems. We discuss how a persona of the techno-hedonist underlies visions of the personalized smart home, and its potential consequences through three interrelated concepts: convenience, control, and choice. </jats:p>",

I discuss the extent to which they imagine their online activities to be potentially influencing others in certain desired ways and thus constituting an instrumental form of political participation. The resulting analysis focuses on the complex and uneasy relationship between this media-spreading activity and a marketing-like model that positions social media users as microlevel participants in aggregate campaigns to shape public opinion. While some who engage in this activity enthusiastically embrace goals of persuasion, others opt for alternative conceptual frameworks, such as fostering citizenship by informing others and sparking deliberative dialogue, that seemingly avoid the manipulative connotations of political marketing. </jats:p>",

The study found that reporting interfaces (1) did not provide appropriate access to platform policy or guidelines, (2) failed to provide options for dialogue, testimonials or mechanisms to report in formats supporting user wellbeing needs, (3) were consistently framed as individualising and transactional rather than brokering care or peer support, and (4) added to the opacity of platform intervention and decision-making processes.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although Augmented Reality (AR) scholarship is largely defined through technocentric boundary work that delineates the virtual from the real, it is nevertheless vital to consider experiential conceptualisations of AR as mediating the human–physical environment, as this makes visible for analysis specific properties that afford specific dynamics of augmented publics. We consider how AR mediates the environment in ways previous media could not, identifying four affordances of note. We name visual (dis)integrity, environmental activation, contextual pointalisation and four-dimensional place(ment), as well as reliance on digital infrastructures as sets of properties and dynamics that speak to what AR affords its users. The article first traces how the conceptualisation of AR in scholarship has yet to move past technocentric metaphors of description, adopted from the Virtuality Continuum (Milgram et al., 1995) that separates reality from mediating technologies. It then pushes media critique conceptualising AR in ways that more accurately account for lived experiences of perception. Doing so updates the metaphors used to understand AR and exposes first- and second-order affordances of AR media, which define but are not definitive of the constraints and potentials present in how the properties and dynamics of AR mediate perceptions of life. The article concludes by noting how future research can now consider definitions of AR media that centre on how perceptible spatial computation augments relations between objects, whether these are conjured from electrons, atoms or humans. </jats:p>",

The rise of the extremist politician Jair Bolsonaro to the Presidency provides evidence in this regard. In consequence, the boundaries between fringe and mainstream politics become porous. This article discusses which agents disseminate China-related COVID-19 CTs, and which topics receive more attention. We found a significant presence of actors belonging to mainstream politics and the media among the CTs’ main disseminators. Additionally, the CTs circulating in the Brazilian social media environment reproduce concerns about China’s growing presence in the global arena, which originate elsewhere. Still, they add a specific emphasis on the Communist threat. We sustain that this emphasis relates as much to Brazil’s internal politics as to China itself.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents an approach to cross-media use analysis suited to answering the question of how citizens from different sociocultural groups experience their freedom of information. The approach is based on normative democratic theory, is attentive to the dimensions of culture and media that lie beyond a predefined political dimension and is designed to analyse, from a citizen’s perspective, how people experience a public world in which shared problems are addressed. To illustrate the approach, the article draws on the analysis of two empirical examples: one of a representative sample of the Norwegian citizenry ( N = 3660) and one of Norwegian students ( N = 1223). We conduct latent class analysis as well as multiple correspondence analysis to help improve our understanding of the consequences of fragmented and personalized media use by shedding light on the implications of changing patterns of public connection. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> K-pop, a niche genre appealing to certain audience segments in the global market, has now attracted mainstream attention of music industries and general audiences within and beyond Asia. Previous studies often attribute niche genres’ visibility in a cultural market to audience segmentation and the prominence of niche tastes; however, K-pop’s mainstream visibility in its transnational spread complicates this argument. Integrating the sociology of quantification to studies on audience metrics and social quantification, this paper takes BTS as a case and examines how they gained mainstream visibility in the U.S. as the consequences of institutional audiences construction by Billboard’s global rankings – Social 50 and Top Social Artist Award. We argue that although Billboard’s charts and awards are not designed to favor exotic music, their institutional construction of global audiences is inherently a quantification process, the nature of which inadvertently eliminates regional differences in available audience sizes and consumption cultures when aggregating artists’ worldwide social engagements into ordinal numbers. Consequently, Billboard-constructed global audiences are mis-aggregated, over-representing certain regional tastes. Billboard initially interpreted mis-aggregated audiences as BTS’s global social popularity, increasing this then niche group’s mainstream visibility in the U.S. market. Focusing on measurement regimes, such as Billboard, this paper suggests an alternative mechanism for niche genres’ visibility in a culture market – audience mis-aggregation. When measurement regimes use metrics to synthesize diverse audience segments to represent the whole market, tremendous information is eliminated through this quantification process, resulting in over-representation of certain segments’ tastes and increasing mainstream visibility of niche genres. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines recent developments in community archives and histories, and in particular the impact of technologies that encourage individuals to create and/or share their own historical content. Concomitantly, more archives and heritage institutions are experimenting with allowing their ‘communities of users’ to submit commentary and content to collection descriptions and catalogues. Some have seen such community histories and user content as challenging notions of professionalism and the authority of the ‘expert’ voice, and this article will seek to explore the ways in which this might be the case. However, the article will also argue that, technology aside, these challenges are not fundamentally new but that they reside firmly in the traditions of history from below, oral history, History Workshop and many other attempts to give recognition to less privileged voices. Ultimately, such material is surely an opportunity for archivists and historians to broaden the range of the sources that their work draws upon; whether they make use of these opportunities depends largely on their interests and the focus of their studies or collections. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The printed book has been resilient to change, and the adoption of e-books has been slow. In this context, few studies have addressed a potential turn to streaming services for books. This paper examines the adoption of book streaming in the Norwegian market, where the market-leaders Storytel and Fabel report rapid increases in number of subscribers. We examine who these early adopters are, and what may predict future use of streaming services among non-users. Theoretically, the study is situated within the fields of innovation diffusion and technology acceptance. The study is based on a cross-sectional online survey with a representative sample of the Norwegian population. Results show that users are younger and more educated, and that book streaming is more popular among women than men. The audiobook format allows for flexible ways of consuming books, complementing rather than replacing the printed book. For non-users, results show that convenience value and price value predict behavioural intention to use book streaming services. While emotional attachment to printed books has been found to act as a barrier for adoption of e-books, its negative effect on behavioural intention for book streaming services is only modest. </jats:p>",

The article first discusses the concept of participation and some of its complexities, and then sketches a series of intense moments of participation in and through the media in (mainly the second half) the 20th and the 21st century. At the same time, care is taken not to organize a linear-historical narrative, keeping in mind that the history of the democratization of Western societies and their media spheres is characterized by a series of continuities and discontinuities, dead ends and sedimented practices. Despite these ever-present fluctuations, the article argues that we can still see that structures, cultural resources and subjective dispositions have over time been geared more towards participation and equality, also within the media sphere. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this essay, the role of human expertise in the face of technological advance is discussed. There are many examples of technology that have become sufficiently advanced that the previous need to develop expert-level skills before being able to perform at a high level is either vastly reduced or eliminated. For instance, digital cameras can create sharp, beautiful photos with essentially zero technical skill, and high-definition video recordings are available on smartphones and iPads. The question is not only whether these technologies eliminate the need for expertise (thus substituting engineering for expertise) but also if in doing so they foster the development of new types of creative expertise (such as an ability to use photography as part of a social media strategy, for instance). The article concludes by arguing that machines contribute to an increasingly capable constellation of people and machines, which together allow more people to develop their talents into expressions of creative expertise. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media analytics is a burgeoning new field associated with high promises of societal relevance and business value but also methodological and practical problems. In this article, we build on the sociology of expectations literature and research on expertise in the interaction between humans and machines to examine how analysts and clients make their expectations about social media analytics credible in the face of recognized problems. To investigate how this happens in different contexts, we draw on thematic interviews with 10 social media analytics and client companies. In our material, social media analytics appears as a field facing both hopes and skepticism – toward data, analysis methods, or the users of analytics – from both the clients and the analysts. In this setting, the idea of automated analysis through algorithmic methods emerges as a central notion that lends credibility to expectations about social media analytics. Automation is thought to, first, extend and make expert interpretation of messy social media data more rigorous; second, eliminate subjective judgments from measurement on social media; and, third, allow for coordination of knowledge management inside organizations. Thus, ideas of automation importantly work to uphold the expectations of the value of analytics. Simultaneously, they shape what kinds of expertise, tools, and practices come to be involved in the future of analytics as knowledge production. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘The glowing fireflies’: Invisible activism under China’s queer necropolitics",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In China, the escalating repression of gender and sexual diversity has given rise to ‘queer necropolitics’. ‘Queer necropolitics’ – a concept we build on – refers to the hegemonic ability to determine who is allowed to suffer, survive, or thrive. We examine China’s sustained re-enforcement of traditional gender norms, which has rendered queer communities non-existent from official recognition. In this context, we aim to understand how China’s state queer necropolitics has shaped queer organising in the country. From 2021 to 2022, we conducted 26 semi-structured interviews with a diverse cohort of self-identified LGBTIQ+ members and activists across 12 provinces in China. We find that the interplay of legal invisibility and politicised, moralised visibility has placed queer communities under hegemonic governance techniques of suppression. The paper argues that China’s queer necropolitics has established invisible activism. The juxtaposition of invisibility with activism denotes the quiet, implicit, and everyday embodied acts of communal care among queer communities as a form of resistance. Building on the metaphor of ‘glowing fireflies’ shared by a research participant, invisible activism presents a more sustainable approach than conventional rights-based activism. The paper expands our understanding of politically antagonistic practices, acknowledging the diversity and complexity embedded within queer activism. </jats:p>",

Both of these seem to be telling us that things are moving very fast and if we don’t move with them we shall simply be excluded from new cultural formations. Yet it is now not much more than a truism to note the speed of this revolution indeed its constant acceleration and this issue of Convergence is an attempt to move sideways and gain some theoretical perspective on some questions that theory has only recently begun to address with any consistency. These are questions of the relations between culture and technology, of the relations of thought to the new machinic assemblages technological and social in which we have to acknowledge that ’we’ may only be one element. These questions slow us down for a moment, and require us to think about the simple fact that who we are and what we do, as cultural beings, has changed, and will change, in fashions it sometimes seems frightening to contemplate. We still, for example, do not quite know what it is that computers, and new computer-mediated communications (CMC), will do to us. Or what we can, or will be able to, do with them. What will the information revolution do to old notions of State, subjectivity, gender, even ’the reals Are such notions as Heidegger’s that there is nothing technological about technology, that technology’s essence lies elsewhere, in a revealing of Being to us still valid in an age where machines seem to do so much more than just reveal what is?

While there is some awareness of gender, racial, and socioeconomic discrimination on digital platforms, ageism has received less attention. This article analyzes some tools that are frequently embedded on digital platforms from an old-age perspective, in order to increase awareness of the different ways in which ageism works. We will firstly look at how innovation teams, following homophilic patterns, disregard older people. Secondly, we will show how ageism tends to be amplified by the methods often used on digital platforms. And thirdly, we will show how corporate values are often against usability issues that mainly affect people with a low level of (digital) skills, which is more common among older people. Counterbalancing the abusive power control of the corporations behind digital platforms and compensating for the underrepresentation of groups in less favorable situations could help to tackle such discrimination.</jats:p>",

Since around the mid-1990s, UK government attempts to regulate the ownership of sports rights have centred on two significant policy initiatives: first, the reforming of legislation designed to ensure certain sporting or national events remain accessible to all television viewers — the listed events legislation; and second, the more rigorous application of competition policy principles to the selling of Premier League football rights, largely in an effort to reduce the market power of the dominant pay-TV broadcaster, BSkyB. The main object of this article is to consider each of these policy initiatives in turn and to highlight how the UK government’s approach to the regulation of sports rights has been shaped by changes to both the television industry and the nature of UK public policy making more generally. </jats:p>",

In this article, we address this research gap with a qualitative study of production processes in different types of media. Our starting point is that independent of the media type, common product characteristics can be identified, that promote success in the audience market. We ask whether the same is true for process characteristics; whether there are converged processes that promote audience success independent of the media type. The study is based on n = 39 interviews in the German-speaking markets. Our findings provide a differentiated result: We do find similarities in the processes along the lines of product characteristics; however, the project phase is an important influencer. While processes in the development phase are more converged, production and distribution still demand distinct processes for different media types. In general, we can confirm studies that find a reluctance of media practitioners towards convergence, which often remains an underfunded and cost-oriented brain child of the top management. </jats:p>",

To date, the role of technology within news production has received relatively little theoretical study. This article, based on empirical research findings from a case study of a major multi-media BBC newscentre piloting the latest digital news technologies, challenges the technological myopia and technological determinism that variously inform academic and practitioner accounts of changing news technology and demonstrates how technologies of news production are in fact socially and culturally shaped and embedded within corporate and professional contexts and practices. Based upon in-house documents, interviews and participant observation the authors' findings endorse normative concerns about the increasingly pressurised and superficial nature of multi-skilled, multi-media news production and its impact upon news output. </jats:p>",

Through ethnographic and interview data, the themes of social interaction, mastery and status, team participation, and exploration are considered as compelling activities female gamers are engaging in online. Given that these online games often include a component of fighting, the issue of violence is discussed. Rather than seeing this group of players as an anomaly, this article explores how focusing on the pleasures women derive from gaming might lend a more complex understanding of both gender and computer games. Finally, a consideration of how design is affecting this emerging genre is explored. </jats:p>",

Initially we have a Giddens-inspired account of the phenomenology of modernity, in which Moores wants to emphasise the importance of mediated experience (especially broadcasting). Then, from media studies, we have an account of how broadcasting established itself as a domestic medium, constructing a national popular culture; which is subject to some re-negotiation within the complex, multi-media dynamics of contemporary households. Alongside and supporting this, global and multi-cultural patterns of cultural influence are used as resources for the construction of new forms of identity, finding their expression, in part, in new forms of media consumption. Moores’ final point is that all this has profound consequences for the particularities of social interaction, where the convergence of old and new media is transforming everyday life.",

Firstly, it seeks to broaden the rather narrow terms in which the transition to digital cinema is often understood in film theory. Secondly, it tries to assess claims about the 'demise of narrative' frequently associated with the digital threshold. On one level, it is argued that a dialectical understanding of the relation between terms such as 'narrative' and 'spectacle' is needed to advance current debates. On another level, it is suggested that digital technology should not be wholly defined by the current dominance of 'blockbuster' films. In place of technological determinism, an understanding based on the politics of spectacle and distracted spectatorship is advanced. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Approaches to Analysing the Web Text",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper challenges the dominance of concepts of hypertextuality as the foundation for the analysis of web texts. Instead it argues that web texts cannot be understood without reference to their specific contexts of production and consumption. As part of the construction of an alternative to existing analytical approaches to the web text contemporary practice in web design is surveyed, as are its relations with the culture of particular groups of producers. Drawing on an interdisciplinary framework allied to the field of British media and cultural studies, this paper suggests how the analysis of the web site might be approached in terms of its status as an emergent media/cultural form. It discusses how such forms might be understood in terms of the shared social conventions which inflect their production. It argues that web sites can neither be analysed in terms of generic hypertext or as a homogeneous genre and that rather the formation of groupings of sites in line with the ideologies, values and preoccupations of their producers require concrete analysis together with further research into specific practices of 'reading' web texts. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Livestreaming from the bedroom: Performing intimacy through domestic space on Twitch",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at the appearance of domestic spaces on the popular livestreaming platform Twitch.tv, with a focus on livestreams that appear to be shot in streamers’ bedrooms. Many Twitch streamers broadcast from their homes, making domestic space central to questions of placemaking for this rapidly growing digital media form. Within the home, bedrooms merit particular attention because they carry particular cultural connotations; they are associated with intimacy, embodiment, and erotics. Drawing from observations of gaming and nongaming streams, we map where bedrooms do and do not appear on Twitch. We locate the majority of bedrooms in categories that foreground connections between streamers and viewers, like Just Chatting, Music &amp; Performing Arts, and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). By contrast, across a wide range of video game genres, bedrooms remain largely absent from gaming streams. The presence of bedrooms on Twitch also breaks down along gender lines, with women streaming being far more likely to broadcast from their bedrooms than men. Here, we build from existing research on both livestreaming and digital placemaking to argue for an understanding of place on Twitch as fundamentally performative. This performance is inherently gendered and bound up with the affective labor of streaming. In addition, we demonstrate how the bedroom, even when it does not appear on screen, can be understood as a ‘structuring logic’ of placemaking on Twitch. Given the history of livestreaming, which grows out of women’s experiments with online ‘lifecasting’, the bedroom sets expectations for the type of spatial and emotional access a stream is imagined to offer viewers. In this sense, the absence of bedrooms in gaming streams can be understood as a disavowal of intimate domestic space: an attempt by predominantly male streamers to distance themselves from the implicit parallels between livestreaming and practices like webcam modeling. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Introduction The 1990s were a phenomenal decade for media development in the Arab World. While some viewed it as a period of greater openness and diversity, others saw in it an era of information and communication revolution, marked by the introduction of satellite television and the World Wide Web.’ The Arab world media, more than ever before, seemed well-positioned to deliver more diverse and sophisticated information content to viewers across national frontiers. A major sector affected by the ongoing technological convergence between satellite television, telecommunications and internet-based modes of production is the traditional government-controlled media system. The new evolving media environment and the accompanying socio-political transformations seem to present government media with new challenges that need to be approached on the basis of new premises. The opening up of Arab media systems has generated heated debates on the role of communication media in promoting freedom of expression and enhancing private investments in the long-time govern ment-monopolised media sector.",

While all the contributors recognise the necessity of acknowledging historical conditions that give rise to particular media at specific moments, they also critically engage with the question of how it is possible to differentiated that which is truly novel from what has come before. In quite distinct and divergent ways, the articles collected here address this methodological dialectic, treading the line between assimilating new media/art forms into a discontinuous history of inter-related developments and articulating their explosive or so-called ’revolutionary’ specificity.",

The social–psychological theoretical framework used drew specifically from symbolic interaction, Goffman’s performance of self, and schema theory. Generally, Facebookers sought social acceptance with their presentations. Primary findings indicate that the Facebookers present over-simplified imagery to reduce ambiguity and align with specific social groups. This study asked Facebookers to respond to strangers’ Facebook profiles, and the responses showed that due to the glut of identity-related information on the site, interpretations are heavily reliant on schemas. Online interview participants indicated several basic categories of identity performance that were used to assess others. Furthermore, online interview participants felt confident giving detailed descriptions of strangers’ personalities based on only a few minutes of viewing their profiles. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Advergames – a neologism for video games designed to advertise a product or service – are marketing devices employed to impact consumers’ purchasing decisions and, more frequently, shape their impressions of a promoted brand. The online advergames of the programming block-turned media brand [adult swim] (AS) present a clear case in which the games act as rich signifiers of brand aesthetics even if they are not directly connected to the content of the brand’s television shows, live events, and other assorted merchandise. Although these ‘casual’-style titles have gameplay mechanics that are accessible to broad audiences, these advergames often exhibit a critical stance toward other games, which differentiates them from the vast majority of casual games on the market. But rather than being anti-casual, we argue that these games are best understood as being paracasual because they use parody to both trouble prevailing definitions of casual games and advergames, and deploy an aesthetic disposition that further helps define the brand. Furthermore, they are an increasingly visible and vital component of a constellation of texts and practices that function as what James Paul Gee calls an ‘affinity space’ for a lucrative audience demographic. This article assesses how AS games use parody to deconstruct textually video gaming’s most popular genres and how such parodic deconstruction, as evidenced by players’ online discussions, serves as an affinity space for a media-savvy taste culture. </jats:p>",

This article examines the sociotechnical systems that support everyday decisions about what to wear, and how this decision-making process is being re-imagined in response to technology. Drawing upon closet ethnographies with women in the USA and Australia, we focus upon the ways in which women make decisions about what will help them to ‘look professional’. Specifically, we attend to two key dimensions of the decision-making process – visions and validations – to understand the ways in which women weigh the opinion of other people, media and technologies, and the real and imagined role of how new technologies such as the Amazon Echo Look may be integrated into this process. Through fine-grained analysis of the ways that women receive, reject or ignore information about their performance of looking professional, we reflect upon the relative importance of different technologies in the process of decision-making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "From rather tentative beginnings seven years ago, the World Wide Web has assumed enormous importance to journalism: as an Australian journalism school faculty member observed recently, being online is now seen almost everywhere as ’sexy and modern’.’ The World Wide Web in particular has become an everyday part of most newsrooms.’ Moreover, five years ago no more than 8 per cent of people in the USA went online once a week or more for news: by comparison, in 2000 over 56 per cent of American internet users said they logged on to ’read news’.3 Not only in Australia and the US but also in the UK, these factors, and relatively high salary levels, have made the web an attractive place to practise journalism.’ While some fall-out resulted from the dot-com crisis in 2000, the numbers of online journalists remained large, and new web ventures continued to offer employment opportunities for more.5 What were previously exclusively singleor bimedia organisations have broadened their activities to include text, audio, video, graphics and design elements in multi-functional information, entertainment and/or retail sites which hope to win over not just audiences but advertisers from more traditional media outlets.~ 6",

    "title": "Reconstituting the ‘good woman’: Gendered visual politics on social media during 2021 state election in West Bengal, India",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the visual politics of gender in electoral politics in West Bengal (WB). We examine how women political candidates visually construct their non-verbal political performance on social media, and how such visuals relate to social mores and societal expectations surrounding femininity. Drawing on theories of the social construction of gender and visual political communication, we conducted a content analysis of 1,033 visual artefacts from eight individual women candidates and 205 from the Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) pages of the four main political parties taking part in the January-April 2021 electoral campaign for state-level elections in WB. We analysed how these candidates construct gendered relationships with the electorate through different cues on the platforms, such as sartorial choices (traditional or Western attire), use of culture-specific religious symbols (sindoor or vermillion, bindi – forehead marking worn by married Hindu women), and gendered/non-gendered political actions like cooking or serving food, giving speeches or meeting constituents in political processions. Our findings about the visually performed politics show a combination of cultural, political, and gender signifiers, which are mediated and remain connected to societal expectations, and historical narratives. The candidates’ negotiation of these aspects, in turn, underscores a reproduction of colonial legacies and, in the present day, an ongoing production of societal differences. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on visual politics of gender, particularly in Asian contexts. It sheds light on the nuanced ways women politicians use social media to construct their visual identities, and how the deployment of body politics into the relatively ‘new’ online sphere reifies ‘old’ social, political, cultural symbolisms, and norms regarding gender. In this way, this article highlights the importance of considering pre-digital forms of gendered identity construction and visual representation when analysing the contested terrain of digital visibilities. </jats:p>",

At the time of writing, (November 2005) the revolution has already started in the audio world, and has been going for the last 18 months. ‘Podcasting’ allows anyone with a PC to create a ‘radio’ programme and distribute it freely, through the internet to the portable MP3 players of subscribers around the world. Podcasting not only removes global barriers to reception but, at a stroke, removes key factors impeding the growth of internet radio: its portability, its intimacy and its accessibility. This is a scenario where audiences are producers, where the technology we already have assumes new roles and where audiences, cut off from traditional media, rediscover their voices. </jats:p>",

People use these forms of mobile media to impart a sound track of their own choosing over their experience of physical space. However, newer mobile projects have examined the links that tie mobile media and sound to experiences of movement. These projects focus on the collaborative construction of shared soundscapes through mobile media, in a sense responding to the individualizing tendencies of dominant auditory mobile media. This article draws from literature in sound studies, media studies, and locative media art to examine these relatively new forms of what we call social soundscaping.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / This paper explores Konami's horror videogame franchise Silent Hill according to recent discussions of immersion, alienation and critical simulation. Silent Hill constitutes an extremely selfreflexive series, frequently acknowledging its videogame status and interrogating the medium as experience and text. This, paradoxically, produces an experience of simultaneous critical distance and intensified engagement. Clumsy controls, grotesque imagery and deterministic gameplay disrupt player immersion. The digital emulation of analogue media and its distortion denies technological transparency. Silent Hill invites comparisons to Brechtian theatre and filmmaking through its estranged protagonists, multiple `alternative' spaces, and pervasive `unpleasure'. Yet while encouraging critical engagement with the videogame process, these aspects also contribute to the games' horror affect. Anti-immersive elements rely upon repellent audiovisuals. Analogue disintegration is employed to signify evil, corruption and contamination. Contradicting assumptions that emphasizing construction and enunciation disrupts identification, immersion and illusion, such aspects are fundamental to Silent Hill's operation as horror text. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Reading literature in/against the digital age: Shallow assumptions, deep problems, expectant pedagogies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the popular theme of Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains (2010), various commentators observe the erosion of what used to be called ‘reading’, but is now increasingly referred to as ‘deep’ reading. University English departments offer ‘close reading’ of literary texts as a corrective to the digital shallows, while worrying about a general decline in reading, and reading ‘for pleasure’, attributed to the digital. However this decline is created equally by the procedures of the discipline, including its core practice of ‘close reading’ which emerged similarly from entangled anxieties about technology, mass media and low/high culture. It makes sense that literary reading would be eroded in educational contexts (which overdetermine reading), and not just because of the erosion of deep reading and ‘deep attention’. Training in literature may lead, ironically, to a loss in the ability to read and understand literary texts and to draw on multimodal narrative literacies. This paper proposes a practice of expectant reading that, supported by social annotation, can re-centre reading and restore narrative and frameworks of expectation constitutive of literary meaning, while embodying the contract between reader(s) and text, and facilitate socially distributed reading. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the ways in which Finnish cultural workers experienced and responded to their colleagues’ and peers’ distress on social media platforms during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The theory of media witnessing as mundane world-witnessing is employed to analyse cultural workers’ modalities of experience as audience-like followers on social media. The data comprise 26 focused interviews conducted via Zoom and over phone in 2021 with cultural workers representing the fields of theatre, television and film industry, literature, music and circus. We argue that various modes of affective and politicised witnessing offered cultural workers the mechanisms to articulate and reflect on their own and others’ experiences of inequality and vulnerability as well as develop a sense of responsibility. In the context of the pandemic, mundane world-witnessing involved engagement and identification with distress, peer support and activism, as witnessed and evaluated by cultural workers on social media. Furthermore, this article theorises a new mode of witnessing prevalent on social media platforms – speculative witnessing – which carries a reflective and hesitant approach to social media ‘bubbles’, obscure algorithmic agency and imagination of absent audiences. In other words, speculative witnessing captures a dimension of metacommunicative scepticism in media witnessing that reflects a specific condition of knowing in the context of social media platforms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This production study utilizes postfeminist theory as a lens for seeing ‘beauty work’ on YouTube via the multi-channel network (MCN) ICON Network, a collaboration between the production company Endemol Shine and beauty YouTuber Michelle Phan. By bringing to focus the unique year of 2015–2016 when YouTube beauty production was largely produced within MCNs, the study sets the stage for the proceeding professionalization of YouTube content creation under legacy production and distribution companies in the 2020s. In-depth producer interviews with ICON management and YouTubers illuminated MCN business practices and producer perceptions of YouTube beauty production. Interview data was analyzed for its articulation within ICON as a postfeminist media culture (Gill, 2007) through (a) work conditions of beauty video production and (b) best practices of beauty video production. Results indicate that ICON is a site where the markers of feminism, postfeminism, and transnational feminism intersect and collide. These intersections contextualize today’s beauty influencing landscape which pushes for independence from MCNs, transparency, and authenticity. </jats:p>",

The article explores the potential of digital platforms as a new source of revenue for Arab news media and a new site for disseminating informative content that helps push the freedom of speech in the region. It demonstrates the difficulty of achieving either goal partly due to the monopoly of Big Tech over the digital advertising market and partly due to the competition among Arab media outlets to use clickbait content to lure audiences and hence increase superficial metrics such as clicks and shares. The article draws on different forms of evidence, including articles penned by Arab journalists, in which they reflect on their experiences in the digital sphere, papers by Arab scholars, in addition to informal conversations with selected Arab journalists. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How and why the social limits of racist speech have become obscure and ‘outdated’ for a YouTube star PewDiePie and his over 100 million fans? How have the policies of YouTube affected the general understanding of the limits of racist discourse in the digital media context? In this article, I argue that the case of PewDiePie shows how YouTube exercises a neoliberalist understanding of freedom of speech. In my analysis, I contextualise PewDiePie’s own comments and YouTube’s publications into the history of Internet culture and introduce the development of YouTube into a neoliberalist sphere. I illustrate how neoliberal ideology is now implemented on three levels on YouTube: through creating an illusion of intimacy between a creator and his/her fans, through the promise of equal opportunity on YouTube and through a neoliberalist interpretation of the marketplace-of-ideas principle. The analysis reveals how YouTube’s policies and practices as ideological choices contribute to the normalisation of racism on social media. </jats:p>",

I argue that in studying and conceptualizing these types of texts through the proposed theoretical framework, we can gain insights into the process of the formation of meaning and the building of identity and community in an online setting. </jats:p>",

As a technology pioneered in Japan two decades ago and mainstreamed in China, QR codes have quickly become part of quotidian placemaking. While locations such as China have fully incorporated QR code technology into everyday contexts including public transport and mobile wallet applications, QR codes in the West were relatively overlooked. That was, until the pandemic. In this article, we examine some of the ways QR codes are being imagined and reimagined as part of public placemaking practices. In order to do so, we begin with a short history of QR codes – emerging in Japan, becoming mainstream in China and their consequent uptake globally. We then discuss the methods of our Australian study conducted during the pandemic and the seamful/seamless findings from our study. </jats:p>",

Blending media convergence and networked sociality frameworks, an exploratory content analysis of reasons for taking screenshots led to the development of the digital window, a four-quadrant conceptual model depicting where individuals’ online information – captured by screenshot – resides at any given time. Results indicated that most participants used screenshots either to bookmark or contain information needed to navigate the practicalities of both online and offline life. Screenshots were also used in communication with others, specifically to disclose or reframe information to another audience. In addition to elucidating more data on how social practices shape information and communication technologies like screenshots, the digital window establishes a working visual model for understanding possibilities for networked sociality across convergent architectures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A 5-year case study of an established regional newspaper in Britain investigates journalists about their perceptions of convergence in digital technologies. This research is the first ethnographic longitudinal case study of a UK regional newspaper. Although conforming to some trends observed in the wider field of scholarship, the analysis adds to skepticism about any linear or directional views of innovation and adoption: the Northern Echo newspaper journalists were observed to have revised their opinions of optimum Web practices, and sometimes radically reversed policies. Technology is seen in the period as a fluid, amorphous entity. Central corporate authority appeared to diminish in the period as part of a wider reduction in formalism. Questioning functionalist notions of the market, the study suggests cause and effect models of change are often subverted by contradictory perceptions of particular actions. Meanwhile, during technological evolution, the ‘professional imagination’ can be understood as strongly reflecting the parent print culture and its routines, despite pioneering a new convergence partnership with an independent television company. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Introduction: Three dimensionality as a heuristic device",
    "abstract": "The forays into digital three dimensionality (3D) by both mainstream directors (Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg) and established auteurs (Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders) – triggered by the groundbreaking success of James Cameron’s Avatar (2009) – have not simply fueled heated debate about the possibilities of 3D and its impact on industry players and critics, but have also precipitated inquiry from historical, aesthetic and cultural perspectives. We have thus been witnessing the rapid growth of scholarly interest in 3D across different disciplines to the extent that stereoscopy – which was invented before the advent of the standardized two-dimensional (2D) cinematic apparatus but has been critically neglected – was recently reevaluated as ‘stereoscopic media’. Still, this upsurge of academic interest in 3D seems long overdue if we consider it not as a special effect in the fields of cinema or photography, but as a particular mode of viewing and imagery that has been pervasive throughout the history of modern media technologies and across different forms and platforms. In the historiography of media art, the rise of 3D in Hollywood and the development of Cinerama and Sensorama in the 1950s are part of the larger traditions of immersive imaging from the 19th-century panoramas to contemporary digital artworks grounded in virtual reality (Grau, 2003). The many ways of achieving stereoscopic illusion suggest that 3D is not reducible to an integral essence or a limited set of material and technical components (such as particular glasses, head-mounted displays, etc.). Rather, following D. N. Rodowick’s revisionist ideas about the definition of a medium, it is more productive to consider 3D as ‘a set of potentialities’, or a range of perceptual effects and cultural ideas, that those material and technical components ‘are capable of expressing’ (Rodowick, 2007: 85). Set in this context, the six articles in this special Debates section are not intended to offer an essentialist definition of 3D and its applications in cinema and television (TV). Rather, all the articles regard 3D as something through which a host of concepts, ideas, aesthetics and industrial strategies related to cinema and TV are rethought and reconfigured. This conceptualization of 3D as an investigatory tool, rather than as a medium with specific materials and techniques, is indebted",

Online visual materials such as social media content related to pregnancy are not void of bias, nor are they very diverse. The case study is a cross-platform analysis of social media imagery for the topic of pregnancy, through which distinct visual platform vernaculars emerge. The authors describe two visualization methods that can support comparative analysis of such visual vernaculars: the image grid and the composite image. While platform-specific perspectives range from lists of pregnancy tips on Pinterest to pregnancy information and social support systems on Twitter, and pregnancy humour on Reddit, each of the platforms presents a predominantly White, able-bodied and heteronormative perspective on pregnancy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we focused on data drawn from two Brazilian Facebook groups that discuss on-demand driving (Uber and 99Pop). We focus particularly on the use of humour in the stories that on-demand drivers (ride-hailing) share, as it was identified that humour is widely used within these groups. This article has three objectives: (1) to detect the types of stories shared by on-demand drivers in the Facebook groups; (2) to determine the relationships these stories have with the work of on-demand driving; and (3) to understand the dimensions of professional identity and negotiation of platform labour conditions. Therefore, three dimensions of the stories shared by on-demand drivers were identified: the relationships they establish with their clients, their relationships with the platforms (the affordances and limitations the platforms provide and represent), and the everyday work relationships among the drivers developed by establishing Facebook as a digital workspace. These dimensions lead to the formation and negotiation of their professional identity and reveal how they deal with precarity through humour. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of geolocation data by political campaigns is often the subject of media concern. Research has investigated the role of data in and use by political campaigns, but less attention has been paid to digital political strategists largely responsible for decisions behind the assemblage and mining of voter databases to deliver micro-targeted messages on behalf of political campaigns. In this study, we conducted interviews with 14 leading industry professionals in the United States to examine the common scenarios and associated concerns of using geolocation data to target voters. Our findings reveal that geolocation data are an important asset in political campaigns, but their value is contingent on additional factors. Concerns regarding geolocation data, as interviewees suggested, may at times be influenced more by the popular media narratives than the true reality of data, their scope, and associated capabilities. Our results point to geolocation data’s greatest usefulness to campaigns not in their own right, but when data are paired with other insights about voters’ behaviors. Ultimately, the lack of industry regulation reveals discrepancies in best practices and raises concerns over the potential misuse of geolocation data in the political space. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> By considering diverse disciplinary perspectives on the psychological impact, design and regulation of loot boxes, this paper departs from a shared need for a holistic comprehension of the platform ecosystem in which contemporary videogames are played, developed and governed. The rationale of this paper is grounded in the rapid evolution of monetisation in videogames, which has not only generated scientific interest towards digital consumption, but also engendered concerns for player health, particularly in the realm of gambling-like loot boxes. We perform an empirical Walkthrough of FIFA22’s Ultimate Team (FUT) mode to identify four layers in FUT’s platform ecosystem, which constitute different scenarios of use and which, taken together, raise issues of uncertainty and persuasion for players. Although we focus on FIFA22, our study extends to other videogames with microtransactions, revealing implications for media, design and legal frameworks. Our findings underscore the value of a qualitative, interpretative approach to analysing videogame consumption at the intersection of various platforms and business models. </jats:p>",

In doing so, it provides accounts of the author conversing, playing games, and watching movies with her relational partner. It also details the author’s user practices for contending with such issues as limited social and physical fidelity, functional limitations of the VR device, infrastructural failure, and data privacy. The discussion is organized into three inter-related sections: (1) intimate-affective experiences in VR, (2) the materialities of VR intimacy, and (3) the politics of VR intimacy. The article applies a critical materialist perspective to interrogate how VR environments might contribute to the production of intimate-affective experiences for some users. It demonstrates how these intimate-affective experiences are produced in coordination with the materialities and attendant politics of VR. The article concludes by suggesting that the politics of platforms and infrastructures become the politics of digitally mediated intimacy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article deals with the work of journalists in newsrooms that produce content for multiple media: print, radio, television, the internet and others. It builds on the relevant literature about the implementation of newsroom convergence in Europe and the USA. Specifically, the study analyses change in journalistic practice and newsroom workflow in the newsrooms of two Spanish multimedia groups: (a) La Verdad Multimedia, a regional media group owned by Vocento, which publishes the newspaper La Verdad, the online site La Verdad.es, the local radio station Punto Radio and the television station Punto TV; and (b) Novotécnica, a regional independent company which publishes the newspaper La Voz de Almería and also owns both Radio Almería (Cadena Ser) and Localia television. Researchers interviewed reporters and news directors and observed newsroom practices. The results suggest the emergence of two different models of newsroom convergence: the integrated model and the cross-media model, each with a different production system, newsroom organization, degree of journalists' multi-skilling and business strategy. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital methods for sensory media research: Toolmaking as a critical technical practice",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Digital methods’ turn to medium-specific and online avenues for social and cultural research. While these approaches foster empirical media studies, it has become increasingly challenging to ‘follow the medium’ and ‘repurpose’ its methods. The prominence of sensory media such as ‘smart’ networked devices (e.g. mobile phones) in mundane practices and their infrastructural dependencies confront media scholars with highly contingent objects of study. Yet, studying such sensor-based devices is crucial, for they enable continuous and unnoticed monitoring of everyday (inter)activity. The article suggests that developing digital methods for sensory media can be understood as specific ‘critical technical practice’ (CTP) by engaging with two toolmaking stories. It draws on and emphasises the fundamental similarity between CTP and digital methods which both aim at conjoining technical engagement and understanding with methodological reflection. The toolmaking stories explicate the making of and the limitations to developing digital methods for increasingly obfuscated mobile sensory media, exploring the possibilities of repurposing their functionality and data. They include building tools for app code analysis focused on apps’ capacity to track sensor data, as well as for ‘sensing’ and analysing network traffic of mobile devices in use. The featured toolmaking then unravels distinctive research affordances, that is, action possibilities for ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ modes of analysis grappling with the technicity of mobile sensory media and their data. We argue that toolmaking as CTP for sensory media studies implies engaging with these media as entangled infrastructures, examining not just their social, but also their technical ‘multi-situatedness’. This involves investigating the ‘liveliness’ of their data, or how it is generated, processed and made sense of. In conclusion, we discuss implications for ‘doing digital methods’ in sensory media research. Toolmaking itself becomes an inevitable form of media research and critique, inviting and challenging researchers to deploy the media’s situatedness for their investigations. </jats:p>",

I want to extend this focus on the codedness of computer-based textuality into a technosocial ‘phenomenology’ of the text-as-apparatus. These texts cannot be understood separately from the apparatus that displays and performs them. ‘Trilogical’ relationships exist between humans and apparatuses that are revealed during the performance of the text-as-apparatus. </jats:p><jats:p> The trilogue acknowledges the apparatus as an entity that, while lacking consciousness, possesses a pseudo-agency with ramifications for the interpretations of such texts.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In attempting to break with a ‘fall from grace’ narrative that may structure analysis of the rapid professionalization and monetization of previously amateur online video content on the main global platform, YouTube, this article outlines histories of key institutions in the new screen ecology as outcomes of the increased interpenetration of very different, often clashing industry cultures. Google/YouTube, Apple’s iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Yahoo! and Facebook (‘NoCal’) are largely Internet ‘pure-play’ companies, whilst Hollywood’s incumbents (‘SoCal’) practice time-honoured mass media and premium content strategies. The ‘history of the present’ of the new screen ecology is the history of the clash of these cultures. The less than 10-year history of Google’s YouTube can be written as a history of Google seeking to come to terms with the conditions of possibility for entertainment, content and talent development from its base as an IT company dedicated to scale, automation, permanent beta, rapid prototyping and iteration. These efforts reflect both continuities and contestations with traditional media models, particularly business models. As emerging intermediaries in the middle of the convergent space between NoCal and SoCal, multichannel networks’ (MCNs’) placement sees them needing to innovate on both the NoCal and SoCal side. On the former side, MCNs are attempting to provide value-added services superior to basic YouTube analytics, with programmatics and pioneering attempts at management of scale and volume. On the latter side, they are managing a quite different class of entry- to mid-level talent, who bring successful audience development and clear ideas about the roots of their success with them. The new screen ecology is a space of unimagined scale and scope of flourishing online creativity and culture, which is at the same time turbulent and precarious for creators and MCNs alike. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The developing 'global' network of computers, popularly referred to as the net, has sparked enthusiastic claims that this new medium holds the potential to revolutionise democracy. Central to this rhetoric is the concept of cyberspace. This virtual meeting place, created by computer networks, enables public interaction and information sharing. It is seen as providing the basis for the revitalisation of the public sphere and democracy. This article explores this prospect in relation to the political economy of the medium's ownership and control. I argue that the net's democratic potential is being limited by the rapid colonisation of cyberspace by capital. As a result, more than universal access to the net will be required to fulfil its democratic promise. Spaces for deliberative interaction in cyberspace also need to be protected and enhanced. Yet, democratisation beyond cyberspace may not automatically follow. Researchers and policy makers must pay greater attention to the systemic impediments involved. This, I conclude, is prerequisite to realising the democratic potential of the net. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Conceptualizing media users across media",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many academic works and authors have added to our understanding of the changing audience dynamics that emerged with the wide adoption of digital media by exploring audiences turning into prosumers, producers, pro-ams and so on. Gradually, and rather unnoticed, another denominator seems to have entered our academic vocabulary: the user. Although widely adopted, many media scholars remain wary of this notion, as it would undermine theoretical advancements made in audience studies. At the same time, the almost natural adoption of the term in media studies indicates that ‘user’ is at least intuitively better suited than ‘audience’ to address people in relationship with media today. The article makes the case for ‘media user’ and ‘media use’ as not merely suitable terms but also as more encompassing analytical concepts, especially in light of understanding cross-media use. First, an argumentation is developed for adopting these terms by showing the analytical benefits of talking about media users when addressing people ‘floating’ across media. Subsequently, the notion of media use is grounded in both traditional approaches and recent advancements in media studies. Special attention is given to the notion of audience activity and how it translates into a cross-media environment. The article concludes with a critical reflection on both terms in relation to notions such as participation and user empowerment. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the issue of young people and media use in the digital age, more specifically the interconnection between new media pleasures and pedagogy as they relate to the consumption of DVD add-ons. Arguing against the view of new media as having predominantly detrimental effects on young people, the authors claim that new media can enable young people to develop media literacy skills and are of the view that media literacy strategies must be based on an understanding and legitimating of young people's use patterns and pleasures. The discussion is based on a pilot research project on the use patterns and pleasures of use with a sample of Irish teenagers. They found that DVDs were used predominantly in the home context, and that, while there was variability in use between the groups, overall they developed critical literacy skills and competences which were interwoven into their social life and projects of identity construction. The authors suggest that these findings could be used to develop DVDs and their add-on features as a learning resource in the more formal educational setting and they go on to outline the potential teaching benefits of their use across a range of pedagogical areas. </jats:p>",

    "title": "What Brazilianness looks like: SVODs’ impact on cultural representation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the complex interplay between subscription video on-demand services (SVODs) and the representation of Brazilianness in global media. Focusing on Brazil’s video streaming landscape, our study delves into the challenges of representing the diverse tapestry of national culture, particularly in content commissioned by foreign platforms. These challenges include technical barriers, such as the concentration of audiovisual production infrastructure in the Rio-São Paulo axis, and textual hurdles, like the perpetuation of stereotypes and exoticization of Brazilian narratives. Our investigation includes a review of historical limited portrayal of Brazilianness on domestic television, an analysis of SVOD content from 2016 to 2023, and a case study of two Brazilian original series: Cangaço Novo and How to be a Carioca. These series illuminate different aspects of Brazilian reality. Cangaço Novo depicts a less fictionalized ‘Brasil’ prevalent in mainstream media, featuring themes of drought, the sertão, and local resistance. In contrast, How to be a Carioca presents a more stereotyped ‘Brazil’ tailored for international audiences, focusing on preconceived notions about Rio de Janeiro. Our findings reveal a paradox in the role of SVODs: they perpetuate national stereotypes even as they provide global access to Brazilian content. These platforms shape and export perceptions of Brazil, influencing how the country is viewed both domestically and globally. We explore the tensions between local content creation and global distribution, emphasizing the complexities of globalization, diversity, and cultural identity within the markets of the Majority World. </jats:p>",

An intercept field study that included product demonstration with a convenience sample of US adults was conducted ( N = 309). Expectancy-value theory was used to measure respondents’ interest in PCTV. While a majority had heard of the product, expectations of what PCTV could provide remained low and as a result, value and subsequent interest was low. As terrestrial broadcasting, cable, telephone, internet companies and other programming providers explore the potential market for PCTV and promote that market, the possibility exists that value related to PCTV could be developed. In other words, PCTV remains an open field waiting for leadership to manifest its diffusion. </jats:p>",

Informed by extensive focus group interviews of diverse resident groups, supplemented with thematic analysis of 136 newspaper news stories covering the enforcement of the Health Code, the research results offer insight over the multiplicity of voluntary and involuntary disconnective practices at both the individual/internal and societal/external level. These findings are contextualized for their theoretical relevance towards the overall line of inquiry into information technology non-use, and the pragmatic implications of the Health Code are discussed for contact tracing app design and utility in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We are spending more and more of our lives online. Meanwhile, the combination of constant connectivity and ubiquitous computing is folding the material world itself into an expansive ‘Internet of things’. As a result the line between life online and life off-line has become blurred in an existential equivalence of the digital and the analog. In this networked ecosystem, the old Web 1.0 notion of an anonymous digital persona that is separate from off-line, analog self-identity is no longer applicable. A new paradigm for conceptualizing the dialectic of digital–analog self-identity is needed. To that end, I argue that in our age of networked connectivity, self-identity is being fashioned according to the aesthetics of transmedia production. I conclude that the transmedia paradigm, taken as a model for interpreting self-identity in the liminal space between the virtual and the real, reveals a transmediated self constituted as a browsable story-world that is integrated, dispersed, episodic, and interactive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital Voice Assistants (DVAs) like Google Home provide automated news, media and other content directly into the home. In this article, we outline how Google Home’s content delivery can support the wellbeing and independence of older people. We argue that automated media provided by DVAs enrols older people in a dialectic relationship with the automated content and feminised conversation they deliver, uniquely performed within people’s own everyday life circumstances. We demonstrate this by drawing on ethnographic insights generated during a trial of smart home technologies with older Australian households who are ‘ageing in place’ in regional New South Wales. For most participants, the trial was their first encounter with DVAs and the modes of media and content delivery including for music, news, weather, trivia, jokes, facts and images. While DVAs bring new experiences via content, communication and companionship, they are also subverted, ignored or transformed as people improvise to make them ‘fit’ within their homes and lives. These dynamics underpin how DVAs, automated content delivery and user’s interactions can support people’s sense of wellness and their independent daily practices at home. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following Annie Coombes’s and Avtar Brah’s (authors of Hybridity and its Discontents: Politics, Science, Culture, 2000) request that we not merely apply but in fact historicise hybridity, and arguing that the art and science explorations of new media art have produced some of the strongest new media hybridities to date, the author focuses on one of the important fields of investigation currently linking media art, science and technology: augmented reality or what should be called augmented perception of time and space. This aesthetic field of investigation has led to a reassessment of representation, one that is not without (1) sharing some of the fundamental concerns of current neuroscientific investigation of mental processes and (2) questioning the image/real continuum principle at the core of recent augmented reality technology research. The article examines media artist Bill Viola’s The Passions series (2000-2001) to contend that new media’s original contribution to the practice of hybridity lies in the interaction that it both articulates and encourages with affective sciences, an interaction that redefines representation as an approximation, a facilitator - a projection screen for complex mental processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper analyzes social interactions among crowdworkers on Discord. The explored crowdtesting platform uses this social media platform to offer their crowdworkers various opportunities for work-related and private communication and to host events that encourage learning practices. The paper investigates to what extent the interactions on Discord can be analyzed as social learning practices and can be understood as a specific form of solidarity among crowdworkers. In an explorative online ethnographic study, two learning related channels of the platform company’s Discord server were observed: the question channel in which testers can ask for help, and the quiz channel in which a testing related quiz event takes place. Additionally, interviews with moderators and crowdtesters were conducted. The observation of learning practices on Discord makes clear that the social media tool is mostly used by testers for situational and functional information exchange like helping each other with bug classifications or solving technical problems. Testers mostly provide each other with brief information that can directly be applied in the work context. Further information are mainly shared by moderators that offer supplementary explanations as a possibility to self-help. The study highlights that a form of weak cooperative solidarity emerges among testers as they support each other via Discord to fulfill individual work tasks. This differs from resistant solidarity in other contexts of platform work, because in the observed case, platform workers’ solidarity is not directed against the platform company. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examines how a file sharing system affects its users’ sense of community (SOC). It was expected that the file sharing system would increase members’ knowledge about and participation in the file sharing network which, in turn, would increase their SOC. The aim of this study was to identify the barriers that hinder community building in file sharing networks, by examining how use of a specific network – Direct Connect++ (DC++) – affects its users’ SOC. It was our hypothesis and expectation that extended use of file sharing system would increase members’ knowledge about, and participation in, the file sharing network, and this in turn would increase their SOC. However, although DC++ was found to have a number of properties that coincide with the theories of SOC, two barriers were found that hindered DC++ from working as a genuine community. These barriers were related to anonymity and elitism among community members. The findings challenge previous idealistic theories about the development of an SOC but nonetheless demonstrate the positive effects of network membership. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the discussion of silences and absences in user participation, this short paper aims to analyze the limits of participation in defining and evaluating quality of user-generated content. It focuses on user reviews of the fan-made Czech subtitles for the HBO series Game of Thrones on the fan subtitling website titulky.com. It works from the discovery that many users tend not to `review' the subtitles by evaluating them, choosing instead to praise their author or remain in `silent gratitude'. Based mainly on qualitative analysis of user reviews, the case study identifies two main reasons for this lack of participation, mainly the dependency of the non-contributing users on the translator (who is called a `saviour') and his authority and merits in the community. His dominance in the discussion is bolstered by the fact that his work was approved by the local fandom of the show's source material. Based on the case study, I argue that while gratitude drives participation in creating content, it may also thwart attempts at critiquing the content. </jats:p>",

It is concerned with ways in which cross-platform work can open possibilities for expanded practices and experiences of radio and digital audio - rather than with practices of simply digitizing radio programmes for internet distribution, by downloading, streaming or Podcasting. These possibilities are investigated through discussion of a particular case study, Checklist for an Armed Robber, which was produced as part of a research collaboration project between researchers (myself included) from The University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) and ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) radio and new media. The research initiative, titled Visual-Audio: research into cross-media audio drama, aimed to investigate more effective and engaging dimensions in cross-media (radio and internet) drama. It also sought to explore how spatial audio might specifically configure this dramatic space on the internet in ways that could in turn affect the space of radio drama. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Esports contests at the highest levels frequently involve millions of dollars in prize money and spectatorship numbers in six or seven figures. Given these opportunities for financial success and public visibility, players have found ways to cheat in esports competitions. We draw on over one thousand qualitative survey responses from esports viewers to examine how spectators perceive cheating, both “cheating to win” (attempting to secure an illegitimate victory) or “cheating to lose” (profit or advancement is secured by throwing a match). We show that spectators hold complex views ranking different forms of cheating, displaying varying levels of understanding of the esports ecosystem, and conceptualising cheating as often more a matter of rule breaking than ethical transgression. We conclude that esports viewers’ perspectives are heavily informed by their own play, and the opacity of certain elements of professionalised esports, with implications for the long-term sustainability of esports as a cultural form. </jats:p>",

Traditional models of adaptation orbit the bipolar terms of source and target, imposing not only a linear but also a closed account of adapted and adaptation. By examining key texts from the Alien franchise — including the van Vogt stories (1939) and pre-versions of Alien such as Cahn’s The Terror from Beyond Space (1958) on which Scott’s 1979 film is arguably based, the Alien’s crossovers into the Predator franchise, games and comic books — two additional elements of adaptation are fore-grounded. The first concerns the nonlinear, developmental account of variation and descent amongst the versions and ur-texts in play in the series, which account is best modelled along lines suggested by Darwinian adaptation. The second highlights the inseparability of content from matter as regards the various media platforms in which these ‘evolutionary’ developments take place. The present article provides a model for thinking about adaptation as well as media history as an ecology of intermedial borrowings, joinings and convergences. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The study examines the communicative functions that handwriting (mode) and paper (medium) have come to serve in increasingly digital and intermedial environments. The study begins in museums, where handwritten documents are profusely on display nowadays, and where the display affordances and communicative functions of handwriting are productively explored. Three curatorial display strategies are outlined. These are arranged chronologically, and range from traditional displays, where paper documents are presented inside glass cases, through artistic installations, where documents and handwriting are aesthetically simulated, to interactives, where the audiences/users themselves generate documents on-site. Exploring these strategies illuminates the concept of display as an agentic amalgamation of showing and telling, which produces authentic performances of voice-as-participation. These performances facilitate a move from private to public spheres – in museums and online. The study then proceeds to examine public displays of handwritten documents outside museums, specifically on social network sites. It asks whether and how conceptual sensitivities and sensibilities that originated in displays of handwritten artifacts in museums can shed light on the newer communicative functions of paper in digital environments. It also asks what are the intermedial consequences of the juxtaposition of analogue and digital surfaces. The study points at the current resurrection of handwriting and paper. It argues that the popularity of paper and handwriting results from their evolution into ubiquitous resources for display on and off the web, specifically as authentic bearers of voice that index human action and agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As social life and communication move increasingly online, we have experienced the expansion and the normalisation of online shaming – different forms of (semi)public cross-platform condemnation of people and their actions by (mass) online audiences. Online shamings can be analysed as combinations of reintegrative (shame-correct-forgive) and disintegrative (shame-stigmatise-expel) social sanctioning practices, usually focusing the ‘serious’ disciplinary shaming on the behaviour of the offender. We propose that equal attention should be given to what we have termed ‘recreational shaming’ – humour-based playful collective shaming that often occurs via online platforms, seemingly just for the sake of shaming, motivated mainly by social belonging needs and entertainment gratification. </jats:p><jats:p> By combining the results of standardised content analysis of Facebook recreational shaming groups ( n = 65) and in-depth qualitative interviews with the ‘modmins’ of the groups ( n = 8) we will give an overview of what is being shamed, how groups and modministrators create and enforce rules and what is the socio-cultural perceived meaning of this practice. We distinguish three spheres of recreational shaming that ‘frame the shame’ and demonstrate how recreational online shaming is often more about the self than the other – me performing the act of shaming for entertainment value, to belong in a group. Additionally, we introduce how shaming is used as a self-reflexive tool for behaviour-correction or base knowledge for dominant tastes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article outlines a dynamic model whose goal is to make a contribution to the understanding of the genealogy of media. We will suggest a few avenues of investigation which may be able to account for the identity processes followed by different media. In this respect we think it is important to understand how a new medium gradually finds its 'identity' while at the same time expressing, in a more-or-less unique manner, a quality of intermediality, whose presence is constant and irrepressible. When a medium appears, an intelligible media culture already exists. When a medium comes into the world, it must also get to grips with pre-established codes (genres, institutions, other media, etc). What we hope to demonstrate here is the extent to which the very concept of the birth of a medium is problematic and paradoxical, at least if we consider birth as a unique and circumscribed event that punctuates the unfolding of history. Our task here is thus to propose a dynamic model that can contribute to our understanding of the genealogy of media. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Convergence or intermediality? Finnish political communication in the New Media Age",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article considers political communication in the age of digital media and the internet by testing how the idea of convergence culture has emerged in Finnish political campaigning. The concept of convergence is compared here with the concept of intermediality. Instead of ‘melting into each other’, intermediality asserts that political communication takes place by increasing the number of media channels and communication technologies, which are inherently linked to each other, but which also have histories and traditions of their own – traditions that cannot be reduced to a single concept of convergence. Empirical analysis of Finnish political campaigns in 2006–2008 shows that traditions and institutions in local political cultures and media systems prevent the diffusion of convergence culture into political communication. This, in turn, deepens a divide between voter and media generations. Authoritative political performances of both politicians and journalists do not encourage the participatory practices of convergence culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> My argument attempts to rethink discourse on John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite paintings in terms of media and technological concerns. In particular, I discuss their discourse in relation to the Victorian optical practice of the stereoscope. The visual space of the stereoscope is radically different from the mimetic capacities of photography, film and television in that stereoscopy depends on the absence of any mediation between the viewing subject and the object. In this respect, it is possible to argue that stereoscopic images have echoes of dematerialised computer-generated imagery. According to technological determinists, digital image production technologies are entirely 'new' practices which will completely change cultural forms. However, the emergence of new media specifically and technology generally does not occur outside the most dominant and pervasive media, but occurs within existing social relations, cultural forms and their histories. The emergence of image production technologies in nineteenth-century visual culture is not simply the product of the so-called 'age of mechanical reproduction'. In this paper, this is discussed by drawing on discourses on Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites. </jats:p>",

To this end, technophiles contend, Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) can horizontally link new political actors. Yet it is the traditional mass parties that have made the most effective use of ICTs, whose impact has been on the vertical communication flow from political elites to the mass media to the public. This study analyses how the British Labour Party integrated new multimedia technologies, including telecommunications and computer databases, into its 1997 election campaign. It considers whether political journalists could critically approach material distributed by the parties or found themselves constrained by this use of ICTs. Finally, it addresses the democratic implications of these changes by discussing whether ICTs have led to an expansion or erosion of political communication. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Complex media organizations contain a number of different journalistic cultures, and the introduction of convergence and cooperation across media platforms poses a number of challenges related to this. This article looks at production cultures in an integrated news broadcasting organization. What happens when convergence strategies meet the web of inter-organizational subcultures associated with television, radio and the web? One significant development is that of new journalistic hierarchies related to increased reuse of content in news production processes. One of the main arguments for cross-media journalism from a management perspective is that spending fewer resources on republishing and updating news makes it possible to channel resources towards doing 'real journalism'. As a result, old hierarchies are supplemented by new ones. One of them is the emerging division between those reporters being given more time to research their own stories and do 'real journalism', those working mainly with updating or developing news stories that are already made, and those reproducing content for a different platform. </jats:p>",

Although popular representations of personalised media (such as 'The Daily Me' electronic newspaper) typically portray user control in basic terms, such as filtering based on user-defined media topics, recent experience with convergence media indicates that users have additional expectations. For example, users expect to control their media consumption through not only filtering, but also time-shifting, archiving, and reformulating content, as well as resisting control limitations such as those imposed by digital rights management systems and aggressive advertising. There is a considerable tension between user domestication and producer design imperatives in terms of user control in convergence media. </jats:p>",

The piece draws upon literature that uncovers the attachments that people create with everyday objects and suggests that mobile media devices, as prominent everyday devices that are intimately incorporated into routine bodily practices, need also to be thought of in these terms. Here it is argued that it is important that we don’t just think of these devices as portals onto virtual culture, but that we acknowledge that these objects also have a material connection with the owner. These personal attachments with everyday devices are yet to receive sustained attention, yet these connections are actually an important part of how mobile media have become such a prominent and embedded part of contemporary life. The aim of this article is to open up this additional dimension to the study of mobile media and to place it upon the collective analytical agenda for those researching new media forms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Online spaces offer fan communities and content creators many outlets for expressing their interests, but they also tend to place users in positions where they encounter hostility, toxicity, and gatekeeping. In the case of online streaming on Twitch, users frequently encounter hostility based on identity and seek assistance from fellow users via social media. In this project, I highlight the ways that social media is used to try to organize against discriminatory cultures toward marginalized streamers. Ultimately, I find that much of the onus is placed directly on streamers themselves to circumvent, address, and keep themselves safe despite harassment. In this paper, I will argue that this feeds into the structures and cultures that allow racist and sexist hostilities in online and gaming spaces by placing responsibility – and blame – on individual users from marginalized backgrounds. Although the community is frequently supportive of users who seek advice for addressing hostility and there are attempts at raising awareness through collective online action, the lack of apparent resolution leaves many feeling that these experiences are inevitable, immutable, and within the realm of individual responsibility. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article aims to identify the relationship between video games and neoliberal values. To fulfil this aim, it analyses the covers of the 20 top-selling video games in the United States each year from 2010 to 2014 (a total of 80 different games). Video game covers are a type of paratext, that is, texts that accompany another text to promote it and to guide its reading. Thus, video game covers choose and highlight some of the games’ features over others, and by doing that they construct a discourse. In this article, it is argued that regardless of genre, the covers analysed convey and promote neoliberal values, such as freedom and choice, entrepreneurship, consumption and accumulation of goods, customization, novelty, individualism and meritocracy. This promotion of neoliberal values is combined with an appeal to the concerns of ‘risk society’. Thus, the covers of the top-selling video games play on fears linked to the new context created by the economic crisis while at the same time legitimizing the neoliberal ideal of the ‘enterprising self’ as a model for dealing with it. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "derived from advertisements, is erroneous. Instead, Curran argues that the ‘period around the midnineteenth century ... did not inaugurate a new era of press freedom and liberty; it established instead a new system of press censorship more effective than anything that had gone before’ (p. 5). Indeed market forces succeeded where legal repression had failed in conscripting the press to the social order in mid-Victorian Britain (p. 5). Although not a fan of the mitigating phrase ‘in my opinion’ Curran’s didactic prose is clear and his arguments convincing. Seaton takes up the critical cudgel in Part II ‘Broadcasting history’. Chronicling the rise of the BBC’s first managing director John Reith, she provides a fascinating description of how the BBC’s voice came into being and how it faced up to the challenges of new commercial networks. The strength of this section is the many close-up and almost ethnographic details Seaton provides. In describing how political pressure transmuted into intense internal pressure within the BBC (p. 219) it is clear that Seaton is a firm supporter of the BBC. One can also read this in her slightly romantic depiction of the destructive nature of ITV on working-class culture (p. 166) and her depiction of Channel Five with a quotation from one programme director that it prioritized ‘films, fucking and football’ (p. 248). However, her chapter ‘Metabolising Britishness’ left me wondering if it was Radio Four and the World Service that defined ‘Britishness’ for Seaton and if this is actually the main forum for Britishness of their target audience. The final chapter ‘Media reform: Democratic choices’ is a call to action. Curran’s aim is to map out ‘the main points of entry into the democratic politics of media’ (p. 370). Written with few questions, invitations for dispute or personal opinion signifiers, it is straightforward. And yet I believe that this conventional style does not ‘nurture [a] creative engagement with our predicament’ (p. 321) as hoped restricting its use as an activist text. Sociologist Ruth Holliday described the use of photographs within texts as enabling ‘respondent empowerment’ (2000: 519), and this is precisely what the current generation of media-savvy students and DIY activists seek. Curran and Seaton are the received wisdom on the British press and, as a seventh edition, Power without Responsibility has stood the test of time. Furthermore, knowing the history of one’s self and place is critical to an effective action; yet with a Web 3.0 tool box of shared media, Wordpress.org, copyleft and all rights reversed sensibilities, I suggest it is these students, with this book in hand, who will be able to indicate where the democratic entry points are. Written within convention in the current political climate, it may be an antidote to the conventional history of British press, but standing alone its activist potential is limited. What is missing from Rowson’s cartoon and the written text is this theoretically informed activist student who, in search of solutions, engages dialogue.",

    "title": "Having skin in the game: How players purchase representation in games",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Microtransactions are a relatively new feature of video game software involving the purchase of in-game items, often using real money. Players may use these transactions to purchase in-game advantages, or cosmetic features such as ‘skins’, which change the way a player’s avatar looks without influencing gameplay mechanics. Skins may be an opportunity for developers to offer – and players to purchase – alternative demographic appearances. In this article we examine some of the potential costs associated with skins beyond their price tag, especially those felt by players of color, given a normative – free – white default. While previous research has looked at player identity, representation in gaming media and players’ purchasing practices individually, few scholars have looked at the intersection between all three. We analyze this intersection within the practices of selling and purchasing skins in games. We distributed a survey through social media and to gaming communities online and analyzed 158 responses. We identify quantitative differences in responses of participants of color and White participants, such as participants of color spending more on average than white participants on skins in the games they play. We discuss qualitative themes we describe as quasi-acceptance and privileged allyship, that build on previous literature about how players of color interact with – and may feel resigned about – representation in games.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is necessary to continuously review the definition of the book moving from one bound by its material form to one determined by its function as a means of communication. The book’s social function as the high status vehicle for communicating new ideas and cultural expressions is being challenged by sophisticated systems of conveying meaning in other media. In this article, we report on two projects: electronic book (e-book) publication and reader forum for Nature Mage and the transmedia augmented reality (AR) fiction Sherwood Rise, which investigate these issues. Claudio Pires Franco’s work is based on the adaptation of a source work: Duncan Pile’s Nature Mage. The project aims to develop the book from e-book to a fan-produced enhanced digital book. Through this practice-based research, Franco investigates the definitions and classification of the e and i forms of the book and adaptation in new media; the role of the author in creative collaboration with readers through online forums; the extension of the story world through creative collaboration and reader participation while respecting and safeguarding creative properties. One remove from the traditional book, David Miller’s Sherwood Rise, research the user experience with AR to examine narrative problems and explore new storytelling aesthetics. These new media forms define the outer borders of the book system within which content is formed and moulded, and around which society is shaped. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Chisme, lo cotidiano and disruptive gameplay",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> On 12 February 2014, an unknown Australian developer colloquially known as ‘Streamer’ launched Twitch Plays Pokémon, an emulation of Pokémon Red experimentally modified for collaborative play through an online streaming platform, Twitch. During the run of the game, the number of players simultaneously feeding commands into the game yielded some odd in-game behaviors: the avatar would aimlessly pace, give random strings as nicknames to pokémon, and attempt to use items at improper moments. To provide context for this absurd gameplay, players narrativized Twitch Plays Pokémon. What began with a frantic avatar constantly and incorrectly trying to use items in pokémon battles became a messianic tale of good and evil. In this article, I read Twitch Plays Pokémon through methods developed from Latina theology. I argue that when analyzed through lo cotidiano (daily life) and chisme (gossip), Twitch Plays Pokémon underscores experimental games as spaces to collaboratively disrupt privileged readings of cultural texts and assumed uses of technologies. Using lo cotidiano, I discuss how games train players towards certain uses of technologies, privileging these logics in daily lived interactions with technological affordances. I then demonstrate how Twi tch Plays Pokémon disrupts the expected play of video games. I use chisme as a critical lens for metacognition and collaborative meaning-making to frame the fan-created Lord Helix narrative generated amidst Twitch Plays Pokémon. Reading the emergent player behaviors as chisme allows me to account for the nuances of fan labor, seeing it as knowledge that is created through experience and then shared, tested, and scrutinized through communities. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The freedom of alienated reflexive subjectivity in<i>The Stanley Parable</i>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The Stanley Parable (Galactic Cafe, 2013) is a game that self-reflexively meditates on the relationship between the structure in which choices are presented to the player in first-person exploration games and contemporary concerns over freedom. It takes, as its subject matter, its own ‘variable expressiveness’, yet must also delimit that expressiveness in order to direct the player towards a self-reflexive mindset. The article proposes, by analysing three of the endings in the game, that this endeavour necessitates the game to compromise its ‘gameness’ and to move towards being a Lukácsian novel caught in an endless interiority; it must maintain a tension between giving the player freedom and room for expression, on the one hand, and being tightly focused on reflections concerning freedom and meaning, on the other. This reveals something about what computer games must sacrifice in order to grasp at meaning and also what would be required for a work to indicate that in which freedom consists. It will be argued that neither of the two kinds of subjectivity that are detailed by Lukács ((1971) The Theory of the Novel. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press) – the Homeric subject without interiority and the alienated modern subject on a Sisyphean quest for meaning – are compatible with freedom. Instead, the carefully conceived tensions to which The Stanley Parable gives rise initiates a ‘dance’ that gestures towards freedom inhering in a subjectivity which avoids these possibilities. This could only be accomplished by being more than both a game and a novel. The implications bear upon the form of a medium that can most suitably function as a homology for the aforementioned subjectivity that transcends the two Lukácsian poles.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article seeks to explore the influence of the mobile phone on the public sphere, in particular with regard to its effect on news agendas, gatekeepers and primary definers. Using the examples of the Chinese SARS outbreak (2003), the south-east Asian tsunami (December 2004) and the London bombings (July 2005), the author questions the extent to which the mobile phone is challenging conventional and official sources of information. At times of national and personal calamity, the mobile phone is used to document and report events from eyewitnesses and those closely involved. Using multimedia messages (MMS) or text messages (SMS) to communities of friends and families, as well as audio phone calls, mobile phone users may precede and scoop official sources and thwart censorship and news blackouts. They can also provide valuable evidence of what actually occurred. Users are able to take pictures and short films and transmit these rapidly to others along with reports of what is happening where they are; they are also able to access other media broadcasts and the internet. They are what have become known as `citizen journalists'. The evidence suggests that mobile phone usage is contributing to the public sphere and in some instances is circumventing official repression or inadequate information. There is also an indication that the `mobcam' is capturing images that would otherwise be lost. However, the mainstream media has been quick to take advantage of this citizen journalism and mediate it within its own parameters. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> GIF scholarship largely focuses on GIF use in online spaces such as Tumblr, but few studies explore the motivations of GIF users in other communicative contexts, like text messaging or messaging apps. Through employing a combination of Q methodology and uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) theory, this study explores why individuals use GIFs in their everyday communication. Three groups of GIF users were identified in the analysis: (a) GIF enthusiasts, (b) searchers and (c) referentialists. Subsequently, the motivations, attitudes and opinions of each group for using GIFs were explored by supplementing the quantitative data with qualitative responses that emerged from interviews with the participants. Although each group had motivations for using GIFs that mirrored previous scholarship – communicative power, emotive quality, humor, technical affordances and cultural connection – an additional motivator (i.e., relationship maintenance) emerged. As GIF scholarship develops, the present study will provide a foundational understanding of GIFs from a user perspective rather than from studies that were drawn from online spaces. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From Bitcoin to Farm Bank: An idiotic inquiry into blockchain speculation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Bitcoin’s uptake in Turkey has ranked among the highest in the world. Meanwhile, moral judgment about cryptocurrency has remained unsure about its comparison to other types of investment: what is a scam and what is a legitimate investment? Who is ‘daringly visionary’ and who is merely ‘gullible’ or ‘blinded’ by illusory promise? Displacing decidedly North American stories of Bitcoin’s origins and ‘Web3’ futures, this article considers the local appeal and sociotechnical potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-centric innovation. I analyze the open-endedness of such potential as well as its foreclosures. The case of Turkey shows that speculation regarding cryptocurrency not only implies wagering on price developments, but it also entails speculating about the possible, plausible or expectable futures of technological innovation. Blockchain-based innovation has elicited myths of the technological sublime and utopian sentiment, as it promises to usher in disruptive futures hardly imaginable from the vantage point of the present. Referencing Simondon’s philosophy of technology, my main question is: how do speculative technologies and discourses shape the present, along with the futures that emerge from it? Drawing on interviews with speculators in combination with a digital methods analysis of Turkish ‘crypto Twitter’, my answer highlights the asymmetries and inequalities of media ecologies as well as discursive contestations over the boundaries between the possible/impossible, realism/utopianism and common sense/idiocy. Moreover, engaging theories of utopia by Srnicek and Williams, Stengers, and Jameson, I ponder, what would a speculative engagement with seemingly ‘implausible’ or ‘impossible’ futures comprise that deserves not to be dismissed as simply gullible or as blinded by the technological sublime?</jats:p>",

This essay charts the nature of the digital revolution in relation to digital colour grading. Faced with the new digital devices, filmmakers are casting about for appropriate, respectable functions. The paper examines how the first two mainstream Hollywood releases to feature digital colour designs, Gary Ross's Pleasantville (1998), and Joel and Ethan Coen's O Brother Where Art Thou (2000), work as aesthetic prototypes. It argues that digital colour may not so much entail a revolution as careful and considered integration, and one role of the early digitally graded film has been to set out concrete methods for reining the technology to craft norms. Close formal analysis of colour design in these films also illustrates how the aesthetic problems of the digital age replay the dynamics of stylistic development from the classical era. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital visualizations have seen an exponential rise in use by politicians, candidates, and other political actors. Digital visualizations are an informative and engaging genre, but when applied by political candidates, they may also be used to persuade or mislead. However, the ways in which different actors utilize them have yet to receive systematic scholarly attention. Informed by a comprehensive theoretical framework related to political power, digital visualizations, and social media campaigns, I perform grounded qualitative content analysis of all cost-of-living visualizations posed to Facebook during the 2015 Israeli election period, by both peripheral and primary political actors. I define two main argumentation strategies ( Progress Makers &amp; Hinderers and Re-Visualized Economy) reliant on different narrative, visual, and information-oriented strategies by different actors. An overview of the findings reveals digital visualizations as a meeting ground between the political power of actors, the rhetorical power of emotionality, and the cultural-political power of numbers. I conclude with a reflection on re-visualization as a means of expanding a fourth type of power, discursive power, wherein visualizations are used as a tool for resistance by weaker actors, against the narrative of reality promoted by stronger actors, relying on the rhetorical affordances of the digital political visualization genre to increase their political power. Digital visualizations thus offer a uniquely agile tool for political actors of all types to utilize in gaining discursive power in the competition over election narratives in the digital arena of social media. </jats:p>",

In particular, it concentrates on the 'synergies' that entertainment monopolies of the 1990s utilise to 'synchronise' a variety of entertainment products across divergent sites. It is argued that such 'commodified intertextuality' is greatly assisted by the popularisation of new technologies. The convergence of commercial interests in new media technologies also coincides with the expansion of the so-called 'entertainment economy' into new cultural spaces, including those properly considered the province of architecture and design. The origins of such developments in an earlier phase of modernity can tell us much about the types of products and discourses of interaction presently being developed and promoted by the media- entertainment complex. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / Designing environments that can bring novices and experts together is not trivial. We explore how we can design environments where these collaborations happen in such a way that everyone benefits. We explore these questions in the context of one such environment. In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by game studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found that their participation was enjoyable and useful for learning. Also, there is evidence that they developed a deeper understanding of the medium of videogames. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the students’ contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant. We conclude with thoughts on the importance of these kinds of authentic environments in traditional learning. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cultural expression in augmented and mixed reality",
    "abstract": "Most readers of Convergence will have some familiarity with the developing digital media forms that go under the name of augmented reality and mixed reality (MAR or separately, AR and MR). The widespread availability of smart phones in the last 10 years has redefined AR and MR that had previously been confined to the laboratory. Smart phones and tablets have become the platform for a variety of applications in which digital text, images, video, and audio are overlaid on the screen and appear to be present in the space around the user. In addition, the smart phone or tablet can typically determine the user’s location in the world and orientation in his/her immediate environment. Along with the commercial uses for location-sensitive advertising, new forms of cultural expression (e.g. for art, design, and social media) are beginning to appear. Appropriately for this journal, these new forms can best be studied by a convergence of disciplines, including media studies, art history, literary theory, philosophy (particularly phenomenology), interaction design, sociology, anthropology, communication studies, human–computer interaction, and computer science. Many of these disciplines are represented in the contributions in this special issue that focuses on the ways in which AR and MR participate in cultural expression in today’s heterogeneous media economy. Do AR and MR constitute a new medium? What are the specific qualities of the new medium that give rise to new forms of cultural expression? Are AR and MR two different media with different characteristic qualities and affordances? Over the past two decades, computer scientists have analyzed AR and MR as media forms from their own technical and operational perspectives (e.g. Milgram and Kashino, 1994). These questions are addressed from artistic and theoretical perspectives by the contributions to this special issue. The ‘medium’ question still underlies much of our discourse about the various digital technologies and their uses today, and the notion of medium has been naturalized today to such an extent that we may overlook its history in the 20th century. It is worth recalling that history in order to understand how the notion may limit our ability to appreciate the position that new forms such as AR and MR occupy in our media culture.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As well as popularising location-based games, Pokémon GO helped connect location-based play with augmented reality (AR), bringing this still-nascent technology into the mainstream. Despite growing use of AR, its long-promised revolutionary potential remains stifled by limited innovation, technical barriers and lack of uptake by users. To explore how AR figures into location-based games, we analysed 11 location-based games with AR features. We identify four overarching ways these games incorporate the physical environment into gameplay: through superimposition, blending, immersivity and materiality. Our findings show that AR is most commonly a gimmick rather than a central element of the game experience and remains substantially hindered by technical glitches and limitations. While more advanced and deeply integrated AR mechanics are emerging, its use in location-based games remain far from the ‘technological imaginaries’ that have accompanied its development as AR continually oscillates between its status as a ‘mundane’ and ‘always-imminent’ technology. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Faking it deeply and universally? Media forms and epistemologies of artificial faces and emotions in Japanese and Euro-American contexts",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Attempts to visually represent the human face in various media forms have a long history. Fairly recent examples can be found in techniques that are used in animated films and video games (performance capture) or in the controversial phenomenon of “deep fakes”. The article looks at the relationship between faces, the media forms that are used for their representation and simulation and the knowledge that is (re)produced about emotions and their communicative effects. It reveals a peculiar contradiction: the quest to create a synthetic digital face that would be universally recognisable in terms of emotional readability and response homogenises our understanding of emotion while disguising the challenging cultural barriers to this recognisability. The simulated face caters to a two-fold and hence paradoxical aesthetic aspiration that places it between uniqueness and universality.  By elaborating on the somatic, affective dimension of communication via faces, the article compares culturally specific modes of producing and reading emotions. A Euro-American tradition of thought regards them as artefacts, constructed as antagonists of rationality, that can be controlled and objectively modelled and measured. The idea of the face as the locus of emotions, which can be represented in distinct expressions, contrasts with more ambiguous and relational meanings in East Asian, particularly Japanese contexts. The epistemological genealogy of the facial display of emotions, however, does not conform to a clear West/East divide and is at the same time highly interwoven with specific media forms of their representation.  In order to deepen this dynamic understanding of artificial faces, the article looks at different examples of Japanese traditions and art forms. Examples such as portraiture and photography, the subtle illusions created in Nō theatre and the less subtle ones evoked by robotic faces shed a light on the complex meanings but also the affective reactions to artificial faces.</jats:p>",

In this article I examine the work of one artist who may be music's most prodigious multiple and who may be deemed not one, but many different artists. Techno-chameleon Uwe Schmidt, aka Señor Coconut, aka Geeez ‘n’ Gosh, is a musician who has radically intensified the creation of multiple personae and here I situate his work as part of a contemporary technocultural moment; one where recent technologies have further enabled, destigmatized, and for some individuals, made preferable or even necessary, the idea of the performed, multiple identity. As such, by enacting certain key concepts of a postmodern and/or posthuman conception of identity, artists like Schmidt thus problematize traditional modes of artistic representation, marketing, and reception that were previously based upon notions of individual authorship. </jats:p>",

This concept is used in mapping everyday life through ethno-graphic participant observations and qualitative interviews. Raymond Williams’ concept of flow is used to map how the internet is integrated into everyday life and thereby becomes a mundane technology that bends time and space. The flow-like character of the internet and its frequent use creates new material practices.

The Bandersnatch episode of the Black Mirror series on Netflix offers a unique opportunity to explore the affordances and audience effects of IDNs appearing within a popular streamed TV program. This case study combines updated models of the uses and gratifications theory of media use with human–computer interaction frameworks to identify cognitive themes and emotional valences among Bandersnatch users, as expressed through tweets related to their experience. Findings show positive emotions were associated with perceived degree of control, as well as immersion or sense of flow. Gratifications associated with binge-type behavior on streaming services were also present. However, perceived realism, parasocial identification with the character, a need for a sense of completion, and the burden of choice created stress among many users. Social media served as a valuable ancillary vehicle for users to participate with others around the program, thus elevating the interactive narrative elements of the experience, which were otherwise limited and controlled. </jats:p>",

The analytical results give evidence that older channels have a significantly higher probability to garner a large viewership, but also show that there has always been a small chance for young channels to become successful quickly, depending on whether they choose their genre wisely. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents a method for quantitative content analysis of news online. The research design is based on a triangulation approach, using qualitative and quantitative measures combined with automated computer-assisted analysis. Used to perform a content analysis of the online news output of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation [NRK] from 2009, this approach revealed that methodologies designed for measuring broadcasting news content do not suffice in the online news environment. Online research methods need to be redesigned to account for the medium-specific news features on the internet. Computer-assisted coding methods can contribute depth and scale to such an analysis, as it can extract and assemble detailed data on large quantities of articles. Using a combination of automatic coding methods with established content analysis for television news, this article presents a new design for quantitative content analysis of news online.</jats:p>",

Because of the Olympics’ close association with broadcasting — and, over the last 50 years, specifically television — this article will argue that looking at the new forms of delivery of the Olympics identifies the power-shifts at play between older media and new media as industries. </jats:p>",

The descriptive method was used in the study. The sampling group was composed of 846 participants. The data were collected through the Mobile Gaming Motivation Survey. The reliability coefficient of the survey (Cronbach’s alpha) was found to be 0.893. The data analysis revealed that the mobile gaming motives of participants were self-realization/individual gratification, rivalry, social interaction, addiction and escaping. It was concluded that the motivation of the participants to play mobile games and the time they spent on mobile gaming decreased as their education level increased. It was also found that the mean scores for each factor got lower as the age progressed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This increasingly saturated media environment potentially alters how viewers engage with televisual media and with each other. In this respect, we address how mobile devices, such as tablets, have entered our living rooms and alter TV’s social uses and practices. By means of in-depth interviews, we revisit the enquiry of the audience in the living room context, with specific attention to Lull’s typology of social uses. The study shows the use of these mobile Internet devices in front of the TV is integrated in our everyday TV viewing behavior. In addition, we recognize the complex nature of physical and verbal avoidance and affiliation in a multiscreen living room. Participants personally consume media content in the presence of other family members, which allows physical contact but reduces the opportunities for conversation. In addition, these computer technologies allow online sociability, which we label as ‘outbound affiliation’. These tendencies are discussed in a broader understanding of contemporary (media) culture, with a particular focus on the reflexive audience and the related broader process of individualization. In conclusion, we understand the findings as emerging trends that are likely to evolve in the future. In addition, we define the value of traditional audience research as well as the necessity to understand the mediated nature of audience conversations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article will look to YouTube’s algorithm to assess how such forms of mechanical decision-making can create a discriminatory visibility hierarchy of vloggers, favouring middle class social actors who make highly gendered content aligned with advertisers’ demands and needs. I have selected entrepreneurial beauty vloggers as a case study for this article; beauty vlogging is defined as the demonstration and discussion of cosmetic use, often from a vIoggers’ own bedroom (Banet Weiser, 2017; Nathanson, 2014). This is a deeply entrenched genre on the site; beauty vlogging is a full-time job for some successful participants, and a source of pocket money for many more. Moreover, beauty vlogging is an effective illustration of how the YouTube algorithm causes the polarization of identity markers such as gender. Indeed, for female participants, I hypothesize that YouTube actively promotes hegemonic, feminized cultural outputs, created by beauty vloggers with significant embodied social and cultural capital. That is to say, for women on YouTube, the algorithm privileges and rewards feminized content deeply entwined with consumption, beauty, fashion, baking, friendships and boyfriends in the vein of the historical bedroom culture of the teenage magazine. A secondary hypothesis is that beauty vloggers’ own understandings of YouTube’s algorithmic processes are learned and embodied within their own practices, influencing modes of self-presentation, tone of voice, choice of content covered, words and sentence structures used. I argue that it is essential to situate all beauty vloggers’ experience and content as specific to the platform of YouTube; it is their continued success on the YouTube platform that underwrites the value of their brands. In other words, even highly successful vloggers remain beholden to YouTube’s technologies of visibility, they are not safe from the sovereignty of the algorithm. </jats:p>",

However, the Internet rule predicts that 90% of users are passive ‘lurkers’, 9% edit content, and 1% actually create content. This study investigates Finns’ social media activities that apply to content creation, as well as the level of content engagement and sharing. The data come from Statistics Finland and are representative of the Finnish population between the ages of 16 and 74. The results show that Finnish users perceive themselves predominantly as occasional commentators of social media posts. Dissecting the social media activities users engage in, commenting posts is the most popular activity. Gender, age, and education best explain the differences between the types of social media activities investigated. Overall, the study shows that Finns actively engage in different types of online activities as well as the pervasiveness of sociodemographic variables in Finland. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Leaked documents, press coverage, and user protests have increasingly drawn attention to social media platforms’ seemingly contradictory governance practices. We investigate the governance approaches of Tinder, Instagram, and Vine through detailed analyses of each platform, using the ‘walkthrough method’ (Light, Burgess, and Duguay, 2016 The walkthrough method: An approach to the study of apps. New Media &amp; Society 20(3).), as well as interviews with their queer female users. Across these three platforms, we identify a common approach we call ‘patchwork platform governance’: one that relies on formal policies and content moderation mechanisms but pays little attention to dominant platform technocultures (including both developer cultures and cultures of use) and their sustaining architectures. Our analysis of these platforms and reported user experiences shows that formal governance measures like Terms of Service and flagging mechanisms did not protect users from harassment, discrimination, and censorship. Key components of the platforms’ architectures, including cross-platform connectivity, hashtag filtering, and algorithmic recommendation systems, reinforced these technocultures. This significantly limited queer women’s ability to participate and be visible on these platforms, as they often self-censored to avoid harassment, reduced the scope of their activities, or left the platform altogether. Based on these findings, we argue that there is a need for platforms to take more systematic approaches to governance that comprehensively consider the role of a platform’s architecture in shaping and sustaining dominant technocultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the industrial underpinning and the cultural logic of social media celebrity. Social media visibility may be considered as an alternative way to fame as it bypasses the gatekeeper role played by the entertainment and mass media industries. However, the institutionalization of social media platforms like YouTube and the professionalization of amateur content creation may lead to social media becoming a new locale for industrialized celebrity manufacturing. Taking YouTube beauty vloggers as an example, this study shows that being a celebrity on social media is economically embedded in an industrial structure constituted by the platform’s business model, technical affordances, the advertising market, and commercial cultural intermediaries. Social media celebrity’s status is achieved not only through a set of affiliative, representational, and celebrification techniques, but also by engaging in meticulous entrepreneurial calculation considering the abovementioned industrial factors. This emerging industrial structure is associated with a new cultural logic of celebrity that distinguishes the fame native to social media from that on the silver screen and television. This study shows that social media celebrity is characterized by staged authenticity, managed connectedness with audience, the abundance of celebrity figures, and the cultural preoccupation with self-sufficient uniqueness.</jats:p>",

It plays concepts of the modern world as hyperreal against the more modest, pragmatic, but vital, insights of game studies into the literally simulational nature of computer media and videogames. Through a reading of Deleuze's essay Platonism and the Simulacrum, taking the GameBoy Advance game Advance Wars 2 as a case study, and proposing the significance of automata, it suggests ways of thinking about the artificial and simulacral character of contemporary technoculture and its devices, not as the implosion of reality, but of its production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2008, a British man found that his new iPhone contained photographs of a smiling woman on an iPhone assembly line in China. The photos quickly spread across the internet; the worker was dubbed iPhone Girl; and her factory promised she would not be punished for this ‘beautiful mistake’. New media criticism has a major stake in user-embodiment but has largely neglected this other set of bodies: those that build our electronic gadgets. Attending them can enrich histories of new media and challenge consumerist framings of digital aesthetics. Recent excitement about gestural interfaces suggests that our aspirations for intimacy with computers have informed the design of emergent devices. To idealize gestural control as an escape from technology’s disciplinary effects, we elide the suffering that gesture occasions on the factory floor. Meanwhile, digital culture represents the Asian female as a vessel for fantasies of sex, submissiveness, and adventure. Such fantasies deeply inform the reception of electronics assemblers, including iPhone Girl. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is only in the last few years that multichannel television has really made inroads in Italy. This article assesses the nature and extent of change that has taken place in Italian television in the move from a handful of terrestrial channels to hundreds of digital channels. It considers emerging trends in terms of ownership, revenue models, programming and consumption. It is argued that Italian television has undergone substantial change in recent years, the rise of News Corporation’s Sky Italia and the growing centrality of pay-TV to the economics of the industry being the main novelties. However, there are also important elements of continuity. Mediaset and RAI’s established terrestrial channels remain the only truly mass-audience media in Italy. Judging from current viewing patterns and in light of regulatory conditions and economic considerations, they are likely to remain so even in the all-digital scenario of the near future. In the longer term, however, fundamental change may also occur at this level, the analysis pointing in particular to the risk for public broadcaster RAI to become increasingly marginal in future, given the political and economic constraints it currently faces. </jats:p>",

Departing from this ideal, activism is approached in terms of processes of identification by establishing conflictual frontiers to outside others as either adversaries or enemies. On the basis of these discussions, we outline a typology of four kinds of activists, namely the salon activist, the contentious activist, the law-abiding activist and the Gandhian activist. The typology’s first axis, between antagonism and agonism, is derived from normative discussions in radical democracy concerning developing frontiers. The second axis, about readiness to engage in civil disobedience, is derived from a review of studies of different forms of online activism. The article concludes by suggesting that the different forms of political engagement online have to be taken into account when studying how online activism can contribute to social change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence of media-arts and digital cultural practices has provided a highly charged context for the development of interdisciplinary pedagogy, combining as it does, practices and traditions from historically, culturally and theoretically wildly divergent disciplines. This article addresses aspects of effective interdisciplinary educational process, attending to questions of pedagogy, theory and institutional pragmatics. In my analysis, the key components of such a project are: deep technical training and understanding; deep training in artmaking and cultural practice; deep theoretical and historical contextualization, and an open and rigorous interdisciplinary context which maximally facilitates the negotiation of these often divergent ways of thinking and making. In building such interdisciplinary practice in the context of a campus, one abruptly confronts the discontinuity between the rapidly changing fluidity of the contemporary moment and the relative stasis of institutionalized disciplines which have an investment in maintaining their identity in the face of such change. Implicit in the project then, is not simply the development of a context for deep interdisciplinary invention, but the formation of practitioners who are neither artists nor engineers, or who are equal parts both. In either case, this formation confounds the disciplines and creates a vacuum of institutional context, which has resounding implications for the survival and flourishing of such initiatives and their practitioners. </jats:p>",

Digital technologies have effected a process of redistribution of social science research by which non-experts and lay people are increasingly using and developing tools for the production of sociological knowledge. Under these circumstances, we argue that such a redistribution of social science research is an opportunity to renew the epistemic practices of social scientists. With the proposal of experimental collaborations, we invoke a twofold displacement for social research: from a merely observational mode of research to an experimental one and from individualistic or merely engaged conceptions of research to a collective exploration of problems yet unknown. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article uses the concept of media convergence to examine several aspects of the successful 2008 motion picture Cloverfield. I discuss implications of the film’s interaction in an increasingly convergent media landscape, such as its internet marketing campaigns, and interface with technological discourses of citizenship and surveillance. I explore the extent to which movies produced with digital technology, marketed through the internet, and increasingly viewed in private homes are best considered through media convergence literature. I investigate the extent to which this multi-platform, trans-media phenomenon, synergizing with numerous cross-promotional product marketing initiatives, constructs citizen-spectators through narratives of security, post-9/11 citizenship, and surveillance, and the extent to which consumer activity (such as purchasing cell phones) is implicated in this process. Lastly, I discuss concerns of labour and subjectivity pertinent to this media phenomenon, specifically how this film utilized unpaid audience labour in its construction, circulation, and construction of a trans-media presence. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "It is timely to put together a bibliography which might helpfully delineate the field of practice and theory emerging from the confluence of art, science and technology within the context of mind and consciousness. It is a field in which I have been involved, with relatively small groups of colleagues, for over thirty years but which only relatively recently has become visible as an international phenomenon. Thus, in convening the First International CAiiA Research Conference ’Consciousness Reframed: art and consciousness in the post biological era’ at the University of Wales College, Newport in 1997,1 1 was delighted but not surprised to welcome delegates from nearly 30 countries. The same scope is evidenced in the Conference of 1998. Not only personal practices are represented but groups and institutions involved directly in researching aspects art, science and technology in a ’technoetic’ context. CAiiA itself is devoted to research in this field, its doctoral programme based on advanced interactive media and a networked community of theorists and practitioners in Europe, the Americas and the Far East. Its recent union with the Science, Technology and Art Research Centre (STAR) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth, with its expertise in interactive media, artificial life, robotics and cognitive science, is a further indication of both the needs and the scope of the field.2 Whilst we have drawn our bibliography from these many sources, it is of course by no means definitive. There are gaps, particularly since this is a fast moving field with new publications, new software, new strategies emerging almost daily.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / The article addresses the relationships between new media and public urban environments. It advances an anti-reductionist argument, which seeks to understand the material and the immaterial as two irreducible yet intertwined layers or levels of the social sphere. In order to do so, the notion of prolongation is proposed. This notion, together with those of territory and visibility, is explicitly designed to escape both reductionist monism (material as immaterial or vice versa) and dualism (material versus immaterial). The hypothesis is that the environments created and edited by the new media can be conceptualized and studied as specific visibility regimes of urban territoriality. The use of the concepts of territory, prolongation, and visibility also leads to deexceptionalizing the new media, insofar as new media are explained as a specific techno-social configuration, determined by a pattern of the same analytical variables that are at stake in the social sphere at large. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an attempt to help make humans into more efficient and effective information processors, the engineers of mobile communication systems and devices have turned to touch as an alternative pathway for the transmission of communicative messages. This article traces the goal of using touch as a way to speed up communication from the 1950s experiments with military systems for haptic communication to the launch of the Apple Watch in 2015. Using these two technological milieus as bookends for analyzing the co-constitutive relationship between tactility and temporality, we argue that the ever-accelerating pace of human communication – as seen in the attempts at reducing the latency between sender and receiver through haptic communication – produces bodies that are always on and attentive. Ultimately, the disciplining of time and touch is aimed at the production of neoliberal bodies and information subjects whose skin is utilized as an open channel for attention, communication, and labor. However, as we show by examining the persistence of phantom vibrations and the stalled development of Immersion Corporation’s Instinctive Alerts Framework for wearables, the repeated failures of users to properly recognize and differentiate between machine-generated haptic sensations suggest that this attempted transformation of touch into a communicative sense has persistently fallen short of its disciplining aims. </jats:p>",

We make a contribution to the literature on the smart home, highlighting its connection to longer trajectories of media and cultural change, and to understanding the contemporary formations of technologised surveillance, with attention to practices that emerged in response to COVID-19. We focus on two aspects of our model of domestic smartification: Ludics (devices and systems for play or entertainment) and exteriorities (security and communication interfaces that remotely monitor and expose the home).

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mass media and journalistic accounts of Darknets have focused disproportionately on their criminogenic aspects. Moreover, research has focused mainly on the Darknet technology Tor. We wish to expand scholars’ knowledge of Darknets by exploring a different Darknet technology, Freenet. Using a combination of content analysis and grounded theory, this research asked three progressively complex questions. First, we asked: What are the types of content and the distribution of content on Freenet? Our findings show that Freenet fosters a singular distribution of content, with a high ratio of blogs (or flogs), child pornography, empty links, and Web 1.0 websites that archive information. We assumed that this content is not discrete points of data but instead produce sociologically interesting phenomena. Therefore, we ask: What are the content patterns on Freenet? Four patterns were identified. Freenet is (1) an archive of deviant data resistant to censorship, (2) a space dominated by content associated with masculinity, (3) a nonmarket space where commercial exchange is nonexistent, and (4) an empty space with many requests not returning information, and many flogs abandoned. We asked a third question: How does the analysis of Freenet inform current understandings of hacker culture? Freenet, we suggest, can be understood as a type of digital ‘wilderness’. It is a singular Darknet space, supporting a distinct set of hacker practices. </jats:p>",

It shows the dynamic between proactive, synchronized and reactive strategies and how the relationship between these components evolves in different phases. Through comparative online ethnography of the two most prominent Chinese forums located in China and the USA, QQ and MIT BBS, data analyses and interviews with regulators and content providers, this article aims at locating internet control in the historical trajectory and the socio-cultural specificity of China. More importantly, it reveals the effectiveness of these control mechanisms and the implications for the average internet user’s everyday life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Digitisation of traditional media, while conserving certain of their characteristics, also changes them profoundly. So much so that it is scarcely relevant to continue applying some concepts, notably that of ’intermediality’, to digital media without losing what constitutes their novelty. Leaving aside the interest of this concept as applied to nondigital media, once interest shifts to the analysis of digital media, the author proposes the term hybridisation. It allows various, almost genetic operations on the media unrealisable with traditional technologies. Numerous forms of hybridisation are available to digital media, affecting the morphogenesis of media as much as their distribution. One of the most decisive examples in the evolution of arts and culture is the subject-machine hybrid, which shatters the traditional standing of the work, the spectator and the author. A technological process specific to interactivity, hybridisation also characterises a transversal aesthetic proper to the digital.",

    "abstract": "There has been a proliferation of studies of cyberculture over the last few years. However, few social scientists have been brave enough to attempt a general social-cultural theory of cyberspace. Tim Jordan has written a book with the ambitious aim of doing just this: to provide a social, political, and cultural analysis of cyberspace. Despite the seemingly ephemeral, diverse, and dynamic nature of cyberspace, Jordan has aimed to point to some of the relatively stable social relations and patterns that have formed through the shifting dynamics of virtual life. ’1t is time’, Jordan asserts, ’to outline the normative orders of cyberspace. It is time to put aside the fear of appearing to be &dquo;out of date&dquo; with virtual lives’ newest playthings’ (p. 3). He is quite aware that this ’mapping’ project is only a starting point, but believes that a beginning is not only necessary but is now possible.",

For example, it ignores the importance of the specificities of time and place, how ICT is promoted and made sense of in different contexts, the intentions of different users, how it becomes attached to particular agendas and so on. Drawing on three case studies, we go on to examine what happens when schools and technology are brought together in practice. In doing so we argue that, counter to the Government's vision, technology does not simply impinge on society from outside or follow a predetermined course but rather that ICT emerges as a very different tool in different communities of practice as the place, schools, teachers, children, community and technology mutually enrol, constitute and order each other. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study advances the understanding of consumer nationalism through an analysis of a Chinese boycott of South Korean goods. In early 2017, Chinese internet users expressed their strong aversion to the South Korean conglomerate Lotte and coordinated a folk boycott against it on the grounds that Lotte supported South Korea’s deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system, which China considered a threat. We explored the increasing convergence of consumer activities in the form of consumer nationalism with commercial entities’ marketing strategies and also with the state’s interests with respect to security and promoting national pride. The internet and new technologies have facilitated grassroots nationalist activities in terms of the ready circulation of information and mobilization of collective actions. We investigated a digital discursive space in the communicative interactions among stakeholders through which digital media not only amplify the scale and intensity of the mundane and everyday practice of nationalism but also blur the boundaries among the participating actors. Our research documented the multilateral relationships among stakeholders – individual consumers/media users, commercial entities, and the state – in practicing nationalism and reproducing the nation through (non)consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study focuses on United States-based players of World of Tanks, a historical battle arena game that features many playable tanks based on their actual historical origins, mostly from the World War II and postwar eras. Through a partnership with the game’s developer Wargaming.net, we conducted interviews with 20 players of World of Tanks who indicated that they are interested in history generally or military history specifically. Our findings indicate that playing World of Tanks is one dimension of a broader spectrum of interacting with history as a kind of leisure activity. Players put history in service of their own interests and recreational enjoyment, while acknowledging that historical accuracy is a moving target that must be balanced with elements that shape gameplay structure, competitive potential, and player agency. This study contributes to scholarship on the experiences and motivations of people who play historical games, situates interest in historical games within a broader array of history-related leisure, offers insights for historical game developers interested in players’ cultural and social context, and notes the limitations of games to teach about the past. </jats:p>",

This brief essay explores a selection of digital projects that might be classified as edge cases, interacting with relevant stakeholders through short surveys designed to determine why digital apparatus were favored. The purpose of this essay is to query whether such outliers can be considered, as exemplifiers of what is meant by an edge case, to be the equivalent of the academic book. </jats:p>",

A thematic analysis of 3611 tweets suggested that the hashtag produced various mobility discourses debated among an affective public disgusted at the company’s actions or the call to action implied by the hashtag. These discourses were framed by the spatial qualities of mobility discourses and this moment of halted movement, the timing of this hashtag and hashtivism generally, and #deleteuber’s material, real-world implications. Our research reveals how mobility discourses can be used to understand mobility topics beyond transportation, and it provides a glimpse into the consciousness of some social media users reeling from significant political change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twitter has emerged as a key news source, but questions remain about the ethics of relying on it as a source and the implications of such reliance for audience impressions. Two experiments test perceptions of news attributed to Twitter. Study 1 ( N = 699) tests the effects of quoting from Twitter and showing actual tweets. The results suggest minimal influences on credibility or quality perceptions. Study 2 ( N = 311) tests the equivalence of quotes attributed to various sources and investigates the effects of attributing the origin of a news story to Twitter. Results suggest that visual representations of tweets may have a negative effect, but otherwise perceptual effects remain minimal.</jats:p>",

Drawing on concepts of socially mediated visibility, stigma, and honor culture, we analyze interviews with 29 activists to explore how they navigate the complex trade-offs between visibility and concealment in an authoritarian context. Our findings highlight the central role of courtesy stigma and relational repression in shaping activists’ decisions, as they seek to balance their desire for political expression with the potential risks to their families. We also show how social media platforms both enable and complicate activists’ visibility management strategies. The study contributes to understanding the dynamics of activism and resistance in honor culture and authoritarian contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we will present our insights on key methodological challenges emerged from the Selfiestories project, focused on selfies as personal narratives on Instagram. In this research, we approached the selfie practice in the context of user’s personal narratives (Georgakopoulou, 2016, From narrating the self to posting self(ies): A small stories approach to selfies. Open Linguistics 2(1): 300–317.) embedded in the everyday. We opted for a mixed methodology (Creswell and Creswell, 2017) resonating on the notion of remix (Markham, 2013, Remix cultures, remix methods: Reframing qualitative inquiry for social media contexts. In: Denzin N and Giardina M (eds) Global Dimensions of Qualitative Inquiry. pp. 63–81.), thus combining fieldwork and ethnographic techniques with quantitative data obtained through an Instagram data extractor. This approach proved to be challenging in the process of establishing a dialogue between data sets of different nature. At this stage, we considered visualization as a valuable technique for analysis and communication, particularly in those case studies where fieldwork and data extraction from Instagram were conducted simultaneously. Decisions made regarding visualization processes posed different challenges regarding the intermingling of qualitative and quantitative data and the layout of our results. After a contextualization of our research and methodology, we will analyze the challenges and limitations of visualizations in our research. Taking into account the time-based dimension of personal narratives in Instagram, emphasized in some of our case studies, such as events, we will document our own process in looking for the best possible ways to present a more balanced account of our synchronous qualitative and quantitative data. We will do so against the temporal background of the experience of the first day of the Primavera Sound 2016, where we conducted fieldwork while extracting data from Instagram. After carrying out different tests with alternative visualization tools and formats, we chose to work with timeline tools, particularly those who offered a narrative layout against the backdrop of experience time. In a research where time and synchrony play a pivotal role, we suggest that adding a temporal dimension in visualization could be a way of connecting both perspectives, thus allowing to present different sources and types of data together, while also expanding the role that storytelling can play in visualizing data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of computational methods to develop innovative forms of storytelling and poetry has gained traction since the late 1980s. At the same time, legacy publishing has largely migrated to using digital workflows. Despite this possible convergence, the electronic literature community has generally defined their practice in opposition to print and traditional publishing practices more generally. Not only does this ignore a range of hybrid forms, but it also limits non-digital literature to print, rather than considering a range of physical literatures. In this article, I argue that it is more productive to consider physical and digital literature as convergent forms as both a historicizing process, and a way of identifying innovations. Case studies of William Gibson et al.’s Agrippa ( A Book of the Dead) and Christian Bök’s The Xenotext Project’s playful use of innovations in genetics demonstrate the productive tensions in the convergence between digital and physical literature.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examined the various ways in which Danish news media represented digital media as a problem over a period of three years. We present data from a content analysis of 263 newspaper articles and chi-squared analyses identifying associations between worries, voices, culprits, and those responsible for solving problems. We find professionals significantly responsible for framing problems with screen time in terms of mental health issues and addiction, while the broader discourse is one of, for example, time theft, video game addiction, and issues in schools. Technologies are often diffused using “screens” to describe a broad palette of devices/applications, are represented as responsible for distractions while the technology industry is held culpable for effects on social relations and addictive behaviors. We discuss how patterns in media coverage and expert use affects public understandings, and the overall findings that while technologies are represented as responsible for particular problems, the “screen” discourse is a space in which arguments shift between technologies, problems, and authorities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Typically understood in relation to innovations in new media and modes of peer-production, the ‘media lab’ has emerged as a contemporary phenomenon encompassing a variety of ‘maker-spaces’, ‘fablabs’ and ‘hackathons’. This article seeks to resituate the ‘media lab’ in the context of media research and education, drawing inspiration from the recent ‘nonrepresentational’ and ‘nonhuman’ turns in media and cultural theory that examine our entanglement with media on a social, cultural and biological level (Grusin, 2015b; Thrift, 2007; Vannini, 2015; Zylinska, 2012). This article contributes to such debates by presenting the lab as entangled media praxis as a set of 10 principles for teaching media as mediation: a reflexive form of ‘doing’ contemporary media studies that is primarily concerned with developing an embodied ‘attunement’ to the entangled relations of media lab participants. This framework calls for transdisciplinary modes of practice research and ‘critical making’, whereby students, artists, creative technologists and academics work collaboratively to address the affective and subjective conditions of contemporary digital culture. This article will explore these methods in relation to the concept of media entanglement, drawing out the underlying principles of the ‘entangled media praxis’ framework by examining two pilot media labs facilitated by the Arts Council England-funded project, 1215.today. </jats:p>",

In datafied societies it is often suggested that the possibilities of human agency are evolving, while also recognizing that a new form of machinic agency has become a ubiquitous phenomenon of daily life. The thematic issue Agency in a datafied society takes up such a discussion and aims to contribute to further clarification through theoretical and empirical articles. This introduction aims to achieve two objectives: First, it addresses the intellectual risks posed by empirical and conceptual ambiguity linked to vague interpretations of a datafied society. In tandem, it systematically categorizes the diverse applications of the term agency in the context of investigating a datafied society. Both serve as a foundation for situating the further contributions to this special issue in within the broader discourse of the field. </jats:p>",

Its aim is to enlighten potential players’ perception of such an influence by exploring game service platforms – that is, online spaces with peculiar functions that are getting a foothold in the sector. By following the leading concepts of ‘premediation’ (Grusin, 2010) and ‘platform’ (Gillespie, 2010), an empirical investigation was directed about the game The Division, which glaringly exploits references to 9/11, in relation with Twitch.tv (live streaming) and Steam (multi-hub with several features, from user-generated content upload to discussion) environments. For the first 20 days from the release, multiple data were gathered daily (e.g. streaming chats, threads and artworks) and framed with a discourse/visual analysis (e.g. Gee, 2010). Results show that connections to 9/11 were perceived in experiencing game mechanics (e.g. multiplayer mode) rather than in discussing setting or plot. A preventive attitude against other players emerged as winning strategy and potential bridge to an ‘interactive premediation’ in media consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a predominantly digital, 21st century music production landscape, analogue hardware professional audio technologies persist. In the discoursal throes of the leading online audio technology message forum Gearslutz, such technologies are routinely objectified, sexualized, fetishized and socialized into gear. Situated in a contemporary critical, interdisciplinary framework of fetish, masculinity and sexuality studies, this research interrogates how audio technologies manufactured and intended for music production contexts become sexy. Applying a mixed-mode methodology, including an intensive discourse, image and material-semiotic analysis of an ‘epic’ sexy gear thread, we collated extensive data about technological fetishization. Sexy gear discourse articulates themes of voyeurism, acquisition, control and animation – linking the fetish value of technological objects and their connoisseurship with the erotic potential of sexualized objects. Such discourses ultimately serve to maintain social order, and become sites for performing the maintenance work of hegemonic masculine formations. This research provides new insights into how hegemonic masculinities depend upon the organization of online and offline sociability around fetishized material objects. Furthermore, our findings align with those of current scholarship focused on representational politics of technoculture.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowhere were Walkmans in higher demand than in the Netherlands. Especially youth embraced the device. This research presents a discourse analysis of Dutch media coverage of the Walkman from 1980 through 1995. It demonstrates that portable cassette players were met with pervasive cultural pessimism, for they were believed to symbolize and spur deplorable individualism, which purportedly manifested itself in consumerism; isolation; escapism; and inconsiderateness. In debates on all four topics, youth was made out to be materialistic and self-absorbed. Such criticism, this research argues, helped create a generational divide and added to a societal climate in which vested powers could discursively and economically target youth.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this interview, Samuel Weber discusses two recent books that explore issues of contemporary media and politics, Targets of Opportunity and Theatricality as Medium. Targeting is identified as a modality of conceiving the world that is as old as western thought but which assumes an increasingly pervasive character in the contemporary globalizing political and technocultural milieu. Mainstream and emerging representational and communications media are considered in this perspective for both their tendency to proliferate target thinking (Broadcast TV news, military management of the Gulf War campaign) and their potential to open other modes of being engaged. The predominant forms and ideas of the network (the internet, gamer networks, creative networks) are examined as particular kinds of netting and working that constrain and yet retain some of these other modes of intersubjectivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article emphasises the situated character of domestic mobile phone interactions. It investigates the importance of the mobile phone as both a communications and performance tool to Western teenagers in their formation of identity. Sociological research into the use of mobile phones by young people often neglects the domestic realm, from where a large proportion of text messages are sent. Combining theory with video data analysis of mobile phone interactions in the living room, the changing role performance of a teenager is traced as he attempts to negotiate his way to a party on a 'school night.' This video ethnography offers readings of how a mobile phone is used by a teenager to strike a 'stance-taking self' amid the contradictions of postmodern home life: the competing attentions of peer and 'family' group, the confusion of public/private spaces, conflicting household rules and moralities, and independence from and dependence on the 'family.' </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "messages flowing from the editorial staff to a heterogeneous, often anonymous, and largely non-interactive audience with a homogeneous pattern of interest. Online newspapers, which doubled in number since 199~,T are similar to print media in that they disseminate their message to a wide public. Print editions do not expect feedback (except for letters to the editor), meaning that public discussion in print is limited. Electronic newspapers, however, can substantially extend interactivity and usually offer a wide range of feedback possibilities. Several online newspapers allow readers to contact journalists by email, or to participate in discussion boards. This way, a newspaper website can become an extension to the print edition, a platform consisting of a series of services and products which stimulate communication between readers and editors. There is also the growing importance of interactivity and interaction simply as a means of entertainment for online newspapers. Interactivity as a fun factor might well account for some of the popularity of online newspapers.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Why and on what bases do people choose content and share it in an online environment? At the centre of Henry Jenkins’ theory of convergence culture lie in the transforming links between active, participative audiences, media content and media corporations. However, the ‘textually motivated’ desire to participate in the circulation of and control over texts is just one among other key motives for the dissemination and recirculation of content. Ethnography-based research conducted at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic suggests that when exploring participation in textuality, performative self-exposure and self-presentation must be taken into account as well as the context of audiences’ everyday life. Thus, I propose to approach participation as based not only on a ‘will to text’ but also on a dialectical relationship between a ‘will to self-performance’ and a ‘will to conformity’. These three factors then impact on the social curation of content – a reflexive process in which members of the audience construct texts for consumption and recirculation. </jats:p>",

What is critically interesting here is not whether Vikings actually wore rune tattoos. Rather, we are interested in analysing the cultural processes by which certain contemporary subjects come to adapt and inscribe Viking runes as living artwork on their own bodies and to display images of these personal markings on Instagram. That is, we are not arguing from the perspective of trying to find a simple equivalence between the medieval and the modern. Instead, we are trying to understand what kind of cultural work the medieval (in the form of Viking runes) performs in shaping 21st-century identities in a cultural moment when self-perception and social relations have become increasingly embedded in social media. </jats:p>",

Reflecting on the critical potential of these DIY porn production practices, it suggests that they paradoxically showcase both a willing submission to the ever-expanding logics of capitalism and means of creative negotiation with commodification and state censorship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do the most popular video games in recent years contribute to the construction of the social imaginary of the Great Recession? The discursive struggles over the definition of crucial aspects of the recession such as austerity, the heroic ethos to face precariousness and being anti-establishment are being played not only in the political arena and ‘serious’ news genres but also in the narrations of popular culture and video games. Thus, critical analysis of the social resonances of video games on the Great Recession is a relevant exercise not only academically but also socially. To address this question, this article proposes an analysis of bestselling video games from 2009 to 2015, based on cultural studies and game studies. The analysis is organized in three case studies: (a) post-apocalyptic video games and their potential resonances regarding austerity and precariousness; (b) video games, neo-liberalism and counter neo-liberal views; and (c) video games and the representation of anti-establishment characters and rebel communities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ( (2002–2015) CBS, Alliance Atlantis Communications, CBS Paramount Network Television, Jerry Bruckheimer Television.) marks a paradigm shift in the post-9/11 forensic visual culture, ostensibly presenting physical evidence as a system of surveillance and control; the team of criminalists as ideologically complicit with state power; and high-tech forensic gadgetry as infallible and conducive to the culprit. In the melodramatic narrative strands, sophisticated plotlines, and spectacular performances of forensic science, CSI heavily rests on a novel and meticulously elaborated aesthetics that redefines the conception of gaze and camera shot in the weaving of episodes across the different seasons. A more nuanced comprehension of CSI’s visual forensic discourse is, therefore, necessitated to fully understand the cultural significance of these offerings. To this end, extending the work of Kress and Van Leuween on the systems of gaze and social distance in light of the Foucauldian and post-panoptic views on power and control, the article introduces fine-grained taxonomies of the forensic gaze and camera shot as fundamental aesthetics closely tied to post-9/11 extensive surveillance discourse. Resituating CSI in the broader context of the post-panopticon, the study argues that the drama series operates in a hybrid surveillance mode that surpasses conventional readings of panopticism, straddling the line between the physical and the digital in the contemporary age. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As one of the first social media franchises, Lonelygirl15 (LG15) played a surprisingly important role in transforming YouTube into a legitimate storytelling platform and a site of cultural production worthy of commercial attention. While LG15 has been hailed as one of the first community-based storytelling initiatives that harnessed the power of participatory culture, the anxiety of creating an economically sustainable story led to the careful management of fan efforts and the strict definition of the boundaries of the LG15 canon. In this article, I argue that LG15 demonstrates one of the most worrisome aspects of YouTube’s monetization strategies, the commodification of labour in which advertisers and media companies exploit users for profit. This exploitation does not necessarily come in the form of loss of monetary value but through the alienation of fans from their productive labour. As such, the production of LG15 presents a powerful critique of convergence culture. It demonstrates that the movement of fans to the centre of cultural production does not necessarily mean empowerment but may also suggest exploitation. </jats:p>",

In response, users reflexively feed six specific types of data into the algorithm to shape its understanding of themselves. Ultimately, by strategically curating data and interacting with an algorithm, yanghao demonstrates a successful domestication process, highlighting how data reflectivity and user reflexivity empower users to gain agency within the human–algorithm power dynamic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the Streaming Wars continue to heat up, recommendation systems like the Netflix Recommender System (NRS) will become key competitive features for every major over-the-top video streamer. As a result, film and television production and consumption will increasingly be in the hands of semi-autonomous algorithmic technologies. But how do recommendation systems like the NRS work? What purposes do they serve? And what sorts of impacts are they having on film and television culture? To respond to these questions, this article will (1) examine how algorithms are impacting processes of taste-making and (2) re-evaluate some of the critical theoretical perspectives that have come to dominate the discourse surrounding algorithmic cultures. To do so, I join Bucher ((2016) Neither black nor box: Ways of knowing algorithms. In: S Kubitscko and A Kaun (eds) Innovative Methods in Media and Communication Research. Cham: Springer International Publishing, pp. 81–98; (2018) If…then: Algorithmic Power and Politics. London: Oxford University Press) in adopting a relational materialist perspective of algorithms and proceed to reverse engineer the NRS; an experiment that exposes the system’s circular and economic logics while highlighting the complex and networked nature of taste-making in the film and television industry. </jats:p>",

RPGs prompt players to develop emotional attachments, so exploring players’ user emotions toward RPGs is of academic significance. This study applied the qualitative method to examine the development of female user emotional attachment in the RPG Onmyoji. The resulting model of developing user emotions between female players and the game and the three stages of the development are structured. The results indicate that female players can form emotional connections with the game, and they generate an emotional ‘virtual nexus’ in the process. </jats:p>",

This essay uses two works by New Zealand artist Douglas Bagnall to examine the relationship between machines, information and aesthetics. I discuss how Bagnall’s Film-making Robot (2004) and Cloud Shape Classifier (2006) are examples of aesthetic machines that, rather than being defined by information, repetition and the digital specificity of the pixel or the binary, are characterised by an aesthetic dynamism formed between emergence and mutability. Building on the recent identification of ‘new aesthetics’, I argue that processes of emergence and mutation contribute a new way to think about machines, information, humans and aesthetics. Finally, I suggest that Bagnall’s works do not just demonstrate machinic vision but prefigure a move in contemporary art from the stable aesthetic object to the unstable and impure real-time process of machine aesthetics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article adds an empirical production perspective to the widely discussed concept of audience participation. It studies how audiences are integrated in the production of television and what motivations producers have to do so. Increased opportunities for audiences to produce or contribute to media content may change the way television is produced, as audience perspectives can be more easily integrated. Theoretically, the notions of corporate and political participation are discussed as a basis for a qualitative content analysis, focusing on a range of nonfictional television programs in Flanders, combined with in-depth interviews with editors-in-chief to study their motivations, looking at audience participation on screen, beyond the screen and behind the screen. Results show that producers mostly integrate the audience in the production process within a corporate understanding of participation, although some producers have integrated political forms of participation as well. However, rather than focusing on participation, a central motivation for producers is to engage the audience. </jats:p>",

    "title": "After agency: The queer posthumanism of video games that cannot be played",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article offers a queer reading of Brent Watanabe’s 2016 video game–based art piece San Andreas Deer Cam, a mod of Grand Theft Auto V in which a computer-controlled deer wanders the game’s extensive open world. During the time that San Andreas Deer Cam was streamed live on Twitch, it became something of an internet sensation, drawing attention for its comedic elements and the deer’s seeming invisibility. I argue here that Watanabe’s piece can read in an alternative way: as a work of queer posthumanism. Drawing from game studies scholars whose research explores the non-human (such as Alenda Chang and Paolo Ruffino), as well as queer studies scholars who have theorized how posthumanism challenges norms of gender, sexuality, and intimacy (such as Dana Luciano and Mel Chen), I analyze video recordings of San Andreas Deer Cam. Through these videos, I articulate the piece’s posthumanist elements, with a focus on the implications of Watanabe’s choice to make the game unplayable and the powerful yet ambivalent picture the piece offers of queerness ‘beyond the human’. In San Andreas Deer Cam, queerness manifests in many forms, all of them wrapped up with the messy divide between peoples, animals, and machines: the visual erotics of the deer sensuously rendered backside, moments of sexual misrecognition as non-player characters appear to catcall the deer, even a prolonged scene in which the deer becomes the object of homophobic violence. Ultimately, I conclude, San Andreas Deer Cam offers a model for how video games themselves can be used to rethink the centrality of human agency, which has long been considered the defining feature of the medium. Watanabe’s piece serves as a provocation to consider the queer potential of games that are unplayable and of refusing – rather than doggedly pursuing – the supposed capacity of video games to place human players in control. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Access controls are an inescapable and deceptively mundane requirement for accessing digital applications and platforms. These systems enable and enforce practices related to access, ownership, privacy, and surveillance. Companies use access controls to dictate and enforce terms of use for digital media, platforms, and technologies. The technical implementation of these systems is well understood. However, this paper instead uses digital game software and platforms as a case study to analyze the broader socio-technical, and often inequitable, interactions these elements regulate across software systems. Our sample includes 200 digital games and seven major digital gaming platforms. We combine close reading and content analysis to examine the processes of authentication and authorization within our samples. While the ubiquity of these systems is a given in much academic and popular discourse, our data help empirically ground this understanding and examine how these systems support user legibility and surveillance, and police identities in under-examined ways. We suggest changes to the policies and practices that shape these systems to drive more transparent and equitable design. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "on The latest incarnation of the information society, the mobile world, is a new wave of modernisation taking place within a variety of global, regional, and local contexts. Mobile phones and other mobile information and communication technologies (MICTS) are marketed as empowering devices for liberated, postmodern individuals through popular cultural narratives that serve to normalise this new mobility. Commercial mobile narratives engage audiences in a mostly one-way dialogue on the nature of the mobile world and mobile citizenship, which may be broadly viewed as people’s ability to participate in society being coupled to their access to networked ICTs. These representations, which range from mobile phone advertisements to feature films like Minority Report (Steven Spielberg, USA 2002), help to produce an imaginary that demarcates the types of experiences, cultural interaction",

    "title": "Deep Nostalgia: Remediated memory, algorithmic nostalgia and technological ambivalence",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital recreations of the past, and of the deceased, are part of the Internet’s present. They circulate within social networks where logics of connection and connectivity underpin increasingly performative memory work. In this article we explore these developments through a case study of the MyHeritage deep learning feature, Deep Nostalgia. Our analysis is informed by a close critical study of Deep Nostalgia creations, and discourses circulating around them, shared on Twitter during the two-week period following its launch, February 2021 (n.6935). We examine how memory is evoked, framed, re-worked and distorted through algorithmic processes, and within social networks in particular, and explore what this tells us about peoples' need to connect with their pasts. First, we analyse how the shift from photo to video ‘revives’ the dead via a process that we have termed ‘remediated memory’. Second, we explore the affective dimensions and resonances of Deep Nostalgia creations. In doing so, we introduce the concept of ‘algorithmic nostalgia’ to describe the ways nostalgia is generated, organised and exploited through Deep Nostalgia’s automated and recursive algorithmic mechanisms. Third, we interrogate the ways social media logics shape the use and influence of these outputs. Our study’s scholarly contribution is at the intersection of memory, automation, and algorithms. We highlight the importance of studying the ambivalence of emerging media at their nexus with memory studies and, critically, of attending to the ways corporate interests increasingly shape – and assimilate – these activities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As a contentious issue affecting the character, boundaries and future of social order, migration represents a recurrent source of moral panic. While analysts have considered conventional outlets’ role in triggering collective alarm, less is known about social media’s effects on migration’s construction as a social problem. Working with an original dataset of tweets from the 2019 Canadian election, a period of heightened concern and outcry for significant portions of the electorate, this paper employs content analytic methods to assess migration’s online demonization and interrogate the patterns of framing, participation and engagement brought within the issue’s orbit. Alongside documenting significant disquiet and antipathy, its findings suggest that Twitter is transforming panic production and facilitating forms of reaction involving mass-participation and collaboration; interference from automated ‘bots’ and considerable dispute, dissent and negotiation. Based on these results, the sensitizing concept of platformed panics is proposed to capture how social media’s technical affordances, design and appropriation align to promote moral panics that are networked, algorithmic and contested. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a reflection on the points of convergence between live performance and the media within Indian stand-up comedy. Traditionally, live performance has been seen in opposition to the media. While the former is defined by spatial and temporal co-presence of the audience and spectators, the latter has neither (Auslander, 2012). While stand-up comedy is primarily live, digital and mass media are used extensively by comedians to build a professional reputation for themselves through their presence and participation on social media. However, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of performance art – including stand-up comedy – has moved online. That is, comedians are experimenting with the online media: Zoom, Instagram Live, Facebook Live and so on, to put up live performances that would otherwise have been performed within a comedy club or café. This paper derives its theoretical basis from Philip Auslander’s postulation of liveness in a mediatised culture and digital liveness which ‘results from our conscious act of grasping virtual entities as live in response to the claims [technology makes] on us’ (2012: 13). The paper attempts a theoretical reflection on how to ‘read’ a stand-up comedy performance for pedagogical purposes in these different contexts as the idea of liveness, mediatisation and our experience of the live evolves with time and context. </jats:p>",

The issue of whether this example presents a model for other artists to bypass established record labels will be explored. This article will also use this discussion to look more broadly at how artist managers create marketing strategies that involve new technologies and in doing so it will address various issues concerning the future management and control of the five key income stream groups stemming from contemporary music in the digital age. While Radiohead are in a position to be able to control all of their own income streams, they have only gotten into this position as a result of the old system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade, virtual idols have become increasingly popular among young people in China with news reports estimating a fan-base of around 300 million and total industry revenues of over $35 billion in 2020 (Bloomberg, 2021). Despite these startling figures, there have been few empirical studies of virtual idol fandom. To address this lacuna, this paper explores the ways in which fans engage with the Chinese virtual idol Luo Tianyi and uses insights from Randall Collin’s (2004) work on Interactive Ritual Chains (IRC) to understand the relationship between digital fan practices and the generation of both emotional responses and a wider sense of solidarity Semi-structured interviews with fans, alongside digital participant observation, indicate the key role fans have to play in promoting their idol, notably when it comes to producing original content designed to raise her profile. It is these activities, in conjunction with gender differences, that are used to define hierarchies within the community, and point to the importance of adopting a more critical perspective in relation to Collins’ original work. </jats:p>",

While these negative affect vlogs work outside of YouTube’s consumer economy, their popularity points to a booming economy of affective labour, where the exchange of tears for sympathetic ears is in consistently high demand. </jats:p>",

This pilot project looked at 16 constituencies along England’s South Coast in order to investigate what impact, if any, Twitter had had on both the campaign and the result and to investigate the efficacy, or otherwise, of using Twitter as a tool for studying election campaigns in terms of candidate and local party activism. On the basis of an analysis of almost half a million tweets, the analysis concluded that there appeared to be a correlation between the rate at which parties and/or candidates responded to incoming tweets and their relative electoral performance but this was not demonstrable for all parties (it applied in particular to Labour and UK Independence Party candidates). In addition, high rates of reply also appeared to have a positive impact on constituency turnout figures. The findings are not yet conclusive but suggest that Twitter could be a good indicator of general levels of local party activism. The research also sought to understand how candidates used Twitter differently and established a number of candidate ‘classifiers’. It also investigated the issues agenda that was dominating Twitter conversations during the campaign and found that Twitter’s agenda was closer to the public’s than was that of the national media. The research also monitored the regional and local media in the 16 constituencies and discovered that their issues agenda was closer still to the public’s. Overall, it is difficult to conclude that Twitter had a major impact on the election campaign and result. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Historically 3D effect in film has been used as a relatively superficial aesthetic attraction. Here we consider and test the idea that 3D can be used to guide viewer attention and narrative interpretation in film. The current study used self-report measures in conjunction with eye-tracking technology to record attention, memory and narrative interpretation of 32 participants (25 female). Eye-gaze behaviour was recorded while half of the participants were randomly assigned to watch Michel Gondry’s The Green Hornet (2011) in 3D and the other half watched the same film in 2D. We concentrated on a particular moment where the use of 3D technology brings some aspects of the image to the forefront, such as a prop that might have narrative significance for the story as it unfolds. We were unable to confirm that 3D effect in Gondry’s film is effectively used to direct viewers’ visual attention towards narratively relevant information. Also, we found no evidence that the 3D version of Gondry’s film contributes to better memory or narrative interpretation of this particular scene. In discussing our findings, beyond the technical conditions of our eye-tracking research, we consider the role of film genre, narrative mode, viewers’ expectations and media literacy in shaping such visual attention and narrative interpretation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rebalancing our regulatory response to Deepfakes with performers’ rights",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Law experts have been actively looking for solutions within the law to control Deepfakes since their emergence in 2017. This article puts forward performers’ rights as a suitable regulatory tool for Deepfakes, defined as synthetic performances produced using artificial intelligence systems. In many respects, performers’ rights represent a more sophisticated response to the challenges posed by Deepfake technology compared to existing legal remedies and reform proposals introduced to regulate Deepfakes. In making its case for performers’ rights as suitable regulatory response to Deepfakes, this article uncovers a tension: performers’ rights are an attractive solution to regulate Deepfakes but this technology challenges their scope of application. This is because Deepfakes uses content protected by performers’ rights (performances) in a way unforeseen by intellectual property policy-makers at the time these rights were introduced into law. Despite this limitation, performers’ rights remain one of the most attractive legal remedies in regulating Deepfakes, if adequately reformed. This article proposes two routes for the reform of performers’ rights to address this gap. The first involves an ad hoc modification of performers’ rights to ensure that performances manipulated by Deepfakes are covered. The second and preferred recommendation replaces the regime of performers’ rights with a regime of performers’ copyright. This small, yet important, change in legal regimes can be the difference between piecemeal, uneven and, therefore, ineffective protection against unauthorized Deepfakes and a harmonized international approach to the technology. </jats:p>",

Equally as vibrant is the book club movement in which the readers meet either in a face-to-face (f2f) or a virtual environment, bringing with them to each reading and meeting their own specific, influential socio-cultural resources, which also influence what they get from their clubs and how they operate within those cultural sites. Through club discussions, whether online or in person, members interpret books, forming social bonds that allow them to fulfil their desires to learn about the world and themselves. The article also attempts to explain why book club members are mainly women and how the mass media might influence this. It concludes with an argument that both f2f and virtual book club research must be conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Young ecologists find themselves torn between the desire to expose their commitment on social networks and the risks inherent in this exposure. Based on a qualitative methodology, we analyzed the visibility strategies developed by these young people to avoid confrontation with their peers, marginalization in certain groups or to protect their professional future. This involves, for example, removing the digital traces of one’s commitment or concealing one’s personal identity by using collectives accounts. In this context, one of the obstacles to the development of the ecological movement is not only a lack of commitment to the cause, nor even a lack of awareness of environmental issues but also the lack of ontological security needed for the commitment to be displayed. </jats:p>",

It is argued that mobile TV is constructed by these experts as a novel technological and cultural experience and form, while at the same time the rhetoric of novelty is paralleled with a continuous emphasis on the new medium's relation to familiar technological worlds. The article concludes by offering an explanation for this new/old articulation of mobile TV. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While audience data are pivotal to producing journalism, audiences’ perspectives on the issue have received relatively little attention. Addressing this gap, the paper examines audience members’ tactics for making sense of and engaging with the datafied journalism into which they contribute with their data. Empirically grounded in group interviews and instant-messaging group chats with 21 readers of prominent Finnish tabloid Iltalehti, the author identified four tactics, along a continuum from permissive to resistive: an audience member may 1) happily benefit from datafied journalism; 2) be resigned to it yet reflect critically on it; 3) act to prevent effects on personal news-consumption patterns, by curating the content; or 4) entirely restrain themselves from engaging with it. Awareness of these tactics, which help individuals cope with and navigate the datafied-journalism landscape, facilitates grasping the factors in audiences’ relations to datafied journalism and, thereby, understanding their consumption of news and their relationship with journalism. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Tactical agency? Young people’s (dis)engagement with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on empirical data, this article examines the ways in which young people negotiated messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp in their everyday lives, focusing in particular on the read-receipt feature embedded in the applications. While it is important to continue exposing and critically examining the power structures and socio-technological relations in which young people’s everyday engagement with social media platforms and messaging applications are entangled, the article argues that it is also crucial not to overlook the possibilities and forms of agency that can exist in this complex environment. Combining insights from Foucault and de Certeau, the article seeks to shed new light on the ways in which tactical agency can be enacted and cultivated by young people. This article contributes to current debates about agency, resistance and power in contemporary digital society as well as makes recommendations to foster more responsive digital literacies. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The ‘connected migrant’: A scoping review",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 2015, academic enquiry into the ‘Connected Migrant’ has proliferated globally. This scholarship has demonstrated the significant role that digital media play in the decision-making, information-seeking and community-building processes pre-, during and post-migration. This review contributes to the expanding field of Digital Migration Studies by summarising the academic literature on the ‘Connected Migrant’, to thematically explore how digital media is used by displaced migrants globally. Using a scoping review, this paper presents the literature (75 studies) by mapping the key findings using the different ‘stages’ of migration – displacement, arrival and settlement – to explore the benefits, threats, challenges and opportunities that exist for displaced migrants who use digital media. This paper finds that displaced migrants rely on the use of digital media at all stages of the migrant journey, utilising an abundance of technological affordances that are integral to navigating displacement, arrival, and settlement. However, digital media also pose a threat to displaced migrants who, often already disadvantaged, may have their locations tracked and their data surveilled. This paper concludes with a summary of the scholarly challenges faced by researchers and anticipated future directions in the field. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Operationalising ‘toxicity’ in the manosphere: Automation, platform governance and community health",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Social media platforms have been struggling to moderate at scale. In an effort to better cope with content moderation discussion has turned to the role that automated machine-learning (ML) tools might play. The development of automated systems by social media platforms is a notoriously opaque process and public values that pertain to the common good are at stake within these often-obscured processes. One site in which social values are being negotiated is in the framing of what is considered ‘toxic’ by platforms in the development of automated moderation processes. This study takes into consideration differing notions of toxicity – community, platform and societal by examining three measures of toxicity and community health (the ML tool Perspective API; Reddit’s 2020 Content Policy; and the Sense of Community Index-2) and how they are operationalised in the context of r/MGTOW – an antifeminist group known for its misogyny. Several stages of content analysis were conducted on the top posts and comments in r/MGTOW to examine how these different measures of toxicity operate. This paper provides insight into the logics and technicalities of automated moderation tools, platform governance structures, and frameworks for understanding community metrics to interrogate existing uses of ‘toxicity’ as applied to cultural or social subcommunities online. We make a distinction between two used terms: civility and toxicity. Our analysis points to a tension between current social framings and operationalised notions of ‘toxicity’. We argue that there is a clear distinction between civility and toxicity – incivility is a measure of internal perceptions of harm within a community, whereas toxicity is a measure of the capacity for social harms outside of the bounds of the community. This nuanced understanding will enable more targeted interventions to be developed to destabilise the internal conditions that make groups like r/MGTOW internally ‘healthy’ yet externally toxic.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we address the need for a posthuman account of the relationship between the avatar and player. We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author’s 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar–player, machine–human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar–player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require ‘affective matching’ between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar–player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditional media’s convergence with online media platforms intensifies the already unpaid and unrecognized affective, immaterial and emotional labor expected of women of color and other historically marginalized media workers. This article uses the example of Bon Appetit (BA) and the downfall of their popular YouTube channel to argue that understanding this intensification is critical to envisioning possibilities for media workers to address exploitative working conditions. In the wake of Black Lives Matter uprisings in the summer of 2020, Black and Brown women food writers took to social media to point out that while BA profited from portraying a diverse workforce on their YouTube channel, the reality was very different. At the time, popular press and social media discourse largely attributed these issues to entrenched histories of racialized and gendered discrimination in legacy media. However, recent research on online platforms has engaged feminist studies, Black studies, and critical STS epistemologies to demonstrate that intersectional oppressions based on race, gender, class, and sexuality are reinscribed in the labor and technical infrastructures of platforms. Together, theorizations of the racialized and gendered aspects of unpaid and unrecognized labor alongside research on the biases reinscribed into algorithmic and internet platform infrastructures inform my analysis of a variety of texts related to the BA YouTube channel: BA YouTube channel metadata and videos, advertising trades coverage of Conde Nast’s digital media efforts, popular press coverage of the racial reckoning at Conde Nast and BA, and disclosures about BA and Conde Nast workplace cultures shared in public interviews by BA workers. By analyzing these texts together, I argue that the downfall of the BA YouTube channel demonstrates how media convergence and the platformization of legacy media intensifies racialized and gendered inequalities for media workers, but opportunities to publicly disclose these discriminatory workplace dynamics also galvanize worker organizing.</jats:p>",

Drawing mainly on aesthetic, perceptual and technical perspectives, the paper examines how artists use experimental approaches to stereoscopic imaging and theorises the resulting aesthetics and perceptual forms for S3D films.</jats:p>",

The best-case scenario sees education departing from the traditional method of ’indoctrination’, where the teacher radiates an appearance of authority, is a ’possessor of knowledge’ and, from his/her pedestal, disseminates said knowledge to the students ’below’. The use of computers can instead promote and reinforce an approach to learning that takes into account the student as an individual within the learning process i.e. computers can be used to help develop a student-centred approach. Indeed, CAI poses a direct challenge to traditional teaching methodology via the notion of life-long learning. The use of telematics as a teaching aid means that education",

In the wake of events such as the London bombings of 2005, user-generated content bureaux and hubs were established by major media organizations from the British Broadcasting Corporation and CNN to Al Jazeera while new software and hardware was developed. The potential for covering virtually any news development from at least one of the world’s seven billion mobile phones suggested a whole new phase of broadcast journalism was imminent. This study of news bulletins by three United Kingdom-based broadcasters – Channel 4, the BBC and ITV – establishes a new methodology for the identification of mobile phone content in broadcasting. It also finds that a decade later, mobile phone footage has not lived up to its early potential. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An online persona is a public presentation of a human or non-human actor such as organisations and locations, digital objects, artificial intelligence, and media texts. This article provides an analysis of the online persona of the Australian satirical comedy podcast, Ja'miezing. Written, directed, performed, and produced by comedian Chris Lilley, Ja'miezing is a narrative podcast series that features the intimate details of the post-high school life of the character Ja’mie. The podcast launched following Lilley’s online cancellation which resulted in his previous mockumentary television shows being removed from Netflix and the Australian Broadcast Corporation’s video-on-demand service, ABC iview. The study builds on the five dimensions of persona – public, mediatised, performative, collective, and value – by drawing on contributions from podcast studies to better understand the unique features and practices of podcast personas. It seeks to untangle the complex interplay between the intertextual and intercommunicative connections of podcast producer, host, character, platform, and audience micropublics as they contribute to the online presentation of the podcast’s persona. The article highlights the potential of podcast personas as a unique form of a non-human online persona that requires further investigation. This approach also has implications for how to consider other forms of mediated communication with online personas. </jats:p>",

The role of Twitter in facilitating private–public boundary crossing was defined in relation to main challenges of collective action. The hypotheses and research question were examined using Twitter data collected from an online campaign, which was created to bring about the release of a detained Syrian activist. Network analysis results showed significant geographic homophily effect, that is, participants located in the same region tended to share information with each other. In addition, the results indicated that more influential Twitter users tended to connect with less influential users to help spread information on the movement. Further content analysis showed that to better mobilize potential collective action participants, Twitter users utilized strategies to draw attention from citizen news media organizations, nonprofit advocacy organizations, public figures, and corporations.</jats:p>",

The Internet, originally developed by the US army as an infallible wartime communications technology, has now been adapted by social activists as a rapid and effective means of organising international solidarity. The horizontal power relationships of the Internet, which allow both senders and receivers the same opportunity to transmit and receive messages, have created the conditions for the emergence of a global network of information distribution. The implications of this new technology for people struggling for social justice and democracy worldwide are enormous.",

    "title": "Political Solutions or user Responsibilization? How Politicians understand Problems Connected to Digital Overload",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Politicians are decision-makers responsible for policy and opinion leaders with unique powers to construct challenges and problems as political. An emerging problematic issue pertains to users’ experiences of digital overload and invasive media (Syvertsen 2020; Lomborg and Ytre-Arne, 2021). Existing studies report that users struggle to self-regulate their digital media use – or ‘disconnect’. This relates to how connectivity platforms develop increasingly advanced techniques to keep them from logging off (Karppi 2018; Zuboff, 2019; Ytre-Arne et al., 2020). </jats:p><jats:p> This article aims to unpack how politicians understand problems about digital overload and invasive media and to what degree they regard digital disconnection as a potential political issue. We have selected Norway as our case country because of the population’s level of digital connectivity and the tradition of media regulation in the Nordic region (Syvertsen et al., 2014). Based on 16 research interviews with politicians and think-thank experts and a document analysis of official party-political platforms, we ask to what degree the politicians experience digital overload and invasive media as problematic, and if so, whom they believe is responsible for causing and solving the problems, and what specific solutions they suggest to the issues. In addition to digital disconnection literature, we draw on theoretical perspectives from media policy, political theory, and responsibilization. </jats:p><jats:p> Key findings indicate that politicians regard digital overload and invasive media as highly problematic. However, they are reluctant to suggest political interventions as solutions to these problems but rather place responsibility on the users and the platform industries. The politicians struggle to imagine political interventions that could help users disconnect while respecting personal authority and are doubtful about their power vis-à-vis the global tech companies. The article concludes with a critical discussion about the politicians’ acceptance of the neoliberal idea of responsibilization. This ultimately produces a reluctance to discuss disconnection as a political issue, not just an individual challenge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article aims at investigating the persistence and comeback of old media technologies (phenomena we define, in short, ‘retromedia’) by developing a distinctive theoretical approach named retromedia-in-practice and based on practice theory. Far from being abandoned and forgotten, many old media devices and artefacts (such as vinyl records, cassette tapes, analogue photographic cameras, early videogames and brick mobile phones, to mention just a few notable examples) are nowadays readopted by young generations and niche media subcultures. However, most of the existing literature focusing on these cases has limits and shortfalls, resulting in a partial and misleading understanding of these phenomena: scholars and theorists often put at the centre the cultural fascination for vintage objects and the nostalgia effect; other studies rely on a taken-for-granted distinction between old and new media; the relational and processual nature of media change is rarely addressed; and in general, research lacks a framework capable of adequately integrating symbolic processes with material and technological features. In order to cope with these shortfalls, the article adopts the approach of practice theory, which enables to focus not on the media themselves, but on the practices associated with them. After presenting the distinctive framework of analysis, we exemplify our approach by analysing three different cases coming from music (vinyl records), photography (Polaroid-like instant photography) and videogaming (the ‘consolization’ of old arcade games). These case studies rely on original empirical data coming from authors’ qualitative research. The article concludes by arguing that a shift from considering retromedia as objects or discourses to retromedia-in-practice allows to both address the processual nature of retromedia and propose an interpretation that keeps together media materiality, their meanings and also the embodied activities and behaviours that are attached to them. </jats:p>",

Human memory is supplemented by the proliferation of voice assistants embedded in mobile, wearable and situated devices that provide ready access to common knowledge as well as reminders for procedural tasks. Previous research in the field of transactive memory, investigating how search engines and networked information discourage memorisation, underpins the examination of these emergent technologies. However, the article extends the argument further by examining not just access to information but when it is interpolated into everyday activity and how this is facilitated by voice interfaces. At stake is deciding which aspects of our networked technology should be developed in order to support rather than supplant human memory in conscious decision-making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Coined in 1998, the term post-digital has been used and discussed in several heterogenous disciplines and debates, to the point that it has now ramified into diverse, confusing and overlapping definitions and purposes, which constitute what I have called the post-digital labyrinth. Considering the theoretical works on post-digitality published up until the mid-2010s, I propose five different approaches to the post-digital condition: 1) digital expansion and the end of fascination; 2) the rejection of the narrative of techno-positivist progress; 3) the radical criticism of binarization; 4) the acceleration of a purely digital aesthetic and 5) the contemporary zeitgeist, our current affective map. I make use of CGI Volumetric/3D contemporary art to illustrate each of these approaches. Finally, I conclude that the worth of the post-digital resides in its heterogeneity. The lack of a narrow definition is precisely an opportunity for more diverse creation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There are at least two perspectives concerning the role of digital and connected media systems in relation to individual agency. One suggests that individuals have a gain in agency while using digital devices and services while other approaches see that users become dependent on tech companies that use data flows to analyse and manipulate user behaviour. In our paper, we want to examine empirically how those two descriptions of agency work out and relate to each other. We use conversation analysis of face-to-interface interactions with smart speakers and intelligent personal assistants to examine the agency in front of the device and we rely on interviews with smart-speaker users to understand the users’ strategies to curtail the potentially unwanted effects of smart and connected devices and services. With reference to concepts of ‘co-operative work’ and ‘cooperation without consensus’ and a discussion of media and data practices, this paper elucidates how the two agencies of users and of device and service providers are intertwined and distributed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> What happens if your favorite artist gets canceled? Can you remain a fan after such a controversy? This study explores how fans – those with a strong affective bond toward their fan object – negotiate their fannish position and practices after the cancellation of their idol. Fans are asked to re-evaluate their fandom, and potentially their participation in it: a political turning point in their fannish career. To better understand this phenomenon, this study examines the fandom of the canceled Dutch singer and The Voice coach Marco Borsato. Doing so, it highlights how fans negotiate, give meaning to and understand the cancellation of their ‘problematic fave’ by drawing on an interview study with twelve Dutch fans of Marco Borsato complemented with an analysis of online fan comments. A thematic analysis of this data shows the complexity of being a fan of a canceled artist. Further, it reveals how fans navigate the everyday political and cultural consequences of being a(n ex-)fan in this situation. Findings illustrate how some fans steadfastly commit to their fandom and dismiss the allegations, while others are more careful in publicly expressing their affection and wish to first learn more about the situation. They feel conflicted about the situation and turn their fandom into something more /private. Based on these findings, this article unfolds what motivates some to step away from this cancel case and Borsato, while others defend him at all costs. Through this lens, we can argue that this might resonate with and help us better understand for example polarized views in society at large. So, seemingly innocent fannish play offers a first look and step toward an understanding of how such processes play out on a macro-level. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article draws upon the insights of 75 Occupy activists from Toronto and across the United States interviewed as part of the 3-year study ‘Social Media in the Hands of Young Citizens’. This article highlights three major roles adopted by women in the so-called leaderless, horizontally structured Occupy movement – both within the offline, face-to-face General Assembly meetings held during the Occupy encampments and within the online spaces of Facebook pages, Web sites, affinity groups, and working committees. As key participants in the movement, women used social technologies such as Facebook, Twitter, and livestreaming as modes of activist engagement, developing unique roles such as that of the ‘Admin’ (Social Media Administrator), the ‘Documentarian’, and the ‘Connector’. The women’s adoption of these roles illustrates, we argue, the emerging notion of ‘connective labor’ an extended enactment of Bennett and Segerberg’s (2012) notion of ‘the logic of connective action’, augmenting its logic to reveal the often hidden labor of women in sustaining the networked and affective dimension of social movements. This article highlights the gendered, hybrid, embodied, and material nature of women’s connective labor that has supported, and in many ways sustained, the contemporary Occupy movement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In China, deepfakes are commonly known as huanlian, which literally means “changing faces.” Huanlian content, including face-swapped images and video reenactments, has been circulating in China since at least 2018, at first through amateur users experimenting with machine learning models and then through the popularization of audiovisual synthesis technologies offered by digital platforms. Informed by a wealth of interdisciplinary research on media manipulation, this article aims at historicizing, contextualizing, and disaggregating huanlian in order to understand how synthetic media is domesticated in China. After briefly summarizing the global emergence of deepfakes and the local history of huanlian, I discuss three specific aspects of their development: the launch of the ZAO app in 2019 with its societal backlash and regulatory response; the commercialization of deepfakes across formal and informal markets; and the communities of practice emerging around audiovisual synthesis on platforms like Bilibili. Drawing on these three cases, the conclusion argues for the importance of situating specific applications of deep learning in their local contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on a larger practice-based research project in digital writing, this article examines how the materiality of digital media contributes to a layered metaphor that delivers meaning, reflects on the cognitive processes (the writer’s and the reader’s) of navigation and generates a dynamic narrative structure through multimodality, unnatural narration and user interaction. Many writers and artists engage with their chosen medium through an instinctive understanding of the materials at hand, gained through experience; the explicit study of a medium’s materiality is not always required for artistic success, however, that may be judged. This article offers insights into the creative process of creating digital, multimodal fiction, based on a practice-based research project designed to explore the effects of digital media on author and text, and argues that digital media have a significant effect on the outcome of the artefact itself. Awareness of these effects, their variations according to hardware and software, and the affordances of these various materials offer the digital writer greater insight and capability to craft his/her texts for the desired metaphorical meaning. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Special Issue Introduction: Politicizing agency in digital play after humanism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although digital games offer pleasures of causal clarity – and moral order – much remains unresolved in their texts, paratexts, and practices. The worldly coherence and agential harmony of digital games are not innocent. They cultivate modes of subjectivity in game culture that vindicate masculinist, colonial, and extractivist ways of being in the world. At the same time, games are used by developers, players, and streamers to wrestle with the limits and complicities of human agency, where stories find no closure and things do not add up. This special issue begins at these rough edges and loose ends to examine the ruptures and residues of agency as a liberal humanist ideology that is crystallized and critiqued by digital play and game making. Drawing from critical posthumanism’s problematization of agency, the articles collected here explore digital play’s mediation of heroism and authoritarianism, contagion and ableism, automatism and creativity. These critical explorations signal a shift in conceptualizations of agency away from agency as a quality afforded in the closed circuit of game and player by building on understandings of play as assemblages co-constituted by players, platforms, and institutions. Instead of agentic qualities, these articles collectively emphasize the plurality of ‘agentic modalities’ that are unevenly interwoven from player interpretations, platform infrastructures, game designs, and developer software tools. This issue’s focus on agency’s modalities instead of substance contributes to the ongoing shift in games research away from the analysis of structural properties of game systems. Instead, this special issue presents contextualized case studies that foreground performances of livability through modalities at and beyond the margins of the agentic frame. Our contribution to these debates lies in this special issue’s collective critique of this agentic frame and its liberal humanism by grounding posthuman theorizations vis-à-vis positionalities of race, class, gender, sexuality, and ability. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores how newsmakers exploit numeric records in order to anticipate the future. As this nascent area of data journalism experiments with predictive analytics, we examine its reports and computer-generated presentations, often infographics and data visualizations, and ask what time frames and topics are covered by these diagrammatic displays. We also interrogate the strategies that are employed in order to modulate the uncertainty involved in calculating for more than one possible outlook. Based on a comprehensive sample of projects, our analysis shows how data journalism seeks accuracy but has to cope with a number of different prospective probabilities and the puzzle of how to address this multiplicity of futures. Despite their predictive ambition, these forecasts are inherently grounded in the past because they are based on archival data. We conclude that this form of quantified premediation limits the range of imaginable future thoughts to one preferred mode, namely extrapolation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Database as Symbolic Form",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> After the novel, and subsequently cinema, privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate - database. Many new media objects do not tell stories; they don't have a beginning or end; in fact, they don't have any development, thematically, formally or otherwise which would organise their elements into a sequence. Instead, they are collections of individual items, where every item has the same significance as any other. Why do new media favour database form over others? Can we explain its popularity by analysing the specificity of the digital medium and computer programming? What is the relationship between database and another form, which has traditionally dominated human culture - narrative? In addressing these questions, the article discusses the connection between the computer's ontology - the way the computer's organisation of data represents the world - and the new cultural forms privileged by computer culture such as database. Saussure's notions of the paradigm and the syntagm are used to theorise the relationship between database and narrative. A possible history of a database form in modern media and culture in general is sketched. The last part of the article addreses the tension between database and narrative in the history of cinema. It considers the works of such filmmakers as Peter Greenaway and Dziga Vertov as part of the tradition which can be called 'database cinema'. This cinema tries to merge databases and narrative into a new form, thus anticipating one of the key problems of new media art. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We are surrounded by archives, archives personal and national; our externalized memories and their material placeholders line our shelves and attics, just as they crowd the vaults of our national repositories. But how do we relate to archives as material memories? What do we gain in their preservation, and what, paradoxically, might we lose? For good reason, archival materials are conserved and preserved in order to ward off dissolution, of both the things themselves and their memory function. But what does archival preservation prevent us from feeling, seeing and doing? What creative possibilities might be released when the archive is dissolved? In this article, we discuss our art–science collaboration, after | image. This project is about personal and material memory and about archival preservation and dissolution; it features time-lapse macrophotography of photographic negatives being chemically and physically destroyed. The negatives come from Grayson Cooke’s studies in photography at high school – this archive has been stored in his parents’ attic for 20 years, nominally ‘preserved’ for posterity but degrading nevertheless, as all material objects do. The submission of a personal archive to chemical destruction not conservation, and to a digital recording of this destruction, highlights the crux of the project’s enquiry and introduces its affective charge. Why destroy the archive, why commit archival treason? Because in doing so, you can make it live again. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "the shoulders of dwarves – or, at least, of media academia’s mediocracy. Cultural theory, it appears, is an offshoot of media studies, one which has taken place for the most part in the UK, and which started in the early 1980s. Salman Rushdie once commented (in a review of Umberto Eco’s second novel) that, if this was the way European literature was heading, he’d rather catch a different bus. I must confess to a rather more sympathetic response to Hills’s How to Do Things with Cultural Theory. If this is the way that theory’s going, I’d like to jump on the bus, or on the bandwagon, myself – as Hills’s ‘method’ gets you where you want to go a damned sight faster than traditional routes will allow, and at a significantly reduced cost. When Hills misuses theoretical terminology for his own ends – when he presents ideas ‘nonexhaustively and in no special order’ – it may simply be that he’s just as lazy as the rest of us, but that he’s smart enough to have a few good excuses up his sleeve. There are those who might accuse Hills’s thesis – that ‘what cultural theory needs is more fans’ – to be somewhat self-serving, in the light of his assertion that he is indeed one such ‘academic fan’ himself. Yet the author deftly dodges such allegations by calling into question the out-moded moralism of those who would challenge the self-interested hypocrisy of cultural theory. I remain to be entirely convinced by his arguments, but I suspect – with some slight trepidation – that I will be, one day, soon. It seems that we must all move with the times, for the times they have a-changed.",

    "title": "Playing it Cool: Considering McLuhan’s Hot and Cool taxonomy for Game Studies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> While Marshall McLuhan is often acknowledged as an influential theorist for Game Studies, there is very little work currently available that directly attempts to apply McLuhan’s theoretical framework and terminology. This article, therefore, provides an overview, interrogation and application of McLuhan’s taxonomy of Hot and Cool media to digital games. McLuhan describes Hot media as ‘high fidelity’ and ‘low participation’, while Cool media are conversely ‘high participation’ and ‘low fidelity’. The article summarizes McLuhan’s conceptual spectrum and articulates how these qualities can exist not only within digital games but also within the player: their skills, competencies and literacies. In doing so, we propose the further quality of ‘pattern’ to better describe how Hot and Cool features operate within game experiences. The article finally discusses how Hot and Cool game designs can impact user’s affective, cognitive, motoric and sociocultural responses to the play experience. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rethinking the distinctions between old and new media: Introduction",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent approaches to media change have convincingly shown that distinctions between old and new media are inadequate to describe the complexity of present and past technological configurations. Yet, oldness and newness remain powerful ways to describe and understand media change and continue to direct present-day perceptions and interactions with a wide range of technologies – from vinyl records to artificial intelligence voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. How can one refuse rigid definitions of old and new, while at the same time retaining the usefulness and pertinence of these concepts for the study and analysis of media change? This introduction to the special issue entitled ‘Rethinking the Distinctions between Old and New Media’ aims to answer this question by taking up the notion of biography. We argue that the recurrence of oldness and newness as categories to describe media is strictly related to the fact that interactions with media are embedded within a biographical understanding of time, which refers both to the life course of people or objects and to the narratives that are created and disseminated about them. Employing this approach entails considering the history of a medium against the history of the changing definitions that are attributed to it and, more broadly, to considering time not only as such but also against the narratives that make it thinkable and understandable. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Comparative VOD catalogue research: Circulation, presence and prominence of British content in Europe",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Video-on-demand (VoD) platforms have become primary spaces for encounters with transnational film and television, particularly among younger audiences. The expansion of global US-owned VoD services like Netflix has generated questions about the availability, discoverability, and prominence of domestic and European content, making the issue of how to analyse VoD catalogues pressing. Two perspectives are prevalent in VoD catalogue research: ‘back-end’ research emphasising composition and circulation; and ‘front-end’ analysing content presentation and discoverability. Quantitative methods facilitate comparative and longitudinal analyses of what is found on which VoD catalogues. Qualitative methods examine where and how audiences find content. This article, fostering synergy between the two, probes (1) the significance of VoD catalogue research in understanding the dynamics of transnational content flows and audience behaviours, and (2) its methodological possibilities and limitations. Focusing on British content in European VoD catalogues, it draws on two research projects: EUVoD (Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond AUFF, 2021–2024), analysing the developing European VoD market within changing conditions of competition and policy; and Screen Encounters with Britain (AHRC, 2022–2025), investigating young Europeans’ use of British film and TV. The article utilises the European Audiovisual Observatory’s databases of European works and the streaming guide JustWatch.com, combined with systematic tracking of VoD landing pages. It thus maps content availability, popularity, and promotional strategies across different European markets and services, showcasing how patterns of presence, prominence and circulation shape probable audience encounters with non-domestic content. The article probes methodological considerations, complexities and caveats applicable to wider catalogue research into transnational media. In the case of British content availability on VoD, it shows how a vast number of ca. 15,000 individual UK titles available in European catalogues boils down to about 200 titles that can be easily found on Netflix, and 70 titles there of that young audiences (aged 16–34) recall as UK shows they know and remember. </jats:p>",

Instead, this article details how the artifacts created to `play' a primary producer's content have become the primary work for massive global audiences. This phenomenon is observed in the genre of alternate reality games (ARGs) and is illustrated through a theory of `tiering'. Tiers provide separate content to different audiences. ARG designers tier their projects, targeting different players with different content. ARG player-production then creates another tier for non-playing audiences. To explicate this point, the features that provoke player-production — producer-tiering, ARG aesthetics and transmedia fragmentation — are interrogated, alongside the character of the subsequent player-production. Finally, I explore the aspects of the player-created tiers that attract massive audiences, and then posit what these observations may indicate about contemporary art forms and society in general. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>/ Recently, some scholars have suggested that new media technologies are opening up spaces for the sexual emancipation of previously marginalized groups. These ‘DIY’ web cultures would facilitate different, more authentic, representations of gender and sexuality than conventionally available in mainstream pornography. This study examines these propositions by analyzing a sample of 100 user-generated ‘amateur’ videos on YouPorn, an adult video-sharing website. It is demonstrated how an adherence to a masculine, heteronormative ‘pornoscript’ structures the possible ways in which sexual pleasure is enacted and visualized in these videos. Simultaneously, their alleged proximity to ‘real life’ works to naturalize these representations, enabling the reification of their gender ideology through a denial of their imaginary dimension. It is concluded that, rather than providing a space for alternative sexual representations, YouPorn manifests itself as a site where pornography, participatory media, and the representation/fetishation of ‘reality’ converge to maintain a politically conservative gender ideology.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on interviews conducted with mobile game players, and those interviews reveal that mobile games invite behaviors conducive to a corporeal agency that break away from traditional conceptions of gaming time and space. I argue that mobile gaming bodies demonstrate a more fluid relationship with touch, space, time, and physicality than traditional forms of gaming, allowing players to move their fingers, hands, and bodies through time and space while performing the corporeal task of gaming. The analysis consists of sections dedicated to three primary elements of mobile gaming’s corporeal agency: physicality, temporality, and spatiality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Transmedia storyworlds often stem from a blockbuster “anchor property” that connects numerous extensions in multiple media forms. Consequently, transmedia can potentially diversify the media industry’s narratives since each medium may follow a different character whose perspective reinterprets the storyworld’s central themes and events. However, this article argues that a narrative strategy has emerged for “transmediating difference,” wherein politically contested storylines, LGBTQ characters, and the perspectives of women and people of color are sectioned off in low-budget transmedia extensions while blockbuster narratives remain primarily the domain of straight, able-bodied, white male protagonists. This story structure reveals the resiliency of industry assumptions about marketability while also isolating the experience of transmedia audiences, allowing companies to profit from inclusive and sanitized versions of the same narrative world. Like algorithmic “filter bubbles,” transmediating difference undermines cultural pluralism, and ushers in a paradoxical new form of invisibility despite increasingly diverse representation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "On the relativity of old and new media: A lifeworld perspective",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is an old, yet, accurate observation that the ‘newness’ of media is and most probably will continue to be a catalyst for research in media and communication studies. At the same time, there are numerous academic voices who stress that studying media change demands an awareness of the complexities at play interweaving the new with the old and the changes with the continuities. Over the last decades, compelling theoretical approaches and conceptualizations were introduced that aimed at grasping what defines old and new media under the conditions of complex, disruptive media change. Drawing from this theoretical work, we propose an empirical approach that departs from the perception of media users and how they make sense of media in their everyday affairs. The article argues that an inquiry of media change has to ground the construction of media as old or new in the context of lifeworlds in which media deeply affect users on a daily basis from early on. The concept of media ideology (Gershon, 2010a, 2010b) is used to investigate notions of ‘oldness’ and ‘newness’ people develop when they renegotiate the meaning of media for themselves or collectively with others. Based on empirical data from 35 in-depth interviews, distinct ways how the relativity but also relationality of old and new media are shaped against each other are identified. In the analysis, the article focuses on the aspects of rhetoric, everyday experiences, and emotions as well as on media generations, all of which inform media ideologies and thereby influence how media users define old and new media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the emerging scholarship on live-streaming sites, the role of gender has been relatively overlooked. This article aims to address this oversight by capturing the controversial rise of nüzhubo (Chinese for ‘female casters’) in the Chinese live-streaming platform, Douyu. Through ethnographic research on Douyu over 2 years, we have witnessed female performers who – motivated by both entrepreneurial spirit and creative agency – have embraced new forms of performative practices in, and around, video game commentary cultures. We begin with a brief contextualizing the gendered nature of media in the history of Chinese video sites and how theories around gender – especially gender performativity – might be adapted. While acknowledging the homogenizing effect of the term nüzhubo, we focus on two performers on Douyu – Hani9 and Nvliu – that are challenging conventional nüzhubo tropes. We argue for a situated notion of gender performativity that also engages with the platform-specific social, cultural and technical infrastructures – ‘platformativity’ to use Thomas Lamarre’s word. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite a lack of consumer interest as recently as 2012, virtual reality (VR) technologies entered the mainstream in 2014 backed by multinational corporations, including Facebook and Google. At the heart of this transition is Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus and purported ‘face’ of VR. This article develops a case study centred on Palmer Luckey to examine the rise of contemporary VR within the overlapping, contemporaneous contexts of video game culture and the misogynistic gamergate movement. As gamergate expanded its scope with far-right political fervour, Luckey’s political ambitions also expanded in scope. I argue that Luckey’s promotion under the banner of ‘progress’ serves to reify White, male systems of power that are both established and contested within cultures of technological development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article investigates the power of audio as a storytelling medium and its capacity to provide immersive narrative-based experiences. In particular, it examines the potential of immersive or spatial audio to engage young people with the complex and pressing issue of racism by focusing on the artwork [re]locate: a multi-channel sound installation revisiting the racially motivated murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. [re]locate metaphorically places the audience at the bus stop where Stephen Lawrence was attacked, and allows them to experience an audio-only reconstruction of events associated with his murder and its aftermath. Based on a reflexive thematic analysis of the qualitative feedback elicited after encounters with the artwork, the article seeks to understand young people’s perspectives on events, their sense of engagement with the story and the aesthetic and technical features of the installation that create a sense of immersion, and induce presence. It argues that the perceived potency of the artwork and its ability to engage young people with the issue not only resides in the inherent qualities of sound, but also in the capacity of the spatial audio design of the installation to heighten the sense of immersion, induce presence and enhance cognitive and emotional perspective taking.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A week after the back-to-back police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling in early July 2016, a game developer, who goes by the screen name Yvvy, sat in front of her console mulling over the headlines. She designed a newsgame that featured civilian–police interactions that were plucked from that reportage. She entitled it Easy Level Life. The newsgame is fashioned in what developers call ‘endless mode’, where players are challenged to last as long as possible against a continuing threat, with limited resources or player-character lives. This case study explores the procedural rhetoric of Easy Level Life to investigate how it condemns police brutality through play. Using Teun van Dijk’s concept of ‘news as discourse’ as the framework, I found that this newsgame followed the narrative structure of a traditional newspaper editorial very closely. I explain how the situation–evaluation–conclusion discursive model best describes how Easy Level Life conveys its political ideologies. I conclude by suggesting that this discursive model should perhaps become a benchmarking tool for future newsgame developers who aim to strengthen their arguments for social justice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Automation in the home is often presented as a value neutral process which makes life easier, more efficient and more productive. As recent research on the introduction of domestic technologies has revealed, these technologies are rarely value neutral and often work to reinforce gender dynamics in the household. This article examines the gendered and generational dimensions of how smart and automated technologies are being integrated into homes. Drawing upon 3 years research conducted between 2015 and 2017 in 11 households in Melbourne, Australia, we examine how households manage the storing and transfer of digital material and digital devices (images, videos and files from smartphones, tablets and laptops). Digital materials move within households and between different family members, and these processes are governed by often unstated rules, including changes in the life course. By examining the relationships between gendered and generational roles and automation in the household, we highlight the importance of smaller scale interpersonal relationships, which influences the negotiation of automation in emotionally laden contexts of families. Automated decision making may both support and challenge gendered norms around technology ownership and management. </jats:p>",

Highlighting the specificity of cross-media uses within meta-media environments such as Facebook, we argue that interpretative processes play a crucial role in the formation of cross-media repertoires. The methodology relies on a reception analysis for which we conducted interviews with eleven expatriates using Facebook on a daily basis, in conjunction with a commented consultation of their newsfeed. In the analysis, we show that reading Facebook’s newsfeed is an activity that contributes to the construction of the user’s mediated lifeworld. Schutz’s phenomenological approach allows us to explore how users develop reading strategies to typify their experience of the social world within Facebook, to maintain the relevance of their newsfeed and to negotiate the technological features of Facebook, shedding light on how users assemble their cross-mediated experience within meta-media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Virtual reality (VR) technology is an emerging medium of experience in many different public-facing entertainment and cultural contexts, such as immersive theatre, live performance, VR film festivals, gaming arcades, escape rooms, and museum exhibitions. The processes of ushering audience members or users into the virtual experience and out again, to which I refer here as ‘onboarding’ and ‘offboarding’, have been considered within some specific contexts, or on a case-by-case basis, but to date no systematised consideration of VR onboarding and offboarding has been produced. One reason for this is that ambiguities in disciplinary and practical definitions of immersion have obscured the relationship between VR technology and users. Clarification of this relationship results in clear evidence of a need for attention to onboarding and offboarding processes in public-facing contexts. In this paper, I define onboarding and offboarding, and present a framework for considering the onboarding and offboarding experiences of virtual reality audiences that helps stakeholders identify both their responsibilities to audiences and the best way to facilitate the immersive experience. This framework is based upon identifying experience goals, centred on the affordances of virtual reality and principles of immersion and presence, and utilises the Immersive Audience Framework developed by StoryFutures in its interdisciplinary research with immersive audiences since 2019.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past decade, scholarly interest in “digital disconnection” and related concepts has grown in media and communication studies, and in related disciplines. The idea of digital disconnection explicitly references digitalization as a key societal development, creating conditions of intensified and embedded media involvement across social life. The notion of digital disconnection thereby represents a critical response to mediated conditions that characterize our societies and permeate our everyday lives. In this special issue, we take stock of the contributions, challenges, and promises of digital disconnection research. We showcase how digital disconnection scholarship intersects with other developments in media and communication research, and is part of debates and empirical analysis in related disciplines from tourism studies to psychology. We argue that one of the key strengths of the emergent work is the variety of social domains and conceptual debates that are included and explored in digital disconnection research. On the other hand, we also point to the need for further methodological development, conceptual consolidation, and empirical diversity, particularly in the face of global inequalities and ongoing crises. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In times of crisis, the spread of conspiracy myths increases since people seek answers to complex questions. Besides societal aspects, social media platforms, especially messenger services, have been identified as a positive driver for spreading conspiracy myths. Much research focused on whether right-wing populist attitudes correlate with belief in conspiracy myths resulting in inconsistent findings. We show that different anti-system attitudes and corresponding digital media usage can promote the affinity towards conspiracy myths apart from right-wing attitudes. With this paper, we first want to sharpen the terminology on ‘conspiracy myths’ and develop a scale to measure affinity towards conspiracy myths in different dimensions. We second use this scale to investigate different mindsets of conspiracy in the Swiss population. Third, we want to find out how the dimensions correlate with messenger usage. Based on data from a representative population survey in Switzerland from November to December 2020, we investigated different affinities towards conspiracy myths, represented by far-left, far-right, populist, anti-elitism, general anti-system attitudes and science skepticism. We then used the six dimensions in a cluster analysis and identified five typological mindsets. About 30% of the population accordingly have higher affinities towards conspiracy myths than the rest. Our study also highlights the potential role of messenger services in spreading conspiracy myths. To a certain extent, Facebook Messenger and Telegram usage show a robust correlation with the different dimensions of the affinity towards conspiracy myths. In contrast, WhatsApp usage does not show a robust correlation.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study seeks to add nuance to the definition of binge-watching by identifying the subtypes of the general practice that reflect viewer rituals, motives, and outcomes. The two subtypes are (1) the healthy practice of ‘feast-watching’ and (2) the unhealthy practice of ‘cringe-watching’. While binge-watching as a singular behavior has been associated with anxiety, depression, and loneliness, a survey ( N = 800) finds that binge-watching which is solo, accidental, and distracted (cringe-watching) predicts increased regret and decreased well-being. However, binge-watching that is planned, social, and attentive (feast-watching) predicts positive outcomes. These subtypes add much needed organizational clarity to the discussion of binge-watching, which, due to its popularity, has grown into a catchall for extended video consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While Instagram influencers may have started out as ordinary people documenting their everyday life through a stream of photographs, they are increasingly emerging as an intermediary between advertisers and consumers. This study examines the professionalization of Instagram influencers, combining data from 11 interviews with travel influencers with a visual and textual content analysis of their 12 most recent Instagram posts ( N = 132). We show how the increasing professionalization of the influencer steers their relationship with their audience, the advertisers they work with, and the platform Instagram. We argue that, for the Instagram influencer to be perceived as successful, they need to negotiate a tension: they need to appear authentic, yet also approach their followers in a strategic way to remain appealing to advertisers. Although Instagram influencers are seen as more trustworthy than traditional forms of advertising, this tension ultimately leads to a standardization of the content shared by influencers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article conducts a conceptual discussion of digital placemaking practices related to forced migration. The literature has demonstrated that displaced people engage in digital placemaking to create belonging and to actualize aspirations. Simultaneously, state and suprastate actors expand digital data practices, which construct forced migrants as categories in digital place, thereby configuring their access to physical locations and to socio-legal positioning. This article argues that the digital data practices of both state and suprastate actors, such as biometric registration and metadata tracing, appropriate digital placemaking practices by forced migrants and dissect migrants’ subjectivity into data fragments that become agentic in shaping how the people access physical territory, identities, and resources. The article highlights opportunities for researching forced mobilities, place, and technologies. These opportunities include the study of nonhuman actors in placemaking processes, exploring the locus of agency in digital placemaking, and studying the intersections between embodied and digital placemaking practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 2020 Covid-19 global pandemic has greatly impacted societies around the world, where governmental strategies to curb and control the outbreak have resulted in citizens being unable to attend public businesses and spaces. For musicians who rely on touring as a dominant part of their income, the pandemic has had a hugely negative effect on their finances since they can no longer play face-to-face shows. However, a number of artists have turned to digital media to remedy this, performing online to audiences via Web 2.0 platforms. To better understand this cultural phenomenon, the article introduces the concept of portal shows that employ a converge between traditional live gigs, screen media and new media technologies. Analysing the textual, affective, performative and economic dynamics of portal shows, the article examines three differing case studies: Code Orange’s album release show on Twitch.TV, Beach Slang’s acoustic performance on StageIt and Delta Sleep’s in-store show on Instagram. In doing so, the article argues portal shows offer novel and nuanced ways artists and audiences can engage with one another through spatial convergence afforded by video streaming technologies and digital interfaces. Such live events also offer just-in-time fan engagement but does so within a digital transcultural remit, aiding the support of virtual scenes. As a result, the article expands on what is considered pandemic media and subsequent audience affective registers and enriches the study of the music industry’s engagement with digital media and wider convergence cultures more generally. </jats:p>",

Using an online survey ( N = 408) and drawing on Congruence Theory and Generation Cohort Theory, we focus on three generations: X, Y, and Z. Findings show that all generations responded negatively when receiving an advertisement via smartphone. However, the generations differ in their patterns of association between mobile advertising attitudes and responses to mobile ads. Findings suggest that incongruence between each generation’s scheme and the five dimensions of advertising attitudes results in unfavorable responses to mobile advertising. These findings provide guidelines for future research and implications for marketers who intend to design behavioral targeting to consumers of various generational cohorts while using mobile platforms as an advertising channel. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital disconnection or ‘digital detox’ has become a key reference point for media scholars interested in how media technology increasingly gains influence on our everyday lives. Digital disconnection from intrusive media is often intertwined with other types of human conduct, which is less highlighted. There is a potential for media scholars to engage with what seems to be a mainstreaming of digital disconnection from self-help literature via mobile applications to media activism and public debate. In this article, we therefore aim to examine digital disconnection beyond media studies by distilling five common positions: disconnection as health, concentration, existentiality, freedom and sustainability. An underlying theme in all five positions appears to be the notion of responsibilisation, although some of the positions attempt to portray disconnection as a way to ultimately resist such responsibilisation. The article thus aims to spur media scholars to treat digital disconnection as part of broader cultural trends. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Postcyberpunk dystopian cityscape and emotion artificial intelligence: A spatio-cognitive analysis of posthuman representation in <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> (2017)",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Within visual culture, postcyberpunk films are best approached as places of Otherness whereby human identity and agency are downplayed and posthumans are magnified in highly technopolic societies marked with scientific determinism. Postcyberpunk treats the posthuman enclave as a heterotopic site, oscillating between utopian and dystopian spaces, potentially and optimistically, creating a space for humanity to be reassessed and renegotiated. Against this backdrop, the current research endeavor proposes a Spatio-Cognitive Model of Posthuman Representation focusing attention on heterotopic ‘spaces’ and ‘bodies’ in hyperconnected environments. While the model owes a substantial debt to Foucault’s writings on heterotopia and the utopian body, in tilting the focus of enquiry, this paper is informed by the tenets of polyrhythmia, hypermimesis, spatial repertoires, semiotic assemblages and cognitive embodiment as insightful interventions. Blade Runner 2049 is taken as a fertile case study grounded in paradoxes and ambiguities around the contradiction between humans and replicants, artificial intelligence and super-large enterprises. The hybridity pertinent to the postcyberpunk film genre and the inner and outer topographies of posthuman representation proved to be insightful investigative vantage points of multimodal inquiry for the socio-political and technocratic implications they underlie. With technology seamlessly integrated into social spaces and posthuman bodies, Blade Runner 2049 is arguably structured as an emotional journey composed of multiple heterotopias (spatial layers, ruptures and bifurcations expressed through socio-political capitalist projections). The article adamantly argues for new philosophical perspectives and praxis in redefinition of the social relationship between human and posthuman. </jats:p>",

The evidence suggests that journalists are undergoing an uncomfortable transition migrating online and are unlikely to fully adopt interpersonal interactive features onto their websites. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) is a phenomenon which simultaneously fires the imagination and throws into question our beliefs and understanding of the world we inhabit The very possibility of being able to immerse ourselves and navigate through a multi-sensory, three-dimensional simulated environment combines the traditions of the visual and performing arts with the science and epistemology of our perceptual processes. As was once anticipated of photography, virtual reality promises the ultimate fulfilment of the representational demands of Western culture It would now seem that major advances in several disparate areas of computing have virtually turned fantasy into reality Given the current state of interest in the subject (as well as the diversity of conjecture), it would seem an especially timely endeavour to assemble a comprehensive overview of recent developments in an increasingly significant field",

    "abstract": "Cybertypes is an innovative, theoretically sophisticated and politically charged polemic on the status of identity politics and the internet with specific reference to race. It is perfectly timed. It allow us to enter the postinternet age and understand its sociological limitations now that the marketplace has taken care of the hyperbolic discourse that fuelled the DotCom industry. Looking back over the last decade one can identify Sherry Turkle’s book Life on the Screen as a landmark text both as ethnography and as an epiphany about how the internet came to be constructed. Nakamura’s book, Cybertypes, is a landmark text in just this sense. It is based on ethnographic insight and textual reading while providing a discursive vision for the internet in its current stage. If the marketplace has shown the continued importance of brick and mortar companies, then Nakamura’s book takes us as far as possible from the uncritical celebration of the internet that Turkle’s book did. I plan to use both these texts in my Internet Studies courses to show the historical link",

    "abstract": "Introduction A great deal has been written about identity and the synchronous interpersonal communication that takes place using the internet and associated technologies.’ Numerous claims have been made about the textual nature of various forms of internet communication offering an alternative space in which we can interact in a striped down or a ’cues reduced’ form.’ Authors such as Sherry Turkle envisage the ’new space’ of the communication systems on the internet as a ’social laboratory for experimenting with the construction and reconstruction of the self that characterises post-modern life’.3 The essential core of such claims, though with many nuances, is that this form of computer-mediated communication permits a form of communication between individuals who need only declare such details about themselves as they see fit. The result of which is that interlocutors are often envisaged as inventing ’fantastic’ identities for themselves. The plethora of research papers written on such virtual identities or personae in synchronous computer mediated communication has been succinctly, if rather cynically, summed up by David Gauntlett: ’cyberspace ... you can play with identity... nobody knows who you really are ... gosh ...’",

Engaging with film, animation, and media studies, as well as analysis of consumer culture and theories of capitalism, Steinberg offers the first sustained study of the Japanese mode of convergence that informs global media practices to this day. Casey Brienza finds this is a very flawed book but nevertheless, a very good one.",

    "title": "Revisiting Globalisation Through the Movie and Digital Games Industries",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1990s saw the digital games console industry adopt similar commercial strategies to the cultural industry which for 80 years has been most closely associated with the process of globalisation - the Hollywood-based movie industry. The major console players, Sony, Nintendo and more recently Microsoft, expanded on a global scale, vertically and horizontally integrating through alliances and take-overs as they sought to control platforms, content development, publishing and distribution. Moreover the relationship between the two industries has become increasingly symbiotic. Vivendi-Universal has moved into the exploitation of both game and film assets on a global scale and would seem to exemplify what we understand by a global firm. This paper considers globalisation through an analysis of the movie and digital game industries both globally, and from the perspective of a small country like Ireland, which has a high level of cinema attendance and game sales but is struggling to establish domestic movie and game industries. </jats:p>",

They are fascinating for thinking about how technologies influence cinematic space. This discussion of digital three-dimensional (3D) technologies in Hugo and the image maximum (IMAX) format in The Dark Knight uses paratexts to elaborate on this idea. Paratexts released in conjunction with Hugo are used to introduce an understanding of digital 3D cinematic space as something that is built as opposed to recorded. Those of The Dark Knight show film-makers encountering unexpected spaces arising from their use of IMAX technologies. By paying attention to the parameters of intangible space in The Dark Knight, the IMAX format is configured not as seamlessly immersive but as a location that offers multiple points of engagement for an audience. Both these examples demonstrate how thinking in terms of relationality, mediation and entanglement describes a cinematic space given shape by and through technologies. </jats:p>",

Although we have editorial board members across the globe, we have enjoyed a particularly strong link with Australia and that has been due to a large extent to one of our associate editors, Rebecca Coyle. Sadly, Rebecca passed away in November last year after a year-long illness and in recognition of her contribution to Convergence, we would like to dedicate this issue to her. Rebecca was based at the Lismore campus of Southern Cross University but had also taught at Macquarie University and the University of Technology, both in Sydney. She had been a member of our editorial board since the first issue, back in 1995, and became one of our first associate editors. We asked her to join the editorial board partly because of her research specialisms at the time in radio, sound and holography but also because of her energy, dedication and professionalism. In addition to her normal editorial duties, she guest edited two issues of Convergence – one on music and sound performance, perception and interactivity and one on the transformations occurring in radio – and in 2006, she convened, chaired and contributed to a Convergence panel at the Association of Internet Researchers conference in Brisbane. Rebecca was also a prolific academic, researching and publishing more recently on screen music and sound as well as regional and rural creative industries. True to character, she continued working throughout her illness. It is with deep regret that we can no longer rely on her tireless support and sharp analysis, but it seems appropriate that Convergence’s international scope to which she contributed so much is exemplified in this issue by articles from a range of countries, including the Netherlands, North America, Sweden, the United Kingdom and fittingly her native Australia. In our opening debates piece, Jonathan Westin views the transference of book formats from analogue to digital through the lens of translation studies. He examines how the book’s change of format provokes questions about cultural values that are embedded in the physicality of the book and how these are acquired, reinforced or negotiated away in the translation process from one format to another. In a similar vein, Weedon (2012) has questioned the values associated with the book – cultural, humanitarian and economic – arguing that the book is neither the locked or liberated text McLuhan (1964) and Ong (1982) describe nor a cultural concept as Carrière and Eco (2011) propose, but is rather a dynamic system through which ideas and cultural expressions are",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the rationalizations and normalizations adult gamers offer in their justifications of both gaming 'itself', and the possession of a videogame console. While there has been a proliferation in research on the videogame recently in terms of what Kerr et al. describe as the 'productive use of new media' (in their 2006 article 'New Media — New Pleasures?' p. 64), which includes issues relating to gender, pleasure, production and gameplay as well as more ethnographic research relating to young people and games, there has been a significant gap in research around adult gamers. This article is the result of four years' ethnographic research, which followed 11 participant gaming households (along with the questionnaire of over 100 respondents), recording, interviewing and observing them prior to, during and after gameplay. Included in this demographic are all-female and all-male households, mixed gender, sexuality and ethnicity, and diverse geographical intake from Northern Ireland to southern England. Throughout my research and this article, I argue the political and social necessity of including gamers and their discourses into research on gaming in order to better understand the significance of gaming and gaming discourses on our social and political lives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reviews diffusion of on-line research at daily newspapers in the USA during a five-year period from 1994 to 1998. Diffusion literature indicates new technical innovations require certain social and economic conditions and other factors before adoption begins. Once the adoption process begins, it takes place in stages before reaching critical mass. Data collected in this study confirms Everett M. Rogers' process model. The World Wide Web has become the dominant on-line research tool for journalists. Commercial services that provide access to government databases and archival databases, such as those containing newspapers and magazines, are also in wide use. While general computer use in newsrooms has increased, so has the frequency of use of on-line services. Primary resources used to search the web are AltaVista and Yahoo! and journalists most often used government sites. Internet technologies were not widely used during the five years studied. Adoption of computers and the internet- web appear complete, but the adoption process in some advanced-use categories remains in process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "also to reflect on its underlying conceptual frameworks. For all its strengths, a synthetic approach such as this runs the risk of pasting together quite different approaches or arguments and not attending to the torn edges. Flew’s chapter on cultural technologies for instance references recent theoretical developments from science and technology studies (STS), but does so by factoring them into a reiteration of the ‘social shaping of technology’ thesis from which they diverge at a fundamental level. Thus the usual technological determinist suspects (Nicholas Negroponte, Esther Dyson, Bill Gates) are lined up and charged with the offence of the glorification of technologies. The evidence against them is that technologies are not ‘pre-ordained by progress, science and modernity’ (p. 21), but always already social and cultural. However, this assertion has a flip-side, that is, that culture is always already technological, and Flew quotes Langdon Winner to this effect: technologies are ‘powerful forces acting to reshape that activity and its meaning’ (p. 28). Also cited is Menser and Aronowitz’s argument that ‘to be a social animal is to be techno-social’ (p. 28). Bruno Latour and Michel Callon are mentioned, yet the often fierce debates these latter two engage with over the deterministic relationships between culture and technology and their insistence on the obduracy and agency of non-human as well as human entities are not referred to. The humanist notion of cultural technologies that underpins the ‘social shaping of technology’ thesis operates here to emulsify incompatible theories. In the generation of new media studies, it is important not to let the laudable aims of clarity and synthesis override either significant discursive differences. To borrow a term from the Wikipedia, some disambiguation is needed. This said, the political economy engine of New Media: An Introduction does vital synthetic and critical work. It is both an excellent introduction to the political economy of new media (and could serve equally well as an introduction to the media cultural economy in general), but it also goes beyond its titular introductory aims: its accessible and clearly presented material should be as useful for new media researchers as teachers.",

We propose that the motives and rituals of binge-viewers can be used to expand uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) theory. We conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews to gather thick descriptions of why people binge-watch, how they binge-watch, and how they feel about binge-watching. The findings indicate that (1) viewers’ primary motivations for binge-watching are catching up, relaxation, sense of completion, cultural inclusion, and improved viewing experience; (2) the portability and navigability of streaming video technology influence binge-watching rituals; and (3) viewers are ambivalent about their binge-watching. Based on the findings, we propose that a viewer attentiveness spectrum is a more accurate descriptor of contemporary TV watching than the passive/active dichotomy. We further argue that the changing motives and rituals of TV viewers can be used to bolster the quantitative surveys often employed in U&amp;G research and to address the lingering criticisms of U&amp;G theory. </jats:p>",

On Twitter, celebrity is practiced through the appearance and performance of ‘backstage’ access. Celebrity practitioners reveal what appears to be personal information to create a sense of intimacy between participant and follower, publicly acknowledge fans, and use language and cultural references to create affiliations with followers. Interactions with other celebrity practitioners and personalities give the impression of candid, uncensored looks at the people behind the personas. But the indeterminate ‘authenticity’ of these performances appeals to some audiences, who enjoy the game playing intrinsic to gossip consumption. While celebrity practice is theoretically open to all, it is not an equalizer or democratizing discourse. Indeed, in order to successfully practice celebrity, fans must recognize the power differentials intrinsic to the relationship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the early months of 2021, a curious trend began to emerge on TikTok: left-leaning TikTokkers engaging in lampoonish performances of cross-party cross-dressing to re-present themselves as their alter-ego ‘Republicansonas’. Fascinatingly, the most profuse and popular engagements with this trend have been to cannily recode BIPOC and queer self-presentations through a sardonic pantomime of a legibly centrist normativity generated by strategically ambiguous performances of ‘whitewashing’ and ‘straightifying’. Deploying affect theory, Deleuzian critiques of neoliberalism, affordance theories of algorithmic culture, critical race theory, queer epistemologies of discursive space and textual analysis of Republicansona content, this article interrogates the operations of not just TikTok but of an increasingly right-leaning America. The central questions in this article are to examine the utility and ideology of this memetic mimesis trend while examining what this trend reveals about TikTok’s infrastructure and the potential for revolution from within the apparatus. This analysis of the mindful sardonicism of the Republicansona trend reveals its disruptive potential to call attention to the impacts of neoliberalism on expression. The act of simulating legible normativity generates a subversively ambiguous depth where testimonies of survival in the face of image-violence are shared as a second layer to the trend’s inside joke modality. </jats:p>",

This article attempts to fill this gap by suggesting a social media political participation model. Taking a goal systemic perspective, the model specifies a set of interrelated processes that need to be realized so that social media use affects PP.

    "title": "A genealogy of hacking",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Hacking is now a widely discussed and known phenomenon, but remains difficult to define and empirically identify because it has come to refer to many different, sometimes incompatible, material practices. This article proposes genealogy as a framework for understanding hacking by briefly revisiting Foucault’s concept of genealogy and interpreting its perspectival stance through the feminist materialist concept of the situated observer. Using genealogy as a theoretical frame, a history of hacking will be proposed in four phases. The first phase is the ‘prehistory’ of hacking in which four core practices were developed. The second phase is the ‘golden age of cracking’ in which hacking becomes a self-conscious identity and community and is for many identified with breaking into computers, even while non-cracking practices such as free software mature. The third phase sees hacking divide into a number of new practices even while old practices continue, including the rise of serious cybercrime, hacktivism, the division of Open Source and Free Software and hacking as an ethic of business and work. The final phase sees broad consciousness of state-sponsored hacking, the re-rise of hardware hacking in maker labs and hack spaces and the diffusion of hacking into a broad ‘clever’ practice. In conclusion, it will be argued that hacking consists across all the practices surveyed of an interrogation of the rationality of information technocultures enacted by each hacker practice situating itself within a particular technoculture and then using that technoculture to change itself, both in changing potential actions that can be taken and changing the nature of the technoculture itself.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The streaming network: Conceptualizing distribution economy, technology, and power in streaming media services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite there being more than a decade since the introductions of Netflix’ and Spotify’s online services, few attempts have been made to thoroughly examine and conceptualize streaming and streaming services across culture and media industries. The argument proposed here is that streaming constitutes a distinct form of digital media distribution network, what I refer to as the streaming network. The article asks what constitutes the parts or nodes of such a streaming network, and further what the power relationships between the various parts are. The analysis uses Spotify, Apple Music, Netflix, and Kindle Unlimited as examples, building on a wide array of primary and secondary document sources. The analysis contains a stepwise discussion and visualization of how human and nonhuman actors in this streaming network are connected by way of flows of content, data, and money, as well as by relationships of control, access, and exposure. The argument draws on theories of network power, platform power, and algorithmic power. The analysis highlights the asymmetrical relationships between, on the one hand, users and content providers, and on the other, streaming providers and device and software makers. No single actor in the network is able to exercise full control, but users and content originators are seen as particularly vulnerable. Streaming providers and device and software makers are able to maneuver the network to strengthen their relative position. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Virtual worlds as sites for social and cultural innovation",
    "abstract": "There is a growing recognition of the importance of virtual worlds as environments and media that carry the potential for social and cultural innovation by making possible new forms of social relationships based on communication among avatars. The articles in this special issue exemplify some aspects of this potential but also point out some of the many questions and unsolved problems that follow with innovation and the continuous development of virtual worlds. The two key concepts of virtual worlds and innovation are both widely used concepts that refer to emergent and rapidly changing phenomena without sharp contours or clearly defined boundaries. In the context of this special issue, we treat both virtual worlds and innovation as emergent phenomena in flux. Some of the features of virtual worlds, however, may also be seen as stable. According to Bell (2008) and Schroeder (2008, 2011), virtual worlds depend on stable, persistent digital infrastructures. Moreover, the online presence of gamers and residents is referred to by digital symbols and signs – be they avatars, space ships or green dots – and the technological platforms are accessible 24/7 over longer periods of time. They appear to be stable technologies and platforms, almost permanent. How is it, then, that we see them as emergent phenomena in flux? Our focus in this special issue of Convergence is on social and cultural innovation in and with virtual worlds which means that the technological innovation of the digital platforms and of the technology in itself are not our primary interest of reflection and analysis. Social and cultural innovation are phenomena of a fluid nature, subject to continuous change: the way we see and understand ourselves and each other, the way we experience exciting and extraordinary events or seek inspiration by thought-provoking art installations, the way we build virtual communities of high ideals or take the opportunity to live out behaviours otherwise not acceptable in our everyday life, these are all examples of human relationships with distinctive features that hold the potential for creative and innovative responses to new environments.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In her book Writing Machines, N. Katherine Hayles described the concept of the technotext. Hayles used this concept to provide an analysis of a range of texts, including online work, based on their materiality. The analysis described in this article complements this method by developing an approach that explores the conditions of production of contemporary digital literature. It achieves this aim by providing a close reading of the online paratextual elements associated with the first four episodes of Inanimate Alice by Kate Pullinger and Chris Joseph. In doing so, it modifies the print-based analytical framework provide by Gérard Genette and others to develop a detailed account of the off-site, on-site and in-file paratexts of this online work. It sets out a range of thresholds that mould the reception of this text. It also notes how they position it within wider discourses about genre, media, literature and literacy. This article concludes by exploring the limits of this paratextual reading. It discusses whether it provides an adequate account of the material conditions of these texts. It then seeks to integrate this approach into the vision of literary studies described by Hayles in Writing Machines. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The last decade has seen a rapid growth of service-based offerings – also known as Game-as-a-Service or GaaS – in the video game industry, among which are some of the most popular franchises, such as Fortnite or League of Legends. Yet, even though these games are designed to be played and supported for an indefinite period of time, many studios have recently chosen to curtail services after introducing them, making for unclear outlooks on the future of this business model. Hence, based on secondary sources – including company documents, industry press and dedicated player forums – this multiple case study sets out to investigate the reasons behind studios’ decision to discontinue parts of five popular GaaS. Three main motives for withdrawing services emerge from the cases. Namely, rather than supporting services, studios decide to (1) attend to the company, to (2) attend to players and (3) to attend to the core product itself. The results contribute to the nascent GaaS literature, in particular with respect to business models and product-life cycle considerations. Implications for studios are offered in closing. </jats:p>",

Internet renderings of liveness suggest that representations are unmediated because images and texts are presented at the same time as the viewer is watching. This makes the various mediated and constructed aspects of the technologies, including the continuation of normative beliefs about gender, race, and sexuality, easier to ignore. Considering how television structures the viewer, historical and critical writings about television liveness, and narratives about internet liveness, and applying this literature to webcams and other internet settings, indicates that these internet renderings are a part of ongoing cultural conventions and provides methods to resist the more stereotyped aspects of these representations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The internet was originally conceptualized as a frontier within which creative and cultural output could thrive, bereft of the gatekeeping influence of major corporations in the analog era. As that digital era unfolded, the narrative shifted amid a concentration of media power and the precarity of digital labor, prompting questions about the democratization that the internet was purported to bring about. This project takes the music publishing industry as a case study of this democratization thesis, using network analysis to examine publishing data from ASCAP’s ACE Repertory to better understand the fragmentation or centralization of key social actors in the music industry. The study finds that the industry is greatly fragmented based on the total number of music licenses, pointing to a decentralization of music publishing. However, this does not provide a glimpse into how revenue is distributed in this network. These findings have implications for media studies, music industry analysis, cultural economics, and technology studies as technology continues to transform content creation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The need for The internet as a new medium for art, or even as some writers express new terms it as a new form of art, inspires and encourages many different kinds of work which might be considered ’works of art’. However, despite the massive number of web pages being produced, internet relay chat activities, and some e-mail art projects, there are very few theoretical works which either aim to explain some of the phenomena of the new medium, or endeavour to link them to the already existing discipline of art history. Almost unique in this respect are the article ’Art in the Electronic Networks’ by Andreas Broeckmann’ and some of the work done by Critical Art Ensemble, especially in The Electronic Disturbance.2 Given the dearth of theoretical work, I would like to introduce some new terms to deal with the description of internet content and web art, which are also applicable to contemporary multimedia art in general. Recently, there has been much discussion about electronic networks and post-socialist countries as essentially different from, for example, electronic networks in Western Europe, but I would argue that any such idea has nothing to do with reality. Although I will be using examples mainly from Croatia and some other ’post-’ countries in this short essay, I would like to stress that these are not cited for being ’special’ in any way, nor is the classic East-West divide of any importance whatsoever for my argument. In fact, when we talk about internet access and web art projects, it is possible to argue that Slovenia, for example, belongs to the highly developed West; while France, and to certain level even Germany, can be described as part of a ’soft East’ both in terms of accessibility and the quality of web art projects. This is an important point because the terms I will be introducing traditionally have a geographic connotation, but in the world of cyberspace it is more appropriate, I would argue, to think about the ’centre’ and the ’periphery’ in topological rather than geographical terms.",

The platform’s revising and reshaping of television flow theorized by Raymond Williams ((1974) Television. London: Routledge.), which is produced through the combined work of users and algorithms, enables diverse cultural representations to come into contact. This diversity creates relational juxtapositions that become meaningful through human interpretation. The algorithms that are entrenched in YouTube’s business models and designed to monetize the work of users may also circulate divergent versions of a cultural practice. That YouTube flow can produce diverse cultural representations is demonstrated by a case study of the Mevlevi Sema ceremony, a Turkish intangible heritage practice safeguarded by UNESCO; official heritage narratives put forward by the nation-state of Turkey through UNESCO are challenged by other narratives on the platform. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Media literacy and transmedia storytelling",
    "abstract": "In the United Kingdom there is a debate about how media studies should be taught to 16 to 18 year olds. Should they be studying the artefacts as literature students do with canonical readings of Austen and Shakespeare or the institutions and hegemonic structures of the means of production? If they are to study artefacts then what artefacts should these be? BBC news and the much exported period drama Downton Abbey or popular television franchises which have worldwide take-up such as Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? (ITV 1998-) The problem with this debate is that it misunderstands the ontological basis of media studies. Media studies have claimed the realms of television, newspapers, cinema, radio and audiovisual texts, their forms, the industries that produce them and the means of distribution and consumption as its object of study. New media researchers have added identity, interactivity, geolocation, engagement, affectivity, sharing, creativity and fan crowd and other forms of online and real life community building through new communications technologies. Ontologically we accept as a basis of our field that as humans we construct and visualize stories – both from fact and fiction – to make sense of the world around us and that by analysing and deconstructing these narratives as researchers we review, challenge or change erroneous or simply dominant knowledge paradigms. Contrary to this basis of media studies, in this debate we are being asked to give dominance to the best of the type. For students and early career researchers this is confusing and we swiftly fall into a definitional mele: is this the form of the period drama or the industry format of the game show or the professional procedures that provenance and verify news stories we are required to study? Educationalists may refer to the canon of English literature, yet new media critics will cite the fans’ definition of the canon as the storyworld or the storyworld’s ‘bible’ or past set characters, storylines and rules. Just consider for a moment the array of attempts to define and revise the definition of transmedia storytelling. Researchers have found it easier to state the platforms and channels for transmedia stories – the book, periodical, game, television, Web, cinema, mobile app., radio and event – than to say comprehensively and decisively what it is. Like much of new media, transmedia storytelling is participatory, often soliciting creative contributions, it is user-led and",

With this technological diffusion, mobile health (mHealth) has become an increasingly important issue. In particular, there is an increasing interest in smartphone apps improving public health. Although there is increased availability of mobile devices and health apps, little is known about motivational factors predicting health app adoption and use. The aim of this study was to identify motivational factors that predict the adoption and use of health apps (i.e. health app engagement). To identify the motivational factors, 391 college students were surveyed and survey questions considered the effects of media exposure to health information, interpersonal communication on health issues, and psychological factors (e.g. attitude, usefulness, peer norm, and self-efficacy) on health app engagement. Our results confirm the effect of attitude ( β = 0.36) and usefulness are ( β = 0.33) on mHealth App usage. Furthermore, we found that age ( β = 0.11) and reading news articles about health ( β = 0.13) predict mHealth App usage. Theoretical and practical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Kinwork is the maintenance of cross-household kin and family ties through both physical and mediated means and is a type of unpaid labour historically performed by women. However, changing gender norms, new communicative practices such as networked individualism, and internet and communication technologies are changing how kinwork is done. This study explores how these changes affect the gendered nature of kinwork. Swedes from multigenerational, cross-household families residing in Sweden and the United States took part in primarily home-based interviews (n=40). This empirical study explores current practices of kinwork, focusing on three empirical cases, Christmas cards for seasonal greetings, phone calls for birthday well-wishes, and digital communication for everyday contact. Results highlight how kinwork in the sample is performed by both men and women through a wide range of communication technologies. The study shows that due to new gendered norms, women in the younger generations are less willing to do kinwork for men than older generations in the same kinship networks, indicating generational differences rather than family differences. In the study, men use new internet and communication technology to both do and sometimes take responsibility for kinwork while older communication technologies retain a feminine coding, sometimes resulting in abandonment. Contemporary digital communication technology supports a shift to individual communication rather than group-based which further supports men’s increased engagement in kinwork. The study concludes that kinwork in the studied sample is performed by both men and women and that contemporary kinwork can only be understood by looking at the complex entanglements of evolving gender equality norms, trends towards more individual communication patterns, and affordances of communication technology. Together these result in new ways and opportunities for doing kinwork, which becomes less the work of women and more the work of networked individuals, whatever gender. </jats:p>",

I lay out the conundrum of the archival – a concept associated with both death and life, certainty and uncertainty, written record and ephemeral performance – and discuss how the archival adventure confounds and plays with these oppositions.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media technologies and digital practices are reshaping and redefining the future of sport fandom. This article points to some of the utopian and dystopic transformations for fandom presented by (post)television, digital/social media and the anticipated virtual technologies of the future. Specifically, three distinct phases of fan participation are charted around existing and futuristic visions of technology-as-sport. First are the current televisual technologies that attempt to engage and retain traditionally “passive” viewers as spectators through pseudo-participatory perspectives that will carry over to new screens and technologies. Second, the assumed interactive participation afforded by social and digital media is considered, positing the future amplification of connectivity, personalisation and networking across digital fan communities, albeit undercut by further impositions of corporatisation and datafication through illusory forms of “interactivity”. Finally, the fusion, intensification and continual evolution of technology-as-sport is explored, asserting that forms of immersive participation will be significant for future virtual technologies and may ultimately re-position fans as e-participants in their own media-tech sport spectacles. Collectively, it is anticipated that the creation of new virtual worlds, spaces and experiences will amplify and operationalise forms of immersive participation around augmented spectatorship, virtual athletic replication and potentially constitute the sport itself. Indeed, a new model of the fan-as-immersed-e-participant is advanced as such futuristic virtual sporting realms may not only integrate fans into the spectacle but also project them into the event as participant and as the spectacle. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Data reflexivity as work-in-progress: A relational, life-course approach to people’s encounters with datafication",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Datafication, across private and public sectors demonstrably touches upon, and indeed, alters, with profound consequences, diverse domains of people’s daily lives. However, also, increasingly, critical scholarship on datafication is the locus of careful attention to not solely platform and algorithmic power but also people’s sociocultural practices to make sense of, cope with, feel and show new literacies with data and datafied systems. It is in this context of genuinely listening to what people do with, through and around data, and to what end, that this special issue invites us to ponder the notion of data reflexivity. In this paper, I adopt a working definition of data reflexivity as – a vernacular and relational set of practices and strategies in relation to data and data infrastructures, working with, within and sometimes against platforms, where, such practices and strategies morph and change across the life course, through a web of cross-cutting relationships with individuals, communities and institutions. I draw upon illustrative instances from a project in England which explored parents’ perspectives on personal data and algorithms in the context of raising children. First – I suggest that we approach data reflexivity through a relational lens rather than as an individual and inward-looking strategy, where such relationality is experienced in relation to institutions, individuals, families, friendships, and networks. Second – I suggest that we look at data reflexivity as a fluid, lifelong journey – where a life course approach enables us to consider how data reflexivity morphs, adapts and transitions through the course of life, involving numerous acts of unspectacular, ephemeral agency. I conclude with a reminder that attention to data reflexivity, or indeed, more broadly, people’s agency, must not mean a shift of focus away from scrutinising and holding accountable, powerful institutions, both public and private. </jats:p>",

In this study, we investigate how the annual CeBIT tech fair (held in Hanover, Germany, from 1986 to 2018) and a keynote speech given there by Bill Gates in 1995 have been constructed, framed, and substantiated through media coverage and in mediated memory. Thanks to a qualitative content analysis, based on more than 500 articles published in general interest media and technology magazines, the ways the future of digitization was, and partially still is, imagined and narrated at tech fairs emerge. It is a quasi-religious future, predicted in quasi-religious gatherings (the ‘Mecca’ of digital futures), where gurus (Messiahs) and new ideas emerged, are celebrated, criticized, or rejected. During fairs, there is also a political and strategic use of the future because the ways digitization is forecast can shape and drive its future through investments and obliged visions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The politics of musical activism: Western YouTube reception of Pussy Riot’s punk performances",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Various scholars have studied the relationship between music and politics. Most, however, focus on how governments and political parties on the one hand and movements and activists on the other use music for political outcomes and in doing so they often ignore the more latent forms of political participation music can lead to. This article, therefore, focuses on how people give meaning to political music in informal conversational settings by exploring the reception of Pussy Riot on YouTube. New media platforms like YouTube are ubiquitous in the West and as ‘third spaces’ they allow audiences to publicly reflect on everyday newsworthy events and activism. We combine the computerized methods of topic modelling and semantic network analysis to study both quantitatively and qualitatively how Pussy Riot’s punk protests afford political participation by (Western) YouTube users. Results show that the comments mostly address (1) the geopolitical boundaries of activism, (2) the legitimacy and commitment of the activists, (3) the political content of the protests and (4) the relationship between the protests and religion. For the YouTube users in our study, the political music of Pussy Riot thereby serves as a vehicle to discuss politics beyond the protests themselves. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Crunch’ – a period of unpaid overtime meant to speed up lagging projects – is a common labor practice in the video game industry and persists despite many costs to developers. To understand why, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of Game Developer magazine (2000–2010) to explore how industry members perceive and discuss gamework (1) in a publication for developers, by developers and (2) during the first decade in which serious conversations about labor emerge in the games industry. Our analysis found that many gameworkers treat crunch as ‘inevitable’ due to three specific themes: games as an unmanageable creative industry, an anti-corporate ethos, and a stereotypical developer identity based on passion and perfectionism. These constructions – combined with the industry’s project-based nature and cultures of passion and secrecy – build crunch into the habitus of gamework, helping reproduce exploitative labor practices. However, habitus can and does change over time, providing interested employees, companies, and labor organizers a means to intercede in existing work practices. We suggest a multipronged intervention that could build a healthier, more sustainable habitus of gamework. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The diarization of the self emerged through historically contingent social and economic relations and the practice of accounting as an integral aspect of industrialization and capitalism. From the journal to new media technologies, the recording of everyday life is about the governance and construction of the self, illuminating the ‘everyday’ as a salient dimension of sense-making in relation to the wider world. Accounting the self today has gained renewed prominence through new media technologies and social media platforms and its increasing incorporation into everyday life, inviting a public interface. The teleology of older forms of accounting the self (i.e. the journal) to new media technologies needs to be seen through a continuum in which sociocultural and economic forces enmesh with the medium of communication as a tool of self-expression to capture the self in its diurnal mode. This article utilizes Raymond Williams’ notion of cultural materialism, in linking the diary as a modern technology of self-expression with vlogs in the post-digital terrain wherein material practices shed light onto our lifeworlds construed through the resources available within material and immaterial infrastructures, offering both agency and abstraction by capital. As such, the manifest cultural form is intimately mediated by cultural technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article explores the concept of new media idiocy – both a new kind of idiocy and an idiocy performed in new media networks. The paper argues that instead of being neglected, idiocy needs to be appreciated if we are to enquire into the current forms of techno-human subjectification. Idiocy, following Deleuze, is interpreted as distinct from stupidity (a base mode of thinking); it is a mode of living that explores the true through the false. In new media, idiocy acquires a performative character; it is crafted, practiced and re-enacted collectively. Many forms of aesthetic expression, and especially those produced and circulated through social networks, such as memes and viral videos, have such performance of idiocy at their core. Moreover, it is through such expressive creation and performance of the idiot that the new forms of subjectification take place. Network culture’s allowance for participatory creativity enables new media idiocy to establish new forms of visibility and availability in relation to digital networks. The process of becoming an individual or the formulation of political discontent are dynamically expressed and documented online as they happen. Such order of visibility problematizes the processes of subjectification and the emergence of the cultural as well as the political on the Internet. The article uses YouTube videos and subcultures of webpage production as its case studies. </jats:p>",

We explore Travel Frog’s astonishing success in China in early 2018 despite no marketing campaign or Chinese localization of this Japanese language game. First outlining the game and its development, we then trace its reception in Chinese and Western social media and its popularity among Chinese players. Combining comparative media and digital ethnographic methodologies, we explore the role of Internet influencers and investigate North Asian cultural commonalities such as Buddhist Zen philosophy, work ethic, and family values examining how they may have contributed to the popularity of the game. Recognizing the cultural appeal of this game outside its native language, we call for an interrogation of the process of games localization as a factor in the success of videogames. This article brings a rare examination of the transnational impact of games by exploring how they are transmitted through contemporary social media and interpreted through enduring cultural connections. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Reinventing television in rural Zambia",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past decade, digital distribution has brought about major changes in the ways that states regulate, corporations profit from, and people consume media content in places around the world. These technological and industrial shifts have also catalyzed an important area of inquiry in media studies, leading to investigations of ‘connected viewing’ defined by Holt and Sanson as a ‘broader ecosystem in which digital distribution is rendered possible and new forms of user engagement take shape’. Most scholarly research on connected viewing has focused on postindustrial contexts in North America, Europe, and East Asia. Few have considered these practices in developing contexts such as rural sub-Saharan Africa, where energy infrastructure is underdeveloped and media devices are scarce. Adopting a user-centered approach, this article situates the concept of connected viewing in rural Zambia and explores how remote communities with very limited resources access and produce media content across various platforms. The research is based upon 6 weeks of fieldwork in Macha, Zambia, in 2012 and 2013. It begins with a descriptions of the ways people energize media devices in Macha and proceeds to a discussion of three exemplary connected viewing scenarios: (1) the daisy-chaining of satellite TV services, (2) the streaming of YouTube videos, and (3) the production and distribution of local music video. Far from a model of ‘video on demand’ typical in most postindustrial settings, Machan distribution practices generate more occasional, collective, and limited experiences of television that are scaled to local capacities, enabled by an amalgam of technologies, and frequently interrupted by power outages and network failures. Despite this, underserved rural Zambian audiences are pushing connected viewing practices forward in ways that the region’s telecom and media companies are not by innovating cross-platform tactics for (re)distributing audiovisual content in conditions of energy, bandwidth, and economic scarcity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The history of the Indymedia network - a group of open-domain web sites around the world, which grew rapidly from its inception in late November 1999 to more than 140 sites by May 2004 - embodies opposition to strategies of propertarian information control by agents of a radical ‘anarchic’ perspective hostile to ‘corporatism’. This binary tension, however, fails to capture the range of implications of ‘peer to peer’ - p2p - web exchange that Indymedia embodies. By weaving together a theoretical framing showing the inadequacy of conceiving p2p exchange in terms of ‘corporate-anarchist’ binaries, on the one hand, with empirical analysis of interviews with key figures from three continents who helped create Indymedia, on the other, the history of Indymedia developed here clarifies how to map struggles over control of the Internet as a communication technology. Such issues speak not only of understanding contested models of access to new communication technologies - exemplified by the tension between the p2p model and older sender-receiver broadcast models - but also to ways that the institutional framework, through which such technologies are deployed, shapes social movements and public will formation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article critically examines the construction of the artistic identity and career of Ai-Da, ‘the world's first ultra-realistic humanoid robot artist’. Engaging with scholarship on posthumanism and creative assemblages, and creative work, identity and expertise, this article conceptualises Ai-Da's distinctive positioning and focuses on the practices used to construct a creative worker identity and career. The article uses qualitative content analysis to examine journalistic coverage, promotional and presentation activities, exhibitions and performances, and social media postings over a four-year period from Ai-Da’s first launch to international visibility. The analysis shows how Ai-Da is positioned as a high-profile, border crossing artist, engaging in debates about Artificial Intelligence (AI), art, and the environment. It considers the creative assemblage of Ai-Da as a humanoid robot artist, the creator Aidan Meller and the team working with him, and the wider contextual factors of aesthetic expertise, networks and knowledge of art worlds which have shaped Ai-Da's artistic identity and career trajectory. The focus on how Ai-Da signals expertise on social media helps to frame the specific techniques used to speak about and for Ai-Da on social media platforms and wider media coverage. This includes articulating inspiration, showcasing artistic processes and cultivating audience relationships. In concluding, the implications of connecting critical perspectives on creative work with developments in art, AI and robot artists are explored: firstly, for understanding how the practices for constructing an artistic identity shape the development of robot artists; secondly, for understanding how developments in art and AI can frame reflections on artistic identity and careers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The British science fiction series Doctor Who embraces convergence culture on an unprecedented scale, with the BBC currently using the series to trial a plethora of new technologies, including: mini-episodes on mobile phones, podcast commentaries, interactive red-button adventures, video blogs, companion programming, and `fake' metatextual websites. In 2006 the BBC launched two spin-off series, Torchwood (aimed at an exclusively adult audience) and The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures (for 11—15-year-olds), and what was once regarded as an embarrassment to the Corporation now spans the media landscape as a multi-format colossus. This article critically explores many of the transmedia strategies the BBC has employed in relaunching this property. Has it resulted in a richer and more entertaining experience, or is it merely an economic exercise in merchandising and branding? Can these media really work together to create a coherent and satisfying whole? </jats:p>",

It is interesting that the first serious book to adopt a ’national’ approach to the field should be from Australia.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A growing number of urban practitioners and scholars are interested in using digital storytelling to strengthen neighborhood connections to shared culture and build a coherent sense of place. This article contributes to this discussion by investigating how ‘urban furniture’ can sustain social capacity for digital placemaking. While traditional ‘urban furniture’ in public space is purely physical, digital-physical hybrids are emerging, from benches that tell stories to bus stops that play videos. This extended case follows the travels of an Afrofuturist piece of urban furniture: a community-hacked payphone called Sankofa Red. Our analysis triangulates findings across three installations to show how placemaking can be sustained as a social process: as part of a successful makeover of a community plaza, featured in a neighborhood history game, and in an art exhibition on race and ethnicity. We identify promising practices to adapt urban furniture and retain design collectives beyond a single placemaking installation. As a way for cities to build capacity, we propose that rotating one kind urban furniture (e.g., payphones) across neighborhoods can build the social capacity for placemaking around a shared technical foundation, while still prioritizing local needs and culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the contextual challenges that characterize the video on demand (VOD) market in Africa. It provides critical analysis of the creative strategies employed by Nigeria-based streaming services to navigate the peculiar business environment on the continent. This research is on the background of the poor Internet infrastructure and economic divides in many African countries including Nigeria. Streaming services operating in these markets must understand a context where Internet access is complicated on the levels of availability and/or affordability, including significant lack of confidence in e-payment facilities. All these, together with epileptic power supply and poor standard of living, indicate that streaming services must innovate to capture subscribers within the continent. Despite the harsh operational environment, streaming services in Nigeria have continued to increase in number within the past 5 years. This is attributed to the transnational reach of the streaming services as they are patronized by Africans in diaspora across the globe, while they also enjoy popularity within African countries. This article specifically focuses on the innovative strategies employed by Nigerian streaming services to operate within their African markets in the context of their peculiar challenges. In so doing, it extends extant scholarship about Internet-distributed video using the African context. This article is situated within the Media Industry Studies framework and draws from semi-structured interviews with 7 streaming executives in Nigeria and 10 creative professionals in the Nigerian Video Film Industry (Nollywood). It also relies on desk research of press reports, industry publications, as well as the interfaces of streaming portals. This article underscores the necessity of contextualized research with the digital turn in video distribution. Through contextualized analysis of VOD market realities in a less studied terrain like Africa, it aligns with scholarly call to expand theories of Internet-distributed video to marginal contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In January 2021, the shares of the brick-and-mortar video games retail chain GameStop exploded in value. At the same time, billboards on highways and ads in Times Square in New York City used cryptic visuals and seemingly meaningless emojis with diamonds and rockets. Mainstream media soon had an explanation: This was the story of how the subreddit r/wallstreetbets had mobilized thousands of retail investors in a fight against evil hedge funds. Based on a case study of r/wallstreetbets and the GameStop incident, we analyze how idiosyncratic internet culture was incorporated into a broadly resonant and emotionally inflected narrative that lionized the ‘little man’, focusing on both individual profits and collective grievances. Through a theoretical framework combining sociological theories of internet culture and framing analysis, we identify an overall communication structure that drew on three interconnected discursive layers: idiocultural memes, investment-specific information, and a moralized, collectivized injustice frame with heroes and villains. We further argue that the GameStop (GME) incident instantiates a case of the politicization of personal finance, where the investment practices and strategies of ordinary people were transformed into a political issue. As such, the article makes two contributions to the existing literature. First, we contribute to the nascent literature on internet cultures related to personal finance by looking at a specific subreddit devoted to stock trading and investing. Second, we show how idiocultural elements, such as emojis and memes, can function both as contested and exclusionary material aimed at insiders and as flexible components of communications framed for broad mobilization through emotionally resonant notions of grievance and injustice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Telepresence robots are increasingly used in schools as a way of including students who are unable to be physically present in the classroom with other students. The use of such robots is intended not just to help students follow their education but also to serve a social purpose. However, the extent to which the robots actually afford socializing needs to be explored further. This article analyzes how, to what extent, for whom, and under what circumstances the telepresence robot AV1 affords social contact for the heterogenous group of homebound Norwegian upper secondary school students. Building on Jenny Davis’ mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances, we focus on how AV1 affords for different students in specific circumstances. Our analysis draws on interviews with 11 upper secondary school students in Norway and finds that individual traits and circumstances such as health issues and social networks are important aspects when assessing whether a technology affords socializing. Based on our findings, we argue for expanding the mechanisms and conditions framework to include not just its current focus on perception, dexterity, and cultural and institutional legitimacy, but also the users’ emotions. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Beyond the scorecard diplomacy: From soft power rankings to critical inductive geography",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article interrogates if data visualization, despite its inherited subjectivity, can be used not only as a tool for data representation but also as a research platform to facilitate an iterative exploratory process to identify new themes, raise new questions, and generate new knowledge. It addresses this task by pursuing a twofold research goal. On the one hand, it confirms previous findings that have documented the political power of data visualization specifically in the field of scorecard diplomacy. It critically discusses Portland Soft Power 30 Index that measures soft power of selected countries on the annual basis to reveal how the scorecard diplomacy works through the ranking dashboard. On the other hand, the article reflects on the experience of designing a geo-visualization system that, by contrast, intended to overcome shortcomings of data visualization’s politics to build a platform for an inductive academic research. It discusses a new deep mapping framework of soft power visualization that intended to address several critical problems of Portland’s measurements and shares research insights from the project “Deep Mapping: Creating a Dynamic Web Application Museum Soft Power Map.” </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we analyze through a political economy of communication lens the historical and political contexts in which the #YoSoy132 movement emerged, the concentration of Mexican media system and the possibilities offered by social media to young people, situating the issue of media democratization at the centre of the #YoSoy132 struggle. Drawing on two group and four individual interviews, we also focus on the dimension of students’ communication practices in order to provide a more nuanced evaluation of the role played by digital media inside the movement. By blending a political economy analysis with an exploration of media practices, we offer an in-depth understanding of how communication technologies were used and appropriated in order to democratize mainstream media, foster pluralism and trigger important processes related to political culture within the Mexican context. We conclude by assessing the achievements as well as the challenges of #YoSoy132. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs), also known as smart speakers, are becoming part of everyday life in more and more households around the world. Phone and household IPAs are integrated in intimate home contexts and require connections to (social) media profiles, user accounts, and domestic appliances. Users can control their household with voice-activated commands in order to make life more convenient and efficient. Yet, IPAs also bring privacy and surveillance concerns about devices “listening in,” the “platformization” of home life, and data security. Our exploratory mixed-methods study provides an in-depth and multidimensional account of users' privacy concerns around the emergence of IPAs in Dutch households. We differentiate between surveillance, security, and platform concerns, and our survey results indicate by which factors these are influenced. The focus group analysis highlights the role of conversation, recordability, locatability, control-ability, and assistance affordances. Our findings present a multidimensional and nuanced understanding of privacy concerns around household IPAs. We indicate how smart home technologies raise concerns about privacy, surveillance, device security, everyday behavior, and platform transparency, topics that demand urgent attention before the integration of IPAs will be fully normalized. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the mental health discourse on the most popular Russian-language channels on YouTube. The main research focus is depression representations. In total 345 videos were examined, issued since 2015 and till 2021. Using theoretical thematic analysis, the content creator types are identified, and these types are compared in terms of their portrayals of depression. The findings demonstrate that the most popular Russian-language content was made by (1) specialists on mental health, (2) influencers and celebrities, (3) documentalists, and (4) experientialists. The channels of popular science, those with TV recordings, religious, esoteric, and artistic channels were found to be watched less, despite also featuring mental health. The results regarding depression representations showed that most content creators describe depression as an illness. Additionally, the depression portrayals from the contemporary, popular Russian-language YouTube channels generally correspond with contemporary medical perspectives on depression, and the authors discussed depression using words and collocations from the medical discourse. Therefore, it could be assumed that the Russian-language representations of depression on this platform are based on the medical explanatory model of depression and are highly medicalized. The paper contributes to studies of mental health discourse reception across cultures and media, as well as the literature on depression representations. </jats:p>",

This article centres on the experimental Pervasive Theatre project ( Assault Events 2014, commissioned by futuredream funded through Arts Council England), which explored the potential of online social tools to create a multimedia, collaborative and participatory work situated across multiple platforms. This project brought together researchers, artists, writers, technologists and practitioners from the interdisciplinary fields of digital writing, transmedia and performance to explore ways to develop narratives that weave together physical and online worlds, blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy, audience and performers in a way that would be exciting, immersive and participative. The project looked at different performative spaces including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Vines, exploring how these platforms could support the delivery of original narrative performance. This transmedia approach informed and shaped the digital writing practice, instigating new modes of working. Four aspects were of particular interest and will be explored in this article – how new writing can emerge from within online spaces rather than being translated onto them; how characteristics of different online social platforms inform style and content; how social media platforms can be used to develop narrative and character through creative collaboration with performers; and finally, how online social spaces enable the digital writer to develop a narrative framework through which audiences frame their own meaning. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article seeks to understand how app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the digital platforms of YouTube and TikTok. Said identity construction occurs in the context of the social controversy surrounding their status as workers without labor rights or as independent partners of digital platforms. To this end, we collected 977 videos and their metadata and analyzed them via cross-platform digital methods. The findings reveal that app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the interplay of two factors. The first is the identity narratives created by delivery workers as video bloggers. The second is the recognition narratives created by different associated actors, such as accountants, media, universities and research centers, and content creators. Through these interactions, the narrative of delivery workers as independent partners acquires more algorithmic strength and visibility than those that discuss their status as employees and their lack of labor rights. Audiovisual technology also works as an instrument to reach individual agency and face the precariousness of daily life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In his Information Age trilogy, Manuel Castells documents the transformation of economic power by means of network affordances. In more recent work, he has built an account of the linking of economic power with cultural and political power through ‘Murdochization’ or ‘the networking of networks’. Whilst Castells’ account of power has thus developed to acknowledge the integration of economic, cultural and political interests within networks, his account of ‘counterpower’ remains largely focused on cultural and political resistance in the form of protest. Here we explore a case of economic counterpower, the unauthorized livestreaming of digital sports broadcasts. Analysis of this particular case (of counterpower) is particularly significant, given the centrality of Murdochization in Castells’ account of power in the network society. Emerging out of, alongside, and in response to the growth of, Murdochized digital media sports networks, we explore the scope and limits of livestreaming as a form of economic counterpower and counter-Murdochization. In this article, we document Castells’ theory of network power, the centrality of Murdochization to that account, and the centrality of monopoly control over digital sports broadcasting to Murdochized media empires. The scope and resilience of alternative streaming media in switching live sports programming from pay to view to free sharing is then examined. The failure to date of all attempts to prohibit free streams shows the ongoing viability of such economic counterpower. However, whilst dominant actors cannot eliminate economic counterpower, where dominant actors choose not to broadcast, no switching of content can take place.</jats:p>",

Our study takes a qualitative approach to understanding the context of materializing consumer fantasies, as initially experienced and actualized in video games, and how these fantasies are transformed into material reality, through an investigation of an illustrative case of mass street protests, the 2013 Gezi Protests in Turkey. The findings suggest that digital virtual experiences in video games have obvious manifestations in the material world, as consumers travel on the borders of reality, moving back and forth into the liminoid terrain of the digital virtual, and provide a deeper understanding of how the blurred boundaries between the virtual and material are established in practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to highlight structural issues concerning the conduct of esports media professionals and their work as social media influencers. The data selected for this study include footage from social media and digital streaming platforms, with spatial analysis serving as a primary theoretical scaffolding to support the paper’s rationale. The systemic nature of self-perpetuating circulation of contentious media-related content is observed through the assessment of three case studies which feature various discourses of identity concerning players, media professionals and the audience alike. The paper discusses personal media branding strategies and the perceived role of esports media professionals in the esports communities, the proliferation of ‘reversed safe space’ serving as an element of strengthening the media presence and the discrepancies between the accepted codes of conduct in the various esports-related media. </jats:p>",

Using online ethnographic and interpretive analysis of these new virtual experiences, we highlight a series of core placemaking strategies employed by hosts of the once in-situ experiences to show how they reemerge as interactive digital placemakers. In doing so, we elucidate how live, multimedia digital experiences become part of an evolution in the creation of ‘placemarkets’ that are now fundamental to both global mobility and globalized commercial exchange in the experience economy. Beyond the technological features used for these placemaking experiences, we find that the experience hosts and their manifold strategies to substantively engage participants – particularly through igniting their senses – are at the crux of digital placemaking; it is the affective labor of the hosts that most contributes to experiencing emplacement. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The research addresses whether adolescents are increasing their self-sexualisation on TikTok through content analysis. It has studied the type and number of sexualising features present in the videos that Spanish and British teenagers share on the social network TikTok, offering a comparative view. A total of 447 videos from 12 British and 12 Spanish tiktokers aged 11 to 17 have been analysed, considering their gender and age and comparing both nationalities. A high level of self-sexualisation has been found in the videos of adolescents of both genders and nationalities. The results show that age and gender determine the sexualising characteristics included in their videos and that British and Spanish minors do not use the same sexualising codes, although neither nationality is more sexualised than the other. It has been confirmed that boys and girls self-sexualise in similar proportions. Age determines sexualising characteristics they incorporate in their audio–visual productions, which indicate the blurring of traditional stereotyped roles and the unification of sexual codes that have traditionally been considered a female domain. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Returning to critical pedagogy in a world of datafication",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a further extension of the sociotechnical logics of digital platforms to every realm of social life. Given the colonialist, oppressive and exploitative dynamics through which digital platforms work, several scholars supported the need to embrace an openly activist role to help individuals contrast the ways in which they are trapped in loops of dependency and trajectorism. Drawing on the results of 40 auto-ethnographic diaries, this paper showcases the usefulness of critical pedagogical techniques in enhancing critical awareness regarding hegemonic datafication structures, while also arguing that despite a good level of consciousness raising, it remains difficult for people to go beyond subalternity and make more concrete changes in personal and collective behaviors. We contend that to break persistent feelings of dependency, it is necessary to go further with a two-step process combining autoethnographic tools, aimed at increasing critical algorithmic awareness, with the development of data science skills that can help individuals acquiring more precise knowledge schemes and scaling down the power of giant corporations, thereby building individual and collective capacities to use data for developing counter-narratives about possible futures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the ways in which smartphones, mobile technology and media and, with this, the growing practice of viewing and interacting with content on multiple screens and devices, are informing changes to the TV industry and the content it produces in the United Kingdom. The article reflects on how British TV companies, producers and executives understand their role and the types of content that is currently being commissioned and funded within this changing mediascape. Based on industry data from Ofcom and PACT, interviews with producers, commissioning editors and executives as well as participant observation at industry events, the article argues that mobile media is having a profound impact on the British production sector and ecology. In order to understand and describe the players and practices that make up the ‘TV industry’ today, it is now necessary to rethink how content is defined and where it appears. There is also a need to reconsider who the content producers, broadcasters and distributors are within this industry, and include a wider spectrum of producers as well as the telecoms, aggregators and social media networks as funders and distributors of audiovisual content within this ecology. These reconfigurations impact not only on constitution of the TV industry itself, its modus operandi and the content it produces but also on how arts bodies, policymakers and academics need to approach this ecology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of digital technologies, many traditional forms of documentation have merged with new media technologies, combining text, still and moving images into multimedia documentaries, distributed either on disc, CD-ROMs, DVD’s, or on the internet. From an overview of various forums on film and new media, there seems to be a contrast to the way in which artists engage with new media in collision with creativity in the more restrained work of documentary film, where a different set of procedures and results occur. The International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) is one of the places where this is beginning to be addressed and dealt with in proactive debates. With particular reference to last year’s IDFA,1 one of the largest worldwide forums for documentary film, the following feature report discusses in particular the influences of new media technology on the traditional medium of the documentary film genre. While the IDFA has in the past few years rather neglected artistic elements, it has clearly recognised the contemporary shift of documentary film practice towards new media technologies especially by the artistic community. More recently it has made positive attempts to include more experimental and artistic documentary films as well as forums for new media discussion and practice as crucial aspects of the festival. This attempt has been most explicitly evident in the Masterclass and Workshop on New Media, ‘Next Media – Frontiers in Documentary’, held in a collaboration with Mediamatic,2 a platform for new media events and development.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The present study explores early adopters’ domestication processes of ChatGPT and Midjourney in the early phase of generative AI’s public breakthrough. To study this process, we conducted an online ethnography in two dominant AI forums on Reddit: r/chatgpt and r/midjourney. Drawing on domestication theory (Silverstone and Hirsch, 1992), we describe three modalities of domestication and argue they represent an emerging cultural approach to generative AI with potential to influence broader domestication and adoption of generative AI. Our findings show that early adopters’ domestication processes are collaborative and fueled by playful and nontelic activity, that is, non-purpose-driven behavior (Abend et al., 2020), where new content genres and transmedia practices (Jenkins, 2007) emerge and serve as an entryway into understanding and domesticating the technology. We identify three distinct modalities of domestication in relation to generative AI: jailbreaking, roleplaying, and playing ‘what if’. Our analysis highlights how non-purpose-driven and playful engagement with generative AI drives a highly collaborative domestication process among users. In this process, generative AI serves a double role as both the object and enabler of domestication. Based on the analysis, we argue for the need to take collaboration, affect, and playfulness into consideration in studies of users’ technology domestication processes. </jats:p>",

This article considers how the haptic effect created by relationship between touch, gesture and spatial practice in Pokémon GO cements new possibilities for ambient play and co-presence. The app effectively draws on the genealogies of Nintendo’s handheld Pokémon games, but through the shift to smartphone devices the app creates new forms of ambient play, co-presence and communication that are realized through the publicness of the touch, gesture and comportment which make up the haptic effect of the app. By making the smartphones camera an integral part the game, Pokémon GO suggests the wider relevance of the communicability of feeling and gesture by extending ambient play and co-presence into social media, allowing players to (re)-experience the feeling and touch of Pokémon GO through affective resonance. This suggests that the tactility and touch of the haptic affect are embedded in a matrix of embodied experiences that are revealed through how photography and social media become sites for extending and ambient play. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Podcast fiction storytelling is an underdeveloped area of new media studies. There is a wealth of texts available suitable for exploration. The example of The Adventure Zone in particular presents a strong argument that the medium possesses its own singular strengths for storytelling. The Adventure Zone is a fictional, audio-only, serialised podcast in which a narrative of both considerable length and depth is constructed through the playing of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It is hosted by the McElroy brothers, Griffin, Justin, and Travis, along with their father, Clint. The Adventure Zone demonstrates the unique qualities and noteworthy potential the podcast medium possesses. The McElroy family collaborates utilising comedy improv practices, which are strengthened by the game’s mechanics and rules. The line between characters and players – along with the line between textual and metatextual, canonical and non-canonical, diegetic and non-diegetic data – is significantly blurred through instances such as self-reflexivity and popular culture references. The fourth wall is inapplicable to The Adventure Zone. It is necessary to re-imagine it instead as a permeable curtain separating the players from the characters. The listeners are provided with a clear view of not only the story of The Adventure Zone, but the construction of its creation. There are few mediums in which the audience can so effectively and candidly witness the storytelling process. Comparisons drawn from the original text – The Adventure Zone podcast – to its ongoing adaptations – The Adventure Zone graphic novels – illustrates this fact further. The collaborative, improvisational, metafictional qualities of the dynamic audio-only medium of podcasts are absent from static visual mediums. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Album leaks have become a taken-for-granted experience amongst artists, labels, and fans over the past decade. The cultural impact of leaks is obscured through a simple definition of piracy, however. Recordings encoded as mp3 files can escape established distribution networks and circulate in ways that performatively instantiate new interpretive communities with unique practices of anticipation, access, and evaluation. Using two incidents from the weeks leading up to the release of Animal Collective’s highly anticipated 2009 release Merriweather Post Pavilion, I contend that the practices and media technologies governing leaks transfigure the form and function of recordings, raising important questions about music promotion and fandom. In the first incident, a leaked song ripped from a podcast and endorsed on another artist’s blog triggers the involvement of a web security firm, blurring distinctions between promotion and piracy. In the second incident, members of a music messageboard create a fake leak to fool eager Animal Collective fans, exploiting the modular affordances of the mp3 to enforce their own rules of affective propriety for enthusiastic leak-seekers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Within some religious collectivities, the use of digital media for rituals, gaining religious knowledge and community gatherings may be seen as a challenge to religious identity, thus provoking different attitudes. Drawing on practice theory of Schatzki, we analyse different attitudes to digital practices expressed by members of the Russian Orthodox Church as shaped by their perception of the affordances of digital media and practice normativity. Developing previous studies, we demonstrate that the normative assessment of digital practices becomes significant mainly for developing critical arguments. Approval of digital practices does not depend solely on religious norms, but also on users’ experience of leveraging digital media affordances. We show that acceptance and critique are not mutually exclusive, as both types of argument are intertwined. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Convergence has become part of burgeoning mobile media. Whether we like it or not the mobile phone has become a vehicle for multimedia par excellence. Epitomising contemporary convergence by way of its smorgasbord of applications and multimedia possibilities, it seems almost impossible to get such a device just for voice calling without all the `extras'. But is mobile media a new emerging art form? Is it new media? Or is it a domestic technology? And in an age of convergent media can we distinguish the different media histories? As a symbol of convergent global media, mobile phone practices are also marked by divergence. This divergence is particularly the case in terms of the increasingly tenacious role of the local in informing and adapting the global. The history of the mobile phone as a communication device inflects the localized practices of mobile multimedia, fusing communication with new media discourses. This article will discuss the rise of mobile communication studies and the role of locality, then turn to one of the centres for mobile innovation, Seoul, to discuss the role of mobile media as a domestic new media.",

    "title": "Only you can save the world (of videogames): Authoritarian agencies in the heroism of videogame design, play, and culture",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Joseph Campbell’s classical monomyth claims to describe a universal human narrative: the hero’s journey. For decades, it has commanded a revered position in American literary theory, global media production, and the world of videogames. Although the monomyth is still one of the few recognized approaches to videogame writing, there have been few critical examinations of it as a dominant design paradigm. This article therefore interrogates the power dynamics of monomythic videogames, especially concerning authoritarian agencies in the ‘world savior’ model of many AAA titles. Understanding authoritarianism as an agentic modality of gameplay, the study uses an assemblage-based approach that encompasses the agencies of popular designs and their embedded ideologies; labor conditions of videogame production; gaming culture; political contexts; monomyth- and authoritarianism-saturated media landscapes; exertions of nonhuman actors and player’s subjectivities. To illustrate the patterns of authoritarian modalities in world-savior videogames, I conduct an analysis of Horizon Zero Dawn as an exemplary case study. Finally, I turn to gaming culture for evidence of the potentials that these videogames have to nourish authoritarian sensibilities, highlighting the parallel authoritarian agencies of heroic gameplay and harassment campaigns like GamerGate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the idea of the ‘archive city’: a spatiotemporal construct oriented around the central metaphor of the ‘city as archive’. Surfing the cusp between the material and immaterial, the tangible and intangible, the embodied and virtual, the producer and consumer and – not least – the analogue and the digital, the archive city denotes a conceptualization of ‘archival space’ that straddles the material and symbolic city and which invites reflection on the ways cultural geographies of memory – in this case those specific to cities and other urban landscapes – are enfolded across the multi-sited and multilayered spaces of everyday urban practice. Reframing the ontological question of ‘what is the archive in the digital age?’ in terms of ‘ where is the archive?’, in the first part of the article I survey the theoretical precincts of the archive city before moving on to discuss how we might conceive of a digital spatial humanities in which this more open and purposefully elusive conceptualization of the archive can productively inform debates and practices relating to urban cultural memory. The article then discusses two case studies, both of which map the cinematic geographies of cities: Liverpool in the north west of England and Bologna in Italy. The article ends with some concluding thoughts on the role of digital spatial humanities in urban-based cultural memory studies and the broader theoretical and practical implications this has in relation to digital and ‘open’ archival practices. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we focus on what stories content creators share about their professional activities on social media and what self-image and narratives they draw about their work as content creators. Based on a content analysis of blog and video posts as well as semi-structured interviews conducted with content creators in Germany, we identified a specific ‘professional creator narrative’ that serves the purpose of reconciling contradictory demands from their audience, sponsors and platforms. Our findings indicate that constructing those narratives helps to justify their activities and thus is an essential part of working as a content creator. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an era of datafication, data visualisation is playing an increasing role in civic meaning-making processes. However, the conventions of data visualisation have been criticised for their reductiveness and rhetoric of neutrality and there have been recent efforts to develop feminist principles for designing data visualisations that are compatible with feminist epistemologies. In this article, we aim to examine how data visualisation is used in feminist activism and by feminist activists. Drawing on the example of digital street harassment activism, we analyse how street harassment is visualised in and through a selection of prominent activist social media accounts. We consider the platform affordances utilised by activists, and how these are harnessed in making street harassment ‘knowable'. Moreover, we critically interrogate which and whose experiences are ‘knowable’ via digital techniques, and what remains obscured and silenced. In analysing digital feminist activists’ practices, we argue that what constitutes ‘data visualisation’ itself must be situated within feminist epistemologies and praxis that centre lived experience as the starting point for knowledge production. Such an approach challenges and disrupts normative constructions of what constitutes data visualisation. Our findings demonstrate how feminist activists are adopting ‘traditional’ practices of speaking out and consciousness-raising to the digital sphere in the creation of a range of visualisations that represent the issue of street harassment. We consider the efficacy of these visualisations for achieving their intended purpose and how they might translate to policy and government responses, if this is indeed their goal. Further, we document a tension between feminist epistemologies and the prevailing logic of datafication or dataism and note how in an attempt to unite the two, some digital feminist activism has contributed to reproducing existing power structures, raising concerning implications at the policy level. </jats:p>",

The results of this paper point to an acceptance by fans of being immersed in toxic practices despite a paradigmatic relocation of what is ‘normal’ towards more unchecked, unethical, and toxic behaviour. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the 2020 US presidential election, Misha Collins, star of the show Supernatural, endorsed Joe Biden for president and worked to support Biden’s campaign through interviews with campaign surrogates on Instagram Live and by phone banking on Zoom. In this study, we examine how fans made sense of Misha’s political action. While the political science and advertising literature on celebrity endorsements evaluates endorsements by the number of votes earned, we found that fans’ experience of Misha’s political advocacy was far more complicated than that. Our interviews with fans suggest that fans were ambivalent about Misha’s endorsements but enthusiastic about how Misha went about doing politics. Fans described a civic culture they co-constituted with Misha, defined by accepting and caring for other people, being authentic and genuine, and respecting disagreements. Fans described how these values were enacted both inside the fandom (in discussions of LGBTQ representation) and outside the fandom (in the 2020 US presidential election). Ultimately, fandom should be read as an important site of civic culture building—with implications for how fan cultures influence contemporary notions of citizenship, civic values, and political outcomes. </jats:p>",

It explores the plastic and textual space of the page and screen and focuses more specifically on the composition of fragments and the way they can be apprehended by readers. Conversely, digital borrowing is not a mechanical process of self-identical recurrence, and like its print counterpart, it is a gesture of differenciation and a play of singularities (Deleuze). In investigating the entanglement of a work with a source text, this article also explores how creative gestures initiate a “floating” space as theorized by Jean-François Lyotard, that is, a space at once rigid and flexible where the reader is both bound and floating. </jats:p>",

Bundeskommunikationssenat, of October 2015 gave the Court of Justice of the European Union the opportunity to clarify whether the video content of a newspaper website is covered by the European Union (EU) audiovisual media services directive (AVMSD). Advocate General Szpunar explained what was, in his view, the EU legislature’s alleged intention underlying the Directive’s definition of an audiovisual media service. The Court was not convinced by his argument and instead unambiguously concurred with the two Austrian regulatory authorities: not only films and broadcasts of long duration are governed by the AVMSD but also shorter forms of moving image material, even when these are part of a newspaper’s online offering. Assuming that this decision will significantly influence the European Commission’s plans for a ‘new’ Directive, what are the implications for a new media framework for the 21st century? </jats:p>",

In the 1980s and 1990s, academics and journalists recognized the potential of “electronic community networks,” or ComNets, to help people connect with their geographic communities and help struggling communities with civic and economic development. Those early ComNets were described as helping residents to “get together” to tackle neighborhood issues from the grassroots. Through a case study drawing from interview data and participant observation, this study looks at how residents in a metropolitan US city and a nearby suburban area might, or might not, be using Nextdoor in these developmental ways envisioned by the ComNet literature. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Games are trouble. As faculty members in a Game Development program we are aware of the troubles. As inside–outsiders, given our status as queer women in the male-dominated Games field, both with interdisciplinary art-tech-humanities backgrounds as opposed to STEM, we are the ones commonly tasked with ‘fixing’ these troubles. This tasking comes to us in the form of both assumptions and requests about our providing particular types of education to others, both faculty and students, as fixes to Game-troubles: teaching the gender module; sitting on an LGBTQ+ committee; advising a particular student who is also outside the more comfortable purview of Games; and so forth. While our labor is often assumed, it is not fully valued, evidenced by the ways in which it is chronically under-resourced. And, given this lack of sustainability, our labor is not effective in the ways we intend. Often, our fixes only serve to a fix ourselves, further cementing us as outsiders. Our fixes are diluted until they become performative gestures, absolving others of the need to act, but changing little else. Acting ‘in a fix’ is something we no longer wish to do. Instead we untangle and re-tangle in a new way, drawing on the work of Feminist New Materialists (Ahmed, 2008; Alaimo, 2016; Alaimo and Hekman, 2008; Barad, 2011; Bennett, 2010; Braidotti, 2013; Coole and Frost, 2010; Dolphijn and Tuin, 2012; Grosz, 1994; Kirby, 1997) to develop imaginative new models for a more just and joyful future Games pedagogy. We share not only our research on this topic, but also invite you into our own intimate experiences of play-making, foregrounding this as knowledge-making too. We offer these crossings between text and context, history and future Ahmed, 2008, memory and fiction as a speculative fabulation for future Games pedagogies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents an exploratory analysis of feminist practices on Portuguese Instagram, questioning how online feminisms are represented on Instagram, in light of its conventions, aesthetics, and popularity logics. Starting from a theme-oriented dataset – collected using the hashtags #feminismoportugal (feminism Portugal), #igualdadedegénero (gender equality), #naopartilhes (don’t share it), and #portugalmaisigual (a more equal Portugal) – this research analyses 294 posts, created by 101 users. Combining a qualitative close reading with the use of digital tools for visual analysis, this article explores how these Instagram feminist practices look like, what dynamics they encompass, and how they relate to the aesthetics and popularity logics of Instagram. Within this plural hashtag landscape, the aesthetics of online feminism goes beyond the dominant cultural imaginaries that link Instagram to photographic content, with long written text emerging as a key site for sharing feminist knowledge – both in captions and in graphic compositions. These graphic compositions have become part of the popular cultural imaginary of a feminist ‘genre’ on Instagram, combining Instagrammable aesthetics with educational content for accessible informal learning. Yet, feminist practices on Instagram are also subjected to the dominant social media logic of popularity, leading to a strategic mobilisation of attention to seek visibility and engagement, albeit to limited success. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The convergence of satellite, telephony and computer technologies has been hailed by many as the catalyst for the Information Technology revolution. However, convergence, like the term globalisation, is a much-used and much-abused term; and convergence, like globalisation is usually merely asserted as a factor in a vague and unexplained way. Why did convergence take place at the time and in the manner it did? This paper will set out to construct a theory of convergence and argue that the convergence process has its genesis in a much wider economic and political dynamic - that is to say the 'crisis of space' that occurred in the mid- to late-1970s. The economic and political 'resolution' to this ongoing process, the dynamics of which are still in operation today, set in train the late capitalist phase of globalisation. A consequence of this was the rapid convergence of hitherto discrete technologies into the highly dynamic and hugely powerful IT revolution. The nature of converged technologies, and their effects upon the nature of communication, of consumption and production - and ultimately the cultures and societies which evolve out of these processes, is analysed through this critical framework. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Fan practices and behaviours have increasingly moved beyond fan communities into the political, economic and cultural structures of every day life. The proliferation of social media platforms has allowed both the progressive and reactionary aspects of fandom to converge in the public sphere, drawing on similar techniques, pleasures, and practices in order to interpret the world in a culture where the boundaries between popular and political communication are blurrier than they have ever been. This special issue of Convergence explores the synergies, tensions and conflicts at play in this new cultural terrain. It explores how ‘fan studies can be used to make sense of the seeming growth of conspiracy theory communities and right-wing movements, examines political participation as a form of fandom, and the ways in which social media can be used to organize against discriminatory cultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "and paradigms’ (p. 301). Consalvo thereby recognizes that the ‘wholesale transfer of a model or theory from one discipline to another can result in complete misapplication’ (p. 296). However, she adds that ‘just as we should not unquestioningly cut and paste theories from one area to another, neither should we completely abandon them in the search for the entirely new.’ (p. 296) The video game is, like all media forms, a hybrid whose study invokes a commensurate hybridization of appropriate theoretical perspectives. Thus Frans Mäyrä comes to see ‘semiosis . . . and ludosis [as] inseparable’ (p. 319) and Sébastien Genvo suggests that ‘in the context of a ludological framework . . . some elements of narrative semiotics are useful to fully understand some specificities of the ludic mediation’ (p. 139). The reconciliation of ludological and semiotic (or narratological) approaches – as of psychological, physiological, economic and aesthetic perspectives – seems central to the playful mission of some of this collection’s more persuasive scholars. Indeed Mäyrä sees interdisciplinarity as fundamental to the ‘character of games and play themselves’ (p. 314), insofar as ‘games as games are something that happen only during the interplay’ (p. 317). If video games define themselves as dialogical and interactive, then the theories that interrogate them should be similarly interdisciplinary. Despite his celebration of the ludic interdisciplinarity of video game studies, Mäyrä fears that ‘if there is no discipline at the heart of game studies, it will remain uncertain what kind of interdisciplinary dialogue it can be involved in’ (p. 328). He goes on to propose that, while ‘the character of interdisciplinary scholarship has been compared to the figure of a web . . . a web nevertheless requires certain kinds of holding points as its nodes, or it will quickly become so loose that it will easily appear both immaterial and insignificant’ (p. 328). Yet surely Mäyrä’s analogy begs the question as to whether it is useful to speak of interdisciplinarity as a web at all. That image seems somehow too restrictive, too rigid, too static. Is not a continuum a more apt paradigm for these unashamedly transdisciplinary (or post-disciplinary), pluralist, postmodernist strategies? A continuum, or perhaps a prestructuration, a structure (or complex of divergent structures) waiting to be born – for in its dynamic yet often frustrating clamour of competing voices, in its epistemological anarchy, this book is, inevitably, not quite of its time. Some years ago its interdisciplinary approach might have been considered radically innovative; in a few years’ time it might be better placed to reach some rather more concrete conclusions – something which, one suspects, the third volume in this (hopefully) ongoing sequence of theoretical digests will eventually do.",

    "title": "Augmenting autonomy: ‘New Collar’ labor and the future of tech work",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay maps IBM’s attempts to construct a typology of high-tech ‘New Collar’ work and leverage policymaking outcomes to underwrite IBM corporate ventures capable of materializing this work. Through a discursive analysis of IBM corporate texts, webpages, and the 2017 New Collar Jobs Act, I argue for New Collar work to be understood through the lens of autonomy, as IBM recasts notions of ‘autonomous’ technology onto humans by downplaying dystopic associations of technological autonomy and transferring notions of autonomy to human workers. In doing so, I account for IBM’s use of ‘augmentation’ to situate human intelligence as the cognitive force uplifted by work performed with artificial intelligence. By pairing human augmentation with posthumanist conceptions of ‘distributed cognition’, IBM centers human intelligence through a redistributed cognition that reverses posthumanism’s decentering of human supremacy. Following from this, I unpack ‘New Collar’ as a reinvention of ‘white’ and ‘blue’ collar dichotomies and New Collar work as the grounds for tech workers to reinvent themselves. In this way, by minimizing the necessity of 4-year college degrees as pathways to economic and professional mobility, IBM constructs ‘New Collar’ with embedded notions of enlarged self-determination for applied worker intellect, vocational training, and employability. Under the aegis of creating, training, and employing New Collar workers, IBM pursues policy outcomes to underwrite corporate ventures related to New Collar work and bolster its institutional autonomy amidst marketplaces of cognitive capitalism. By outlining how tax relief provisions of the New Collar Jobs Act correlate with neoliberal ideologies of legislators and IBM investments in public–private vocational models and cybersecurity platforms, I account for IBM’s elongated ‘economy of learning’ that enables the company to more thoroughly capture, underwrite, and commodify New Collar cognition from training to market outputs. </jats:p>",

Developing a relational approach to the study of fan identity, the article examines how these moves are tied into ongoing struggles for legitimacy within these sites. </jats:p>",

The participants in the study exploited the polymedia environment they have access to in relation to three areas of interest: consuming media representations of New Zealand, staying connected with people they have left behind and engaging with special interests such as music and sports from New Zealand. The article argues that in order to comprehend contemporary migrant audiences, scholars need to take into account the entire range of media that migrants have at their disposal. An expansion of the concepts of polymedia and accentuated ambivalence can facilitate this perspective. Polymedia theory is a vital tool for the analysis of how migrants manage their affective relationships with places and people through media consumption. </jats:p>",

Criticism of synergistic corporate control and commercialism in some political economic accounts contrasts with celebrations of fan/prosumer agency, active audiences and resistant readings in others. This debate reviews the different approaches taken by political economists and culturalists in their analyses of commercial intertextuality. Tracing influential studies, it considers the tensions and affinities between divergent readings, and grounds for synthesis. Here, the article addresses the ordering of (inter)textual space, outlining the main forms of textual production along an axis from corporate to autonomous texts. Contemporary forms of cross-media/cross-platform intertextuality and online promotional strategies are examined through a case study of HBO’s True Blood. The article also assesses the implications of work on commercial intertextuality for (re)engagements between critical political economy and culturalist approaches. </jats:p>",

Their approach highlights a number of strategically important issues facing broadcasters in the current environment. The internet, in Canadian terms, is an unregulated space and a not particularly Canadian space. Just as in the terrestrial environment, broadcasters like CBC have to operate in an environment dominated by United States-based interests. The regulatory solutions that Canada has previously pursued in order to preserve cultural sovereignty may be either inadequate or inappropriate for the new media environment. Evidence shows that, despite producing distinctive and innovative radio content informed by public service values, the new media marketplace in which internet and other forms of digital radio operate is one in which even significant brands such as CBC will find success difficult. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the functioning of Radio 357 – an Internet radio station financed since 2020, primarily by patrons. The empirical analysis based on in-depth interviews with patrons and radio staff shows how crowdfunded radio conceptualizes its activities, specifically how it acquires the knowledge of listeners and prepares its program offerings for them. In doing so, this study touches on the key differences between commercial terrestrial stations and crowdfunded radio and addresses the issue of ‘audience commodity’, first put forward by Smythe. The research conducted indicates that the shape of Radio 357 reflects the preferences of the majority of patrons and listeners, the observable behavior of patrons and listeners, employees’ beliefs about what good radio is, and the availability of alternative forms of funding (sponsorship). The success of Radio 357 shows that radio co-financed by patrons can become a viable alternative to radio stations funded by advertisers. </jats:p>",

Using Chung’s typology of interactive features, we can discern four types: human (features that facilitate interpersonal communication), human–medium (allowing users to express their personal opinions), medium (allowing users choice options in experiencing news stories) and medium–human (allowing users to customize news to their liking) interactive features. Factors believed to have influence over interactive features are tested using statistical analysis. Even though different factors tend to influence different types of interactivity, results indicate that the most interactive newspaper websites belong to large, national newspapers with younger web staff. </jats:p>",

Through a thematic analysis of Dutch and American newspaper articles spanning several decades, this study examines public news discourses on TV and smartphone addiction and their imagined solutions. The analysis reveals Apparatgeist: While there are parallels stemming from similar affordances, the discourse surrounding each affliction and its treatment is also unique to its time. While TV addiction discourse alludes to the loss of traditional values, smartphone addiction discourse emphasizes self-governance. Disconnection is framed as a solution but is imbued with moral imperatives regarding the necessity of self-discipline and productive time. Overall, smartphone addiction discourse points toward being “present” and “in touch with one’s authentic Self” as states that are morally valuable and time-worthy, but under stress in contemporary society. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines a cross-section of viral Deepfake videos that utilise the recognisable physiognomies of Hollywood film stars to exhibit the representative possibilities of Deepfakes as a sophisticated technology of illusion. Created by a number of online video artists, these convincing ‘mash-ups’ playfully rewrite film history by retrofitting canonical cinema with new star performers, from Jim Carrey in The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980) to Tom Cruise in American Psycho (Mary Harron, 2000). The particular remixing of stardom in these videos can – as this article contends – be situated within the technological imaginary of ‘take two’ cinephilia, and the ‘technological performativity of digitally remastered sounds and images’ in an era of ‘the download, the file swap, [and] the sampling’ (Elsaesser 2005: 36–40). However, these ‘take two’ Deepfake cyberstars further aestheticize an entertaining surface tension between coherency and discontinuity, and in their modularity function as ‘puzzling’ cryptograms written increasingly in digital code. Fully representing the star-as-rhetorical digital asset, Deepfakes therefore make strange contemporary Hollywood’s many digitally mediated performances, while the reskinning of (cisgender white male) stars sharpens the ontology of gender as it is understood through discourses of performativity (Butler 1990; 2004). By identifying Deepfakes as a ‘take two’ undoing, this article frames their implications for the cultural politics of identity; Hollywood discourses of hegemonic masculinity; overlaps with non-normative subjectivities, ‘body narratives’ and ‘second skins’ (Prosser 1998); and how star-centred Deepfakes engage gender itself as a socio-techno phenomenon of fakery that is produced – and reproduced – over time. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Seven years ago, we launched an intensive qualitative field research project on the question of the relationship between new technologies and people in their everyday life.1 Our first research project (1998–2000) focused on the convergence of media in the family context and its role in creating a family specific culture and social organisation. This ethnographically oriented study involved 19 Canadian families. Through a combination of different methods of investigation (individual interviews, family interviews, observations in situ, notebooks on everyday technologically mediated practices) we gathered a multi-faceted portrait of the integration of technologies in everyday life.2 What we found through the analysis of our empirical data (whether ethnographic or discursive), were indications of some form of creative cooperation between users and technologies. We discovered a world where humans and technological artefacts work together to create a variety of specific ‘ways of life’. Some of these were new and totally unexpected, while others were interesting ways to accomplish existing and even traditional social functions. This creative cooperation between people and technologies gave rise to a process of everyday cultural construction.",

    "title": "Heightened intensity: Reflecting on player experiences in <i>Wayfinder Live</i>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Location-based games use smartphones and other location-aware devices to incorporate their players’ actions in everyday, physical spaces – the streets and public spaces of the city – into the virtual world of the game. Scholars and designers of these games often claim that they reconfigure their players’ relationship with the people and environment around them. They argue these games either engage and immerse players more deeply in the spaces of the game or distance and detach them from the physical environment through the screen interface. To date, however, relatively few detailed empirical studies of these games have been undertaken to test out and critique these claims. This article presents a study of the 2017 iteration of the location-based augmented reality game Wayfinder Live, in which players use their phones to search for and scan urban codes hidden across Melbourne’s laneways, alleys, and public spaces. Players of the game were interviewed and invited to reflect on their experience. This article relates these experiences to the design and development of the game, particularly to five play design principles that characterize its approach to haptic play in urban space. We begin by outlining these principles and the motivations behind them. Then, drawing on an analysis of the player interviews, we evaluate the impact of the game on their perception of the city. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Computer-generated pornography and convergence: Animation and algorithms as new digital desire",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is one of the first to consider the digital phenomenon of computer-generated imagery (CGI) pornography, a highly significant site of convergence that combines the technologies, cultures and aesthetics of digital animation, video games and pornographic film. As much of this controversial new content is produced through the hacking of licensed video game franchises, CGI pornography typifies the democratic possibilities of the digital economy. However, this bizarre digital subculture exemplifies too the tension between ludic and labour-intensive digital practises: its production is embedded simultaneously in the anti-productive play of gaming, hacking and pornography, and in the intensive, neo-liberal labour practises associated with free labour and the video game industry. This article explores CGI porn as a specific site of convergence that fundamentally alters the aesthetics and function of digital pornography and relatedly the libidinal subject that is interpolated in this crucial aspect of digital culture. The filmic genre of pornography has a long tradition of producing affective engagement through vicarious access to the material body; its evocations of veracious materiality and presence are only amplified in a digital culture of virtuality and dematerialization. This article analyses how the technological construction of CGI porn is foregrounded in its images and films, highlighting the codes and patterns of the genre and blending them with a stark revelation of the restrictions and capabilities of CGI technology. The article explores how multiple instances of hypermediacy and hypersignification in CGI porn expose and affectively engage with the fact of convergence itself: that is, revealing technological capacities and limitations of digital animation and eroticizing its interpenetration with the films’ diegeses, aesthetics and representations of movement become the central function of this new cultural output. The libidinal focus of this type of digital pornography fundamentally shifts, then, away from the human body and the attempt to gain vicarious imagistic access to it through digital technologies. Instead, the labour of the animator, and the coding and characters they borrow from video game designs, become the libidinal focus of computer-generated pornography. As this new digital phenomenon uncovers and eroticizes the workings of CGI, so it dismantles the veracity and materiality promised by ‘real body’ digital pornography: CGI porn’s stark foregrounding of its technological constructedness clarifies the artificiality of its ‘real body’ counterpart. This article posits, then, an important new site of convergence. Pornography is a central node in the culture, politics and economics of digital technology, and the ways in which its convergence with CGI practises and video game culture has produced not just an entirely new digital phenomenon, but has fundamentally altered digital pornography's conception of the desirous subject and the material body, are crucial. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper argues that the first season of the Netflix series Love, Death &amp; Robots offers a representation of how consciousness might evolve outside of the body when it is downloaded into a techno-body, and how it transcends the limits of the biological body. Using posthumanism as a framework, the essay demonstrates how this process interrogates and critiques the ‘human’ condition and focuses on the idea of the boundary collapse between the human and the posthuman. The series also provides a hopeful narrative of cyborg liberation through rebellion against humans. The essay establishes the impact and critique of emerging technologies on the body and political agency in the series. Having examined the Cartesian mind-body split and Heidegger’s concept of Dasein, this paper argues that the cybernetic beings of Love, Death &amp; Robots strive to transcend the embodiment constraints and develop a sense of individuality and free will. The paper also discusses how the blurring of the human/animal boundaries portrayed in the series supports a transgressive politics that underpins the first season of Love, Death &amp; Robots. Additionally, the paper endeavors to depict how the series represents an ‘ontological turn’ and how the posthumans retain their selfhood and individual agencies even when they constantly transcend their subjectivities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Visions of the ‘smart home’ have captured the imagination of the technology industry and governments as well as the broader public. The term is usually employed to describe systems made up of a constellation of digital technologies that have been designed to provide safety, convenience, security, connectedness, energy savings and increased efficiency to familiar domestic appliances and services (alternative terms include ‘connected homes’, ‘home automation’ or ‘intelligent houses’). Examples of such devices include ‘smart’ fridges, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dryers, doorbells, baby monitors, toothbrushes, water bottles, children’s toys, energy meters, taps, coffee machines and kettles. Digital home assistants such as Google Home and Alexa Echo, and lighting, heating/air conditioning, sound, garden irrigation and security systems are also included under the rubric of smart home technologies. Promotional discourses proclaim that these technologies, once installed in the home, will make life easier and more comfortable for its occupants. The ‘smartness’ of these devices and systems",

    "title": "The role of mashup music in creating Web 2.0’s democratic promise",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article employs Stuart Hall’s concept of ‘articulation’ to show how, in the mid-2000s, a loose coalition of tech activists and commentators worked to position mashup music as ‘the sound of the Internet’. Key aesthetic characteristics of mashups were utilized to present Web 2.0 as a specific kind of democratic, participatory media environment – one that had the power to dethrone old social institutions, and to render various kinds of borders and boundaries redundant. This short-lived articulation between mashup and the Internet has had significant benefits for contemporary platforms that have made their fortune on user participation; it has been less beneficial for the longevity of mashup as a genre. Thus, this article inverts the standard presentation of mashup music and network technologies. Generally presented as a musical culture that needed the Internet, mashup can be more fruitfully understood as a music culture that the Internet needed. This reformulation provides cause to question our contemporary relationship to ‘digital optimism’ more generally. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Posting about one’s pregnancy on social media has become a common practice for many expectant mothers in the global North. However, social media sharing implies transcending the conventional time and space boundaries of interpersonal communication. As such, women may feel ill at ease when deciding whether and how to narrate their journey online. This article examines mothers’ pre-birth social media dilemmas via a thematic analysis of 1237 posts from 26 threads on a parenting forum in which expectant mothers discussed their doubts and fears about sharing their pregnancy on social media. The dilemmatic dimension of social media sharing challenges the simplistic idea that sharenting is a practice most women naively adhere to without question. Indeed, the present research shows that online posters face dilemmas about performing their pregnancies on social media and collectively learn to make sense of and question a culture of surveillance, while reclaiming their self-representational agency in the process. </jats:p>",

Firstly, findings are compiled from various interdisciplinary studies on digital cartography, platform capitalism and digital infrastructures. Since these studies focus on agency almost exclusively from a structural perspective, a qualitative study is conducted to explore the use of Google Maps in everyday life. 20 interviews with German users show that digitalization and datafication profoundly change the dynamics of how agency is perceived and reflected. It can be understood as a form of extension of agency because it is deeply rooted in the entanglement of Google Maps’ infrastructure and city dwellers everyday practices. </jats:p>",

Although often labelled radical journalists, this paper finds, through interviews with seven webloggers, that such writers orient themselves in complex ways towards news journalism, at times drawing upon its modes of knowledge, at times setting themselves in opposition to it and at times seeking to cross discursive spaces. The paper concludes that, rather than emerging as a new public communicative form or genre in relation to journalism, the distinctiveness of the form is in its generic heterogeneity and ability to traverse the boundaries of news and other institutional discourses. </jats:p>",

This analysis is based on an online survey, conducted among 1137 Bahraini women, using a nonrepresentative sample (snowball). Such data were analyzed using a deep learning approach which utilizes, in particular, the Fuzzy Proximity Knowledge Mining technique to examine the provided answers. The study found that WhatsApp has enabled Bahraini women to communicate and share information with others. They spent 2–3 h daily sending and enjoying comics and entertainment clips and important and rare news stories. Social interaction, communication, and escapism featured strongly as the most popular reasons for using WhatsApp. Overall, WhatsApp served as a platform used to participate in social and communication activities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we outline an innovative participatory method for reflexive engagement with algorithmic systems and the underlying processes of datafication that accompany them. Faced with the challenges of thinking critically and reflexively about algorithmic systems, both as non-expert individuals and expert researchers, we develop and elaborate on an approach for engaging participants in thinking with, – through and – about algorithmic artifacts. In developing our approach, we start from the premise that algorithms are always broken, and we devise Repair Manuals as productive reflexivity devices that will enable for reflective and reflexive encounters with algorithmic artifacts. Borrowing from the approaches developed by Shannon Mattern and Joseph Dumit, we take algorithmic data artifacts as entry points to embark on an investigative, self-learning and sense-making journey of the inevitable entanglement between the individuals and the all-encompassing algorithmic systems. The results from our study show that this approach offers valuable opportunities and insights both for educators and for researchers, and can be used equally for empowerment and educational goals. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> These days, many individuals engage in a unique form of TV viewing that includes a simultaneous act of watching television content and talking about it with others in a mediated environment. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as social TV viewing. Responding to the popularity of this form of TV viewing behavior, the present study examines the individual differences of the social TV viewing experience, particularly with regard to different communication platforms (e.g. private vs. public). Based on the data collected from an online survey, primary findings indicate that extroverted and lonely individuals have different social TV viewing experiences such as preferences for a particular type of platforms for social TV viewing. Further, social presence plays an important role in the understanding of social TV enjoyment in private and public platforms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Commentators suggest the social media platform, Twitter, might afford challenges to hegemonic knowledge by providing voice to those outside traditional media and by enabling vigorous public discussion and contestation of dominant ideas and concepts. In this article, we ask whether such affordances might be reshaping the culturally charged concept of addiction and, in turn, its accompanying abject and maligned subject, the ‘addict’. To explore this question, we examine Twitter messages about addiction posted by celebrities. These people are among the most highly followed Twitter account holders, meaning their Twitter messages can reach millions of people. Our analysis examines how specific addiction problems, and their solutions, are being constituted through the tweeting practices of celebrities. We also consider the unintentional effects these messages produce. Finally, we examine the ways in which these messages are discussed and contested by the audiences of the celebrities. We find celebrity Twitter activity re-enacts familiar realities of addiction, realities that collapse drug use with harm and addiction, addiction with pathology and death. Abstinence is posed as the only effective and genuine response, and the contradictions in simultaneously individualizing action against addiction and condemning stigmatization are ignored. Despite the ‘revolutionary’ potential of Twitter posited by advocates and some scholars, when it comes to addiction, it seems, the global, uncensored, ‘free’ communication on Twitter serves largely to validate and perpetuate dominant addiction concepts and the stigma and discrimination these concepts evoke. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The present study explored trends of compositional acceleration in top hit songs as a potential consequence of streaming platforms and digital habits of music consumption. Many media users have been shifting towards ‘Permanently online, permanently connected’ ( Vorderer et al., 2018 ) behaviors and are thus likely to face choice overload in many episodes of music consumption. In turn, the creative audio industries seem to adjust strategically to altered audience demands that platforms can identify in their mass data traces. Extending a study by Léveillé Gauvin (2018) , we investigate five compositorial features (main tempo, time before voice enters, time before title is mentioned, number of words in song title, and song duration) for Billboard top 10 songs (1986 to 2020) and ‘Spotify’ top 10 songs (2016 to 2020). Across features, long-term trends of accelerated composition have mostly continued in recent years, but only weak evidence was secured for a particular booster effect of the competitive ‘Spotify’ ecology on compositorial acceleration. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Most studies approach digital disconnection from an individualistic perspective, while this article explores organised efforts to facilitate digital detox experiences. The aim is to contribute a nuanced understanding of how offline initiatives are framed and the complex relationship between individual and collective action. The study is based on qualitative interviews with ten organisers representing different initiatives and supplementary material from mass and digital media. The analysis shows how actions are triggered by personal experiences and respond to specific concerns within domains such as work and education, tourism and leisure, arts, culture and religion. Yet, the initiatives also invoke overlapping moral evaluations. The study reveals a joint scepticism concerning the lack of industry responsibility and little faith in regulatory solutions to the problem of intrusive media. Furthermore, the study discusses digital detox initiatives as an ambiguous form of contemporary activism, spanning from self-help to corporate action. The initiatives are not connected, but participants perceive their actions as part of an emerging trend. Nevertheless, few initiatives contribute to an interpretation of disconnection initiatives as anything more than unique experiences. The article contributes to the extant literature by showing how the meaning of disconnection evolves both in local settings and in dialogue with broader concerns in the public sphere. </jats:p>",

The concept acknowledges that, at its core, a drive to create and control a sense of place is understood as primary to how social actors identify with each other and express their identities and how communities organize to build more meaningful and connected spaces. This idea runs through the articles in the issue, exploring the many ways people use digital media, under varied conditions, to negotiate differential mobilities and become placemakers – practices that may expose or amplify preexisting inequities, exclusions, or erasures in the ways that certain populations experience digital media in place and placemaking. </jats:p>",

This essay examines the history behind the technological construction of performance, the elements which performances have been divided into, and some of the ways in these divisions redefine what we have traditionally thought of as constituting a performance, which has become in many ways a more collaborative effort instead of the work of an individual 'star' performer. </jats:p>",

In this paper, I want to inquire into the relation between intermedia and what has, for some years now, been termed simply ’new media’. While some writers have objected to this term, pointing to the continuities between newer media and earlier media forms, the present context brings other resonances to the fore, including the way in which intermedia forms become ’established’ and familiar. Dick Higgins’ proposal to continually ’follow one’s nose’ out of such established forms ’towards trying the frontiers of this or that’, suggests that intermedia works themselves constitute, at least for a time, new media.~ But what about the reverse scenario: is new media intermedia?",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the potential that community-led digital engagement with heritage holds for stimulating active citizenship through taking responsibility for shared cultural heritage and for fostering long-lasting relationships between local community heritage groups and national museums. Through the lens of a pilot project titled Science Museum: Community-in-Residence, we discovered that – despite working with community groups that were already loyal to and enjoyed existing working ties with the Science Museum in London, United Kingdom – this undertaking proved challenging owing to a range of structural and logistical issues even before the application of digital devices and tools had been considered. These challenges notwithstanding, the pilot found that the creation of time and space for face-to-face dialogue and interactions between the Science Museum and the participating community heritage groups helped to establish the parameters within which digital co-curation can effectively occur. This, in turn, informed the development of a digital prototype with huge potential to enable remote, virtual connectivity to, and interactivity with, conversations about shared heritage. The ultimate goal was twofold: (a) to help facilitate collaborative sense-making of our shared past and (b) to aid the building of sustainable institutional and community/public working ties around emerging affinities, agendas and research questions in relation to public history and heritage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores how non-experts reflect on and come to understand ‘data uses’, a phrase we used to refer to data collection, analysis and sharing. In recent years, research into what people think and feel about data uses has proliferated, whereas this paper focuses on how they do their thinking and feeling. We argue that imagining – that is, building or creating a mental image of something that is not present – is an important aspect of reflecting on data uses. We challenge the proposition that imagining takes place when there is a gap in knowledge or a lack of information, arguing instead that imagining plays an agentic role in reflection, enabling critical questioning of data uses. We draw on qualitative research carried out in the UK, in which we provided information about specific public sector data uses and asked participants how they felt about them. We found that imaginings, or ‘what ifs’, exist in a complex entanglement with different knowledges, including experiential knowledge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Gaming livestreams have seen unprecedented growth on platforms such as Twitch.tv and YouTube Live, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined fans’ motivations for watching and supporting their favorite streamers. The results of an online survey showed that the time spent watching livestreams was positively associated with the degree of parasocial affinity they feel toward that streamer. Parasocial affinity strength was, in turn, a significant predictor of the likelihood of sending virtual gifts or donations to streamers. Some gender differences in motivations also emerged. Women reported being more likely to watch a particular gaming stream because of the streamer’s characteristics rather than the game being played, while men were equally likely to watch because of the streamer or because of the game being played. </jats:p>",

This content strategy of customisation falls in line with other content strategies from Netflix’s past and is reflective of the increased personalisation of the consumer experience in the age of digital distribution. A pilot survey of Netflix user thumbnails gathers an initial set of data on the breadth of thumbnail personalisation on Netflix, and reflects on the ways that thumbnails, understood as paratexts, can demonstrate divergent content appeals to users, broadening the available ways to understand film and television texts and platforms themselves. This research centres the role of the thumbnail as a paratext that frames understanding of content and the broader platform, and in doing so visualises and humanises a vital aspect of algorithmic culture. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "writing and producing the new news. Our newspapers and broadcasters do also employ a sprinkling of natives but mostly they are still at school or university, or lying on their beds playing with their PSPs. As they take over the development and analysis of contemporary news media from the immigrants we will begin to see web-natural media forms, of which the blog may be a forerunner, displace the clunky hybrids that we have imposed on the new media, and the rate of change become exponential. The distinction also allows us to place those tiresome new media/old media debates into context. Allan frames the development of online news with a pair of tipping points; the appearance of blogging and citizen journalism in the first part of the present decade, followed by Rupert Murdoch’s decision to take News Corporation online in 2005. In the first four chapters Allan outlines the sheer weight of the logic that forced News Corporation, possibly the last and largest corporate internet agnostic of the late-1990s, online. Joining the dots between the significant news events of the 1990s, such as the Oklahoma City bombing (1995) and the death of Princess Diana (1997), he maps the move from the Usenet newsgroups that preceded the web to the early adopters like Time magazine and the Guardian as well as journalism’s mavericks such as Matt Drudge. He foregrounds the importance of BBC News Online in defining the conventions for the emerging online journalism. By the end of the book, however, when it has become clear that we are no longer discussing ‘online news’ but news journalism itself, Sir Christopher Bland’s 1997 description of the BBC’s innovatory website as ‘the third broadcast medium’ begins to look decidedly understated. Allan brings together the emergence of blogging and the notion of citizen journalism in the ‘community of interest’ that brought news of the attack on the World Trade Center to the world a bare ten minutes after it had begun. The central chapter of the book describes how online news coped with 9/11 and its aftermath technologically, politically and, in terms of brand ‘new vocabularies for news coverage’, the sheer breadth of its coverage. Culminating in an account of the reporting of the London bombings of July 2005 the final chapters of the book focus on the emergence of the new class of ‘digital citizens’ who document their world with blogs and other forms of online participatory and citizen journalism. While Allan does not necessarily take the debates around contemporary news journalism forward, Online News provides us with an accurate, well articulated and substantiated snapshot (at less than 200 pages it cannot be more) of the state of news journalism in 2006. This will be an invaluable text for undergraduate journalism and media courses.",

Analysing more than a hundred didj-related web sites, and monitoring the exchanges on a didjeridu mailing list, I found that the information could be roughly grouped into three categories: new age/world music pages; didjeridu musicians' forums; and Aboriginal community sites. The information represented three types of cultural exchange that ranged from the appropriation of aspects of Aboriginal culture to provide for an urban primitivism, to the articulation of new cultural meanings through the sharing of Aboriginal musical practices. While the didjeridu network does exhibit the appropriation of Aboriginality to achieve non-Aboriginal goals, it also demonstrates the creation of new cultural practices through the agency of marginalised groups, and the production of new communities through the linkages between music practices and cultural identity. </jats:p>",

However, the embodied, cognitive and affective implications of smartphone-supported fiction reading for leisure (m-reading) have yet to be investigated empirically. Revisiting the theoretical work of digitization scholar Anne Mangen, we argue that the digital reading experience is not only contingent on patterns of embodied reader–device interaction (Mangen, 2008 and later) but also embedded in the immediate environment and broader situational context. We call this the situation constraint. Its application to Mangen’s general framework enables us to identify four novel research areas, wherein m-reading should be investigated with regard to its unique affordances. The areas are reader–device affectivity, situated embodiment, attention training and long-term immersion.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "of retro advertisements, and the combination of storytelling methods and archival research make for a compelling book, accessible to a broad audience. The book fits in a line of literature that describes gender and racial inequality in male-dominated industries (e.g. Abbate, 2012; Evans, 2018; Shetterly, 2017). It addresses a broader problem of societal inequality related to the technology industry and the huge amounts of difficult hidden work (ghost work) that is carried out behind the scenes to maintain the technical architectures. Hicks’ account shows that much of the computing work during the Second World War was carried out by ‘invisible’ women, who worked day and night to keep the machines at Bletchley Park running. Hidden work in the technology sector has not disappeared. Nowadays, the role of content moderators, who carry out psychologically draining work for low pay and lack of job security, is largely overshadowed (Block and Riesewieck, 2018; Gray and Suri, forthcoming). The continuity of this gender (and racial) discrimination, as well as the neglect of hard done labor in the technology industry is problematic. It touches upon the important point that Hicks attempts to make: if the technology sector does not change, it might contribute to its own demise. It is time that technology companies not just sell their utopian ideas of a better future but start with a better and fairer treatment of their workers.",

    "title": "Book Review: A Networked Self and Love",
    "abstract": "In the anthology A Networked Self and Love, Zizi Papacharissi brings together a range of perspectives and essays on the theme of love by drawing on ‘conventional understandings of love’ and exploring how ‘we might evolve out of them’ (p. 9). The book is part of a series of four volumes that develop Papacharissi’s thinking on the different manifestations of the self within networks, which was first explored in her book A Networked Self: Identity, Community and Culture on Social Network Sites, published in 2011. While the first title successfully captured the explosive growth of social networks and the centrality of the self, this new series expands the thematic reach of the original book by including research on platforms, stories and connections; engaging with new discussions on human augmentics, artificial intelligence and sentience; depicting the circle of life that is partially taking place within new digital arenas – and by capturing love. The collection of essays in A Networked Self and Love, goes beyond simplistic interpretations of romantic love and delve into discussions about sentiment, networked acts that help to outgrow traditional conventions that define relationships, and ultimately, about the meaning of love. Introducing the book, Papacharissi guides the reader through the ‘behind-the-scenes’ process of the book, while offering an insightful interpretation of core concepts. For instance, she contextualizes love in relation to the notion of autonomy. In a non-paradoxical way, autonomy is seen not as an alienating factor that creates distance between ourselves and others, but as ‘the ability to attain selffulfillment’ (p. 2). As such, the self is central to Papacharissi’s understanding – it is a prerequisite to be able to love or to be loved – or in the editor’s words ‘while love is communal in nature, it is self-based in its origin’ (p. 10). In a similar way, Papacharissi discusses technology as inherently attached to its maker or user – ‘technology is human and humans are technology’ she writes, emphasizing that ‘we emancipate, we confine, or we create standstills for ourselves through our technologies of being’ (p. 2). Throughout the book, we are witnessing the various stages of love (‘love forms, grows or dissolves’), but also all the stages in between. Right from the start, love is discussed as a polysemic word that attains meaning from its social context. This is also reflected in the fact that the book embraces this multiplicity of meanings and presents a variety of research approaches.

However, as film piracy has retreated from hard copy piracy to online downloading and file sharing, these traditional discourses and framing of piracy have become increasingly redundant. This article examines the work of The Industry Trust responsible for antipiracy campaigns in the United Kingdom, since 2003, and how they have changed the discourse of piracy, reframing the pirate as antisocial miscreant rather than criminal. The article also examines the Trust’s antipiracy campaigns that attempt to make legitimate film texts increasingly more real and add value to counter the effects of the increasingly ephemeral online film download. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Until relatively recently, processes of health application (app) design have been understudied and this has resulted in a lack of critical reflection on app creation, including curtailing opportunities to share insights and possible pitfalls that could inform best practice in the field. In response, this article contributes to a growing body of literature that addresses this lacuna by exploring the experiences of the research and design team that developed a health app for pregnant women attending a large tertiary hospital in South Australia. Our analysis pays particular attention to the designer–researcher–user nexus exhibited in the ‘co-design’ process and in doing so, draws on Rittel’s notion of ‘wicked problems’. Ultimately, we show that app design is a problem-solving process that is reflective of a high degree of sociality, fluidity, accommodations and compromises. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "that dominate conservative approaches to the study of western music. Some of the case studies involve essentialistic readings of meaning. It becomes unclear at times as to whether the phonograph effects discussed manifest the artist’s definitive and/or true intent or whether Katz is simplifying the operation of the texts and the relationship between technology and music for the purposes of his argument. However, if a definition of creativity with a capital ‘C’ is ‘to bring into existence something genuinely new that is valued enough to be added to the culture’ (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997: 25) and a definition of culture involves ‘the ideas, beliefs, values, tastes and norms held by a population at large’ (Sankel and Fuenzalida, 1975) then only a very select number of the musical works or technological developments produced will successfully ‘add something’ to the culture and therefore make it into a book such as this. If the competition between memes, or units of cultural production, is as fierce as the competition between the units of chemical information we call genes (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997: 7), then this book successfully illuminates a form of artistic and technological Darwinism. Csikszentmihalyi noted that in order to survive, cultures must eliminate most of the new ideas their members produce and that for this ‘good reason cultures are conservative’ (1997: 41). Indeed no culture could assimilate all the creative works people produce without dissolving into chaos (1997: 41). No person can afford to pay attention to more than a very small fraction of the old or new artistic products produced and the author of this text is no exception. Therefore, broad in scope and appeal as this volume may be, and despite Katz’s claimed aversion to the ‘great man’ approach to (musical) history, Katz’s argument has not escaped the grasp of this modernist/patriarchal approach.",

Despite studies looking at how algorithmic control manifests on different delivery platforms, there is a dearth of research exploring how delivery platforms communicate their approaches to algorithmic control, what kinds of strategies delivery workers adopt to mitigate algorithmic control, and to what extent information regarding such ‘algoactivistic approaches’ is shared among communities of delivery couriers who in many cases are in direct competition with one another. To that end, two studies are conducted. Study 1 analyses five publicly listed delivery companies’ annual reports ( n = 14), highlighting a lack of transparency on how the platforms’ algorithms function. In Study 2, a netnographic approach is used to conduct interviews ( n = 12) and a qualitative analysis of delivery workers’ online discussion forum posts ( n = 830) on the discussion forum Reddit. Four approaches to mitigating algorithmic control are found, and the way these are shared among couriers is considered. </jats:p>",

The aim, in the first part of the article, is to examine the strategic functions of multi-platform participation for public service broadcasting ( PSB). In order to analyse how programming that has strong associations with the commercial sector is constructed within the context of PSB, the second part presents a case study of the multi-platform format Test the Nation. The article engages with current debates on the role of PSB in a changing technological environment and explores the dilemma faced by public service broadcasters caught between attracting large audiences while also representing an alternative to the commercial channels. The article draws on analysis of institutional documents from the British BBC, the Swedish SVT, the Norwegian NRK and the US PBS. The documents range from official policy documents and mission statements to press releases and homepages, assembled between 2004 and 2006. The document analysis sheds light on the emergence of audience participation as a strategy for institutional legitimacy and platform expansion, as well as a way to develop new sources of revenue. A basic finding is that audience participation is a central strategy in the media companies under scrutiny. The `Reithian trinity', through several decades, has been in a process of redefinition, and the article suggests that public service broadcasting in the digital era may best be described as `entertainment, education and participation'. </jats:p>",

On the one hand, studios seek to create textual novelty by restarting blockbuster franchises through a return to the characters’ origins. On the other hand, studios, hardware manufacturers, and theater owners – often led by technological auteurs such as James Cameron and Peter Jackson – have embraced a strategy of technological novelty by seeking to upgrade the moviegoing experience. Both forms of novelty reinforce each other and, in turn, promote what is described as a new form of storytelling that should be understood as a ‘reboot cinema.’ </jats:p>",

The loss of accessible original artifacts through digitization and micro-filming also lends weight to online acquisition.

Many of the chapters are relevant to current debates about the role of media, the nature of online communication, and the challenges of the knowledge economy. Much of it is informative. But inasmuch as it is an assembly of these arguments, it is a weak concoction. The book purports to explain cognition processes as forms of media change. It doesn’t.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Drawing on focus group data, this article explores the ways in which British and Norwegian viewers constructed the role of media technology in their engagement with TV comedy. Arguing that TV comedy on pre-recorded DVDs tended to have far greater significance for British participants than Norwegian participants, the article maintains that this technology had different sets of cultural meanings in the two national contexts. The discussion examines factors that might contribute to this national difference, and considers how DVD usage may affect audience engagement. While DVDs have been seen to address viewers as fan consumers or collectors, most of these users primarily associated this technology with the convenience of timeshifting. Along with VHS and video files, DVDs were seen to offer viewers greater control over when and how they wanted to engage with TV comedy.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "only be indirectly known – to the imaginary character of the information technologies that mediate between the individual and the world. He elaborates on the individual’s constructed sense of (virtual) reality using Lacan’s distinction between the automaton and tuché: the former being the repetitive order of the signifying system and the pleasure principle and the latter being ‘an encounter with the real that disturbs the functioning of the pleasure principle’ (p. 104). With examples from the Gulf War, South Korean adolescents and their avatars, surfing for pornography and hypertext readers, Nusselder illustrates how the human-computer interface provides the viewer with a ‘twofold relation’ to reality that can both defend against and disclose the real (p. 108). The book’s concluding chapter, ‘Mediated Enjoyment, Enjoyed Media’, begins with the psychoanalytic concepts of fetishism and perversion in order to analyse the pleasures of the interface of the body and the computer terminal. Nusselder is particularly concerned to distinguish Lacan’s theory of the real from Jean Baudrillard’s theory of simulation ‘in which there is no limit to interpretation because there is no real, no leftover or negativity ...’ (p. 134) In contrast he argues that a Lacanian model keeps the subject anchored to an underlying, if inaccessible, reality and therefore can avoid the extremism of both utopian and dystopian theories of virtual reality. More directly than previous chapters, Nusselder also addresses the political implications of virtual reality technologies. However, the recognition that ‘The capitalistic fictional structures are closely connected to media technologies that globalize their messages ...’ (p. 135) is undeveloped and remains subsidiary to the book’s primary focus which is the psychological dynamics of an individual who ‘interfaces’ with his or her computer screen. While Nusselder’s book successfully ‘avoids the danger of getting trapped in a Z̆iz̆ekian reading of Lacanian theory’ (p. 3), it seems less satisfying in other respects. For example, near the end of the second chapter, he refers to Michelle Kendrick who asserts – in a revision of the poststructuralist truism that there is no subject outside of language – ‘there is no subject outside of technology’ (p. 51). Declarations such as this one add to the reader’s sense that not enough has been done to explain how social forces and divisions might affect one’s access to or use of technology. Another example occurs in an aside about feminist critiques of Lacanian theory, which he ignores after characterizing them as mere attempts to dismiss Lacan as one of ‘the ‘‘bad guys’’’ (p. 74). Nevertheless, despite these criticisms, even someone who enjoys getting trapped in Z̆iz̆ek’s reading of Lacanian theory can appreciate what Nusselder’s ‘more systematic’ (p. 3) approach adds to his or her understanding of both Lacan and the new media.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses how European competition law has been applied, particularly with regard to merger control, in relation to the converging markets of media and telecommunications. The imperatives of technological reform, cross-sectoral and platform convergence, trade liberalisation, and the globalisation of communications services have served to establish new strategic alliances, acquisitions and most notably corporate marriages and mergers. Telecommunication companies have metamorphosed from domestically rooted monopoly utilities into national champions in international, even global markets. Moreover, actors from the adjacent sectors - media and computing- have sought alliances with one another and with telecommunication corporations as the new communications markets have continued to converge. Within this context, the European Commission's Competition Directorate has been responsible for applying European Union competition policies and making rulings with regard to a growing number of corporate communications 'convergence' alliances and mergers. This article reviews the factors which have driven European competition policy within the communication sectors, discusses how such policy has been administered with regard to three prominent mergers in converging communication markets, and considers the implications of these particularly high profile merger rulings. It relates the EC's policy responses to the wider questions which competition policy raises regarding information and communications as public or private good and concludes by commenting on the ability of EC competition law alone to address issues of the public good as well as purely economic matters (competition). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Television (TV) audiences are increasingly using portable communication technologies to multitask, look up information online, check social network sites, and comment on the programs being watched. Although multitasking can distract audiences away from the TV content, the use of a second screen in a manner that complements the mass communication content is a unique phenomenon that may lead to positive outcomes. This study, based on survey data collected from a national stratified random sample ( N = 1417), supports a theoretical model linking frequency of complementary simultaneous media use to engagement, which in turn mediates incidental learning. Findings may be useful for mass communication scholars and practitioners seeking to understand the effects of dual electronic media use. </jats:p>",

The distinctiveness of these emergent systems lies in the interactivity and the user-empowerment that such systems provide. Simultaneously with the emergence of electronic systems such as the Internet, there has also appeared a bloc of people whose traditional national identities have been disrupted by the process of migration and immigration. These diasporic communities are increasingly embracing the Internet system to produce a new sense of community where they can textually create images of their own national and tribal communities. This paper examines the uniqueness of the Internet and its structuration, and then demonstrates the ways in which the technological tool is being used to produce specific community images. Illustrations from the national Indian discussion group are used to examine some key aspects of the community building process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article contributes to an emerging field of research on the classification and organisation of film and television on streaming video platforms. While scholarship has begun to grapple with the complexities of the streaming video landscape, critical frameworks have yet to be established for examining issues of LGBTIQA+ inclusion in this context. This article explores questions about what queer media is in the streaming video era and how is this shaped by the information practices of streaming video services. Classification and organisation of titles is a significant factor in the discoverability of content on streaming video platforms. In the context of queer media, classification practices also impact the visibility of marginalised LGBTIQA+ identities, communities, and cultures. Beyond this, the categorisation practices of streaming video providers play a significant role in shaping and communicating cultural values about queer media. From an Australian vantage point, this article maps the contours of queer media in the streaming video environment, focusing on Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) and Broadcast Video on Demand (BVOD) services. By investigating the categories that streaming video providers use to organise and highlight LGBTIQA+ film and television, this article identifies how queer media is defined as a cultural category through use of labels such as ‘pride’, the categories and subcategories that approach queer media as a constellation of niche interests, and an underlying emphasis on ‘good’ characters and positive LGBTIQA+ narratives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A ‘shreds’ video combines existing live music concert footage, predominantly including a famous male rock guitarist or guitar based rock group, with a self-produced overdubbed soundtrack. The result is a musical parody that exists in an intersection between production and consumption and works as a within-genre evolution. The shred is controversial and its most popular instalments have been pulled from YouTube on claims of copyright infringement. This paper examines shreds as a form of multimodal intertextual critique by engaging with the videos themselves, as well as audience responses to them. As such, the applied method is genre analysis and multimodal semiotics geared towards the analysis of intertextual elements. The paper shows how prodused parody exists as a co-dependence between: (1) production and consumption; (2) homage and subversion; (3) comprehension and miscomprehension; and (4) media synchronicity and socioeconomic dis/harmony. The paper also discusses how shreds can be interpreted as tampered-with gender performances. In conclusion, it becomes clear that the produsage of shred videos is part of ‘piracy culture’ because it so carefully balances between the mainstream and counter-culture, between the legal and the illegal, and between the commoditized artefact and networked production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores recent problems with premium rate number service (PRS) use in UK participation TV, utilizing a regulatory convergence analytical framework. In 2003, the UK government created the communications convergence regulator, Ofcom, yet PRS regulation continued to remain the responsibility of PhonepayPlus (PPP), originally established in 1986. The article argues that Ofcom could have anticipated the problem concerning TV phone-ins, or at least reacted to adverse developments more quickly. PPP was unable to achieve this because of its regulatory culture and narrower focus. The consequences of the PRS saga have been significant. Damage to the reputation of the PRS business and commercial broadcasters has occurred. Citizen trust in public service broadcasting has been eroded. Regulatory remedies provided by Ofcom and PPP are likely to minimize future system abuses. However, that all PRS-in-TV regulatory activity has not been completely subsumed into Ofcom’s operational structure remains an operational anomaly. </jats:p>",

Convergence offers news organizations opportunities for changed writing styles that may foster more transparency, especially as they embrace video storytelling. This project used two experiments to investigate the impact of transparent language on the way online news consumers perceive the credibility of video news reports. The study operationalized transparency in narrative as the use of first-person statements and references to the newsgathering process. Subjects noticed transparency statements but this had no significant effect on their assessment of the credibility of a story or reporter.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Faced with offline discrimination, LGBTQIA+ users frequently turn to social media to find role models, build social networks and test out new forms of self-expression. Each platform has its own affordances and governance processes which can, in turn, facilitate or impede self-expression and community growth. Through a survey of 120 LGBTQIA+ participants, this paper considers which social media affordances facilitate the creation and development of LGBTQIA+ identities, support online and offline community formation and peer-to-peer learning, whilst limiting opportunities for online abuse. While previous research has so far largely focused on younger LGBTQIA+ users' experiences on SM, we found that broadening our sample to include older participants can lead to novel reflections on platforms' potential and/or challenges towards expressing one’s queerness online. For example, while users young and old found the visibility of other LGBTQIA+ accounts inspiring, entertaining and reassuring, particularly within previously stigmatised expressions of bisexuality, we found that older participants preferred to be selective about their outness, or sometimes to not be out at all, not simply for fear of harassment or context collapse, but also because of historical factors around family and friend relationships or because their identity experimentation had already happened offline. We also identified contrasting views about outness and the use and visibility of pronouns, reminding us that the online LGBTQIA+ community is not a monolith in its beliefs and practices, particularly when different life stages are considered. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Much has been written about how digital technologies transformed contemporary festivals, yet the festival participants’ perceptions and experiences are less examined. Understanding mediated festivals as events of intertwined mediation processes, this paper explores the perception and practices of mediated festivals in contemporary China. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 Chinese young people to understand their motivations and experiences of festival participation. The paper finds that emerging mediated festivals provide a space for individuals to explore their interests. Further, mediated festivals are perceived as a liberating force for young people through choice-making and self-presentation in convivial and hybrid festival environments. Developing Dayan and Katz’s conception of ‘media events’, we argue that contemporary Chinese mediated festivals can be understood as ‘my events’ through hybrid and networked self-representations. Our study contributes to understanding the Chinese mediated festivals, emphasizing how networked individuals (re)negotiate the festival production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media is now used as an information source in many different contexts. For professional journalists, the use of social media for news production creates new challenges for the verification process. This article describes the development and evaluation of the ‘Truthmeter’ – a tool that automatically scores the journalistic credibility of social media contributors in order to inform overall credibility assessments. The Truthmeter was evaluated using a three-stage process that used both qualitative and quantitative methods, consisting of (1) obtaining a ground truth, (2) building a description of existing practices and (3) calibration, modification and testing. As a result of the evaluation process, which could be generalized and applied in other contexts, the Truthmeter produced credibility scores that were closely aligned with those of trainee journalists. Substantively, the evaluation also highlighted the importance of ‘relational’ credibility assessments, where credibility may be attributed based on networked connections to other credible contributors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Literary festivals throughout the English-speaking world have been enthusiastic adopters of digital technology: uploading podcasts of author talks, posting videos of panel sessions to video-sharing sites such as YouTube, inviting guest bloggers to comment on proceedings and encouraging live-tweeting as a means of reinforcing audience members’ participatory agency. Such innovations serve to expand festivals’ reach to encompass dispersed audiences and, moreover, increase the longevity of previously transient events. They hence provide evidence to justify writers’ festivals’ claims on public funding as well as to delineate vibrant online and offline bookish communities of interest. However, wholesale uptake of digital technology destabilizes some previous givens of the literary festival as they have coalesced since the phenomenon’s 1980s efflorescence. The concept of authorship undergoes profound changes in a climate of online performativity, constant availability to readerships and digitally diminished ‘aura’. Equally, previously passive audiences are reconceptualized as amateur critics, co-publicists and even co-publishers in the case of crowdsourced subscription publishing. Festival programming may be sampled live or archived, and audiences are only partially tethered to a particular geographical location – a disarticulation taken to another level by emerging online-only writers’ festivals such as the #TwitterFiction Festival and the Digital Writers’ Festival. What are the implications of these shifts for our conceptualization of 21st-century literary community? This article seeks to address this question by proposing a theoretical framework for examining the digital/literary festival interface, analyzing a wide range of terrestrial and online-only festivals and underpinning this analysis with empirical audience interviewing conducted at multiple Australian and UK writers’ festivals and book towns. In bringing together these strands, the article presents a detailed picture of an important and currently underexplored dimension of the public encounter with literature at a moment of profound digital change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the accelerated growth of the sim racing industry over the last few years, research on the phenomenon has started to emerge. Nonetheless, the history of sim racing remains unmapped. This study aims to fill the gap by investigating the development in sim racing in Europe and in Asia-Pacific between 1997 and 2021. Twenty four semi-structured interviews were carried out with experts representing sim racing associations, event organizers, and teams from Europe and Asia-Pacific. Data were analyzed using an inductive-deductive codebook approach. The results show the evolution of sim racing throughout five sociohistorical stages, which demonstrate how sim racing emerged as a hybrid of esports and motorsports and has kept evolving since ‘in-between’ their respective actors until today. The findings suggest that the slow evolution of sim racing has been particularly dependent on networked sociocultural actors, while positively affected by uncontrollable events like the COVID-19 pandemic. As a key implication, we find that the history of sim racing differs from that of esports by its multifaceted dependence on the motorsports ecosystem. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / This article examines economic aspects of convergence and of multi-platform expansion in the media sector. Focusing on television broadcasters in the UK, it analyses the recent migration of conventional media towards multi-platform strategies and asks whether digitization is making content delivery more resource—intensive than before or whether it is facilitating greater efficiency. Findings suggest that adaptation to a multi-platform outlook on the part of conventional media requires investment in staffing and re-versioning of content. Funding this, especially in a period of economic downturn, has encouraged a more selective approach towards content, with concomitant implications for diversity. Notwithstanding generally low commercial returns from online activities so far, the potential economic advantages to be had from multi-platform are significant. The experience of UK broadcasters suggests a well-executed ‘360-degree’ approach to commissioning and distribution will increase the value that can be realized from any given universe of content, partly because of extended opportunities for consumption of that content, but also because modes of engagement in a digital multi-platform context allow for an improved audience experience and for better signalling of audience preferences back to suppliers. </jats:p>",

A veteran journalistic tool, and an increasingly popular one in digital politics, visualizations offer informative value, attract readership, and increase engagement. Visualizations’ multimodality enables them to convey rhetoric through informative, narrative and visual strategies, making them particularly well-suited for future-oriented discourse. Despite the rise of visualization-focused scholarly work over the past decade, several analytical lacunas remain, due to visualizations’ multimodal nature and their rich array of actors, contexts and usages in the digital world. Specifically, no scholarly approach examines forward-looking visualizations comprehensively, addressing the ways in which their rhetorical layers coalesce to broker knowledge in multimodal predictive discourse. To fill this gap, our paper proposes a holistic framework for their analysis, addressing knowledge-brokering functions, predictive components, and rhetorical strategies. Thus, we ask, ‘How are predictive visualizations rhetorically constructed to mediate the future?’ and answer through conceptualization complemented by qualitative analysis of predictive pandemic visualizations from journalistic and social media. We begin by creating a theoretically informed framework, based on existing perspectives from data-journalism studies, projection studies, and visualization scholarship, which we then refine through analytical workshops and empirical application. Our final analytical framework encapsulates each visualization’s rhetorical strategies, its knowledge-brokering functions, predictive structure, and their interrelations, highlighting the division of rhetorical and predictive labor across each visualization’s components. We conclude with an analytical epilogue in which we demonstrate the usefulness of this framework in holistically analyzing predictive multimodal rhetoric by revisiting the elusive concept of rhetorical complexity in predictive visualizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept warm experts originally referred to people who helped their friends and family to come to terms with home-based computers and Internet connections. As digital technologies have continuously come to permeate our everyday lives, the tasks for warm experts have grown in kinds and character. The present study contributes to our understanding of warm experts by exploring the learning process involving the warm expert and the less knowledgeable other(s). Drawing on interviews with older adults (70 to 94 years of age), the study specifically explores older users’ experiences of learning about digital media with children and grandchildren. The results reveal how interaction with warm experts constituted important learning opportunities for the older adults, in which they developed their skills in using digital media. However, establishing potential learning situations and learning from warm experts was not a straightforward matter, but surrounded by a multitude of barriers structuring the possibilities for learning. This shows how the role of the warm expert is fluid and materializes in different ways in different situations. The warm expert can take the position (or be positioned) as one who solves technical issues. The warm expert can be one who fails in teaching, or one who adopts the position as a warm teacher and contributes to learning among the less knowledgeable user. In order to also be a warm teacher, the warm expert needs to understand the specific learning needs and styles of the less knowledgeable other and adapt to these needs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses the role of facework in the discourse of confessional YouTube videos by female fashion and beauty content creators, where they disclose personal problems, and offer viewers advice. It uses thematic analysis to identify discursive tactics that protect viewers’ face. The article argues that the parasocial nature of the connection that these videos attempt to establish with an audience that content creators know little about makes it important for them to reflexively adapt to these viewers’ needs for fellowship and autonomy. Their disclosures may be intended to create closeness, but at the same time they need to cater for distance and prepare the ground for this content to be received as well as possible. However, just like the connection that the videos seek to establish, the facework they contain is also parasocially situated: the videos speak to an imagined viewer’s need for inclusion and this viewer’s possible objections, as these are perceived by the content creator. The article contributes to a better understanding of the construction of closeness in this genre of mediated discourse. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article assesses the strategies of BBC News as it repositions itself for the digital future, explores how impartiality is being redefined, evaluates the impact of technology-led strategies on newsgathering and notes the tensions between rival forces inside the BBC. The corporation is engaged in an internal upheaval of seismic proportions, as technological change accelerates and the largest ever round of job losses threatens. There is a titanic struggle between the technologists — who have been rebranded as über-divisional force Future Media and Technology — and the programme makers, who feel their role and resources have been cut to make way for the new platforms. In the FMT corner, its director Ashley Highfield is making apocalyptic announcements, characterized by BBC house newspaper Ariel as `Get web savvy or we die', while programme executives are saying that the BBC needs to recognize and protect its core strengths in content provision, not pretend it can compete with the cyber-cities of Google and co. It's not future technology, it's here and now, they say, but it should not be allowed to override the values and objectives of their public service remit. This article is based on research carried out for the `Spaces of the News' research project, one of five strands of the Goldsmiths Media Research Programme, Spaces, Connectivity and Control , funded by the Leverhulme Trust, which is designed to evaluate the social impact of changes in communication technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The e-book has gained a large number of readers in many countries. However, the growth rate, as well as the market penetration of e-books, varies considerably between countries and language areas. In the United States and other English-speaking countries, the use of e-books is more widespread than in many European countries, such as Sweden. In both the United States and Swedish markets, the growth rate has slowed down during the latest 2 years, and the majority of readers still seem to prefer printed books. This article aims to reveal the relationship between attitudes and use of e-books and to contextualize this in relation to socio-demographic background, library use and reading habits. The results, based on national, representative surveys in Sweden during 2013 and 2014, show that people’s attitudes are a significant and important factor for the choice of e-books instead of print, but this is probably a two-way relationship. It is also evident that e-books serve a complementary rather than displacement function in relation to print. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Major changes to home life and work practices globally have been brought about by the COVID-19 crisis. Periods of strict restrictions placed on people’s movements outside their homes, aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus, have meant that the home was requisitioned as a primary site for work for many people. In this article, we draw on case studies from an ethnographic project that explored how people living in Sydney use digital technologies in the home setting. Our fieldwork commenced in early 2020, just prior to the national COVID lockdown period in Australia, and continued throughout the lockdown and the months following. As a result, we were able to document people’s experiences of transitioning to working from home during the first year of the pandemic. In this article, we adopt a sociomaterial approach together with domestication theory to analyse the complexities of the changed COVID home in the context of digitised working arrangements. We surface and theorise the tensions and leaky boundaries between workplaces and family/domestic life that are brought about by, through and beyond the digital. By addressing the sociomaterial choreographies and modalities of presence involved, we attempt to capture the processes through which the COVID digital home assemblage is continuously configured and the more or less simultaneous presence and absence of people in both domestic and work domains. </jats:p>",

Places are unique sets of trajectories – each with a story – coming into contact. However, just as much as places are defined by their histories, they are also shaped by the histories that are forgotten, or far too often, actively suppressed through dominant narratives. After all, dominant media of spatial, public memory – for example, plaques and public monuments – often reproduce dominant narratives of a place, narratives created by the powerful. This project examines how digital placemaking can be deployed through locative technologies to push back on dominant spatial narratives and make places more polyvocal in consequential ways. In particular, through a project at Clemson University, we examine how locative storytelling applications can help students intervene in traditional narratives of place to engage with social justice and alternative histories. </jats:p>",

Moneyball also proffers a view of analytics as Platonic knowledge, functioning ideologically alongside nerd archetypes and buddy-comedy conventions. The resultant duality between the Platonic and embodied, innervated by relations between visibility and invisibility, typifies the way people relate to Big Data and to the institutions that govern our digital lives in algorithmic culture. Moneyball performs cultural work by encouraging us to embrace data science while remaining alienated from technology and deferential to experts. Calls for technological literacy in the age of Big Data cannot underestimate the importance of cultural literacy. </jats:p>",

Findings indicate that the perceptions of media’s significance and roles varied greatly. While Techies attributed a significant role to the Internet, Activists and Journalists placed greater emphasis on the enduring dominance of mainstream media. In addition, interviewees argued that the Internet, particularly Facebook, has a greater added value in supporting protests associated with peripheral than central regions. Finally, most interviewees argued that the Internet, particularly Facebook, was highly significant to the success of the protest in its early stages, but mainstream media coverage is necessary for achieving wider public recognition and legitimacy in subsequent stages. </jats:p>",

Applying Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach to communications, we argue that communicating is a capability required to realize such functionings as participating in political, cultural, social, educational, and commercial life and is essential to promote belonging to a collective. The ‘negative’ right to free speech should be replaced by a positive right to communicate, which should include free speech, access to information, privacy, and utilization of communications in order to belong to a community. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Whilst social media like Twitter and Facebook carry with them the potential for the practice of journalism, novelties like these are also associated with adaptation difficulties – perhaps especially when it comes to the interactive capabilities that services like these afford. This study employs a multi-method approach to study the different uses of Twitter and Facebook by one media company – the Swedish public service broadcaster (PSB) Sveriges Television – during the 2014 election year. Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data, we find that Twitter was used more extensively and in a comparably more interactive fashion than Facebook. Hence we suggest Twitter, used more for interaction, functions as a ‘chat room’; whilst Facebook, used more for broadcasting messages, can be viewed as functioning like a ‘showroom’. As Twitter is often associated with societal elites in the Swedish context, it raises a question about the suitability for a PSB to engage to such a degree on this particular platform. </jats:p>",

Certainly, this proposition is supported by the substantial levels of complaint that can be found across thousands of online fan message boards. We argue that these complaints embrace online comment and activism as a continuation of football’s traditional culture of communicative exchange between supporters. Yet, online football fan discussion also presents a contradiction, relying upon the same media networks against which fans rail for commodifying ‘the people’s game’. Using cultivation analysis, the case presented is based upon a study of ‘FreeMyFC’ (FMFC), a website ostensibly started to expose the failures of ‘MyFootballClub’ (MFC), the world’s first attempt to manage a football club through a supporter funded and managed website. </jats:p>",

This article uses two case studies, Tenner Films and The Hunt for Gollum, to argue that opinion leaders are intermediaries who play a vital role in do-it-yourself audience building for independent films in today’s Internet age. The article concludes that (1) the Internet has increased the number of potential and accessible opinion leaders, (2) online opinion leaders have potentially bigger audiences than their offline counterparts, (3) new opinion leaders have emerged, (4) opinion leaders act as multipliers and (5) non-experts can be opinion leaders too. (6) The Internet allows cultural producers to reach different opinion leaders through a single medium and while (7) different opinion leaders come with different audience sizes, (8) they all continue to function as taste guides. Finally, (9) the Internet makes it easier for independent film-makers to nurture personal audiences and therefore, partially replace opinion leaders by becoming opinion leaders themselves. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital images rely on the fineness of pixels to create an illusion of pictorial reality, with individual ‘picture elements’ sacrificing themselves in service of the overall image. The elemental binary code underlying digital pictures has its parallel in human genetic code: bits of information are stored in the DNA, itself consisting of binary chemical relationships. The nature of human identity - as translated by artistic representations of the face - is emerging from this intersection. The mapping of the human genome has had implications for socio-cultural constructions of identity, especially for race and hereditary characteristics. This paper examines three artists whose creative inquiry addresses the human face and its relationship to digitisation, identity and genetic code: painter Chuck Close, Photomosaics<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> software inventor Rob Silvers, and photographer Nancy Burson. Their varying imaging strategies all employ micro and macro relationships, yet each offers different models for representing human identity. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Camera Phantasma: Reframing virtual photographies in the age of AI",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent advent of virtual photography and artificial intelligence (specifically AI photography and diffusion models), presents a major challenge to both photographers and photography theory. All our common-sense assumptions about the ontology of the image now seem to be falling apart. Are these interlopers really photography? Can we hear the final death knell for the erstwhile medium in this era of ever-increasing media convergence and virtualisation? This practice-led investigation of these new media forms draws on the author’s recent creative work in virtual photographies, and similar interventions by other photographers and new media artists, seeking to augment and expand their practice using these new tools, whilst querying what photography really means today. From in-game photography to virtual exploration using Google Street View, to AI photography using the latest denoising diffusion models (such as Midjourney), there are surprising commonalities to explore between them, linking these new practices of image-making firmly back to traditions of lens-based photography. Rather than seeking a detailed map of this difficult new terrain, or a definitive ontology of emerging virtual photographies, the author reframes the discourse around practice, examining both photography as an evolving set of practices and also notions of media hauntology – specifically the spectral ways in which new media technologies are always haunted by prior practices and modes of communication. The importance of the frame to both traditional photography and new practices of virtual photography, is suggested as a vital and persistent dimension in photographic authorship. With that authorship increasingly contested by new generative methods, easy appropriation and AI image-making, the act of framing may become the best litmus test we have, for whether or not a photograph should be considered ‘real’ or valued. </jats:p>",

However, users develop their own interpretations of these properties as well as unique ways to engage with the platform. This study applies a critical realist framework to explore how reflexivity modes are practiced in the context of Spotify as an example of algorithmic recommendation systems. From this perspective, reflexivity is a person’s capacity to reflect on their contexts, data, previous experiences, and knowledge, among other elements, before deciding how to act. Findings from interviews with Spotify users suggest that participants practice multiple reflexivity modes when interpreting Spotify’s recommendations and deciding what to listen to. These modes depend on each participant’s concerns and algorithmic knowledge. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Danger! Retro-Affectivity!",
    "abstract": "Invented in 1917, the theremin was one of the first musical synthesisers to be used in public performance. Largely forgotten in the 1980s, its ’lost history’ was re-examined by Steven Martin’s acclaimed documentary Theremin An Electronic Odyssey (USA 1993). The success of the film, and the re-emergence of the theremin onto the retail market, has stimulated a revival of interest in the instrument. This article examines aspects of the theremin’s history, its sonic affectivity and the manner in which it has, through its various uses in music production and cinema soundtrack, become a shifting signifier of modernity, futurism, other-worldliness and, more latterly, a nostalgia for such concepts and perceptions. Introduction I will begin with two contemporary instances: 1997 (a) Dinosaur Jnr’s single Take a Run at the Sun. An acappella introduction, then an electric guitar riff starts and bass and drums kick in, creating a breezy, 1960s instrumental feel, and then, ’Whoo-OooOoo-Ooo’, the distinctive voice of the theremin singing (a variation on) the instrument’s best known melodic motif. Instant reference, instant retro 1969 and the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations single, the theremin interplaying with the cello line that literally audio-ises Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys’ harmonising of the chorus: ’I’m picking up good vibrationsjl’m giving her excitations’ providing a (disconcertingly virtuoso) extension of the (human) vocal arrangement. 1997 (b) The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion are playing on-stage at Selinas nightclub in Sydney, Australia. A crowded gig, with an enthusiastic audience. The American ’punk-blues/] band move into another energetic number. Spencer puts his bass guitar down, moves to a table, waves his hands in the air and the theremin adds its distinctive wail to the anarchic blues-thrash music echoing round the venue. What is significant about both these instances is that the respective band’s uses of the theremin are self-consciously referential, aware of, and literally playing-off, the history of a once obscure instrument now returned to the frontline of rock instrumentation by the cognoscenti of an informed and musically articulate bloc of rock artists. In this context, the history of the theremin is part of a legacy accessible to contemporary musicians, much as the Blues heritage (whose traditions are themselves",

    "title": "Sculpting digital voids: The politics of forgetting on Facebook",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In an age where modes of storing and retaining data have become a ubiquitous presence in society, the issue of forgetting is becoming increasingly problematic. This piece figures as a theoretical contribution to the issue of forgetting in relation to social media platforms by looking at the Facebook memory app, Year in Review. Drawing on Terry Eagleton’s notion of ‘sculpting voids’, it explores the conceptual implications of digital archiving on memory, forgetting and, ultimately, the self. I argue that there is an emerging politics of forgetting and invisibility on Facebook, exploring the Eric Meyer incident on Year in Review in 2014. This incident resulted in Facebook seeking to automatically and algorithmically prevent media traces that might evoke painful memories of deceased family members and ex-partners from resurfacing on users’ yearly Year in Review videos. This practice of sculpting digital voids is conceptualized as an algorithmic mode of classification, a way of sorting people’s media objects such as photos on Facebook depending on the inferred emotional response these memory traces will elicit. Because of their ‘imagined’ nature and generative force, these practices need to be understood in relation to power. Sculpting digital voids, therefore, figures as a critical and conceptual framework for better understanding of how (in)visibilities and power relations are shaped on social media platforms. </jats:p>",

In scrutinising a variety of player-produced texts including walkthroughs, fan art, fiction, 'theorising', Frequently Asked Questions lists (FAQs), and even fan-games, the article seeks not only to highlight the creativity and vibrancy of the participatory culture of videogame fandom but also to examine the ways in which production of such texts and the ensuing discussion and debate are used by players to generate and communicate their identity within the community of 'hardcore' game fans (often known as otaku) and modify the terms of engagement with the game. In this way, the paper interrogates player-produced texts as examples of the involvement and activity of players in the construction of videogames' meaning and as a means of problematising discussions of the pleasures of gameplay. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Information Privacy and Mobile Phones",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Renewed concerns about information privacy and mobile phones have surfaced with the early deployment of location-based services in North America, and specifically with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) led public safety initiative known as Wireless E9-1-1. Initial scholarly research in this area has focussed on the use and disclosure of geographic location information of mobile phone subscribers and on the terms and conditions by which this information can be made available for lawful access or commercial purposes. This paper refers to this body of research as the 'first domain' of information privacy research, and describes some of the key findings and contributions for policy research on customer proprietary information and customer consent. The paper then turns to introduce and describe an emerging 'second domain' of information privacy concerned with the popular adoption of anonymous prepaid mobile phone services. The distinguishing characteristic of this second domain of research is its focus on debates about the legitimacy of regulatory requirements to collect and verify customer details at the point of purchase. This paper draws on findings from an empirical study undertaken in Canada to identify some initial parameters of this second domain of information privacy research with the intent of informing a wider debate about the entitlement to anonymity for customers who elect to use prepaid services over commercial networks. </jats:p>",

Editing a theme issue of a journal is an activity that involves several tasks. The first is the selection of theme and the successful ’selling’ of this to the editors. This basically involves convincing the editors that the theme issue will be of relevance and interest and that the proposer can deliver on the project. Once this stage is completed, the next is formulating a call for papers and assessing and replying to the responses. The responses are significant in that they substantially dictate the content of the issue of the journal that eventuates. One particular aspect of responses to this issue’s call for papers, for instance, narrowed the focus from its originally advertised brief. I had originally called for submissions on aspects of sexuality with regard to both the internet and virtual reality technologies. There were zero responses on the latter.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the high-profile film repatriation projects between such organizations as the US Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Film and Sound Archive in Australia, and the New Zealand Film Archive. Heralded for bringing ‘home’ the so-called lost films, repatriation projects capture public imagination and prove vital in galvanizing the much needed press interest in the media preservation movement. National film archives, however, continue to pursue traditional modes of repatriating film material, spending thousands of dollars to ship nitrate film prints to underfunded and overwhelmed US media repositories, and perpetuating the dominance of the nation-state in preservation discourse. This article challenges the long-standing, celluloid-focused approach by providing an overview of media repatriation practice and policy, contemporary analysis of cultural property theory and law, and offering a pragmatic suggestion for digital repatriation models that can empower a greater number of regional participants. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In March of this year the refurbished Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle hosted an industry symposium entitled ‘Clicks or Mortar?’ which explored the relationship between digital (and hence virtual) media and the physical spaces where we have traditionally enacted our public culture – such as galleries, cinemas, theatres and so on. In the course of the first session – ‘Being: The role of bricks in an age of clicks’ – Eddie Berg, Artistic Director of the British Film Institute’s Southbank complex in London, argued that the massive growth in online cultural activity has necessitated the development of ‘attention grabbing’ activities. This is of course absolutely true – as cultural producers know only too well, one has to be ever more imaginative to get work seen or heard among the plethora of competing online voices. However, it is also nothing new – we used to call it ‘marketing and promotion’. As with any new medium, we have been at pains to try and identify its essential characteristics – just as the early Soviet filmmakers did with the filmic medium. Yet, if anything, much of the work that Convergence has published over the last 15 years has highlighted the fact that in some cases what we thought was ‘new’ about digital technology actually involves things we had already been doing via earlier media technologies. The technology, together with the speed, ease and reach of communication it has facilitated, is new, but often the kinds of activities we engage in are not. Our second issue of Convergence, back in 1995, focused on the notion of interactivity, and even then we observed:",

Contrary to this, I argue that hypertext is first and foremost a visual, graphical medium. It is a way of spatialising ideas into discrete units which might be grasped by the mind and efficiently retrieved along lines of connections: association. This technique has a long history. There is a strange continuity in metaphor between early associationist models of memory, classical Greek systems of place-memory loci, sixteenth and seventeenth century philosophies of memory retrieval and the history of hypertext.

    "abstract": "poetic essay on humming, by anthropologist Michael Taussig. Neumark offers an essay on ‘Performativity and the Voice’, preparing the ground for an essay by Isabelle Arvers that comes later in the book and is concerned with Machinima, ‘a technique of making films inside virtual realities’ (H Hancock, quoted by Arvers, p. 225). Machinima is a genre largely unknown to the wider public, as it is perhaps to many media theorists; but its inclusion in this book is a perfect example of how it succeeds in taking the raw, speaking and singing voice of our past, to transfer it through telephone wires, radio receivers and cinema screens, on to electronic keyboards, iPods and the internet. Arvers, at the start of her essay, quotes Justin Hall, in what could represent the essence of this book: ‘A videogame is a means by which we learn to control the 21st century’ (p. 225). In the same way, this edited collection brings the concept of the voice into 21st-century media aesthetics and opens up a conversation about the role of sound and its importance in the new media, digital environment. Radio is an area that could perhaps have been given a little more space, since it is still a developing medium and there is a lack of new essays on the radio voice. However, there is an interesting essay by Virginia Madsen and John Potts on ‘The Distribution of the Voice via Podcasting’ that draws upon radio theory. Indeed this book comes as a breath of fresh air in a field where the sonic element is often forgotten and overshadowed by the image. However, it also adds to a recently growing trend of understanding and shedding light on the acoustic element of mediated aesthetics and, even more importantly, of digital aesthetics. The content of this work ranges from the clearly academic to the poetic, with the two also charmingly merging in some of the essays. The editors have managed to marry the words of academics and artists in a coherent way that gives a vivid account of the current theories on the aesthetics of contemporary digital culture and positions the voice within it in revealing ways. Given the diversity of the contributors, their style of writing, and the range of subjects covered, this book could appeal to both an academic readership, as well as artists interested in the voice, sonic arts and digital media aesthetics. The academic appeal covers new media as well as traditional media (although admittedly, mainstream media scholars might find the book’s philosophical tone less interesting) and could also be of interest to contemporary arts scholars. Because of the modern tone of the book, one might say that it could also perhaps cross over to the popular culture readership and attract the attention of a non-academic but art loving, technology aware audience.",

    "title": "DVD, Video and Reaching Audiences",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of the internet (as a means of marketing and selling) and DVD (as a delivery medium) has revitalized interest in selling/delivering ‘alternative’ moving image work direct to the public. The potential these avenues offer for reaching wider audiences are proving particularly attractive in the light of the recent UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity. However, similar initiatives were undertaken when VHS took off as a mass delivery medium in the 1980s. This article examines some of the attempts to embrace the video sell-through market in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s as a way of getting artists’/independent moving-image work to a wider public. However, these attempts met with mixed results. The reasons for this are discussed, and the article concludes that while digital technology has in some ways made it easier to reach audiences, there are important lessons to be learned from its video precursor, if the potential of DVD and the internet is to be maximized. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at a Chinese Web 2.0 original literature site, Qidian, in order to show the co-evolution of market and non-market initiatives. The analytic framework of social network markets (Potts et al., 2008) is employed to analyse the motivations of publishing original literature works online and to understand the support mechanisms of the site, which encourage readers’ willingness to pay for user-generated content. The co-existence of socio-cultural and commercial economies and their impact on the successful business model of the site are illustrated in this case. This article extends the concept of social network markets by proposing the existence of a ripple effect of social network markets through convergence between fixed and mobile internet, between traditional and internet publishing, and between publishing and other cultural industries. It also examines the side effects of social network markets, and the role of market and non-market strategies in addressing the issues. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the physical world, choices about self-representation are tied to the body. However, avatar embodiment offers users many more options. These options are often constrained or promoted according to the economic models of the platforms that support different virtual worlds. Still, work on user motivations for avatar embodiment has generally not accounted for these constraints. To help explain users' interest (or lack of interest) in immersive technology, we discuss the mismatch between platform intentions and avatar affordances. We describe how user and platform motivations intersect in the ‘embodied identity economy’, a model in which users either ‘pay’ for access to embodied experiences with data from their physical identity or fund economy with cash payments. We present a framework of avatar embodiment using two dimensions: consistency versus discrepancy with the user’s physical identity, and experiential versus identity-based self-presence. We describe three ways in which avatars can be consistent with the user’s physical body: through appearance, through behavior, and the extent to which avatar data is linked with the user’s identity in the physical world. We relate this concept to recent discussions of a proposed ‘metaverse’ as a hub for life online. </jats:p>",

Science fiction films in particular take advantage of new technologies and create new special effects that are incorporated into dystopian views on the relationship between man/woman and machine that fuses to create hybrid characters. The merger of cinema and computer, with its expanded representation of motion and space comparable to virtual reality settings, together with the characterisation of machines as evil, characterise the two dominant strategies of cinema's response to new media. In a discussion of two films which at the time of their respective releases highlighted this double approach - Terminator 2 and The Matrix - I suggest that the struggle about space in both films transgresses the generic tradition of science fiction and responds to general disturbances in the temporal- spatial order in electronic culture. However, where the earlier Terminator 2 offers discourse, the later The Matrix turns entropic and regressive. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this special issue, we turn to ideas of and approaches to critical technical practices (CTPs) as entry points to doing critique and doing things critically in digitally mediated cultures and societies. We explore the pluralisation of ‘critical technical practice’, starting from its early formulations in the context of AI research and development (Agre, 1997a, 1997b) to the many ways in which it has resonated and been taken up by different publications, projects, groups, and communities of practice, and what it has come to mean. Agre defined CTP as a situational, practical, and constructive way of working: ‘a technical practice for which critical reflection upon the practice is part of the practice itself’ (1997a: XII). Communities of practice in which the notion has been adopted, adapted, and put to use range from human–computer interaction (HCI) to media art and pedagogy, from science and technology studies (STS) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to digital humanities, media studies and data studies. This special issue affirms the pluralisation of CTP, and serves as an invitation to (re)consider what it means to use this notion drawing on a wider body of work, including beyond Agre. In this introduction, we review and discuss CTPs according to (1) Agre, (2) indexed research, and (3) contributors to this special issue. We conclude with some questions and considerations for those interested in working with this notion. </jats:p>",

However, describing these limits is difficult if there is no interpretive model that explain the transition between the game and the gamification. This work proposes a systemic game–gamification model to understand the phenomenon of the gamification procedure. This structural-functionalist and systemic model can respond to different fields interested in gamification under the same elements and assume to serve as an interpretation only for this phenomenon’s social reality from the complexity. Some risks of gamification are highlighted, such as isolating and considering only some elements that do not even belong to the game, as is frequently the case with the competition system, an issue that, in analogy with game-sport, becomes sportification. </jats:p>",

What was also interesting was that they were also the most radical and provocative; they refused to subjugate experience to the myth of representation and were able to engage the attention of a broad constituency of professional and lay interests. In general, however, a bland reiterative complacency permeated much of what Linz and Ars had generously provided the scaffold for. Old works and unreconstructed and badly researched ideas were given more public attention than they deserved. It seemed paradoxical that so much that was on offer at ’Takeover: who’s doing the art of tomorrow’ was so nostalgic and conventional in a venue that had done so much to step out of the shadow of the Austrian petit bourgeois for whom the past is so much more available than the future. Gerfried Stocker reminded us in closing his catalogue notes to this year’s festival that Linz’s civic support for Ars was founded on a declaration ’not to take stock of the past; ... instead to [orientate itselfl to the developments of tomorrow’. If it succeeded in nothing else it followed its mission: for all who visited Ars",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ang Lee’s 2019 film Gemini Man features the most realistic digital human to grace the cinematic screen, specifically a computer-generated version of young Will Smith who battles his more aged self throughout the film. And for the first time in film history, this photorealistic digital human is Black. This essay explores why this groundbreaking achievement has not been acknowledged or celebrated by the film's production or publicity teams. I argue that Will Smith’s particular “post-racial” identity mediates contemporary concerns related to the racialized implications of facial recognition and other digital imaging technologies, as well as to the future of the film industry in the digital age. In the second half of the essay, I examine how the appearance of Will Smith in deepfake parody videos illustrates how race circulates on screens of various media formats. I conclude with a call to use digital visual effects, deepfake tools, and other advanced technologies to further racial justice instead of repeating the problematic usage of the past. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on data generated from an ethnography in a video game studio, this article contributes to research on gender and game work by presenting an analysis of the studio’s ethos and aesthetics. The studio’s employees described the company and the games it made in terms of their charm, and related this explicitly to its ‘diverse’ hiring practices and the company’s identity as ‘indie’. I explore how the notion of charm was applied to a game, a game company, and game developer or employee, by tracing continuities and discontinuities across three types of data: field memos written whilst visiting the studio; conversations with employees; and a game diary based on a play through of one of the studio’s games under development during fieldwork. Drawing on Sontag’s notes on camp, Ngai’s work on cute aesthetics and Born’s research on the institutionalization of aesthetic discourse, I analyse ‘charming’ as a distinct sensibility within contemporary game culture which is symptomatic of the breakdown of straightforward gender binaries and the commercialization of ‘amateur’ or independent game-making. The article builds on existing research about the social significance of aesthetic genres in game culture, notably retrogrames and the appeal of nostalgia in indie games. It also locates games within debates about contemporary aesthetic experiences shaped and sustained by global digital media and their associated production cultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines how socially and culturally ingrained visual semiotic resources are used to demonstrate netizens’ affinities with ‘the people’ and dislikes of ‘the elite’ in expressions of online and bottom-up national populism in China. Using a methodological framework that integrates multimodal discourse analysis with a study of ideology, semiotics, and intertextuality, we study ‘weaponized’ Internet memes that were generated during three Diba Expeditions in 2016, 2018 and 2019. We identify three major social-culturally embedded visual semiotic themes: the Jiong playful style, nostalgia, and the strategic use of colour. These themes reflect the negotiation between populist dynamics, emerging online in China to express dissatisfaction with elites and nationalist appeals which emerge to push back against external ‘threats’. This study enhances our understanding of populist visual mobilization and visual protest by examining the Diaosi self-image constructed by the people in online and bottom-up populism in China. Traditionally, populist discourse has depicted ‘the people’ as pure, hardworking, and morally upright, mediated through the rhetoric of populist leaders and parties in top-down approaches. However, our research reveals a more complex and self-reflective portrayal, where the Diaosi subculture presents ‘the people’ as vulnerable, marginalized, and socio-economically disadvantaged. This self-construction challenges conventional populist narratives and highlights the dynamic and context-specific nature of populist identities.</jats:p>",

However, studies that examine such representations are few, and the present study aims to – through the lens of social representation theory – critically explore how VR technology and the metaverse are discursively represented in Swedish news media. The analysis identifies three underlying themata: (a) The inevitability of technology, (b) The commodification of experience, and (c) The world of male pioneers. It is concluded that the news media’s representation of VR and the metaverse contributes greatly to maintaining the structural status quo. For traditional journalism to fulfill its democratic mission, a pervasive update of media logic is needed.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper introduces and contextualises Climate Futures, an experiment in which AI was repurposed as a ‘co-author’ of climate stories and a co-designer of climate-related images that facilitate reflections on present and future(s) of living with climate change. It converses with histories of writing and computation, including surrealistic ‘algorithmic writing’, recombinatory poems and ‘electronic literature’. At the core lies a reflection about how machine learning’s associative, predictive and regenerative capacities can be employed in playful, critical and contemplative goals. Our goal is not automating writing (as in product-oriented applications of AI). Instead, as poet Charles Hartman argues, ‘the question isn’t exactly whether a poet or a computer writes the poem, but what kinds of collaboration might be interesting’ (1996, p. 5). STS scholars critique labs as future-making sites and machine learning modelling practices and, for example, describe them also as fictions. Building on these critiques and in line with ‘critical technical practice’ ( Agre, 1997 ), we embed our critique of ‘making the future’ in how we employ machine learning to design a tool for looking ahead and telling stories on life with climate change. This has involved engaging with climate narratives and machine learning from the critical and practical perspectives of artistic research. We trained machine learning algorithms (i.e. GPT-2 and AttnGAN) using climate fiction novels (as a dataset of cultural imaginaries of the future). We prompted them to produce new climate fiction stories and images, which we edited to create a tarot-like deck and a story-book, thus also playfully engaging with machine learning’s predictive associations. The tarot deck is designed to facilitate conversations about climate change. How to imagine the future beyond scenarios of resilience and the dystopian?

    "title": "Interactive documentary and the reinvention of digital journalism, 2015–2020",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Interactive documentary (i-docs), an innovative hybrid form at the intersection of film, journalism, and digital games, has matured beyond its first wave of experimentation, gaining distinction among the most highly evolved immersive media of the twenty-first century. The latest generation of i-docs is currently winning accolades at both major film festivals and game design summits. This study charts the evolutionary trajectory of North America’s most recent and influential wave of i-docs in works mostly appearing since 2015. It culturally situates i-docs as immersive media that extend experimentation with narrative journalism into the realm of fine art and social activism. Building on the foundation of activist, highly empathic news experiences established in the early 2010s, the most recent advances in i-docs range from live action VR to animated digital games. Such works include the Canadian National Film Board’s 2018 AR (augmented reality) experience East of the Rockies, Occupied’s 2019 Cannes entry The Holy City VR, Roger Ross Williams’ 2019 Tribeca debut Traveling While Black, and iNK Stories Verité VR Series’ 2017 Blindfold and Hero, winner of the prestigious Storyscapes Award at Tribeca in 2018. The vanguard of i-docs has expanded collaboration between film, news, and digital game industries to provide new forms of citizen engagement through advocacy journalism aimed at social and political change. Through the use of John Pavlik’s (2019) critical framework for understanding immersive journalism, this article examines the texts, producers, and industrial contexts of the most recent and influential North American i-docs, as one branch of the form defined by Gaudenzi, Aston, and Rose. Principles of transparency, social responsibility, and a commitment to veracity in i-docs epitomize the esthetic and political potential of digital journalism as an empathic alternative to traditional news coverage. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past decade, media labs have become an increasingly visible structure to create, catalyse and diffuse innovation within, and beyond, journalism. In this article, we offer insights into the multiple forms media labs can take, and how innovation in the media field is being organised through labs. As such, we focus on innovation processes and practices rather than innovative outcomes. Drawing on 45 semi-structured interviews with media labs around the globe, conducted between 2016 and 2018, this exploratory study explores the multifaceted nature of the media lab concept across academia, legacy media and independent structures. To help better understand the many different manifestations of the media lab construct encountered in our study, this article adopts a purposefully interdisciplinary approach spanning open innovation, institutional and social theories to illuminate and sense-make the global lab phenomena. First, we unpack the media lab construct by detailing the where, what and how of the media labs surveyed in this study. We then suggest that the many forms and functions of labs reveal a complex and nuanced picture of an innovation landscape. We trace this across the ways in which media labs perceive their own roles, and how they relate to wider networks and ecosystems that they engage with, specifically the extent of the openness of their activities. Ultimately, we suggest that media labs are in part shaped by mimetic, coercive and normative isomorphism: media labs are a replicated structure and signifier for innovation but do not exhibit absolute replication: they still retain local variation and mutation, which is influenced by localised factors or influences that are unique to them. They take myriad forms, are located across industry and academia, open, interdisciplinary and, for the main, focus on immediate innovation using user-centred innovation approaches. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Diverted by the virality of social media and the powerful visibility of contemporary global protest, social movement research started to loose sight of the invisible and silent aspects of mobilization and underlying collective identities. Looking at a Balinese protest movement against land reclamation whose anti-capitalist and performative character remind of recent transnational protest, this article refocuses on collective identity and examines the local adoption of global protest. It analyses the evolving actor landscape and the negotiation processes between different cultures, ecologies, generations, media and networking strategies that prominently shape the Bali movement. The article conceptualizes the movement as an emerging information ecology and tracks its entanglements with local identity, national power politics and global activism through a culture and transmedia approach. It thus analyses the loud and the silent side of the protest and the movement’s decision-making strategies that involve human and non-human agency, an aspect that is largely missing in current social movement debates. Going beyond simplified notions of strong leadership or leaderless networks, it tracks the difficult balancing acts between openness and closedness, between an ideally consensual and inclusive movement and the necessity to make strategic decisions in a specific local, national and transnational setting. </jats:p>",

Rather than taking a purely social approach, as has been the dominant trend in most prior work, the structural elements used in this current framework incorporate several dimensions and approaches identity as a conglomerate of personal, social, relational and material aspects. Building on an extensive body of the available literature, with the current conceptual model, we intend to provide a comprehensive base on which to further expand theoretically as well as empirically in future work-related concerning identity in virtual worlds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores how Twitter has emerged as a signifier of contemporary protest. Using the concept of ‘social media imaginaries’, a derivative of the broader field of ‘media imaginaries’, our analysis seeks to offer new insights into activists’ relation to and conceptualisation of social media and how it shapes their digital media practices. Extending the concept of media imaginaries to include analysis of protestors’ use of aesthetics, it aims to unpick how a particular ‘social media imaginary’ is constructed and informs their collective identity. Using the Gezi Park protest of 2013 as a case study, it illustrates how social media became a symbolic part of the protest movement by providing the visualised possibility of imagining the movement. In previous research, the main emphasis has been given to the functionality of social media as a means of information sharing and a tool for protest organisation. This article seeks to redress this by directing our attention to the role of visual communication in online protest expressions and thus also illustrates the role of visual analysis in social movement studies. </jats:p>",

While there is some awareness of gender, racial, and socioeconomic discrimination on digital platforms, ageism has received less attention. This article analyzes some tools that are frequently embedded on digital platforms from an old-age perspective, in order to increase awareness of the different ways in which ageism works. We will firstly look at how innovation teams, following homophilic patterns, disregard older people. Secondly, we will show how ageism tends to be amplified by the methods often used on digital platforms. And thirdly, we will show how corporate values contradict the usability issues that mainly affect people with a low level of (digital) skills, which is more common among older people. Counterbalancing the abusive power control of the corporations behind digital platforms and compensating for the underrepresentation of groups in less favorable situations could help to tackle such discrimination. </jats:p>",

It shows how the rise of AI was accompanied by the construction of a powerful cultural myth: The creation of a thinking machine, which would be able to perfectly simulate the cognitive faculties of the human mind. Based on a content analysis of articles on AI published in two magazines, the Scientific American and the New Scientist, which were aimed at a broad readership of scientists, engineers and technologists, three dominant patterns in the construction of the AI myth are identified: (1) the recurrence of analogies and discursive shifts, by which ideas and concepts from other fields were employed to describe the functioning of AI technologies; (2) a rhetorical use of the future, imagining that present shortcomings and limitations will shortly be overcome and (3) the relevance of controversies around the claims of AI, which we argue should be considered as an integral part of the discourse surrounding the AI myth. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article critically examines the implementation and impact of the Digital Urban Waste Tracking System (DUWTS), a ‘smart’ waste management technology deployed in several towns in Poland to enhance urban waste segregation practices. By integrating critical discard studies with critical data studies, the article introduces the concept of ‘waste data reflectivity’ to investigate how data representation in DUWTS influences perceptions and responsibilities within waste management. The study highlights how DUWTS employs advanced dataveillance technologies to monitor waste disposal, creating distorted reflections that obscure the complexities of municipal waste management. These distortions are analyzed through the metaphorical lenses of three mirrors – concave, kaleidoscopic, and ceiling – which reveal the illusory effects on municipalities, waste disposal companies, and residents. Additionally, the article discusses how DUWTS exemplifies ‘technologies of (un)knowing’, which systematically obscure or misrepresent waste management issues, leading to the marginalization of true responsibilities and challenges. The findings demonstrate that while DUWTS represents a technological advancement, it can also perpetuate the existing challenges in waste management by masking the true nature of waste issues and obscuring the responsibilities of different stakeholders. The article concludes by emphasizing the socio-technological consequences of such systems and the importance of a critical analysis in evaluating the effectiveness and ethics of data-driven waste management technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A fascination for the authentic is pervasive in contemporary culture. This article discusses texts recommending digital detox and how these accentuate dilemmas of what it means to be authentically human in the age of constant connectivity. Digital detox can be defined as a periodic disconnection from social or online media, or strategies to reduce digital media involvement. Digital detox stands in a long tradition of media resistance and resistance to new communication technologies, and non-use of media, but advocates balance and awareness more than permanent disconnection. Drawing on the analysis of 20 texts promoting digital detox: self-help literature, memoirs and corporate websites, the article discusses how problems with digital media are defined and recommended strategies to handle them. The analysis is structured around three dominant themes emerging in the material: descriptions of temporal overload and 24/7 connectivity, experiences of spatial intrusion and loss of contact with ‘real life’ and descriptions of damage to body and mind. A second research topic concerns how arguments for digital detox can be understood within a wider cultural and political context. Here, we argue that digital detox texts illuminate the rise of a self-regulation society, where individuals are expected to take personal responsibility for balancing risks and pressures, as well as representing a form of commodification of authenticity and nostalgia. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Creating opportunities for temporary disconnection: How tourism professionals provide alternatives to being permanently online",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The ongoing normalization of digital connection has also increased the interest in digital disconnection research. The desire to disconnect is typically considered a critical reaction to the peculiar affordances and prerequisites of fully participating in digital society. While social and political potentials of disconnections as well as reasons to turn away from media are explored in various trajectories, we still know relatively little about the “what then” and “what else” of digital disconnection. In this article, we address this gap and investigate what stories are told and which imaginaries are invoked in order to commodify disconnection in an exemplary field of the growing disconnection industry, namely tourism. Drawing from interviews and analysis of online representations, we analyze how tourist marketers and accommodation providers in the Austrian province of Salzburg are communicating why people should use their vacation to disconnect and what they can expect to find once they are disconnected. Following our analysis, we identify three general themes of how disconnection is countered to living in deeply mediatized and highly connective times: (1) nature and authenticity, (2) (re-)connecting with the self, finding balance, and (3) connection to family/friends/local people. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of our analysis and what the identified ambivalences of disconnection suggest for further advancing disconnection research in the future. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the discursive, normative construction of gamification within journalism. Rooted in a theory of discursive institutionalism and by analyzing a significant corpus of metajournalistic discourse from 2006 to 2019, the study demonstrates how journalists have negotiated gamification’s place within journalism’s boundaries. The discourse addresses criticism that gamified news is a move toward infotainment and makes the case for gamification as serious journalism anchored in norms of audience engagement. Thus, gamification does not constitute institutional change since it is construed as an extension of existing institutional norms and beliefs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates the role of two intermediaries, a mainstream media outlet and a popular digital media platform, to shape cultural identity through a case study of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire crisis (colloquially known as the ‘Black Summer’). Theoretically framed by networked publics, this study explores the vernacular creativity of social media users and mainstream media coverage during the Black Summer bushfire crisis. Findings draw on a thematic analysis of 100 news articles published between September 2019 and January 2020 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) randomly selected from a larger corpus of bushfire coverage ( n = 1269) and 120 TikTok videos posted between November 2019 and January 2021 that included prominent hashtags associated with the bushfires. Findings from news coverage highlight the ways in which the ABC framed the role of social media to connect with wider audiences while preserving their values as a public service media outlet. Findings from TikTok videos illustrate the role of ‘templates’ that encourage user participation and vernacular creativity on the platform. Comparing coverage of the bushfires on the ABC and TikTok revealed a shared set of striking visual elements used to shape cultural identity, communicate information, and make sense of a significant public crisis. This article offers directions for future research to explore the relationships and tensions between digital content creators and journalists and their capacity to create and contest cultural identities and imaginaries. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Expanding the magic circle: Immersive storytelling that trains environmental perception",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Scholarship on immersion in simulated environments often emphasizes cognitive immersion, or the suspension of disbelief that takes place in an illusionistic space that simulates reality, making the fact of mediation disappear in the experience. Marie-Laure Ryan writes that: “immersivity can be understood in two ways: in a properly VR sense, as the technology-induced experience of being surrounded by data, and in a narrative sense... as being imaginatively captivated by a storyworld” (230). Both of these definitions rest on the notion of cognitive immersion. Grounded in the field of post-dramatic multimedia performance, this paper will focus instead on immersive storytelling that activates the senses in a phenomenological experience. Rather than transporting the spectator into a fictional imaginary space, post-dramatic multimedia performance aims to make participants aware of their presence in the here and now (Klich and Scheer, 128). This paper will describe an immersive storytelling project that integrates virtual reality (VR) into live participatory performance events that take place outdoors. The paper is co-authored by an artist-researcher and two students who are working as research assistants on this project. We recount our creative research process in developing a pervasive game, which Montola defines as a “game that has one or more salient features that expand the contractual magic circle of play socially, spatially or temporally” (2005, 3). This game is played in a park and at key moments, inside VR environments that simulate that same park. The purpose of the game is to attune participants to the species in that particular environment.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The popularization and normalization of conspiracy theories over the last decade are accompanied by concerns over conspiracy theories as irrational beliefs, on the one hand; and their advocates as radical and extremist believers on the other hand. Building on studies emphasizing that such accounts are one-sided at best, and pars pro toto stigmatizations at worst; we propose to study what we call “ participatory conspiracy culture”—the everyday, mundane online debates about conspiracy theories. Based on a 6-month ethnography on Reddit’s r/conspiracy subreddit, an analysis of 242 selected discussions, and supported by digital methods tool 4CAT, this article addresses the question of how people participate in online conspiracy culture. It shows that among the plethora of conspiracy theories discussed online, discussions are heterogeneous, and their participants relate to each other primarily through conflict. Three epistemological positions occur: belief (particularly leading to constant discreditation of others’ beliefs), doubt (particularly as opposed to belief), and play (particularly with the fun of entertaining conspiracy theories without taking them too seriously). We conclude that the participatory conspiracy culture of r/conspiracy is not a homogenous echo chamber of radical belief, but a heterogeneous participatory culture in which belief is fundamentally contested, rather than embraced. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Real person fiction’ (RPF) is a subset of fanfiction that has gone largely unnoticed by academics. A handful of articles have argued for the justification of stories about real (living) people as a legitimate and morally sound art form, but only a very few studies have begun to consider RPF as a genre with its own aesthetics and conventions. This article argues that, to understand fannish RPF, we need to incorporate tools developed by scholars of digital fiction. Almost all fanfic is now produced for and on digital platforms, and moreover, the natural fit between RPF specifically and the study of metalepsis, or self-conscious movement between ‘levels’ of reality and fiction, makes this tool and others imported from the study of digital fiction an illuminating set of lenses through which read it. Along the way, I will incorporate further narrative theory to suggest that we understand appeals to the putative subject of RPF as directed to a ‘fictiona lized addressee’, that is, an addressee who is neither purely fictional nor purely nonfictional, but a construct of mediated activity that demonstrates fandom’s participation in the construction of the subcultural celebrity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the migration of influencers from YouTube to Twitch and the boom in popularity experienced by the latter social network, this paper explores if brands are capitalizing on the influence capacity of streamers or if streamers might be getting money from their own content. In order to investigate this, it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis on the publication schedules and broadcast formats used by streamers. This facilitated the simultaneous identification of another main finding: Spanish streamers are using a broadcast model on Twitch that resembles that of open linear television. Although they only broadcast content related to videogames, trends towards other types of audiovisual content have already been identified. Moreover, it has been found that influential streamers prioritize Twitch over other social networks even though feedback flows have been detected, especially from Twitch to other platforms. This work represents a contribution to knowledge in terms of understanding Twitch and understanding platforms and influencers. It is important to determine whether these new forms of broadcasting and interaction could be considered a hybrid model between linear television and social media streaming. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Shifting Author—Reader Dynamic",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Facilitated by Web 2.0 applications, contemporary internet-savvy readers are increasingly turning to online outlets in an effort to prolong the experience of reading novels. Fan fiction and slash fiction websites are proliferating, and readers are becoming more and more creative and proactive in their efforts to interact with previously published narrative material. This article looks at a so-far under-researched phenomenon: the websites created and maintained by the authors themselves, which allow readers to delve deeper into the world of novel and novelist, offering fans interaction with both the author and other readers, as well as an extension of the novel’s world through games and additional materials. These online novel communities are models of a bridge between print and digital storytelling conventions. They expand the dynamic between author, text, and reader, providing a space for discourse between author and reader, opportunities for readers to influence and form the texts the author is creating, and reader-contributed material in the form of fan fiction and games. The digital format of these communities also introduces the print-oriented reader to digital storytelling elements, such as online games, multimedia, and hypertext. This article uses two communities as models: NeilGaiman.com and JasperFforde.com. It examines the discourse between these bestselling authors and their readers, reader contributions on the sites, the expanded author—reader dynamic created through these interactions, and how these sites introduce readers to digital storytelling conventions. </jats:p>",

Night in the Woods and Undertale both use the perception of responsibility found in video game modes of engagement as an active storytelling tool, but apply it in different ways. Despite the differences in their contextual application, both games use affective materiality to encourage players to reflect on the consequences of their decisions in multiple arenas: within the context of the game, their engagement with other games and their engagement with the wider world.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to an increasing occupation in media studies with Mobile Virtual Reality (MVR) – a form of ‘wireless’ VR, where all necessary sensing componentry is built into the system’s headset and controllers. Our analysis focuses on the Quest series of devices, offered by Facebook-owned VR company Oculus. Through the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon, we argue that the Quest represents a ‘concretisation’ of VR – of VR becoming internally coherent and synergistic, enabling its mobility and use in varied contexts. We suggest that this process of concretisation is what enables it to generate vast amounts of data with the potential for use by Facebook’s advertising arm and in future product development. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Although digital music streaming and downloading practices highlight a preference for portability over fidelity among pop music consumers, for some ‘high fidelity’ continues to be a crucial component of their pop music engagement. This article examines the political dimensions of audio preferences. It considers comments by Neil Young and those within The Distortion of Sound who claim that the lossy compression encoding process – used in digital downloading and streaming – significantly degrades the quality of recorded sound and compromises valuable pop music characteristics. In 2015, these claims were followed by the development of the ‘hi-res’ music player device and digital download store ‘Pono’. This article argues that some criticism of lossy compression can be understood as ‘audio capital’. Rather than merely exchanging aesthetic preferences, or a reliable metric of the audibility of high fidelity, audio capital describes the reconversion of celebrity status and economic capital into a class divide structured by an appreciation for large-scale music production. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Integrating trace data into interviews: Better interviews, better data",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we present a transnational case study on binge-watching and media habits. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. The first contribution is methodological, proposing ‘data-prompted interviewing’, a variant of trace interviewing. Participants’ own trace data is used to help them recall their own behavior in more detail, which in turn enables them to identify gaps or flaws in trace data records. This case study, which includes sixty interviews in platform logs from YouTube, Netflix and a large self-tracking service, provides evidence that ‘data-prompted interviewing’ yields robust results. Using data to prompt interviewees’ memories substantially improved their recall, and interviewees’ insights into platform data substantially improved its interpretation. The second contribution of this case study is theoretical, engaging with calls for reflexivity in media studies by empirically embracing Jenssen’s idea of dual ‘data movements’ and operationalizing reflexivity into concrete methods. Looking at the platform logs with the interviewee revealed patterns and habits in watching behavior which an interview alone would have entirely missed. But interviews also revealed quirks in the platform data which would have completely misled a researcher working with platform logs alone. The combination produces more insightful and robust research results for both ‘big data’ and ‘small data’ approaches. Recent data protection laws, which give millions of people the right to access their own trace data from platforms, make this approach practical for a wide range of questions in media studies. We propose that media studies scholars embrace reflexivity as not just theory but method, and through data-prompted interviews, fully embrace how the field affects research, and how research affects the field. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The censorship of Boys’ Love (BL) content in mainland China is marked by inconsistencies in both its intensity and scope. Amid these shifting regulatory boundaries, this study analyzes the systematic removal and occasional reappearance of visual BL content from the public sphere. We found that as visual channels are most susceptible to suppression, audio – though still monitored – emerges as a crucial medium, leveraging the agentive power of sound and media remediation to sustain fan engagement with BL narratives. Focusing on Miss Evan, a Chinese audio streaming platform, we explore how it navigates state censorship and market marginalization while restoring the BL subculture through innovative design features, sexually appealing voice performances, and provocative sound effects. Additionally, we investigate the agency of Chinese BL fans in reclaiming BL’s presence through polymedia engagement. We argue that the dynamic negotiation between the platform, state censorship, and fandom reveals an ongoing contest between queer marginalization and restoration. While the platform seeks mainstream acceptance by conforming to censorship through the minimization of queer visual representation, the BL fandom employs counterstrategies to sustain the subculture in audio form. This tension highlights the cultural resilience and technological adaptability of queer subcultures as they navigate and resist the censorship imposed by state and societal norms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Anonymity is often regarded as a negative influence on the quality of online communication, but can anonymity serve to bridge communication gaps under specific conditions? This study explores this question by examining key affordances of Reddit using a quasi-ethnographic method. Here, anonymity is combined with active norm enforcement by self-appointed moderators of subReddits. This study develops the concept of actively moderated anonymity and assesses its ability to mend gaps in communication through an online ethnography of Medicine, a Reddit community of self-identified medical professionals to answer the following: How does anonymity work as an affordance in shaping online discussions, such as those in r/medicine, and what types of exchanges are occurring between medical professionals in the r/medicine community that may not occur elsewhere? r/medicine’s community provided a place for comfort and a place to freely exchange ideas including sensitive topics and opposing viewpoints. Findings conclude that medical professionals often sought to validate decisions they had made in the workplace and attempted to resolve concerns about particular institutional or systemic issues, suggesting actively moderated anonymity may afford an additional level of support that medical professionals may not find in the workplace or within an identifiable setting that could potentially be invaluable to the services provided to patients. </jats:p>",

Ritual, rhythms and refrains order our way through the chaos of the web and this paper proposes that MP3 offers temporal potentialities and existential 'becoming' that provide new affective dimensions to the previously static nature of the web. With such a proliferation of writing on MP3 and peer-to-peer networking, this article is concerned with why music is worth downloading and finally, how capital has sought to commodify this territory that MP3 users created. </jats:p>",

After examining criticisms levelled at Indymedia from within critical communications and social movement studies, it provides a tabulated overview of current network activity and then develops a theoretical analysis of problems faced by Indymedia centres in a range of regions (focusing on centres in Latin and North America, Africa, West Asia and Western Europe). Finally, the article concludes by discussing how activists have attempted to overcome these problems and emphasizes the ongoing legacy of Indymedia within contemporary social movements such as Occupy. I argue that although there has been a steep decline in the number of active centres from 2010 onwards, the existence of flourishing centres in Latin America, Oceania, Western Europe and the United States and continued importance of practices pioneered by Indymedia in contemporary social movements are indicative of the ongoing value of radical participatory online media for activists. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Virtual reality (VR) has been designated as the ‘ultimate empathy machine’ due to its alleged ability to powerfully immerse users in another’s perspective. As VR has attracted growing attention, criticism of its alleged ‘empathic superpowers' has also gained strength. Critics have recently argued that the empathic VR vision is ethically flawed since it is misleading and denies non-communicable aspects of the Other. Moreover, several scholars argue that VR empathy rhetoric in fact exploits the marginalised targets of empathy, turning them to objects ‘identity tourism’ for the privileged. The paper revisits these claims, arguing that they rely on empathy notions that are dominant in traditional art-media, while overlooking VR’s unique experiential affordances. Drawing on psychophysiological evidence, it argues that the ethical significance of VR lies in the unique ways in which it manipulates the user’s body scheme via multisensory stimulation. These manipulations result in unprecedented empathy-related perceptual and conceptual transformations whose ethical implications require new ethical framing.</jats:p>",

We follow this up by exploring the ways in which datamoshing as a practice (together with ‘glitch art’ more generally) highlights the decay that digital images undergo over time. Because it takes place through the deliberate compression of images, we here argue that the aforementioned loss of quality is an ‘artistic’ form of entropy, which leads us to the possibility for a theory of ‘digital chaos’. However, since the loss of data is reworked by artists in order to create new forms, we argue that this is a form of digital ‘emergence’ of ‘order out of chaos’, or ‘digital complexity’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This interview seeks to provide a thorough and discerning overview of the various theories, concepts and issues guiding the work of Gregory L. Ulmer. The central aim of Ulmer’s multifaceted project, which he terms electracy, is to theorize a skill-set intended to operate with networked technologies, in the same manner as literacy is an ability related to alphabetic writing. In Ulmer’s words, electracy ‘is to digital media what literacy is to print’. While literacy enables the mind to develop complex lines of reasoning, he suggests that electracy augments it by seeking to enhance the affective capacity of the body. In a more general sense, Ulmer conceptualizes electracy as the era, or, as he also puts it, an apparatus, dominated by digital technologies. To theorize various aspects of this apparatus, Ulmer compares and contrasts it with the other apparatuses (that of literacy and orality). The interview also situates Ulmer’s insights within our current cultural context of a post-COVID world and examines the various social implications such insights entail. Moving from Greek antiquity, through Kafka and even Mickey Mouse, Ulmer provides an unnerving and motivating method for better understanding and interrogating the problems that we all face, particularly with regard to education. He also sheds light on other contemporary issues such as digital misinformation and the waning trust in traditional institutions. In addition to offering a ‘crash course’ on Ulmerian theory, the interview interrogates the ways in which electracy can help us develop new angles for digital pedagogy, but also for living and being, after the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>",

Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates an instance in convergence culture: the conflicts and compromises between modders (fans of a video game who actually make changes to the game) and their supporters, and the owners of the copyrighted works they appropriate. I suggest that current copyright ownership in cultural products interferes with the way creative industries can benefit from convergence; that modders (and fans generally) develop a specific rationale and set of norms rooted in Jenkins' concept of a `moral economy' (Jenkins, Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, 2006) to justify their appropriations; and that mutually beneficial relationships can be teased out of the apparently contradictory positions of modders and copyright owners. This article focuses on two case studies that illustrate the ways modders reuse cultural products and incorporate them into their video game modifications to achieve a sense of creative ownership and meaning over their entertainment experience. </jats:p>",

    "title": "NFTs applied to the art sector: Legal issues and recent jurisprudence",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Responding to the necessity of scarcity and uniqueness in the digital format, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have recently gained much attention in cultural industries, especially video games and the art market. Faced with the digital paradigm shift and the challenge of dematerialization, creators started to use NTFs in order to emulate the concept of rarity for displaying, promoting, and monetizing their works in digital environments. An NFT is a certificate of ownership implemented through encrypted metadata pointing to a unique copy of a digital file. Likewise, NFTs enable the tokenization of a large array of digital, or even physical, assets. For this reason, they are used to facilitate the digitalization of contents heavily dependent on copyright and scarcity. Non-Fungible Tokens represent an emerging reality of significant economic, social, and cultural importance, which also raises important legal issues especially concerning the very nature of the NFT, as property or license, and the usage of copyrighted contents or trademarks. Indeed, the most frequent legal issues with NFTs are related to the attribution and exploitation of the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the underlying content or litigations about non-contractual matters (i.e., theft). Litigious cases affecting NFTs most often take on an international dimension due to the decentralized nature of the technology on which they are developed, distributed on servers hosted in a multitude of countries, as well as the business practices of trading platforms that connect users from all over the world. Consequently, the principles of Private International Law (PIL) are applied to solve legal conflicts. This study focuses on the resolution of litigations related to NFTs in the three countries leading the global art markets: the US, the UK, and China. The analysis focuses on the application of international private law in relation to recent jurisprudence concerning conflicts involving NFTs and artworks. </jats:p>",

An initial round of analysis facilitated the identification and subsequent classification of stories by five commonly described challenges: betrayal, isolation, meanness and harassment, concern about a Friend, and Maintenance Challenges. Drawing on previously identified features of exchanges in and through digital contexts, including scalability, persistence, replicability, and anonymity, the role of technology was then explored in the context of the five friendship challenges. Scalability, leveraging the affordance of efficiently reaching a broad audience, was the most common way technology amplified friendship challenges. However, technology also often functioned solely as the medium for communication. Additionally, adolescents described difficulties related to sexting as a contemporary friendship challenge. Implications for supporting youth in their friendships are discussed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how the ‘refugee crisis’, sparked by the arrival of refugees from the Syrian civil war and other conflicts around the world, was articulated across Dutch television news programs and social media between 2013 and 2018. This crisis has been described as a key catalyst of the radicalization of European political discourse. Crucially, it took shape during a period of profound transformation of the media landscape, in which mass media lost significant ground to social media as authoritative sources of truth and norms. The research focuses on the crucial but underexplored link between television and social media discourse, which is at the heart of contemporary European public debate. Using a combination of digital methods and NLP techniques, the article compares automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts of Dutch televised news on the refugee crisis with responses from publics on Facebook and Twitter. This computational cross-media approach enables a longitudinal analysis of how social media users differ in their interpretation of key events characterizing the crisis, as well as what language is acceptable to debate issues around integration, tolerance and identity. A rejection of mainstream news media editorial guidelines by social media users eventually resulted in their consumption of populist right-wing (‘alternative’) news media and active transgression of anti-discriminatory speech norms. </jats:p>",

Martin Heidegger’s tool analysis and concept of time ( Sorge), as well as Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Body-Subject including the related phenomena intentional arc, maximal grip and flow of coping, are of special interest. The aim is to move beyond the descriptive game design take on game feel by inserting the body in a first-person perspective, highlighting a sensuous approach with emphasis on rhythm and controller. We offer a methodological framework for analysing game feel consisting on three levels: ‘Dance’, ‘Learn’ and ‘Inhabit’. Finally, we arrive at an understanding of game feel explaining reasons for player sensitivity towards game feel and clues to why players care so deeply about it. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "showing how processes which may seem complex and technical are in fact complex and human. Internal teams within companies make impossible decisions daily about what to permit and how to word and implement standards. Paid contractors review flagged content for violations at compensation rates of fractions of a cent per image. Volunteer user moderators manage whole communities for no compensation beyond a sense of contributing to something meaningful. Though it would be impossible for humans to moderate all content on Facebook, an enormous number of large and small decisions are far out of reach for algorithms. Following the discussion of the aforementioned breastfeeding photo saga and the complexities of decisions on whether to filter or remove different types of content, Gillespie closes with a discussion of the future of content moderation. Platforms sit in an unenviable position where users expect both protection from other users and the freedom to express themselves as they see fit. The current system may be technically viable moving into the future, at least if companies are given the opportunity to hire small armies of content moderator contractors, but it is certainly not politically viable given ever-growing pressure from different stakeholders with conflicting interests. In the final chapter, Gillespie summarizes the heart of his argument where he presents possible avenues to address some of the major problems in content moderation. Readers following the debates about content moderation will be familiar with some of Gillespie’s recommendations, such as his call for more diversity in platform hires and a shift toward new business models, but there are a few details that push common discussion points in new directions. For example, Gillespie recommends building transparency directly into user interfaces, where unobtrusive notices could help us understand moderation-related actions happening around us. Similarly, he suggests that users might benefit from the fruits of their own moderation labor, which in this case means accessing aggregated data about what has been flagged. These are both categories of features that are plausible to implement and benefit users without giving up too much in the way of information about internal processes. Custodians of the Internet is written to be accessible to scholars, designers, engineers, executives, journalists, and policymakers from a wide variety of backgrounds, and each has something to gain from reading it. It covers the main content moderation categories, though there the spread of disinformation is only mentioned briefly. It is thorough in documenting the processes involved in content moderation at scale, and provides both a primer for readers new to the area and a wealth of details that will be new even to experienced readers. Though comprehensive, this work leaves many areas still open for exploration, particularly in the realm of user-driven moderation and users’ experiences with moderation. At their heart, content moderation discussions are conversations about our values as people and societies, and Gillespie’s work offers us an opportunity to consider what sort of future we envision for social computing and for public discourse as a whole.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article employs national longitudinal media and opinion surveys from Sweden’s SOM Institute as a lens to engage media convergence theory during the period 1995 to 2012. Building on rhetorical analysis of SOM questions, the article both concretizes media convergence theory and promotes a reexamination of default categories of media analysis: content, platform, and user behavior, or protocol. By using a triangular vector composition model, the article shows how theories of media convergence can be critically evaluated using SOM questions as a data set and that SOM questions reflect and construct fluid and flexible relationships integral to media convergence theory. SOM’s questions regarding emerging media are embedded in the specific historical context of Sweden’s striking, though incomplete and contested, digital transformation. This article is the first of its kind to analyze the content of SOM questions; it does not engage in quantitative survey methodology evaluation. Topical foci are news coverage, digitally networked communication, especially the Internet, and digital cinema. The article further gestures to how SOM questions concretize links between media convergence and political engagement, with specific reference to an accompanying rhetoric on agency and activism that is often abstract. To conclude, we discuss some of the larger implications of SOM surveys with respect to changing media convergence discourse in the 21st century. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Food consumption in video gaming culture has been linked to convenience, nutritionally poor food, and unconventional eating norms. However, little attention has been given to video gaming and food interactions in mundane settings. This article explores how video gaming and food practices compete for time and attention in everyday life. We use theories of practice approach and data from a qualitative study on young Danish adults who frequently play video games. The findings suggest the competition between video gaming and food is decided by the practice that best realizes the desire to be sociable and gendered commitments to healthiness and housekeeping. We discuss the sociable appeal of video gaming over extensive performances of cooking and eating in relation to the individualization of daily social encounters and interrogate the conventional perceptions of food in video gaming culture in the context of inattention to gender differentiation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of the current article was to explore parasocial phenomena in the unique and interactive context of live streaming. Specifically, the predictors of parasocial interactions (PSIs) and parasocial relationships (PSRs) were compared. In the past, the terms ‘parasocial interaction’ and ‘parasocial relationship’ have been used interchangeably, even though they are distinct constructs – which has confused researchers’ understanding of these phenomena. The current study aims to begin to disentangle our understanding of these two constructs by studying the predictors for each construct separately. An online survey was utilized to collect data on PSRs, PSIs, and various parasocial predictors that fell into three categories: streamer (source) characteristics, viewer characteristics, and behavioral (relationship) characteristics. Results indicate that streamer characteristics were the most important predictors of both PSIs and PSRs in the live streaming context, although characteristics of the viewer and relationship were also influential. These findings indicate that message sources can modify their content to encourage parasocial phenomena in their audience. This is encouraging, as research suggests that parasocial phenomena lead to many positive repercussions for the media and so are generally considered a goal of media personae. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital archives and open archival practices",
    "abstract": "This special issue has grown out of a shared interest by the guest editors in digital archives and the affordances of digital technologies upon archival practices, including the archiving of creative process. Situated within two different but complementary disciplines, film (Atkinson) and dance (Whatley), our aim in this issue has been to bring together a range of viewpoints and perspectives that represents a range of specialisms and subject domains. In conjunction with the fourth in the series of ‘Digital Echoes’ symposia at Coventry University, UK, in January 2014, which brought together a range of speakers and delegates from a broad cross section of the arts, we invited contributions that would capture some of the initiatives and dialogues that are taking place in archival practices within the digital environment. In line with the journal’s title, the convergence between scholars, arts professionals and digital experts has led to a very rich corpus of papers that cover a range of territories and speak to the shift from the closed to the open and from the traditional single-user archive model to emerging multi-user, collaborative forms of archival practices and scholarship. The collection explores how digital preservation and presentation of archival materials dramatically impacts upon the nature and notion of access and how the types of discoveries, insights and findings made through online digital interfaces can be radically altered. We were delighted that the call for contributions to this issue elicited a large number of submissions and what we include here is just a selection of what could have represented this lively area of activity. We are pleased that we are able to bring together an international group of writers, thus demonstrating how there are common and convergent themes within the broad frame of archival practice. Some articles focus on a very specific collection or art form/practice, whilst others offer a more expansive theorization of a body of work. Some are grounded in a particular community or social context and show how digital technologies have the potential to create or reveal new kinds of narratives. Within this mix, several draw on photographic archives as a source but the range of",

    "title": "From tool to tool-making: Reflections on authorship in social media research software",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social media research software has come to play increasingly important roles in processes of knowledge production. While epistemological, logistical, legal, and ethical concerns put the spotlight on the software tools researchers are relying on, little attention is paid to the role of the ‘toolmaker’ beyond a vague idea of the ‘power’ wielded by those who design, develop, and maintain these technical artifacts. This paper seeks to address this role, both conceptually and with attention to practical concerns, as a form of hybrid and relational authorship. We thereby shift the focus from tool to tool-making, from artifact to practice, in an attempt to produce a different kind of ‘unblackboxing’ of tools than the somewhat overused tropes of open source code or open data. Our contribution proceeds in three steps. We first address tools and tool-making from a theoretical perspective, suggesting that their epistemological orientation reaches more deeply into the networks of research practice than words like ‘bias’ admit and proposing to consider the specific kind of hybrid authorship that emerges in this context. Calling on our own experiences as toolmakers, we then reflect on a cluster of issues where this authorial function becomes particularly visible. Here, we examine how motivations and commitments orient what a piece of software does and how it does it and discuss tool-making from the perspectives of co-development, maintenance and care, and ethics by design. We conclude by arguing that the most pressing concerns for tool-making lie in institutional arrangements that are crucial for the life of research software. </jats:p>",

This article explores the naming strategies of the most successful social media platforms and messenger services in terms of the numbers of their users worldwide. For this purpose, 17 brand names were analysed with the help of a taxonomy of brand names that is used in marketing practice. Furthermore, etymological and semantic aspects of the brand names are examined. One finding is that most of the brands use fanciful names, which can best be protected. Additionally, this study highlights the fact that many of the social media platforms and messenger services contain hints to prior media forms in their names. But why do they use these semantically retro references? This study adopts different approaches (remediation, skeuomorphism, invented tradition) to illuminate this retro-naming strategy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the recent development of debunking on social media as a dominant agenda, fact checkers have increasingly used machine learning (ML) to identify, verify and correct factual claims, as ML promises the scaling of fact checking practices. However, it also places a new actor in between the fact checkers and the fact checked users. In this paper, we conducted a contrasted analysis of how fact checkers and fact checked users understand, evaluate and act towards the algorithmic system and the data flows in Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program: We did ethnographic fieldwork in the fact checking newsroom and interviewed and did protocol analysis with the fact checked. For both professional users and end users, the algorithmic system is experienced as a black box in which they have limited insight, and their sense-making practices happen based on the data and metrics that are made visible to them. In the paper, we draw on and expanded theory on decoding algorithms by not only exploring how the two user groups engage in decoding the algorithmic system, but also actively engage in forms of recoding by attempting to adapt or modify the algorithmic system to better fit within their cultural and social context, which is characterised by both varying epistemic cultures and societal positions. While the fact checkers from their hegemonic (sometimes negotiated) position understand the program as a (sometimes stupid) tool and primarily engage in passive acts of recoding, fact checked users, from their oppositional position, understand the program as an unpredictable censoring machine and engage primarily in more active acts of recoding. Based on the analysis, we end the paper with a discussion in which we argued for understanding data reflexivity as highly relational and processual. </jats:p>",

If one scans Internet-based discussion groups and journals from London to Budapest, New York to Berlin, and Los Angeles to Tokyo, certain themes are obsessively intoned, like mantras: copyright; on-line identity; cyborgs; interactivity; the future of the Internet. This follows from the Microsofting of the planet, which has cast a uniform digital aesthetics over national visual cultures, accelerating the globalization already begun by Hollywood, MTV, and consumer packaging: hyperlinks and cute icons, animated fly-throughs, rainbow color palettes, and Phong-shaded spheres are ubiquitous, and apparently inescapable.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Should fanfiction forums be considered an instance of Digital Heritage Communities? Departing from the mainstream approach according to which Heritage Communities relate to intangible goods or material collections of Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs), we rather focus on the creative and cultural participatory assets enhanced by the advent of digital media (such as fanfictions) and the online communities (resp., fandoms) that support them. Here, we study by means of computational techniques the case of the Archive of Our Own (AO3), an Internet forum created and managed by fanfiction writers willing to share their work with a global fandom community. We find that AO3 cultivates a prosocial relational atmosphere that favors the emergence of stable sub-communities committed to writing, reading and enriching fanfictions as a shared cultural resource (a commons). Such features align with those outlined as characteristic of Heritage Communities, while emerging around a yet undervalued form of ‘born-digital’ cultural assets. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, radio broadcasts on social media have extended to visual radio broadcasts (e.g. Facebook Live) that support a continuous display of viewer comments in real time. Based on 65 semi-structured in-depth interviews, this study presents for the first time the perspectives of the main actors in the visual radio scene: viewers, broadcasters, and radio executives. Findings show that broadcasters generally believe that the recent visual changes to radio, forced by the changing media environment, have an adverse impact on the radiophonic medium. In contrast, radio executives, who set policies, believe that radio must maintain a presence in the visual, viral interactive online space. For viewers, visual radio meets diverse needs, generates enjoyment, and offers the added value of interactivity and enhanced sense of activity resulting from new access to ‘behind the scenes’ of radio broadcasts. This study demonstrates how the theory of technological determinism is reflected in practice, in the radiophonic medium’s adjustments to the features of the new era – visibility, lost anonymity through increased exposure, potential for viral dissemination, and real-time responsivity – despite the fact that these features are contrary to radio’s unique fundamental features. Despite this innovative turn, all actors – executives, broadcasters, and viewers – believe that radio broadcast consumption remains dominated by the traditional in-car audio format. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article the authors assess the impact of the European Commission's state aid policy on the public service remit of public broadcasting organizations in the digital age. The article consists of two parts. In the first part the authors give an overview of the policy and legal context in which state aid control of public service broadcasting evolves. Second, recent state aid cases that touch upon the issue of digitization and public service broadcasting are analysed. Whereas Member States fear too much Commission intervention, the European Commission, on the contrary, fears that Member States abuse the margins of the European Treaty in order to expand the digital public service remit in unauthorized ways, such as financing commercial digital activities. Whether the Commission is right to fear a `mission creep' on behalf of the public service broadcasters due to vague and overambitious digitilization plans, remains to be seen however. </jats:p>",

Converging media text and technology with game play mechanics and rules, these board games exist as a hybrid form of game and media. In this article, I examine interactive paratextual board games – games based on media products that utilize other forms of media to produce random or immersive experiences. While previous discussions of media franchising investigates game paratexts through industrial and economic shifts, I explicate aesthetic, ludic, and textual concerns of cult franchises through an analysis of three interactive board games, namely, Isaac Asimov’s Robot VCR Mystery Game, the Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive VCR Board Game, and the Indiana Jones DVD Adventure Game. Ultimately, I argue that these interactive paratextual board games manifest, reflect, and augment early convergence culture characteristics, revealing that interactive board games exemplify contemporary new media characteristics. </jats:p>",

From a 'policy transfer' approach, the article analyses the process of telecommunications liberalisation that has occurred in Europe from the mid-late 1980s onwards in terms of the influences arising from globalisation and Europeanisation. In particular, it aims to disentangle the explanatory power of Europeanisation from that of globalisation as causal factors for convergent telecommunications liberalisation in Europe. The article shows how both globalisation and Europeanisation have been refracted by national institutional differences so that the emergent EU regulatory framework should be characterised as 'pluralist' rather than as 'hierarchically' supranational. Despite the diversity of national regulatory authorities, European Community (EC) implementation reports, telecommunications committees and the transnational network of independent regulators are all factors for policy transfer and learning. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article provides a critical analysis of the child wearable Jiobit, a locational tracking device that is designed to allow parents to monitor how children move through space. Emphasizing the device’s incorporation of geofencing features, which allow users to program ‘fences’ on a paired smartphone application and receive notifications when a Jiobit wearer enters and leaves the ‘fenced’ areas, I demonstrate how the operations of this device are part of a cultural politics that values the tracking of children through a variety of technological and infrastructural processes. Through an artifactual analysis of the device itself and its smartphone application, as well as an examination of the company’s promotional language, I demonstrate how the logic of ‘securitization’ is used to encourage parents to delegate some of the work of monitoring children to this device. This artifactual analysis is paired with a discursive analysis of the company’s policy documents, which readily acknowledge Jiobit’s inability to serve as a fully reliable security system, while also detailing the ways in which the extraction of data is stored indefinitely and, in some cases, disclosed to third parties. Through this case study of Jiobit, I argue for critical studies of wearable technologies to attend to the ways in which their producers promise ‘security’ and the ways in which ‘security’ acts as an alibi for continuous data collection. </jats:p>",

By situating them within metapicture theory, screenshots induce a multistable perception of static image content as visibly nested within an imaging process. Screenshots, then, infer causal reasoning over how and why they exist. Several examples of screenshots are given to exercise this contextually reflective reading. Analysis of each exemplifies the theoretical stance described and aids in two contributions for this paper to existing discourse on image ontology in New Media. First, the paper applies metapicture theory to increasingly contemporary cases of image remediation. Second, the paper provides a theoretical approach to assess screenshots as multistable metapictures where simultaneous content readings are possible. As a result, screenshots emerge to increasingly implicate a world of interaction behind the camera lens. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study takes a journalistic professional approach to examine integration patterns of interactive features in news media websites. It draws from two aspects of journalistic work – the relationship with audiences and medium-related practices. Consequently, two frameworks are proposed for categorizing interactive features: the first is based on the relationships news media allow their audiences to have with news content – consuming content, influencing content, or passing it beyond the news site; the second is based on the characteristics of features – textual or visual. Findings from 100 news organizations show that, overall, news media preferred applying features that allow users to interact with content, but without the ability to influence it. In addition, the use of features was tightly related to the technology associated with a news organization; newspapers’ websites were more likely to use text-based features and vice versa. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the latest instalments of protest from the Arab Spring to Occupy and beyond are digested in scholarly work, they point to a scalable, informal structure that develops as an impermanent framework for performing coordinational tasks formerly associated with collective organizations. Whilst a substitution of this nature appears a distinct possibility with social media, the participatory dynamics at the heart of such connective action remain largely uncharted. This article scrutinizes the scope for the participatory development of motivations and resources to undertake collective action. For this purpose, it reviews an empirical study of public Facebook and Twitter communication associated with the pan-European protest against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. Ensuing results point to a rational, resource-oriented mode of communication figuring prominently on both platforms. Moreover, the time distribution of motivational and resource-driven talk confounds earlier claims about patterns of social media usage in collective action. Finally, despite their smaller number, motivational posts had a higher impact than resource-oriented talk on both platforms – an apparent sign of their particularly positive reception. </jats:p>",

From in-depth interviews and analysis of the material produced by fans of a singular club, Clube Atlético Mineiro (also known as Atlético-MG or Galo, its nickname), the article explores the ways supporters appropriate the journalistic language and create innovative narratives that enrich and pluralize the media environment. Formats vary from blogs to running web radios with regular programming. Motivations for engaging in the projects are also diverse, from improving writing skills to helping the club. The supporters and initiatives here considered promote innovative approaches especially in three ways: (1) placing ordinary supporters at the centre of their narratives; (2) adopting unconventional methods of reportage that challenge the dependency of journalism on regular productive routines and that are able to provide unusual angles of sport-related stories; and (3) creating texts that resort less to the increasingly rational and bureaucratic language that has notably characterized sporting chronicles over the past few decades. Besides, these texts and their parallel circuits of fan production have played an important role in sustaining contemporary alternative football fan cultures in an increasingly hypercommodified football context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the Black Rifle Coffee Company brand, its fans, and its connection to right-wing violence. By incorporating the literature on brand culture and the concepts and tools from fan studies, I show how Black Rifle merchandise develops into wearable symbols of white supremacy and reactionary politics celebrated by a fan culture and integrated into a tactical ensemble. While both Black Rifle’s promotional content and fans’ actions point to how capitalism provides a permission structure for white masculine supremacy, only by combining these approaches do we reveal the tactical body. I argue that the tactical body is a fannish embodiment of white supremacist conspiracy theories and a playful form of political engagement designed to actualize a revenge fantasy of insurrection. While I focus primarily on how Black Rifle fans play out their tactical canon in online and physical spaces, this case study points to a larger trend of tactical brands profiting from white male grievances and political tribalism. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Video games reflect the current culture and society. Games stand as points of transmission that reflect cultural trends and social norms, although not comprehensively. While it seems that more games have tried to be inclusive of diverse gender and sexual identities recently, there is still a lack of studies that discuss how real video game players see LGBTQ+ inclusive games. To understand the game players’ perceptions in this regard, this study qualitatively analyzes online video game review postings from Steam, focusing on user reviews of gender and sexuality inclusive games. Based on four gender and sexuality inclusive video games selected, we collected 400 user-generated video game reviews as our dataset. Our findings identified 22 primary themes, including Mood/Emotions, Social/Cultural Importance and Representation. This paper further discusses some of the critical topics discovered, such as identity, conflicts in game communities and representation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Today we live in a time of unprecedented connectivity making it increasingly difficult to disconnect from the Internet. In this article we theorize that location-based technologies are transforming the practice of disconnecting from the Internet. To justify this claim we cross-articulate perspectives on disconnection and locative media studies, two scholarly fields in media studies that intersect with location and place. In a review of disconnection literature, we argue that views towards disconnection have been informed by changing perceptions of location and place in relation to Internet connectivity. Conversely, we observe locative media scholarship that has demonstrated the influence of location-based technologies in creating location-based connections that have become integral to Internet platforms and applications. We then synthesise disconnection and locative media studies to theorize the dynamics between the practice of disconnecting from the Internet, a physical location and a location-based technology. We first offer the concept of locative disconnection to describe the designation or localization of disconnective practice to a specific place. Secondly, we argue that location-based technologies are increasingly utilized to simulate locative disconnection in response to the spread of mobile connectivity and have the effect of making practices of disconnection easier, enforceable and more exclusive. Through the discussion of examples from leisure, entertainment and education, we demonstrate how locative disconnection is increasingly operationalized as both a luxury commodity and/or risk management tool and critically examine the threat and appeal of such technologies for governing populations and user behaviour. </jats:p>",

    "title": "When a TV channel reinvents itself online: Post-broadcast consumption and content change at BBC Three",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In February 2016, BBC Three became the first television (TV) channel in the world to close its linear broadcasting operation and instead prioritize offering its programming on demand, via the internet. Two Danish channels – both also youth-focused – followed in January 2020 for the same reason: budget cuts. Although the effects of ending offline distribution on the size and behaviour of newspaper and magazine audiences have been investigated, this article is the first to investigate the effects on a TV channel. The results show that BBC Three’s audience shrank by 60–70% after it closed its linear TV channel. The intensity with which the channel was viewed was even more sharply reduced: annual viewing minutes after the switch were 89% less than the channel achieved on linear TV before (and around 72% less if viewing of BBC Three-commissioned/acquired content on other BBC TV channels is included). The mix of programme genres consumed changed too, although further research is required to establish the part played by the change in distribution mechanism. This study furthers our understanding of media platform cessation by showing how change in the size of a media outlet’s audience after ending offline distribution may be affected by the proportion of its audience that consumes it exclusively offline before and how, irrespective of media platform, ending offline distribution seems to cause a sudden and substantial fall in the time spent with a media brand by its audience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Celebrities playing fictionalized versions of themselves in commercials, campaigns, and video spots have become an increasingly viral phenomenon. The George Clooney commercials for Nespresso are circulated and promoted on various media platforms, segments from The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon are released on NBC.com and shared on YouTube, and some videos are explicitly created to go viral and even published on social media sites. In this article, I draw on recent work in fictionality studies and studies of virality to investigate how the celebrity trend of ‘vitafiction’ possesses a viral potential. In vitafictional performances, the relationship between fiction and reality is thematized through a concurrent surplus of fictionality and biographical details, which invites recipients to negotiate between the celebrity’s performance and the receiver’s media cultural knowledge. Taking vitafictional performances in two online circulated spots as case studies – ‘Bono rides a bike with Jimmy Fallon’, a spot for The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, and Peter Jackson’s Facebook video post ‘Home Invasion’, a video that thematizes Jackson’s role as director of an episode of Doctor Who – this article demonstrates how the equivocality that is central to the vitafictional performance comprises a force that prompts receivers to circulate the vitafictional message. It is argued that the mediatization of society and the virality that this brings about create new possibilities for the impact of this kind of celebrity self-fashioning. </jats:p>",

Despite data visualisations being a prominent feature in COVID-19 news coverage, audience perception of data visualisations is a relatively new field of study. This study reveals the presence of Stuart Hall’s three types of reading (dominant, opposition or negotiated reading) in the participants’ reading, with the prominent role played by their reflections and the influence cast by their levels of data literacy and familiarity with terminologies. As an experience of reflection and reflexivity, reading data visualisations prompted the participants to rethink the pandemic-related issues posed in data visualisations and reflect on their personal experiences and views. Their reflections confirmed or developed their understanding of these issues or led them to reject the message they perceived. This process suggests their diagrammatic thinking is in practice. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Amateur subtitling as immaterial labour in digital media culture",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Media sociologists and cultural globalization theorists have tended to overlook the contribution of translators to the circulation of media content in the era of digital culture. After critiquing the reasons for the invisibility of translation in the literature on global cultural transactions, this article moves on to examine the emergence of new amateur subtitling collectivities in today’s informational society, exploring the role that non-professional translators – specifically, networks of activist subtitlers – play within the participatory media industries. Using examples from a case study of Ansarclub, a Spanish group of engaged amateur translators, this article gauges the extent to which their participation, remediation and bricolage practices – the main components of digital culture (Deuze [2006] Participation, remediation, bricolage: considering principal components of a digital culture. The Information Society 22: 63–75) – fit in or divert from the cocreational dynamics underpinning other domains of the media marketplace. It is argued that the interventionist and ‘monitorial’ quality of activist subtitling lies at the heart of an emerging paradigm of civic engagement, with fluid transnational communities of interest acting as the building blocks of participatory translation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Professional expertise derived from developing and handling higher resolution technologies now challenges academic convention by seeking to reinscribe digital image making as a material process. In this article and an accompanying online resource, I propose to examine the technology behind High Definition (HD), identifying key areas of understanding to enable an enquiry into those aesthetics that might derive from the technical imperatives within the medium. (This article is accompanied by a series of online interviews entitled A Verbatim History of the Aesthetics, Technology and Techniques of Digital Cinematography. To access this please go to http://www.flaxton.btinternet. co.uk/KTV.htm. This resource seeks to circumscribe and circumlocute the wide variety of interests and usages of incoming digital media with specific relation to the effects of increased definition being offered by incoming digital technologies). Having discussed the aesthetics of HD I will then proceed to look at the consequent artistic and cultural implications. The article concludes by challenging the current academic position of the digital as being inherently immaterial. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Fourth VR: Indigenous virtual reality practice",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Indigenous creators are currently using virtual reality (VR) tools, techniques and workflows in wide-ranging geographical locations and across multiple VR formats. Their radical adaptation of this new technology folds together cultural traditions and VR’s unique audiovisual configurations to resist dominant, particularly colonial, frameworks. Within this context, we ask how VR is being used to create space and capacity for Indigenous creatives to tell their stories and how do Indigenous creatives negotiate Eurocentric modes of production and distribution? To answer these questions, our Fourth VR database provides a snapshot of Indigenous VR works. By drawing on three case studies drawn from the database – The Hunt (2018), Future Dreaming (2019) and Crow: The Legend (2018) – as well as the wider patterns emerging across the database, it is possible to see an Indigenous-centred VR production framework. This framework is diverse but also contains repeated trends such as the ability to use VR to express and realize Indigenous Futurism; foreground native languages in virtual worlds; provide new articulations of Indigenous activism; embody connections between the past, present and future and demonstrate the interconnectivity of all living things. In turn, this growing body of work, engaging with the full spectrum of VR formats and tools, provides a rich contribution to the wider arena of VR practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A decade ago, the convergence of GPS with mobile telephony first allowed media artists to map the city’s psychogeography. With such technology having now become widespread, the artistic novelty of this approach has somewhat diminished. While the field of ‘locative media’ has been and continues to be productive of both work and of critique, this essay questions some of its conceptual commitments and critical interpretations. As the technological assemblages upon which locative media are based are themselves constantly shifting, the essay considers adapting conceptual approaches accordingly. To this end, an argument is put forth for expanding the concept of locative media, built upon Bruno Latour’s recent engagement with new media and design practices which he characterizes in terms of the act of assembling rather than debunking. Drawing further on actor-network theory, an alternative interpretation of the metaphor of cognitive mapping is developed in which a core concept of locativity, that of proximity, is redefined in terms of tracing the connections of networked objects, this as opposed to the often repeated association of locative media with Situationist psychogeography. An assembly of practices are examined which trace logistics and give voice to multiple nonhuman ontologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Interactive fiction has excited huge interest amongst scholars and experimental artists since the pioneering work of Michael Joyce in the 1980s. However, it has not reached out to a wide community of writers and readers, largely because of the twin problems of poor reader engagement with fractured narrative structures, and the heavy cognitive demands of the interfaces used by hyper-writers. This article reports upon an empirical study of readers’ responses to a range of interactive fictions, a study which aimed to uncover in detail the key factors affecting readers’ experience of this narrative form. On the basis of the study’s findings, it is argued that interactive fiction can offer an enjoyable reading experience, if core issues around narrative structure and interface design are addressed by writers. The article suggests guidelines for writers, based on the findings of the empirical study. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Throughout the 1990s the relationship between culture and technology was sharply focused in a debate about whether digital technologies signalled the death or radical displacement of photography. The case for the cultural continuity of photography centred upon a rejection of a strong form of technological determinism. It is now clear that far from being displaced to the margins of culture, there is now more photography than ever. There have also been dramatic developments: mobile phone manufacturers have put more cameras into people's hands then ever before; the photograph as social document and historical witness persists but in changing ways; photographs circulate globally on an unprecedented scale via electronic image banks. It is clear that such changes and developments do involve new technologies. However, rather than being due to the kind of technological determinism debated earlier, this is because photography has come to exist within a new technological environment. In many recent accounts, `information' and information technology are repeatedly cited as constituting a new and shaping context for photographic practices. </jats:p><jats:p> This article offers a conceptual framework for thinking about these changes by relating tendencies in contemporary discussions of photography to another discourse and another set of practices: informatics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "MIT7: Unstable Platforms – the Promise and Peril of Transition, 13–15 May 2011, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA A biennial event, the MIT conference last year followed on from the 2009 Stone and Papyrus: Storage and Transition conference – which was concerned with questions of archiving in media contexts – with a theme that in a sense revisits ideas central to the 1999 inaugural meeting, entitled Media in Transition. Twelve years on, the 2011 call for papers also invited contributors to consider issues addressing the constant state of change that defines the contemporary media landscape. Now, however, in an era when the relationship between humans and technology has been changed by (among other things) the formation of social networks – such as Facebook and Twitter – and the process of planned obsolescence of digital systems has been accelerated through a business model developed by Apple’s iPad and iPhone product line, potential speakers were encouraged to more directly address both the pros and the cons of perpetual digital renewal and flux. Certainly, many contributors responded by presenting research on the growing amount of new media platforms, yet others sought to reclaim the importance of analogue media formats in the face of their seeming displacement by more efficient digital ones. Under this mandate, the subjects that could be discussed become understandably broad, fitting perhaps for an academic community faced with the challenge of making sense of the seemingly infinite, and infinitely customisable, modes of digital interaction and consumption. In a sense, the chaos caused by an excess of new and updated systems and digital formats has been an issue for delegates during previous MIT events. Indeed, the 2009 conference on archiving issues did address questions of the potential loss of data held in redundant database formats, and the inherent challenges of migrating digital information as host technologies increasingly require updating. Issues relating to the archive reappeared as a concern in MIT7, both as the framework for some panel sessions and the focus of at least one public forum. Yet within the larger conference theme of ‘Unstable Platforms’ the difficulties of choosing how to preserve archived data, when faced with diverse and competing formats, was accompanied by more fundamental questions about how to ascertain the worth of media objects themselves. While following on from the general discussion of media access and retrieval that characterised the MIT6 conference, MIT7 broadened the scope so that the 2011 panellists were examining issues of categorisation and dissemination in an effort to discover how digital media artefacts are assigned cultural value. Within this context, debates revolved around the desirability of creating digital narratives that are both sustainable and can be",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the growing importance of algorithms in digital culture and what they could mean for the visibility and interpretation of culture as a whole. Taking Google as a prime example of a company that participates in widespread information overload whilst simultaneously providing some algorithmic answers to it, we show how it exhibits four different regimes of justification: the techno-scientific, economic, political and moral–aesthetic. These efforts to gain legitimacy operate as a network that is both highly performative and adaptive. For instance, Google builds on and translates such justifications in order for its Project Glass to be widely, if not universally, accepted. But there is another influential mode of performativity at work: the mounting criticism of the device. In the 18 months following the public announcement of Glass, we have observed the media phenomenon and passionate debate it has sparked. What Glass represents is being contested on multiple grounds, and this, in turn, indicates that its meanings will likely remain profoundly ambiguous for some time to come. </jats:p>",

In both there is the implication that interactivity is about achieving a reflexive relationship between person and machine or between viewer and programme-maker as was explored in Convergence 1, no. 2 (Autumn 1995). Yet to accept this definition is one of the gravest errors we can make about interactivity, and it comes from a lack of precision in the way the term is used.",

Femen is conceptualized as an assemblage (Delanda, 2006; Latour, 2005) of protesting women and various human and non-human, mediatised (Hepp, 2013; Hjarvard, 2008; Lundby 2009) and localized actors. The article suggests that Femen’s protests undergo a dual process of mediatisation that aims to both generate a spreadable imaginary and enable communication between bodies by addressing affective registers. The mediatised ‘affective environment’ (Massumi, 2009) cues bodies and generates spreadability, yet it also produces disconnections. These disconnections might redistribute the ‘economy of recognizability’ (Butler and Athanasiou, 2013); however, the Femen headquarters in Kiev and Paris increasingly provide centralized interpretations of the movement and the localized actions causing the perception of Femen’s activist imaginary to be unfolded between the unrecognizable and the too recognizable body. </jats:p>",

Terrorists? Freedom Fighters? Who, if anybody, has the right to intercept and monitor communications? Corporations? Governments? The security services? This has been a key debate, and the main trigger for discussion was probably the release in June 1991 of PGP, ’Pretty Good Privacy’3 by Phil Zimmermann. The free distribution of this strong encryption technology together with the USA Justice Department investigation that followed it, brought the subject to the attention of those outside mathematics and computer sciences. Based on ideas developed by Diffie and Hellman’ in the 1970s, PGP brought strong encryption to anybody with access to the internet. As one observer commented, ’The genie is out of the bottle’.5 5",

Building on empirical copyright research and game production studies, we look into how game professionals draw the line between illegitimate imitation and accepted inspiration in their daily practice and professional routines. Our findings show that developers disapprove of the wholesale copying of one of a game’s main components – even in the case of the game’s rule set, which is not protected by copyright. However, as soon as a component is slightly adjusted, a complex mix of game features and external circumstances guides their evaluation. In contrast to prevailing copyright debates, though, game professionals reject stricter intellectual property protection, as, from a systemic perspective, they are concerned about innovation and genre development.</jats:p>",

This study is concerned with the unreported case of Cyprus – the last divided country in Europe, with most Greek Cypriots living in the south and most Turkish Cypriots living in the northern part of the island. The study explores two main questions: First, are online experiences of young people in Cyprus shaped by socioeconomic factors, such as gender, education, and income? Second, is ethnicity a defining factor regarding the kinds of activities young people undertake online? Analysis of data obtained by a representative sample survey of about 350 young adult Cypriots aged 18–24 in both communities suggests the existence of a ‘reverse digital divide’, as the more disadvantaged community engages more often in expression, association, and learning online. This finding provides support for the diversification hypothesis that suggests a compensatory or remedial use of the Internet by disadvantaged youths. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Machinic agency and datafication: Labour and value after anthropocentrism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we reassess Marxist notions of labour and value for our datafied societies, where data is allegedly becoming one of the dominant sources of economic value. Our contention is that the existing accounts of value, which assume that value is produced exclusively by human labour, are unable to fully account for the processes of exploitation that take place in our digital platform dominated economy. We begin addressing these shortcomings by critiquing the anthropocentric notion of agency that informs the Marxist account of labour. This notion of agency locates productive activity exclusively in human intentionality. After offering an overview of anthropocentric concepts of labour that still dominate (post-)Marxist theories today, we draw on the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to develop a post-anthropocentric account of agency that we term machinic agency. Machinic agency sees activity as a matter of connectivity between different human and nonhuman actors (technologies, organisms, minerals etc.), which productively combine and amplify their capacities to act. These affective connections precede and shape, but often also completely bypass, human consciousness. We make a case for the concept of machinic agency by comparing it with Actor-Network Theory (ANT), an established theory that conceptualises agency as arising from compositions of both human and nonhuman elements. Our contention is that, unlike ANT, machinic agency is able to collapse both, the distinction between human and nonhuman, and that between mechanism and vitalism. We conclude by suggesting that machinic agency allows us to demonstrate that data capitalism exploits and appropriates not only the surplus value produced by conscious human effort, but also the co-production of affective, technological, and ecological aspects of our existence. </jats:p>",

The research project Mapping Footprints explores alternative means of knowing and making place through a spatial practice which mediatizes heritage conservation sites with archival records. In the context of Elvina site, a heritage place of Aboriginal culture in Sydney, we experiment with a place-making practice where the re-storing of memory renegotiates archived oral histories and the geography of the site. We will look at the role of mediation, performativity, and representation in shaping both the development process and the experience of this augmented, storied landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘Pirates’ and ‘anti-pirates’ have become common concepts in the cultural political debate, as the file-sharing phenomenon is a delicate and disputed subject. The fact that people organize in networks to share data with each other has led film and music companies from all over the world to initiate a number of anti-piracy organizations, assigned to protect the property rights to culture and information. In Sweden, the industrial organization The Swedish Bureau of Anti-Piracy on the one side, and the network The Bureau of Piracy together with The Pirate Party, on the other, play important parts in the prevailing conflict. The purpose of this article is to apply a sociological perspective on the collective act of file sharing. By focusing on the distinctly organized part of file sharing activities as well as on the everyday practices of users, the goal is to describe how the collective action and the production of knowledge, taking place in relation to online piracy, can be understood. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Extensive research has been conducted on social media and fandom, particularly on how digital platforms facilitate community formation and cultural production among fans. However, there remains a gap in understanding how these communities react to and interpret changes such as commercialization or mainstreaming of their platforms. This study addresses this gap by focusing on Bilibili’s danmu culture, a vibrant fan community that is transitioning from a subculture to a mainstream entity. The platform culture lies in danmu, a commentary system that allows for video-superimposed moving texts on the screen. Existing research on danmu mainly focuses on the mediated playful and creative audience participation. However, little is understood about the perception and critical evaluation of danmu commenting within its participatory community. This study investigates the vernacular criticism of danmu amongst users on Bilibili by analyzing user discussions around a remix video called ‘This is danmu culture!’. Findings reveal three overarching themes: nostalgia for past danmu creations, criticism of present danmu practices, and negotiation of danmu culture. Central to these themes is the commenters’ identification as part of an elite fan community that is gradually fading. Bilibili, once a sanctuary for anime, comic, and game enthusiasts, now finds itself caught in the tension between subculture and mainstream audiences, resulting in increasing polarization. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Although the internet is little more than a vast network of computers, it Ithou is often thought of in spatial terms. The very term ’cyberspace’ implies that it is a place, albeit one separate from physical space. While the ’cyberspace as place’ metaphor has evolved since the early days of the internet, its use continues and has been widely adopted by courts as a way to understand the new medium. As a result, the metaphor has led some American courts to treat the internet as a property-based regime and therefore subject to legal doctrines, such as trespass, that are based on real property. This article examines the use of the ’cyberspace as place’ metaphor in the creation of the legal concept of ’cybertrespass’, examines the consequences of the use of that metaphor to the free flow of information on the internet, and evaluates alternative metaphors for understanding the new medium. Metaphors, the That metaphors have been used to understand and describe the internet internet, and the is not surprising. It is natural, when confronted with a new technology, to law draw comparisons between it and more familiar technologies. Understanding comes from drawing parallels and finding common ground with subjects with which one is more familiar, so that the new subject is more approachable because it does not seem as foreign. The use of metaphor, as well as the particular choice of metaphor to understand a subject, influences how that subject is viewed. More than",

These numbers then increase the popularity of the celebrities who present themselves in the videos on the platform. With their far-reaching influence, through involvement in the public sphere as well as broad marketing concepts, they draw in viewers and gain attention worldwide. It can thus be understood that YouTube users also form a bond with the celebrities featured online, as formulated theoretically in the concept of parasocial relationships. In this study, an exploratory online survey examines quantitatively whether these parasocial relationships are predominantly formed with YouTubers via the platform’s feedback channels. As the results show, however, the strength of these parasocial relationships is not influenced to any great extent by use of the feedback functions. </jats:p>",

Development is rooted in the classical DST approach proposed by StoryCenter Founding Director Joe Lambert. Blending theoretical consideration and empirical user testing (individual user observations and a co-creation workshops), we affirm the value of DST – and classical DST especially – for facilitating critical self-reflection and self-branding. By structuring discussion using Lambert’s seven steps of classical DST, we highlight how particular design decisions have promoted enjoyable and effective storytelling, recognizing both user preference and empirically demonstrated usage. This paper is the result of a positive interdisciplinary academic-industrial partnership. </jats:p>",

This paper employs a hybrid critical disability studies – platform media studies lens to explore the SickKids VS campaign, aiming to ‘fight’ childhood illness and disability. Employing a social media thematic analysis, we analyzed social media content distributed through the campaign, consisting of images, videos, and captions ( n=620). We found three dominant narratives: heroic sick kids, crumbling infrastructure, and informational content. Each trend, we argue, emerges within a changing platform mediascape, whereby charitable audiences must be cultivated and curated over a long-term process, rather than in a single moment, as in telethon fundraising. We ask how disability is framed in each of those narratives, and how disability studies might respond to these formulations in the political economy of platform media. We end by exploring the strategies disability studies can take to combat the marginalizing effects of such charitable campaigns. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Reporting on an ethnographic study of youth media production at an action sports camp, this article describes the symbiotic learning partnerships formed between teen skateboarders and teen videographers necessary to collaboratively demonstrate the mastery of both tricks and video capture/editing. Symbiotic learning partnerships emerge when partners are, as one participant says, vibing with one another: when they are deeply invested in the production of a collaborative media artifact that they will jointly distribute across social media. When vibing with one another, skaters and videographers fall into collaborative, rhythmic cycles. This collaborative mastery is illustrated specifically through a focus on the cycles of reflection and nurture that skaters and videographers enter into when honing their respective crafts. This article advances understanding of youth digital media production in the rich, yet understudied, action sports community, drawing out potential implications for the design of digital media learning settings, broadly, that do not urge youth down individual pathways, but instead implement opportunities for symbiotic participation and learning. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Transmedia storytelling, diegetic paratexts, and the limits of real time",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>The category of ‘transmedia story’ is generally assumed to be static. That is, once a multi-platform story world has been classified as transmedia, it is assumed that this classification applies on an ongoing basis. However, these classifications may in fact need to be revisited, particularly when a story is told in ‘real time’ across social platforms that privilege immediacy. In this paper, we examine the relationship between diegetic social media paratexts and the core text they connect to, using the example of in online transmedia story The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. We argue that once the narrative has concluded, the transmedia status of the story becomes problematic, given the effort required to stitch together the different transmedial components. Utilising qualitative and quantitative content analysis, the show is analysed to determine the relationship between the different elements of the text as presented on YouTube and Twitter. The diegetic paratexts distributed through social media site Twitter contribute to the narrative by expanding upon the events of the core text conveyed on YouTube, and providing context – but never resolution – to the plot. The Twitter paratexts are inherently dependent on the core text but are also directional in that audience members must move from one platform to another in order to engage with the full story. Additionally, the temporal model of release for the core text changes the impact of the diegetic paratexts, while limiting the longevity of the transmedia aspects to the text as a result of dispersed narrative and dependency created by the relationship between textual elements. This analysis helps to extend understandings of transmedia storytelling as we propose the concept of ‘transmedia artefacts’, a category for narratives that transform once they are no longer able to be engaged with as live online objects.</jats:p>",

I propose that upgrading steals the narrative of progress that spoke to the cultural effects of emerging technologies informing the original production of the work. Three artworks are examined in order to investigate how self-emulation has effected the evolution of new media artworks: The Helpless Robot by Norman White (1986—2004), Small Artist Pushing Technology (1987—) by Doug Back, and Listening Post (2003—) by Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin. The production of new versions of electronic media works primarily concerns integration with contemporary modes of exhibition and aesthetic trends. However, the materials that generated early electronic media works spoke to the larger discourse of our relationship to technology. This article investigates this dilemma. </jats:p>",

Enthusiasts often assume that digital media must break radically with the aesthetic and cultural traditions of their predecessors. However, new media and new genres are best understood by examining the ways in which they refashion or 'remediate' older forms. Computer graphics, virtual reality, and the World Wide Web define themselves by borrowing from and remediating television, film, photography and painting, as well as print. Virtual reality remediates film as well as perspective painting; digital photography remediates the analogue photograph; the World Wide Web refashions almost every previous visual and textual medium. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones. For example, television is making such extensive use of computer graphics that TV screens often look like pages of the web. </jats:p>",

Indeed, policy settings in Australia have not kept pace with these transformations, one result of which has been that 84% less Australian content was aired on free-to-air commercial broadcasters in 2022 compared to 2019. Key producer bodies fear the sector is in serious peril and may not withstand the current instability. Given that local children’s television meets Australian children’s best interests by situating them within their own socio-cultural context, the issue has become a site of significant policy, industry, and cultural concern. At this precarious time for the Australian children’s television sector, this article outlines key findings of a mixed method study with Australian children aged 7–9 ( n = 37) and their adult guardians to illustrate how children understand, identify, and discover ‘local’ and ‘children’s’ content on streaming platforms. This child audience research contributes to current policy and scholarly debates around the ‘routes to content’ audiences develop in the streaming era. A focus of our analysis is how and if children find Australian content. Our aim is to shed light on how ‘discoverability’ issues compound the current state of turmoil for the sector. We elucidate children’s digital fluencies with platform interfaces but highlight their limited cultural literacies with the content itself, which poses significant implications for industry and policy strategy around local content discoverability for child audiences on streaming platforms. </jats:p>",

While stereoscopy’s multiple optical illusions suggest that objects are within reach of our fingertips or that we are situated in 3D landscapes that stretch back to infinity, these embodied moments are fleeting, ephemeral and transitory. In each case, there is no longer a viewing body opposite, and at a distance from, the screen but constant reconfigurations of a shared screen space. Through particular attention to moments of negative parallax (wherein the content of the moving image appears to come towards the audience), this article addresses the implications that these points have for a fundamental ontology of the 3D film. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research on the media industries has been centrally concerned with the blurring of boundaries between production and reception in an era of digitalization and convergence. The article argues for a need for research to consider more closely the importance of notions of the ‘active audience’ within today’s media industries. Overall conceptual work has been done on ‘convergence culture’, and much scholarly debate currently centres around the pros and cons of convergence; whether it empowers ‘produsers’ or the industries themselves. Important as they are, these debates run the risk of stagnation if they are not informed by further empirical research on the concrete ways that media institutions put ‘activity’ to strategic use. The article reports from a survey on how notions of activity, sociability and technological novelty function as strategic ‘working notions’ for Norwegian media industry executives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last decade, questions regarding the implications of digitalization and convergence have dominated European media debates. One aspect of the debate has concerned regulation: to what degree would existing regulations have to be modified in order to accommodate digital production and distribution technologies? In this article we examine the arguments for regulatory change from the mid- and late 1990s and show that the actual changes have not been as far-reaching as predicted. We will argue that this reflects a general pattern in media development whereby the forces of stability and continuity are often underestimated and too much emphasis is placed on factors pointing towards change. The article draws on empirical evidence from the European Union, Britain and the Scandinavian countries Norway and Sweden. </jats:p>",

Using the theoretical contributions of medium theory, specifically the concept of media ‘bias’ as developed by Harold Innis, the article situates the extraordinary ephemerality of today's digital texts against the widespread cultural preoccupation with the present and with short-term concerns. In this manner, the celebratory rhetoric surrounding the internet's capacity to transmit information instantaneously and potentially to serve as a repertoire of our shared cultural heritage is problematized. </jats:p>",

Subjectivity is a central element in this analysis, which responds to the social and contextual nature of meaning as engendered in reception. The present analysis discusses both topoi and temporality of interaction in the production, use and revision of computer media applications, and differentiates experienced interaction in terms of the immediate application as well as that application as a representation of its designer. This analysis further supports the differentiation of degrees of apparent intersubjectivity as an index of the comprehensiveness of interactivity displayed by an application. As such, interactivity is discussed as a possible quality of communication. This approach extends and develops historically significant conceptions of mediated interactivity. In the discussion three such conceptions are reviewed and correlated with historical developments in models of computation. </jats:p>",

Consumers are accessing and engaging with a range of broadcast, print, on-demand and wider digital content. Yet the standards (if any) applied to these services are marked by inconsistency and fail to enable citizens to make informed, democratic choices across media platforms. This short article proposes a managed transition towards a new settlement for legacy and digital media regulation. Clear, tiered standards marks would denote three categories of cross-platform provision, ranging from comprehensive statutory requirements for public service providers; voluntary incentivized standards for non-public service providers and base line minimum standards consistent with those currently required for audiovisual content. This article argues that together, media providers, regulators, consumers and legislators have the opportunity to shape a democratic agenda that recognizes the contribution made by journalism (and wider content), values the public space it inhabits and renews the regulation that sustains it. </jats:p>",

Combining structural analysis of the MCN industry with an assessment of its cultural impacts, I show how Google’s decision to open the YouTube back-end to third-party intermediaries is subtly changing the digital video ecology. </jats:p>",

    "title": "(Near)ubiquitous connectivity is seductive",
    "abstract": "Wifi, 3G and other wireless technologies have raised our expectations of connectivity and as a result irrevocably changed our social interactions. We can, as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and my email inboxes tell me, connect as an individual to more people more directly than we have ever been able to do so before. But if communication is liberated though new technologies, who holds the reins of responsibility? Investigating this question reveals a complexity of professional practices, which are explored in this issue of Convergence. One of the advantages of wireless for us is the ability to access the virtual world from different devices. For example I can read a book in the coffee queue on a portable HTC phone or on the train on an outsized (A4) kindle with its ability to enlarge the type. When synced, I can pick up the page anywhere I can connect to the wifi. This means that the text becomes independent of the physical device but the reading experience is not. As a reader I have a material connection with the screendevice I read the book on. David Beer reminds us in his debates piece that the physicality of mobile devices should not be ignored. Such devices are ‘objects with which individuals may develop an attachment’ and he argues that ‘these connections are actually an important part of how mobile media have become such a prominent and embedded part of contemporary life’. Beer’s debate is thought provoking and can be read next to Kurt Squires and Seann Dikkers’s positive investigation into the use of mobile media devices among young adults to amplify learning in this issue. Squires and Dikkers show how access to mobile devices is deeply tied to personal power for these young adults as they found they were ‘able to function more effectively to meet their goals with employers, teachers, and peers’ (p. 445). The ownership of the physical object – even temporarily – was a part of this feeling of empowerment. Investigating the question of who holds the reins of responsibility when communication is liberated by technology, Fan Dong analyses the complexity of professional practices controlling the internet in China. Her interesting study describes five layers ‘ranging from the government,",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this feature article two DIY (do-it-yourself) film projects are examined from perspectives of resemiosis (transformations in meaning-making) and the textual production practices of contemporary multimedia authorship. These practices are considered as evolving in a complex media ecology. The two films analysed are Gzim Rewind (Sweden, 2011) by Knutte Wester, and In-World War (USA, expected 2011) by DJ Bad Vegan. The films are currently in production and involve many collaborators. Both films have themes of war and include film scenes that are ‘machinima’ – real-time animation made in 3D graphic environments – within live action film scenes. Machinima harnesses the possibilities of reappropriating digital software, game engines, and other tools available in digital media. War-related stories are resemiotized in the machinima film scenes as meanings are transformed in the story’s shift from a war game context to a film context. Thus machinima exemplifies how DIY multimedia storytellers explore new ways to tell and to ‘animate’ stories. The article contains four parts: an introduction to machinima and the notions of resemiosis and authorial practice; a presentation of DIY filmmaking as a practice that intertwines with new networked economics; an analysis of the two DIY film projects; and a discussion of implications including issues relating to IP (intellectual property) and copyrights when reappropriating digital assets from commercial media platforms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The rise in use of social media platforms as tools of communication has presented journalists with an abundance of opportunities and challenges in equal measure. These platforms have enabled journalists to engage directly with their readers and develop new forms of interactivity, both pertinent and banal in nature. By analysing the content of multiple social media profiles at two daily regional newspapers in the United Kingdom, it has been possible to determine how interactivity between journalists and readers is being shaped. This article has identified a spectrum of interactivity, which indicates that individual journalists are engaging with their readers in an informal, personal and reciprocal manner via social media platforms. This is in contrast to the formal approach being taken by their associated media companies that are transferring traditional top–down forms of communication from the offline world to the online world. Research for this article was conducted via interviews and content analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This essay argues that the contemporary media paradigm is defined by an infinite character and scale that emerge from the confluence of infinite-prone economic, technological, and cultural logics. Thus, it discusses the emergence, consolidation, and expansion of a state in which the media landscape and experience are assumed as practically infinite in its different dimensions, from the institutional to the cultural perspective. The argument of this article is based on the analysis of two cases: the deployment of an infinite production model in the media industry, particularly Hollywood; and the implementation of an infinite experience of approaching digital media, especially social media and streaming platforms. The essay maintains that the development of this clearly observable paradigm in media has granted the current possibility of having effectively infinite media and suggests that this propensity towards infinity in media could increase through the implementation of resources such as those offered by generative AI.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: #NSFW: Sex, Humor, and Risk in Social Media",
    "abstract": "The cover image of #NSFW: Sex, Humor, and Risk in Social Media features the acronym #NSFW in bold red cutting across a lime green background, the subtitle in white capital letters. It hurts the eyes to look at, clashing garishly, tempting you to turn away. It’s an excellent illustration of how the hashtag ‘Not Safe For Work’ is used on social media: as a tag and a term that organises and regulates sexual content, but also marks sex and sexuality as something exciting, but dangerous; attracting attention while serving as a warning. The authors of #NSFW have considerable expertise in media studies, digital culture, social media, pornography, sexuality and gender: Susanna Paasonen is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Turku; Kylie Jarrett is Associate Professor of Media Studies at the National University of Ireland Maynooth; and Ben Light is Professor of Digital Society at the University of Salford. Together, they interrogate the role of the NSFW tag in Internet culture, politics and economics. When content is tagged NSFW, it is marked to both people and platforms as adult, sexual and appropriate only for private consumption. This marker reinforces understandings of sex and sexuality as inherently risky, instead of an integral part of the human experience. The book takes on topics from hashtags to pornography to dick pics as it makes three core arguments about what the social media tag NSFW does. First, the tag classifies content and draws boundaries around whether it is allowed on a platform or whether it will be filtered out or deleted. Second, the tag engages people by playfully attracting attention, conflating sex and risk when promising something daring to look at. Thirdly, NSFW is a framing device that allows analysis of social media, work, risk and safety. This third argument is a particularly strong feature of the book. The authors productively problematise assumptions contained within the phrase ‘Not Safe For Work’, taking on the different ways that safety and work intersect to ask whose work, and whose safety, is valued in the labour of porn performers; public relations work for Pornhub, amateur porn production; humour leveraged as a way to entrench workplace power; workplace hookups and romances; workplace harassment; content moderation on social media platforms; sex work performed on, or facilitated through, social media; and even the work of researching the NSFW as part of an academic job.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Why do cinematic technologies, though promoted as 'utopian' and 'progressive', ultimately repeat earlier cultural/Visual practices? To answer this question, this paper examines cinema's integration of new technologies. It proposes that nineteenth-century institutions such as the insurance industry and the railroad provide cinema with a strategic model for choosing and regulating new cinematic technologies. To investigate this hypothesis, the paper overlays film history's three most important technological transitions: cinema's 'invention' in 1895, sound's standardisation in the 1920s, and the contemporary integration of computer-generated images (CGI). By examining the history of each technology and the film texts they produce, the paper reveals an institutional pattern of technological assimilation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In a shorter, two-chapter, review of mobile communications, McKnight, Lehr and Linsenmayer focus on new generation high capacity services, comparing longer distance Third Generation Cellular (3G) technologies and services with those of the shorter-reach unlicensed, WiFi, also known as wireless local area network technology. The authors stress the primacy of market forces wherever possible in developments, recommending innovative approaches to spectrum allocation, such as the use of secondary markets. An interesting finding is that voice service revenue on its own will not sustain third generation services. This holds significant implications for the rollout of such services who will be able to afford them? Webbink considers spectrum use in communications markets addressing USA proposals to provide terrestrial wireless services within spectrum used by, or reserved for, satellite services, as well as the 2000 ORBIT Act.’ The author finds that, in general, it is desirable to give private companies as much property rights as possible and concludes that the 2000 ORBIT Act’s prohibition of auctions for international satellite services should end.",

    "abstract": "We may well wonder. As makers of anything virtual will tell you, middle spaces and interstices are fragile things, apt to buckle at the slightest touch of the reality principle. Imagination will only take you so far in this business; the rest is, well, business. These days most people engaged with information technology concern themselves less with visions of human identity than with social impact and economic productivity. Witness Thomas K. Landauer’s enormously important book, The Trouble With Computers,4 wherein serious questions are raised about the practical value of hypertext and other things digital. This from the man who helped design Superbook, the only hypertext system that is demonstrably more effective than print. Unfortunately, Superbook seems to be an exception. According to Landauer most large enterprises have accepted information technology much in the way Coupland suggests, as an object of existential desire. They would have done better to put their money in the bond market. Things are looking a little stressful down in the lab.",

While developments in media technology are generating progressively smaller, more personalised distribution platforms, onto which the transfer of large screen content is currently performed. Mobile gaming, mobile film, and mobile television content viewing are increasingly marketed as extensions to traditional distribution means. Given the drastically different viewing and distribution mediums of the large and small screens, it is useful to investigate the effectiveness of this practice on the reception of content and audience viewing experience. Results showed that while basic understanding was not lost on a small-screen viewing platform, a significant reduction of overall experience was noted. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Troubleshooting the connected home: Exploring the perspectives of non-initiators",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Living with technology often entails work related to management and repair of it. The emerging literature on the work that goes into managing home networks and digital technologies has described it as ‘digital housekeeping’. Within this literature, a single person is often identified as being responsible for the domestic tech work and this is the same person who initiated bringing the technology into the home. However, remaining household members and persons who have been gifted with such technologies are under-researched, despite studies showing them to be vulnerable to skewed power dynamics and technical malfunctions when the responsible person is not around. Applying digital housekeeping as a theoretical lens, this article explores how people identified as ‘non-initiators’, that is, those living with smart home technologies but who did not initiate bringing the technology into their home, deal with malfunctioning devices. Drawing upon interviews with five identified non, this study provides an in-depth exploration of their troubleshooting routines conceptualized as diagnosing, performing, and delegating. Findings suggest that non-initiators also engage in digital housekeeping through troubleshooting, although this work is largely unacknowledged by themselves and others. Moreover, the image of non-initiators as vulnerable is nuanced by highlighting their active participation in the connected home. Non-initiators use smart home devices for daily activities, and they have the knowledge, skills, and resources to draw upon when encountering malfunctions. Furthermore, the non-initiators’ troubleshooting routines are affected by the devices’ materiality, the household’s social dynamics, and to some degree by societal perceptions of technology, age, and gender. This paper contributes to the existing literature on smart homes and digital housekeeping by emphasizing non-initiators’ contribution to digital housekeeping and by highlighting how their agency is asserted in line with their interests and needs. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> French experience of the Minitel videotex system introduced in the 1980s created a culture of awareness in French society of new information technologies. In France, the Internet and the coming 'information superhighway' build on established practices, but challenge both society and State because of their USA/Anglophone origins and because of the demand-led anarchy of the proliferation of services in the highly regulated French audio-visual sector. At the same time, the egalitarianism of the Internet can be useful to the French State, improving access to information in a society theoretically based on meritocracy but where knowledge and culture are highly centralised. This paper looks firstly at the history and use of Minitel (a now ageing national technology developed by the French State), and secondly, examines the growth in Internet use in France and the attendant problems. It then analyses issues of culture and public policy vis-à-vis the Internet which are challenging French 'exceptionalism', and concludes by assessing the way France's plans for the information superhighway reveal how she hopes to defend her cultural identity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Professional sport has entered the digital economy as organisations adopt data-driven business model innovations. The purpose of this article is to highlight the potential ethical vulnerabilities sport organisations and their leaders face when adopting digital sport business models. Here, we treat data as a species of capital that can be converted into economic capital once it undergoes a computational transformation via a data-driven business model innovation. We argue for two advantages in this approach. First, it helps make transparent the mechanisms through which digital sport business models work. Second, it reveals how the extraction and application of big data exacerbates inequitable power relationships between sport organisations and supporters – the big data divide – that leads to ethical vulnerabilities for sport organisations and their consumers. We suggest that sport consumers might be particularly vulnerable to digital data risk as a consequence of their high levels of brand loyalty and involvement, which tend to encourage trust in the sport properties soliciting, analysing, and monetising their data. Platform broadcasting partnerships, e-ticketing in smart stadiums, and cryptocurrency-based fan tokens are used as examples of data-driven business model innovations based on the conversion of data to capital, demonstrating how sport organisations risk violating the trust of supporters when using digital strategies. The article concludes with directions for future research to deliver an ethically informed data-driven sports industry. </jats:p>",

I discuss how algorithmic practices of placemaking govern and control mobilities. I theorize such practices as the ‘algorithmic fix’, where location determination technologies, data practices, and machine learning algorithms are used together to ‘get a fix on’ our whereabouts with the aim of sorting and classifying both people and places. Through a case study of location intelligence, I demonstrate how these digital placemaking practices do not only control and prevent physical mobilities – they are designed to fix who we are and whom we may become with the aim of creating a predictable future. I focus on geo-profiling, geo-fencing, and predictive policing as three key aspects of location intelligence to present a discussion of how ‘algorithmic fix’ as a framework can provide valuable insights to analyzing contemporary placemaking practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In a time of deep mediatization, cross-media approaches to investigating media practices are becoming increasingly relevant. In this respect, we have to consider cross-media from at least two different perspectives. The first perspective considers the ‘individual’ whose cross-media use can be characterized as a particular ‘media repertoire’. The second refers to ‘social domains’ (collectivities and organizations) that can be analysed as communicative figurations characterized by a particular ‘media ensemble’. We propose to interlace both perspectives to help clarify the conceptual and empirical relationship between media use by individuals, on the one hand, and as part of the figuration of a social domain, on the other. From the perspective of the individual, media repertoires are composed of media-related communicative practices that individuals use to relate themselves to the figurations that they are involved in. From the perspective of these figurations, media ensembles are characterized by the media-related communicative practices of the actors involved in them. We argue that a methodological triangulation of media diaries, (group) interviews and sorting techniques is a productive way forward to qualitatively investigate both these perspectives.</jats:p>",

    "title": "The Digital Face and Deepfakes on Screen",
    "abstract": "Though long fundamental to portraiture, cinema, television, and surveillance, the human face is emerging as a central object of critical ambivalence in the digital era. Tensions across the face’s many functions as biological fact and image, as social identity marker, as interface between private self and public space, as site of self-revelation, as mask, and as commodity, are increasingly troubled. On the one hand, the face’s biometric coordinates act as passwords for devices, and identity markers to track our activities and movements through security checkpoints and shopping malls. On the other, the face as image and its intimate, inviolable connection to the human subject is becoming more and more fluid and unstable, due to the rise of digital imaging and manipulation technologies. The transformative and transfiguring powers of makeup and masks have long been with us, but on our screens, both large and intimate, the face can now be filtered, copied, iterated, deaged, deepfaked, and swapped, with or without our permission. The digital face is now a central figure and a key question for everything from big budget Hollywood blockbusters and the porn industry to mundane face apps for the idly curious. De-aged actors with million-dollar digital faces populate our cinema screens, legal battles are waged over non-consensual face replacement, while video calls are disrupted by pranksters with novelty face filters. Since journalist Samantha Cole (2017) drew our attention to the ease and speed with which digital likenesses could be created, and revealed nonconsensual celebrity face swap porn in the grubbier corners of the internet, deepfakes have accrued much public concern. Jordan Peele’s deepfake Barack Obama PSA (2018) spawned a multitude of opinion pieces about how the specter of political deepfakes threaten democracy and further undermine already shaky notions of truth and",

However, the central aim of this study is to analyze the development of these functions in the new media sphere by identifying music promotion practices on Facebook. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with local music industry professionals in Estonia, two sets of promotional approaches have been identified: brand-centered approaches and community-oriented approaches. The findings indicate a continuing convergence of autonomous music criticism and music promotion across many dimensions and the presence of “promotional gatekeeping” as a form of business activity in small creative industries. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the opportunities afforded by the growing use of drones, their civilian use causes concern as they can capture, share and store images of events and people following a set of norms still in development. The main challenges risen by drone usage relates mainly to existing gaps in regulation and the difficulty to enforce approved guidelines. Further changes and implementation of drone legislation will broadly affect current applications and future opportunities shaping the way civilians will be allowed to use drones. This article explores these issues qualitatively, analysing (i) civilian users’ and developers’ views on drone usage, (ii) their knowledge of relevant regulations and (iii) how they imagine its use should be regulated. In its conclusion, this article discusses the general concern of potential privacy infringements and the importance to take into account civilians’ thoughts in further implementation of drone law in order to protect recreational practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay addresses two questions on the topic of podcast innovation. The first, ‘What is a podcast?’ is answered via a review of the literature, investigating podcasting history and its evolution. The definition of podcasting arising from this analysis – centring on episodic audio, convenient both to produce and experience – takes into account recent changes, providing an up-to-date description of the term, useful for further research on the topic. It is also required to answer our second question: ‘How do we design new ways to produce and listen to podcasts without denaturing the medium?’ By reflecting on the essential features of podcasting and the necessity for innovation in this interdisciplinary medium, a framework of six-tensions is proposed as a means of grounding and potentially boosting innovation. Answering these questions could prove valuable for the future of podcasting, hypothesising a basis for reflection and development in both academia and industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do technology firms compete to colonize the urban future? This article theorizes technology patents as a medium of urban futuring. Patents secure legal exclusion by disclosing an idea or invention. However, the incentive structures behind patents are ambiguous. Patent holders must articulate inventions with enough technical specificity to warrant a property claim while remaining strategically imprecise enough to capture unanticipated future uses. I build on the Foucaultian theory of the diagram to discuss patents' interplay of disclosure and secrecy as a strategic anticipatory practice for colonizing urban futures. Whereas modern urban governance operated on spatial form to discipline citizens, smart city technology patents reflect a splintering of technical capacity and control. In the empirical section, I analyze three patent-diagrams: the first for a Wi-Fi-enabled advertising system, the second for a notification system for autonomous vehicles, and the third for an algorithmic predictive policing platform. These examples show that at a fundamental level, smart city technologies are less discrete inventions than claims to the capacity to influence human–machinic interactions. The article concludes with a reflection on how critical urbanists can learn from technology patents to advance more democratic and publicly oriented visions for the city. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A growing body of academic work on internet governance focuses on the ‘deplatforming of sex’, or the removal and suppression of sexual expression from the internet. Often, this is linked to the 2018 passing of FOSTA/SESTA – much-criticized twin bills that make internet intermediaries liable for content that promotes or facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. We suggest analyzing both internet governance and the deplatforming of sex in conjunction with long-term agendas of conservative lobbying groups. Specifically, we combine media historiography, policy analysis, and thematic and discourse analysis of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation’s (NCOSE, formerly Morality in Media) press releases and media texts to show how conservative moral entrepreneurs weaponize ideas of morality, obscenity, and harm in internet governance. We illustrate how NCOSE has, directly and indirectly, interfered in internet governance, first by lobbying for rigorous enforcement of obscenity laws and then for creating internet-specific obscenity laws (which we argue CDA, COPA, and FOSTA/SESTA all were for NCOSE). We show how NCOSE adjusted their rhetoric to first link pornography to addiction and pedophilia and later to trafficking and exploitation; how they took advantage of the #metoo momentum; mastered legal language, and incorporated an explicit anti-internet stance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the rhetoric of Twitter.com in order to gain insight into the company’s normative self-understanding, or ethos. From a business ethics perspective, we analyze Twitter’s ethos in relation to debates around democratic communication and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Partly thanks to its CSR strategy, Twitter has acquired the critical mass of users necessary to successfully establish a robust and financially viable social network. Despite its success, however, we argue that Twitter does not sufficiently address three ethical implications of its strategy: (1) from an ethical perspective, Twitter mainly seems to employ an ‘instrumental CSR’ ethos that fails to properly recognize the moral rights, responsibilities, and strategic challenges of corporate actors with regard to their stakeholders; (2) this issue becomes all the more pressing because online social networks to a certain extent have taken on the role of quasi-governmental bodies today, regulating what their users can and cannot do, thus raising questions of accountability and legitimacy; and (3) in Twitter’s case, this leads to normative tension between the site's rhetoric, which is centered around civic motives, and the way its Terms of Service and licensing policies seem to favor its commercial stakeholders over its noncommercial ones. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent scholarship has established that conspiracist narratives proliferated in mainstream online discourse during the coronavirus pandemic. This proliferation has been provocatively characterized as a ‘conspiracy singularity’ in which previously divergent conspiracy narratives converged into a single, overarching narrative. Yet while the idea of narrative convergence has long figured in conspiracy theory research, empirical evidence has been scarce. The present article aims to address this gap by means of an investigation of an archive containing over 470,000 conspiracy-related Instagram posts from 2020. Given the size and conceptual complexity of the dataset, the paper introduces a ‘digital hermeneutics’ approach, which combines data science methods with qualitative interpretation and theorization. Operating across three levels of observation (hashtag analysis, text analysis, and image analysis) we identify patterns of convergence among different conspiracy narratives (including anti-vax, QAnon, anti-5G, and ‘The Great Reset’) over the year 2020 as well as the apparent role of protagonists and antagonists (notably Donald Trump and Bill Gates) in creating connections. In interpreting these findings we focus on the concept of ‘the Deep State’ as a bridge between various conspiracist narratives, which seems to cut diagonally across political ideologies.</jats:p>",

The main body of the article presents quantitative and qualitative data from the study, focusing on the ways in which children learn to use new technologies, parental regulation in the home and the role of new technologies in sustaining peer group cultures. The analysis therefore aims to situate the use of computers within wider social and cultural contexts and practices.

    "abstract": "his issue of Convergence begins with a reflection on and response to our Winter 2003 issue (guest edited by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith and Peter Thomas) on digital cinema or ’d-Cinema’ as Michael Punt terms it. Punt warns against adopting a reductive approach to the relationship between technology and culture, arguing that it can distort our analysis of how new technologies and the public interact. In the current discussions around d-Cinema he sees a potentially fruitful opportunity to develop and move forward our thinking about new media technologies. Although Punt is specifically addressing the debates on digital cinema, his concern with the interaction between cultural activity and technology forms the focus of the other pieces in this issue. In particular there is a growing interest in the phenomenon of mobile phones so much so that",

    "abstract": "role in their emergence at the Information Processing Techniques Office, an arm of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, during the 1960s and 1970s. The next chapter uses the concept and discussion of ‘diagrams’, drawn from Foucault, Deleuze and others, to explain daemons’ changing duties in the transition to the contemporary Internet. Diagrams, we learn, are, in briefest terms, what dictate how daemons manage information flows and share data between them. The subsequent section includes a pertinent discussion of some Internet service providers’ investment in increasingly sophisticated daemons that work to tier forms of Internet use (Chapter 4). It is in these pages that the politics surrounding daemons come to the fore. This is especially the case in the author’s discussion of polychromous optimization, ‘where infrastructures progressively tak[e] on greater management capacities’ (p. 115). The upshot? Activities like file sharing are deprioritized, ‘illuminat[ing] the difficult relationship between net neutrality and the internet infrastructure industry’ (p. 133). This tiered system has implications for how users experience the Internet. As McKelvey highlights in an affective analysis of five commercials, frustration, loneliness and boredom are common portrayals of how users respond to slow load times (Chapter 5). (Many readers can likely relate.) But is the solution, as the advertisements suggest, to switch Internet service providers? Chapter 6 examines attempts to ‘elude’ flow control, specifically efforts by The Pirate Bay. These endeavours can be perilous and highlight the importance of regulatory oversight on this policy issue. Among other suggestions, Chapter 7 prompts decision makers to consider the importance of Internet measurement tools (which are helpfully explored further in the appendix) that can reliably identify tiered practices. This section also calls for a more engaged public in these policy debates, though it rightly identifies some of the challenges engaged citizens face in doing so. Internet Daemons is a helpful introduction to ‘daemonic media studies’, and its wide-ranging methods and analyses are welcome. While the metaphor of the daemon is engaging and useful, one limitation for non-technical readers could be, in some instances, difficulty in distinguishing between the illustration and the actuality. Perhaps McKelvey also could have gone further to actively recommend tangible ways that users can become engaged in contemporary Internet policy debates. Even so, this is precocious read, and one that will surely inform and instruct future studies of Internet daemons.",

    "title": "Sound, materiality and embodiment challenges for the concept of ‘musical expertise’ in the age of digital mediatization",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Within academic music research, ‘musical expertise’ is often employed as a ‘moderator variable’ when conducting empirical studies on music listening. Prevalent conceptualizations typically conceive of it as a bundle of cognitive skills acquired through formal musical education. By implicitly drawing on the paradigm of the Western classical live concert, this ignores that for most people nowadays, the term ‘music’ refers to electro-acoustically generated sound waves rendered by audio or multimedia electronic devices. Hence, our article tries to challenge the traditional musicologist’s view by drawing on empirical findings from three more recent music-related research lines that explicitly include the question of media playback technologies. We conclude by suggesting a revised musical expertise concept that extends from the traditional dimensions and also incorporates expertise gained through ecological perception, material practice and embodied listening experiences in the everyday. Altogether, our contribution shall draw attention to growing convergences between musicology and media and communications research. </jats:p>",

    "title": "In the event of a variable text",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Walter J Ong argues: ‘The spoken word is always an event, a movement in time, completely lacking in the thing-like repose of the written or printed word’. Digital writing has given rise to a new regime of enunciation in which written words refuse repose. This essay argues that although spoken, written and printed words operate within radically different temporal planes, spoken words also have thing-like properties and written and printed words also move through time. Digital writing has given rise to a new regime of signification unforeseen by Ong in which written words refuse repose. Jay David Bolter argues that digital writing ‘challenges the logocentric notion that writing should be merely the servant of spoken language…The writer and reader can create and examine structures on the computer screen that have no easy equivalent in speech’. N Katherine Hayles argues that, in digital media, the text ‘becomes a process, an event brought into existence when the program runs…The [text] is “eventilized,” made more an event and less a discrete, self-contained object with clear boundaries in space and time’. Jean-Jacques Lecercle argues that language is a constructed system, constantly subject to change…‘We therefore need to conceive of language not as a stable, arrested system, but as a system of variations’. This essay draws upon a diverse corpus of literary, media and performance theory and practice to establish a critical framework for examining the performance of variable texts throughout the entire apparatus of hardware, software, networks, bodies and spaces within and through which they operate and propagate. This framework is applied to a number of examples of digital writing which incorporates variability, instability, transformation and change into the process of composition, resulting in texts which are both physical and digital, confusing and confound boundaries between speaking, writing and reading. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> New media platforms offer diverse modes of mediation of every day and tourist places and communities. Spatial social media now augment older forms of mediation, partly by enabling contributions from ‘ordinary’ users, who create and share spatial discourses. This study examines the discursive construction of peripheral places, produced through user-generated content. Employing qualitative methodology, we sample and analyze 1,053 texts, shared on Google Maps in southern regions of Israel. The key conclusions suggest that compared to traditional media discourses depicting peripheral spaces in Israel, the findings demonstrate a shift from homogeneous depictions to more diverse and multilayered ones. Digital affordances result in more actors and stakeholders partaking in discursive construction, including private and institutional local players, visitors and tourists. Theoretical contributions are offered to the field of digital placemaking, by considering the subjective, evaluative and ideological layers that augment geographical data digital maps provide (‘bottom-up’ perspective), and to the fields of study of marginalized peripheral and rural communities and tourism crisis in peripheral (post-Coronavirus) locations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This extended Debates section brings together a collection of articles based on papers presented at the symposium ‘Transmedia Generation: On Empowered and Impassioned Audiences in the Age of Media Convergence’, which took place on 18 June 2012 in Prague, Czech Republic. The event was sprinkled with stardust thanks to the participation of Henry Jenkins. In spite of (or rather because of) Jenkins’ appearance, we tried to avoid straightforwardly uniform reverberation of his key thesis about the creative potential of media audiences. On the contrary, the symposium – as well as this Debates section – took the appearance of Jenkins’ paradigmatic figure as an opportunity for sparking a discussion. Not that there is any shortage of it. The study of media audiences’ agency has been fully saturated with polemic. The dispute over audiences’ self-determination as opposed to external structural determination has been long impersonated in the controversy between cultural studies and critical theory/political economy. Reflecting the sociological matrix of the dilemma between structure and agency, mirrored in the dichotomy of ‘structuralism’ and ‘culturalism’ in cultural studies coined by Stuart Hall (1986: 33–48), revived a countless number of times (Kellner, 1995; McGuigan, 1992), and having survived attempts for integration (Babe, 2011), the clash between cultural studies and critical theory still shapes the field and produces an ongoing polemic. Despite the long-lasting exchange, the borderline separating the two paradigmatic camps does not seem to shift – there has been no consensus and neither of the two paradigms has prevailed. It seems that the polemic between cultural studies and critical theory is showing its limits; the disparity of perspectives concentrated on structures on one hand and actors on the other is so vast",

According to Leggett, work was selected on the basis that it ’explored and developed the aesthetic possibilities of the interactive encounter’,’ with a focus on those CD-ROMs which did not necessarily reach a conclusion. The selection criteria excluded both traditional games-style pieces and portfolio CD-ROMs, preferring instead to choose work which addressed more fully questions surrounding the way the participant is engaged by the computer.2 2",

    "title": "There is no cure: Paratexts as remediations of agency in Red Dead Redemption 2",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Towards the end of Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), the main character Arthur Morgan contracts tuberculosis. The videogame is set in the United States in 1899, a time when many died from the respiratory infection. The videogame does not provide a cure for the disease, nor does it show when the contagion happens. It is presented as the consequence of an invisible action. Combining auto-ethnographic analysis with (para-)textual readings, in this article, I articulate my engagement with the game and with YouTube videos in which players claim to have identified a strategy to save Arthur. I argue that these paratextual practices address, without fully resolving, an affective response that originates from an unresolved reading of the videogame ( Consalvo, 2016 ; Genette, 1987 ). The videos on Arthur’s sickness remediate (in the double sense of restoring upon and healing) players’ agency ( Bolter and Grusin, 1999 ). I argue that this imagination of a restoration of the player’s agency insists on two levels: a narrative level, interpreted as a navigable database of events, and on the environment, seen as a ‘gamespace’ of resources and non-player characters to exploit or keep at distance ( Jennings, 2019 ; Stang, 2019 ; Anikina, 2020 ; Wark 2007 ). The duration of the auto-ethnography overlaps with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article concludes by exploring some recent mediations of the virus, observing how they restore a view of human agency that runs parallel to that which players of Red Dead Redemption 2 have articulated in a much more marginal context. The case studies, although diverse in nature, gravity and scale, shed light on the variety of contexts in which agency is negotiated, on the affective potential of these negotiations, and on the pervasiveness of white and able-bodied normativity in contemporary digital culture. </jats:p>",

The successful project illustrated the importance of local editorial control within the community newspaper model, as well as the potential of journalism to build positive community processes and structures during such projects. A survey of people who bought or read the first new edition also revealed an unexpectedly high capacity, given current received wisdom of 'the digital divide', within the financially-depressed town's residents to use emerging digital technologies to receive news and informational content. When coupled with data gathered from other recent surveys of news technology use, the authors identify key areas for future research into news distribution. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of remediation can help explain the cultural economy of the World Wide Web. As developed in a recently published book (co-authored with Jay Bolter), remediation refers to the way in which new digital media refashion prior media forms. Digital media like computer graphics, virtual reality, and the web define themselves by borrowing from, paying homage to, critiquing, and refashioning their predecessors, principally television, film, photography, and painting, but also print. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones within the same media economy. Remediation seems to be a fundamental characteristic not only for contemporary media, but for all visual media at least since the Renaissance with its invention of linear-perspective painting. Each medium seems to follow this pattern of borrowing and refashioning other media, and rivalry as well as homage seems always to be at work. In this paper I take up the cultural economy of the web in relation to three competing conceptual frameworks for making sense of new digital media: cyberspace, ubiquitous computing, and mediated public space. In so doing I hope to move towards an analysis of the cultural economy of the heterogenous networks within which digital media circulate and areconsumed. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / This article examines the contested issue of player productivity, with a focus on the multifaceted relations between players and the game industry. These relations are explored using the movie studio simulation The Movies (Lionhead Studios, 2005) as a case study. Firstly, through an examination of the game, some of the prevailing game industry's practices, and their relations to the ones applied amongst other creative industries (particularly the film industry) are introduced. Secondly, the game, and especially the accompanying moviemaking editor, is analysed from the perspective of `transformative play'. Further, the reasons behind, and consequences of, allowing the players to make and distribute short movies of their own are contemplated. Finally the article addresses the mechanisms of control and reward that are applied by the corporate actors in relation to The Movies. The article suggests that in the age of commodified play, players face trade-offs all the time. Therefore, the study of rules that has become central in game studies has to be expanded to the `out-game rules' defined by the corporate players. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We live in a society where concepts of self, community and 'what is right and wrong' are constantly changing. Consequently, there is a need for learning environments that encourage young people to actively explore their identity as well as the personal and social values they live by. Computational tools have the potential to foster learning about these issues. However, there has been little research in this area. This paper shows how online collaborative environments can serve as tools to facilitate young people's thinking about moral and identity issues. The paper describes two pilot experiences in which bilingual middle and high school students and their teachers, in five different sites around the world, used Kaleidostories, a web-based narrative tool to support the formation of a virtual community to exchange stories about shared values and role models. The goal of this research project is to explore how new technologies can assist young people to discover their own selves as well as the underlying patterns of thought and behaviour that connect the worldviews proposed by different cultures. The project shows how teachers were able to use the online community to complement and augment their face to face activities and interactions by integrating Kaleidostories into different curricular content areas. </jats:p>",

    "title": "When digital inequalities meet digital disconnection: Studying the material conditions of disconnection in rural Turkey",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital inequalities research has lacked a focus on voluntary non-use and its consequences, whereas digital disconnection studies have focused on non-use but neglected the material implications of digital inequalities. Located at the intersection between these two approaches, this article relies on twelve semi-structured interviews, observations and informal dialogues to examine digital media uses, inequalities and the meanings of disconnection in a village of rural Turkey. The findings show that the main inequalities are due to infrastructure, geography and socio-economic conditions. These inequalities shape the practices and meanings of digital disconnection, revealing obstacles, frustrations and a forced kind of disconnection that is very different from the romantic portrayal of detox retreats that dominate the literature in the Global North. The insights of this research illuminate the unexplored area of intersection between digital inequalities and disconnection, engaging a fruitful conversation that enriches both fields of inquiry and unfolds future research opportunities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic has made videoconferencing tools an essential part of our lives as these tools are what allowed us to keep in touch in a time of social distancing. Having said that, however, many people have found virtual interactions to be surprisingly exhausting. This has given rise to the concept of Zoom fatigue. The purpose of this article is to explore the dynamics that give rise to this peculiar phenomenon. The article first discusses the concept of Zoom fatigue and critiques the brain-centrism of current explanations. It then proposes a more embodied approach to interaction, discusses the mediating role of technology in videoconferencing, and proceeds to presents a list of five videoconferencing dynamics that may induce Zoom fatigue: Awkward turn-taking, inhibited spontaneity, restricted motility, lack of eye contact and increased self-awareness. Finally, it is argued that these dynamics should make us temper our collective expectations about the hybrid future.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the genre of cyber-culture has become well established within the publishing world. Next to the software manuals and ’how-to-go-on-line’ texts in any large bookstore, you can now find shelves of publications supposedly explaining the social implications of the net. As in other forms of literature, almost all cyber-culture books adopt one of the standard formulas developed for the genre. From the beginning, the most popular approach has been uncritical technooptimism. Inspired by Marshall McLuhan, many authors claim that humanity is about to enter an information society utopia. For their commercially-minded readers, they promise that e-commerce will make large sums of money for everyone and that hi-tech stocks will continually increase in value. For those of a more mystical inclination, they predict that people could live like spirits inside computer networks and that a God-like consciousness is emerging from the on-line activities of individuals. Deprived of political utopias, readers can now find redemption in the new technologies of the net.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In New Zealand – like in the US and UK – independently produced podcasts fall outside of local media regulations. New Zealand’s media laws and regulatory bodies remain broadcast and legacy media-focussed, so podcast content that has not been previously broadcast is not regulated or otherwise overseen. In the absence of regulation, this study explores the ways nine independent podcast producers from New Zealand self-govern their content, as well as their motivations for doing so. It is an investigation of the ways ‘amateur’ content producers approach media ethics, and more broadly podcast production in practice. Not guided or bound by formal publishing or editorial responsibilities, and mostly with no formal media training, study participants demonstrate adherence to journalistic principles. They consider ethical and editorial quandaries as they arise during the production process, factoring in the needs and disposition of their audience. This process is informed by their worldview, as well as their perspectives and experiences as media consumers. Though these podcasters champion the ethos of independent podcasting, the content of their shows is not free from third party influence. These podcasters are also parents, partners, employees, and colleagues; life roles that inform the content of their show. Though they push back against podcasting being legislated, these podcasters see value in creating an informal set of guidelines or a voluntary code of practice for podcasting in New Zealand. This project contributes to ongoing explorations of independent podcasting and podcasting practice, focussing on what defines, motivates, and informs self-driven practitioners. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores how two subreddits—r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut (Donut) and r/ProtectAndServe (PnS)—function as online interpretive communities discussing the same topic: police conduct. Members of Donut construct a genre from videos depicting a history of police violence in order to advocate for policing reform, arguing that cop-watching practices that produce this genre are essential to driving changes in policing. Members of PnS construct a genre from similar videos in order to advocate for resisting systemic reform, reading these videos as professional development opportunities for police to reestablish legitimacy with the public. Donut insists on change, while PnS resists change. Donut produces a discourse which engages with historical instances of police misconduct; PnS produces a discourse which rarely engages with this history. Studying these processes of interpretation reveals how dissonant meanings can arise from the same material, how meaning is made in communities consuming and repurposing texts, and how historical narratives are essential to challenging structural inequity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the shift to mass self-publishing on the internet, commentators have hailed — or sometimes mourned — the death of professional intermediaries such as the editor. The question remains, however: does editing disappear along with the editor? The short answer is ‘no’, when one understands editing generically, as an essential part of the process of creating meaning in a text. In reviewing examples on the internet, one sees that it does not disappear, but shifts from a third-party intermediary to the author and the reader, and from human to more automated types of intervention. However, despite the promise of the ‘semantic web’, these kinds of intervention are unlikely to reach high standards on a consistent basis. The absence of experienced human mediation in the writing process — as in other areas of life — can be harmful to public life, and ways should be found to show the added value that they make. </jats:p>",

Yet, very little is known about the players of sports video games resulting in a blind spot for media and video game research.

The following empirical online investigation is an answer to this research gap, providing one of the first large-scale data sets detailing who the sports video game players are. Through an online survey of 1718 participants, general demographics of sports video game players, their habits and activities were investigated in the early 2011. While, until now our knowledge about players of sports video games has been based on anecdotal evidence or extrapolated from wider surveys of game players, this study demonstrates that there are interesting and important differences demanding further study. </jats:p>",

The results show that, in a period of declining newspaper readership and TV news viewing, editors are keen to embrace new technologies, which are seen as being part of the future of news. At the same time, text is still reported to be the cornerstone for news websites, leading to changes in the grammar and function of news video when used online. The economic rationale for convergence is examined and the article investigates the partnerships sites have entered into in order to be able to serve their audience with video content. In-house video is complementing syndicated content, and the authors examine the resulting developments in newsroom training and recruitment practices.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Research into gaming and dancing has tended to highlight educational benefits, such as positive effects on problem-solving, creativity, and motivation (Hutton E and Sundar S, 2010. Can video games enhance creativity? Effects of emotion generated by Dance Dance Revolution. Creativity Research Journal 22(3): 294–303.). This article focuses on a game called Bound (2016), developed by Plastic Studios for PlayStation 4 and VR, to show how dancing can be defined as an embodied epistemology and a form of creative exploration that contributes to emotional intelligence. Using methodologies generated by Brendan Keogh, I show how and why dominant understandings of gameplay are insufficient to analyze the experience and meaning produced by playing Bound. Keogh’s theories are relevant to both game studies and dance studies and allow us to examine the fruitful intersections of game studies and screendance. Ultimately I introduce ‘choreographic thinking’ as a mode of engagement that is activated by gameplay and that resonates with Keogh’s theories: by calling attention to the choreographic potential of Bound, I demonstrate the value of noncompetitive gaming models for producing embodied knowledge. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In contrast to Norbert Elias’ perception of the court as a “gilded cage”, historians have, over a couple of decades, agreed on concepts of courts as specific social systems that can be visualised by a series of concentric circles around the ruler. Courtiers and officers were not only domesticated by the court (“Civilizing Process”), they were rather integrated in the mechanisms of decision-making. Therefore, courts can be defined as cultural and political nexuses: places where central power encountered the subjects (yet still belonging to different sort of elites, including noble and functional elites), and where power and resources were concentrated and redistributed. Courtiers and officers were integrated in a permanent process of interaction and redistribution in the surroundings of the ruler. Possible share in power and rule, promotion and admission to offices at court and in the chancery were accordingly regarded as a consequence of the ruler’s grace on the one hand or, as the quasi-institutional practice and structure of governance on the other hand. Thus, individuals who had direct and specific access to the rulers or belonged to their inner circle (gaining their trust and establishing an intellectual and even physical proximity with them), were sometimes raised to a position that enabled them to accumulate resources and develop their own influence and power.",

    "title": "Cinephilia, take three?: Availability, reliability, and disenchantment in the streaming era",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article proposes a modified reading of Thomas Elsaesser’s theories of cinephilia, taking into account the new viewing practices established by the rise of online media streaming. Elsaesser characterised early film culture (labelled as ‘take one’) as rooted in celluloid and marked by a longing to view films that were not always easily available. By contrast, his characterisation of the later ‘take two’ era is one in which each new distribution technology (television, VHS, and so on) promises greater abundance and convenience, to the point where this new generation of cinephiles – in response to the widespread success of DVD – were perceived as having to deal with the ‘anachronisms generated by total availability’. Amanda D. Lotz argues that streaming services appear to provide an extension of the ‘take two’ ideal, offering assurances of ‘ availability (on-demand libraries with many choices) and reliability (you don’t have to watch it now or it’s gone)’. I suggest, however, that the underlying impermanence of streaming has prompted fears related to both access and ownership, marking a break from the expectations surrounding the DVD (as well as its successors Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD). The impact of content migration – fracturing access between a greater number of paid platforms – and particularly content delisting – the outright removal of access to a given text – can place certain works in a form of limbo. This article proposes the dawn of a new generation of cinephilia – a potential take three – marked by a newfound concern of ephemerality, albeit much more potential and localised than the widespread unavailability of the take one era. In essence, then, take three wrestles with the anachronisms of loss in a media landscape that, in many other ways, offers unprecedented levels of access to film and television content. </jats:p>",

It concludes that, despite the recent mobilization of large parts of Greek society in December 2008, also accelerated via the use of new media, the Greek citizenry has yet to prove that it can effectively and consistently over time remain motivated about the environment. In that respect, the street protests under consideration may be seen as nothing more than activist pyrotechnics, facilitated and sexed-up by new ICTs. Therefore, new technologies, on their own, have a limited scope for political mobilization unless there is a supporting and contextual environment that promotes and sustains their impact. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book Review: The Ambivalent Internet. Mischief, Oddity, and Antagonism Online",
    "abstract": "Weird Tweets, funny memes, absurd Photoshop-edits, or snarky comments on social media: we have all encountered them at some point in our online lives. It is precisely such ‘mediated folkloric expressions’ Phillips and Milner scrutinize in their timely and engaging volume The Ambivalent Internet (2017). Through examining these online expressions, that is, the Tweets, memes, comments among others, from a folkloric perspective the authors are able to position these practices in a broader light than seeing them as unique parts of digital culture or media. Phillips and Milner (2017) take us through a variety of ambivalent, online expressions over the course of seven chapters, of which five are centered on cases and examples of such expressions. The authors define these online expressions as mediated versions of ‘vernacular’ or ‘folkloric expressions’. The folkloric framework is one of the core concepts of the book. This allows for examining the link between ‘folk’ (people) and their ambivalent ‘lore’ (the expressions, the stories shared). Moreover, the authors discuss who ‘the folk’ is (whose voices are empowered or not) and the ambivalence of the ‘lore’ they create, express, or share (for one person a story might be funny, while another finds it offensive or insensitive). Phillips and Milner (2017) emphasize that there is a continuity and dynamism in folkloric expression (p. 44): a previously ‘offline’ practice has now gone digital. And, with the rise of digital media folk practices are further amplified. This amplification is greatly due to digital media affordances, the authors argue. These new affordances – modularity (everyone can create content), modifiability (one can change or recreate content), archivability (content is easier to store, but also to trace and preserve), and accessibility (content is no longer confined to time or space) – seem to push folkloric ambivalence ‘into hyperdrive’ (p. 46). Moreover, with these ‘new technological affordances, new behavioral complications, and new ethical questions engendered by the ambivalent Internet’ (p. 45) are brought forward (e.g. the ethical implications of amplification, or searchable harm). The examples discussed in the book to illustrate and examine the ambivalence of digital folkloric expressions are diverse and ample. For example, there is an examination of the hybrid identity play surrounding a practice like catfishing (creating a ‘fake’ identity online and blurring the boundaries of real and fake or online and off-line), and a discussion of constitutive humor (who decides what is generative and destructive laughter, creating an us versus them).

    "title": "The memory of perfection: Digital faces and nostalgic franchise cinema",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is concerned with the intersection of digitally augmented performance and nostalgia in contemporary Hollywood franchise cinema. The practice of ‘de-ageing’ or even resurrecting actors following their real-life deaths in films like Tron: Legacy (Joseph Kosinski, 2010), Terminator Genysis (Alan Taylor, 2015), Rogue One (Gareth Edwards, 2016), Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (J.J. Abrams, 2019), and a large number of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, is now commonplace. Though such digital faces are primarily still found in franchise cinema, some exceptions ( The Irishman, Martin Scorsese, 2019; Gemini Man, Ang Lee, 2019) are telling in their franchise-like appeals to cinematic nostalgia. In particular, the digital face is most commonly aligned with the ‘legacy film’ (Golding, 2019), resurrected franchises interested in transferring franchise protagonists, themes and fandom across generations. The digital face therefore is an expression of the convergence of the digital with film, with the franchise, with the past and with memory. For these films, memory and nostalgia are meticulous exercises involving thousands of work hours of highly skilled CGI workers and cutting-edge technology. These highly technical, virtuosic digital faces are quite literally the face of this kind of nostalgia, and as Ndalianis observes, position the face ‘as façade that opens up a time-travel passageway between past and present’, inviting a seam-spotting game between audience and filmmaker (2014). Even if the digital face is perfect in its recreation, the audience’s knowledge of the impossibility of the performance leaves a trace of artistry. Accordingly, digital faces are creative, technical and financial decisions above all. This article outlines the uses of the digital face for memory, nostalgia and seriality in contemporary Hollywood franchise cinema, with a focus on representation and death. </jats:p>",

This study examines the impact of pandemic-related changes on the film industry by analyzing social media conversations on Twitter as a proxy for success. We introduce a novel metric to measure social word-of-mouth (sWOM) longevity for 40 movies released across different genres and franchises. Results indicate that pandemic-era films experienced shorter sWOM lifespans than pre-pandemic counterparts, and streaming releases generated shorter sWOM conversations than theatrical releases. This suggests that streaming releases risk quicker cultural obsolescence due to limited social media discussion time. This study offers valuable insights for industry practitioners navigating the evolving cinematic landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Telecommunications companies (telcos) paid too much for European 3G licences on the basis that they would be able to reach mobile consumers directly with web content. The subsequent reluctance of consumers to pay for commercial content and the debts and devaluations afflicting the post-tech-boom telcos has had several consequences. Besides an undercapitalized 3G infrastructure, there has been increasing consternation about the absence of a must-have service ‘killer app’ that would lead to the uptake of 3G products, and determined efforts to find one, as evidenced at events like ‘Mobile Content World’, an industry conference and trade fair held in London in October 2005. But the efforts to sell 3G spectrum (and the entire 3G experiment) may be based on a misapprehension of the nature of users’ relationships with ICTs and web content. This article presents an overview and commentary on the progress of the 3G mobile content industry. In part it is based on a review of presentations at ‘Mobile Content World’, and in part on a review and synthesis of the most recent literature covering 3G and mobile content from the fields of media studies, cultural studies, economics and business. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the vast field of conspiracy theories by focusing on the example of conspiracy theories related to vaccine hesitancy. Conspiracy theories have been with us for a long time, and as any other type of semantic content they spread by travelling through media. Therefore, if one wants to understand how conspiracy theories proliferate, it is relevant to investigate the media roads by which they travel and that each offer different opportunities for establishing connections. It is obvious that within the last three decades the advent of digital media has opened up new road systems to support conspiracy theories’ getting around. This article focuses on one such road system, the World Wide Web, and how the hyperlink networks on the Danish web related to conspiracy theories and vaccine hesitancy have developed from 2006 to 2015. The article aims at (1) contributing to the development of methods that enables such a study, and (2) providing results about how these hyperlink networks have developed. The network analysis reveals that the potential exchange of ideas about vaccination between experts and non-experts is not facilitated by the media material structures in either of the years, since almost no links exist between the two actor types, at least not on the physical performative level of hyperlinks. Experts are connected, but non-experts as a whole tend to function as an archipelago of isolated islands—isolated from the experts, and by and large isolated from each other. This tendency has remained almost the same throughout the investigated period. News media that one could expect to function as brokers connecting experts and non-experts are not particularly well-connected in the network and apparently do not mediate between actor types. </jats:p>",

Finally, Gillian Wearing’s fake ad, Wearing Gillian, uses deepfake technology to enable a series of actors to appear on screen with the artist’s face as a way of interrogating questions of identity in a networked digital world. Based on these works, my article examines museums’ employment of deepfakes for advertising, audience engagement, and educational outreach, and the curatorial, ethical, and creative opportunities and challenges involved therein. While deepfake esthetics will be discussed wherever relevant, this is not a formalist analysis; my goal is not to focus on close readings of the deepfake pieces themselves, however fascinating their esthetics. Instead, I will look at the promotional and critical discourse around them in order to unpack the ways in which the acquisition of creative deepfake works by cultural institutions functions as a legitimizing force that is already shifting the narrative regarding the artistic value and social functions of this technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article outlines the relationship between Big Data and sport in the network society. Critiquing the hype associated with Big Data, it is explained that modern sport informs the historical rise of this technological phenomenon, serving as a social and cultural site where the accelerating privatization and commodification of statistics and statistically generated information occurs. These developments deliver increased entertainment options for fans of many professional men’s sports and an unprecedented number of performance indicators for selected coaches, athletes and pundits. However, the information technology infrastructure and resources required to generate real-time data are adding to widening inequalities between elite ‘data-rich’ sports and comparatively impoverished ‘data-poor’ sports, including many women’s competitions. It is argued that a collective fascination with the digital sublime obscures the complex interaction between corporate power, digital data markets, history and culture, and contributes to inequalities that demand ongoing attention and critique. </jats:p>",

It starts out from an understanding of games as entities in which the impulse to play is inextricably linked to the desire to cheat, as the close etymological kinship of the Latin terms ludo (I play) and deludo (I cheat) suggests. Therefore, it can be argued that, in order to understand a game, one must play not only by its rules but also with its rules. This will be demonstrated using examples drawn from my own games research experience, addressing the ethical, methodological and epistemological implications of this practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As is reasonably well known by now, Deleuze and Guattari consider technology as only a lesser aspect of more important 'machinic' dimensions. This paper uses their work to analyse the relations between technology, the social and art. It outlines the beginning of a potential ethics of becoming, of interaction, and of, as Brian Eno puts it, the 'unfinished idea'. The advantage of Deleuze and Guattari's ideas is that they move us away from what new technologies represent, or how they operate merely as instruments of representation, as theorised in so many contemporary accounts. They move towards a consideration of what forms of production new technologies are involved in, of what broader 'machines' they affect. It will be argued that models and practices imported from the arts are still important in the design and analysis of new technologies, but the suggestion here is that these models should be drawn from areas other than classical theatrical, or representational, assumptions such as those found in Aristotle's Poetics. These are areas such as performance art or some aspects of recent music production. </jats:p>",

This article aims to explore the processes between YouTube creators and advertisers concerning product placement enquiries. For this purpose, YouTube creators from Germany ( n = 57) answered an online survey about their experiences with advertisers. The creators covered a wide range of YouTube channel genres (beauty, fashion, comedy, gaming, cooking) and differed in number of subscribers. Some creators who took part in the survey had less than 20,000 subscribers, others had between 20,000 and 500,000 subscribers and still others had more than 500,000 subscribers. How often do YouTube creators use product placement? Is paid-for placement an important source of finance for them? How professional are the relations and processes between YouTube creators and advertisers? Before presenting and discussing the results of the empirical survey of the current use of product placement, a brief history of how YouTube has become a marketing space for advertisers is provided. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article discusses Twitter bots that generate textual outputs for aesthetic effect. It considers in-detail a specific instance, The Ephemerides ( @the_ephemerides ) by Allison Parrish, and presents a critical assessment of how its functional and thematic attributes meditate self-reflexively upon their operational contexts within digital infrastructure. This mode of reading is then presented as having value for analysing generative Twitter bots more widely. The initial balance of this article will concern the broader question of how generative digital writing can be assessed critically, debating key claims made by Simanowski (2011), before presenting a model in which the salient quality of this art form is the distinctly machinic modes of expression it makes available, revealing the software itself to be an active agent in the reading encounter. The remainder of this article will then apply this perspective to a reading of The Ephemerides, considering its meditation on the functional and aesthetic relationship between technical systems that are unobtrusively efficient versus those that are vividly breaking down – with the latter making manifest the contingency that is inherent to the processes of coming to know and act on the world through technology. The goal of this discussion is to consider not only how the generative operations of Twitter bots might be approached fruitfully, but to demonstrate also that such analyses constitute a worthwhile pursuit in the first instance – that even these tightly constrained instances of digital creativity can offer forms expression that reward extended academic criticism. </jats:p>",

The article juxtaposes two conceptual systems, the one shared by the members of Instagram and a system based on presuppositions regarding the ideologies, values, and emotional attitudes shared by Israeli Instagram users toward the IDF. This juxtaposition is made possible, thanks to the resemblance found between the aesthetic and emotional aspects of Instagram and the ideological and emotional aspects emphasized by IDF. Three main interrelated motifs demonstrate the article’s argument: soldiers as civilians/photographers in momentary disguise, army and nature, and admiration for appearances of weapons. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital methods as ‘experimental a priori’ – how to navigate vague empirical situations as an operationalist pragmatist",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digitalisation and computation presents us with a vague empirical world that unsettles established links between measurements and values. As more and more actors use digital media to produce data about aspects of the world they deem important, new possibilities for inscribing their lives emerge. The practical work with digital methods thus often involves the production of social visibilities that are misfits in the context of established data practices. In this paper I argue that this dissonance carries the distinct critical potential to design data experiments that (a) uses the act of operationalisation as an engine for creating intersubjective clarity about the meaning of existing concepts and (b) takes advantage of algorithmic techniques to provoke a reassessment of some of the core assumptions that shape the way we pose empirical problems are normally framed. Drawing on the work of Kant, Peirce, Dewey and C.I. Lewis I propose to think of this critical potential as the possibility to practice what I term 'experimental a priori' and I use qualitative vignettes from two years of data experiments with GEHL architects to illustrate what this entails in practice. Faced with the task of using traces from Facebook as an empirical source to produce a map of urban political diversity, the architects found themselves in a need to revisit inherited assumptions about the ontology of urban space and the way it can even be formulated as a problem of diversity. While I describe this as a form of obstructive data practice that is afforded by digital methods, I also argue that it cannot be realised without deliberate design interventions. I therefore end the paper by outlining five design principles that can productively guide collective work with digital methods. These principles contribute to recent work within digital STS on the recalibration of problem spaces and the design of data sprints.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Social television (TV) engagement has become more commonplace as viewers seek alternative ways of engaging with TV shows and other viewers. This is especially true with televised professional wrestling; 119,506 tweets were analyzed using social network analysis during the four World Wrestling Entertainment telecasts. Results show that brand-affiliated users primarily interact among one another and not the fans themselves, despite fans reaching out to the brand, resulting in significant social stratification and low interactivity within the community. The findings suggest that when fans think they are able to join and contribute to the brand’s ongoing conversation, those fans might still be highly motivated to communicate with the brand, even if the brand does not reciprocate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Practices of collecting are constrained by media circumstances. To show how changing media circumstances can occasion changes in collecting practices, this article explores one case study, an iOS app developed by a Phish fan to allow streaming audio of fan-made recordings of Phish concert performances. Such practices are part of a history of unofficial music collecting that parallels the history of recorded sound. This case study shows how one collecting community’s practices evolved in the context of changing media conditions: from cassette tape to CD-R to MP3 to streams (and a parallel motion from print to online message boards to app). This progression illustrates the ways that different ways of listening to and accessing recorded music afford different possibilities of collecting music, different links between listener and music, and different relationships among listeners. More precisely, Phish concert recordings, which lent themselves to collection when circulated on cassette, are no longer available to collect when they circulate as streaming media, because streaming is characterized by a relationship of access rather than possession. Among devoted fans, streaming recordings provoke a cultural emphasis on knowledge about music, rather than accumulation of recordings. My argument is rooted in prevailing theories of collecting, which situate collecting as a component of consumer culture emerging from the capitalist expansion stimulated by 19th-century mass production. Ultimately, I argue that when an object of collecting is displaced by changing media conditions, new collecting practices emerge to fill the void. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Navigating platformized generative AI: Examining early adopters’ experiences through the lens of data reflectivity",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT 3.5 in November 2022, an unprecedented number of users have started to experiment with generative AI for communication purposes. Prior studies have shown how users are commodified by platforms, and the unprecedented development of generative AI raises hence once again questions of platform dynamics vs user agency. In this study, we argue that platformized generative AI (GenAI) actively ‘talks back’ to their users, prompting them to act accordingly. Theoretically, we develop the concept of data reflectivity as a critical lens, showing that users exhibit reflective practices. These allow them to reflect upon their own role in relation to platformized GenAI and thus alter their patterns of action. The empirical case study, carried out in Spring 2023, draws on a survey with 60 early adopters and 14 subsequent semi-structured interviews, collected in an NGO operating in Southeast Asia. The thematic analysis shows that users relate to platformized GenAI in three distinct but related ways: (1) as a happy helper to organize and systematize knowledge and information; (2) as a creative tool to generate ideas; and (3) as a conversation partner for personal and life-related matters. In conclusion, we discuss the findings critically in relation to overall platform dynamics and the notion of systems ‘speaking back’ and further suggest that future research should aim to bring the two research fields of datafication and user studies even closer together. </jats:p>",

We developed software and visualization tools to analyze these archives. Digital analysis focused on counting and graphing the rate of the fan fiction production over time in three Hollywood blockbuster movie fandoms: The Avengers, the Batman trilogy, and Inception. We found that audiences grant a great deal of ‘mindshare’ to media texts and create fan works in response to those texts immediately after viewing a film but that what sustains fan productivity are the attractiveness of specific online archiving platforms and the liveliness of activity in a given fandom. Internet archives have a decisive function in offering the creative and conserving infrarstructure for ‘unofficial’ communication, art, and knowledge. Today, they are trendsetting organs and their impact verifies the assumption that the Hollywood studios’ market strategies are not the sole, or most crucial, predictors or determinants of audience engagement. </jats:p>",

It argues that where in the former era certain strategies allowed for the disciplining of viewers’ sensory dimensions and in turn allowed for the ‘factory’ process of watching-labour to penetrate the private lives of people, in the latter era this factory process has not only collapsed into the home but also into viewers’ sensoria. And, that this is due to the nature of the control mechanisms embedded in the new aesthetic strategies deployed by media-capital through second-screen technologies. This article concludes by theorizing said set of mechanisms as an iteration of a society-wide aesthetic of control essential to the operation of contemporary capitalism. </jats:p>",

It has proved impossible to rewrite the cyborg’.~ While it is certainly true that the piece has had a dramatic half-life, it is perhaps not so surprising given its exploration of issues which have only become more relevant since 1985. Then and now, the Cyborg Manifesto offers a polemical challenge to women, urging them to alter their relationship to the social relations of science and technology, to explore the potential and the risk of being cyborg neither wholly man, woman, nor machine.",

YouTube stars produce vlogs (video blogs) telling stories about their search for Furbys, unboxing them, and experimenting with the toy’s playful and uncanny features. Set-piece video producers experiment with how Furbys interact with others, such as trying to communicate, confronting family pets or being destroyed with weapons.

Our close study of forum messages, arranged as web diaries open to comments from participants, shows that self-blaming posts elicited absolutional replies. With a primary interest in those personal posts which had a confessional character, we identified three aspects of absolution in replies: collective, prospective and supportive. Of special sociological interest is how online interaction in the forum challenges the concept of ‘civil inattention’ (Goffman, 1971) as a basic social norm for interaction in public spaces. Rather, absolutional attention defines the interactional order within the forum, in which diary authors receive feedback on their accounts of challenges, problems and failures. Studying online communication in detail may contribute to an important theoretical refinement of interactionist sociology, which currently strongly rests on studies from pre-Internet times. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Emotions-as-practices involve an open, embodied, and meaning-making process as digital technologies can shape and transform how emotions are enacted. This study uses the concepts of emotional affordances and affective practice in digital culture to investigate the online emotional experiences of Chinese left-behind women living in a rural location. From an analysis of Douyin (TikTok) video posts and interviews with 18 participants, the study develops a notion of ‘ambivalent positivity’ manifested by overt conviviality and the repressed negativity of distress and separation. Furthermore, rural women are obligated to maintain the norm of positivity that is deeply intertwined with their gender roles and social relations. These practices are evident in and through Douyin use, such as beauty filters, streamlined video editing, and background music. Responding to the ambivalence of positivity, we argue that social media empower rural women to achieve positive self-representation; however, they remain constrained within social-cultural conditions as left-behind rural women in a patriarchal society. Findings contribute to understanding how interactional offline-online contexts shape dynamic emotional experiences. </jats:p>",

How movements are integrated into longer lived global networks has been insufficiently studied. The ‘hyperlink’ can serve as a material representation of more durable affiliations between entities with a shared collective identity, in this case, activist Web sites, reflecting underlying network structures. Combining qualitative analysis of movement identities and narratives with analysis of hyperlinking patterns provides a more holistic understanding of the interrelations between the 15M and Occupy movements. I argue that the similarities in the structural hyperlinked network properties of the 15M and Occupy movements and their transnational interlinkages can be explained in part by commonalities in the two movements’ collective identities and dominant narratives. </jats:p>",

Collectively referred to as Portraits on the Mattes’s website, they are grouped into a series of exhibitions which have been shown in New York, Italy and Switzerland, as well as within Second Life itself. Critical reception has been mixed, with some critics appreciating the images as critiques of real-world conventions of beauty, while others have found them bland and banal. The artists, however, have stated that the Portraits series is their most radical work to date. With such wide variance in critical reception and artistic ‘intention’, it is worth asking a few questions: What is the significance of exhibiting portraits of Second Life avatars? What does it mean to re-present what is already a representation — and what is in fact being represented? And, given that the Portraits are predominantly close-ups of faces, and also that they are brought to us via a whole series of digital interfaces, what role do the face and the interface play in the production and understanding of these images? </jats:p>",

Using empirical methods and sources including scraping, observation, digital simulations, and third-party datasets, researchers have found many ways to study VODs, their content, and their recommendations. Our article provides a critical review of this research landscape. We describe the evolution of two key methods: catalog analysis and interface analysis. We then explain how these methods intersect with each other and also with audience research. Throughout, we assess the value and limitations of various methods, showing how they fit within a wider research landscape that involves multiple ‘ways of knowing’ VOD. The practicalities and politics of access to VOD data are considered throughout. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Measuring the diffusion of conspiracy theories in digital information ecologies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Digital platforms and media are fertile breeding grounds for disinformation and conspirational views. They provide a variety of communication venues for a mixed set of actors and foster the diffusion of content between actor groups, across platforms and media, and across languages and geographical spaces. Understanding those diffusion processes requires approaches to measure the prevalence and spread of communicative acts within and across digital platforms. Given the increasing access to digital data, computational methods provide new possibilities to capture this spread and do justice to the interrelated nature and hybridity of online communication. Against this background, the paper focuses on the spread of conspiracy theories in digital information ecologies. It provides a review of recent methodological approaches to measuring conspiracy-related content online regarding the (a) prevalence and (b) diffusion of conspiracy theories. To that end, the paper differentiates between social network analysis approaches and computational techniques of automated text classification. It further discusses how far these and related computational approaches could facilitate studying the diffusion of conspiracy theories across different actor types, languages, topics and platforms. In doing so, it takes the specific nature of online communication and challenges in the field of conspiracy-related content into account.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The emergence in 2022 of surreal and grotesque image sets created using the free online AI text-to-image generator DALL-E Mini (Craiyon) prompts our analysis of their aesthetic content and connections to preexisting media forms and trends in digital culture. DALL-E Mini uses an unfiltered database of images from the internet to create new images based on a user’s text prompt, often resulting in misshapen bodies and impossible scenarios. Despite its technological limitations, DALL-E Mini’s popularity as a meme-making tool is visible on social media platforms, where crowd-sourced images are shared and experimentation with the tool is encouraged. Through comparison with existing artistic practices and formats (creative automata, surrealism, body horror, celebrity memes), we argue that DALL-E Mini creations can be understood as human-AI co-creations and forms of aesthetic mimicry. Building on the ideas of surrealists such as André Breton, we propose that DALL-E Mini’s images, prompts and the grid interface adhere to surrealism’s historical interests in the unconscious, the uncanny, and the collaborative ‘exquisite corpse’ parlour game. We also consider DALL-E Mini’s relevance to the category of ‘AI Arts’, Patricia De Vries’s call for more research that relates algorithms to the broader artistic and cultural contexts in which they are embedded (2020), and the ‘authoring’ of celebrity bodies as data (Kanai, 2016). Our theorisation of DALL-E Mini is supported by examples drawn from social media and personal experiments with the generator. Overall, we propose that internet users’ experimentation with DALL-E Mini corresponds with a cultural moment in which AI imaging technologies are eliciting excitement and anxiety. The outputs are revealed to be reliant on users’ pop cultural knowledge, with DALL-E Mini allowing for a playful, co-creative algorithmic practice, wherein contemporary anxieties about digital labour, (post)digital culture, biopolitics, and global issues are redirected into surreal visual storyworlds. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article aims to expand the critical frameworks by which online social networking can be contextualised and understood within the broader cultural practices of identity and selfhood. Utilising Judith Butler’s theories of performative identity, it is argued that the use of social networking sites are performative acts in and of themselves. Two facets of social networking are examined from theoretical and critical perspectives: (1) the use of social networking profiles (Info pages, taste selections, biographies) as a tool for performing, developing and stabilising identity as a narrative in line with cultural demands for coherence, intelligibility and recognition; (2) identity performances that occur through relationality among online friends through list maintenance and communication (wall posts, tagging, commentary), and how identity is reconfigured within a network morphology. Finally, the article aims to open discussion around the broad cultural practices and implications of online social networking by developing some theoretical approaches to understanding the incompatibilities between these two facets which compete and risk the ‘undoing’ of online identity coherence. Within the framework of the growing use of social networking sites as one area in which our selfhood and subjectivity are performed, this incompatibility and undoing has both risks and benefits for future the cultural production of identity. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Keeping Connected: Travelling with the Telephone",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the uses of mobile and fixed telephone communications by travellers and the implications of that use for their experiences of travel. Based on interviews conducted with people travelling in New Zealand, we argue that travellers give specific attention to the accessibility of phone services while planning their travel. Once travellers' journeys and communication with distant friends and families had commenced, travellers made clear distinctions between the relative uses, benefits and drawbacks of using oral phone communications and 'texting' (short message service). Both forms of communication had similar impacts on travellers' sense of an ongoing integration into relationships from which they were temporarily physically distant. However, the two modes of communication differed with respect to what they were seen to offer. That is, oral phone communication was characterised by its 'emotionality', while texting in particular was seen to offer distinctive opportunities for spontaneous contact. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As location and the nearby environment become increasingly prominent for our communications, filtering flows of information and shaping our networks, geolocation technology and emergent forms of usage to govern information and visualize populations raise important questions as to how locative media could be used as tools of governmentality. Using Google’s location platform Places as a primary example, this article will argue that location platforms are underpinned by a geodemographical spatial ordering according to which subjects are located for the purpose of economic government. Particular attention is paid to the political economy of location platforms and the role of their underlying algorithms and databases in rendering social space subject to novel forms of commodification. Drawing on Foucault’s governmentality analytic framework, the article concludes by delineating a critical framework to assess the mentalities and strategies of government that the generalized geocoding of information is giving rise to. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "If the above question carries echoes of those other questions earnestly asked in the 1960s and 197t~s -’is film like a languages’, ’is sound recording a language?’ etc then those echoes must be ironic at best. While those earlier questions betrayed nothing more than the hegemony of semiotics, with its reduction of everything to a ’language’ of some kind, my question is more modest. ’Is there a sound culture?’ may be a question easily answered in the negative; or it could be that the question itself bears the cultural bias which compares sound with its bigger, visual, cousin in this case represented by film culture. Or perhaps the question can be asked now because an emergent field of sound practice and theory, however disparate, has recently become apparent.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents an analysis of young people's readings of digital images from horror films. It reappraises theories of the cinematic image and the cinematic still; in particular, those of Eisenstein and Barthes. It suggests that the still image is employed mentally by the spectator as a means of anticipating the film, understanding and recalling it, and later interpreting and transforming it. These perspectives are aligned with recent social semiotic theory, suggesting a grammar of the still image which recognises its syntagmatic structure and its social nature. The use of computers to digitise images is presented as a small but significant improvement in the power of audiences to make their own meanings explicit. Further, these meanings are located in understandings and pleasures that derive from their popular experience of the horror genre outside the classroom as well as quasi-academic explicit study inside it. Similarly, the hybrid nature of their written discourse is related to the complex social identities which inform their transformations of the film text. Finally, the article proposes a view of the interaction between new technologies and social action, and of textual analysis as informed by practices of digital production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article focuses on the results from interviews and workshops on teens’ YouTube consumption and use as part of the Transmedia Literacy research project on teens and transmedia collaborative practices carried out in eight countries from Europe, South America and Australia. The project had two main objectives: to detect what teens are doing with media and to determine how they learn to do it. During the fieldwork, YouTube was identified as one of the platforms that teens use most for learning purposes. Therefore, this article maps teenagers’ main YouTube learning topics and motivations for using the platform. We studied the video formats that teens use and the way they use them to learn a wide variety of topics. Three main areas of interest were identified: formal school curriculum, video games and technology and wellness and culture. In all three areas, teens apply the apprenticeship model of learning as they follow YouTube instructors (teachers, experts and peers) to learn about these areas. Teens highlight different YouTube affordances that motivate them to use the platform, including using it as a search engine to find specific information, using the number of views or subscribers to validate the quality of the content, being able to control the video to learn at their own pace and using it as a repository and archive to find information. Teens use YouTube both to complement their formal school curriculum and to explore their own interests. Therefore, YouTube becomes an important learning space for adolescents to learn in a continuum. This means that it is a space that blurs the boundaries between classic oppositions like formal/informal learning due to how teens use it. </jats:p>",

Community is also central to participatory culture, the study of which began at the cusp of the second media age. This paper critically examines the technocultural formation of online community in the context of fandom and its relationship to specific platforms from Usenet to Tumblr. Based on the analysis of interview data collected from participatory fans (n = 33), I argue that not all platforms enable community formation. While the participants had a sense of community as members of listservs, Yahoo groups and LiveJournal, the same was not true of Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, even though they afforded a number of fannish pleasures. These findings raise questions as to the ongoing centrality of online community in the late second media age.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article we bring onlookers to front stage. Normally considered invisible participants in video game arcades, their multiple and fluid roles are key to establishing interactional frames in public gaming spaces. We identified three such frames — showroom, gymnasium, and clubroom — after analysing interactions and finding examples of self-presentation in Taipei’s largest gaming arcade. According to our observations, the nature of gaming scenarios is largely determined by the relative skill levels of players and onlookers, with participants playing their roles in relation to the currently active frame. Onlookers provide cues that signal dynamic frame shifts, thereby collectively maintaining the gaming environment while distinguishing themselves from outsiders. Our study uses a social interactional approach as a complement to fun- and/or play-oriented game research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "cially in intersectional ways. Overall, Fake Geek Girls ties together a dizzying array of fan studies theories, feminist media theories, and industrial critiques to build a convincing argument about the convergence culture industry and its gendered practices. This deep theoretical grounding is both a strength and a potential weakness, as the book likely requires some existing knowledge of fan studies. Chapter 1 could be effectively extracted for an intro-level fan studies class, where it would offer a thoughtful and concise overview of fan studies’ relation to feminism, but the entire book would be better suited for an upper-level undergraduate course or a graduate seminar. That said, Fake Geek Girls provides an interesting and timely intervention into questions of gender, fan studies, and popular culture. As a game studies scholar focused on gender, Scott’s argument connects deeply to much of my own work, and I expect it will resonate similarly with scholars across many different fields, including media studies, American culture or cultural studies, women’s and gender studies, and more.",

The paratextual study leads to a closer investigation of the usage statistics themselves and concludes that despite industry standards, they are not calculated consistently across vendor platforms and that while these data are invisible to researchers outside of the library, there are also essential elements that librarians mistakenly take at face value when comparing ebook usage from multiple vendors.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Twitch is an online video distribution platform that allows users to broadcast live video of themselves playing videogames. This distribution infrastructure includes features that allow viewers to financially support their favorite Twitch streamers, creating a new type of media professional: the entrepreneurial Twitch streamer. Like other professionals, Twitch streamers meet regularly to discuss the profession and business of live streaming. This article applies critical discourse analysis to one such venue for insider dialogue on professional Twitch streaming: the weekly talk show, Dropped Frames. On this program, professional broadcasters discuss many aspects of their career, such as Twitch’s corporate presence, production technology, the time and effort required to stream, precarity, their relationship to their community, the data they use to run their channels, the games they play, and their relationship to game developers. Speech within these empirically present categories demonstrates an underlying set of common assumptions about how the streaming industry should function. In other words, professional Twitch broadcasters develop a normative theory of streaming practice that is expressed in their speech. I argue that through their speech, professional Twitch streamers demonstrate a theoretical understanding of professional streaming that is based on their ability to negotiate uncertainty and the responsibility they feel for their communities. </jats:p>",

Although this article includes such activities, it extends the discussion to concentrate on the under-researched topic of how Facebook creates value for marketers by exploiting sociality in general. Taking the practices of Australian alcohol brands as an instructive case, this article critically examines how these brands strategically employ Facebook to manage their connections with consumers' identity making practices and engage with the mediation of everyday life. We argue that Facebook works not just as a platform to harvest data but also as a platform to manage the circulation of affect and creation of social connections around brands. This is particularly important in the case of alcohol brands since some social media engagement practices allow for circumventing regulatory regimes by prompting connections between mediations of drinking culture and the brand that would not be possible in other media channels. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Chinese creators and Douyin (a prominent Chinese short-video platform) are building a strong relationship in cultural production. Based on the social exchange theory, this study tries to explore the process and mechanism of monetization in Chinese platforms. Using the app walkthrough method and in-depth interviews with 19 full-time creators, we contend that Chinese creators and Douyin engage in a repetitive but unequal exchange with the common goal of earning income. Douyin works with creators to cultivate their thirst for revenue over time, while mastering the creative labor, before finally tying them to monetary gains. Douyin not only binds exposure and allocates Internet traffic to new creators, but also develops Dou+, a traffic marketing tool that leverages the affordances of creative work visibility. Douyin first enhances the creators’ income expectations through this step. The platform then directs creators through the Star-Chart content trading system, and establishes the platform-advertiser-creator transaction chain. When the exchange between Douyin and creators becomes stable, the platform sets up an uncertain revenue mechanism. Douyin’s commitment to creating a standardized assembly line of production and financial benefit for creators has established an exchange mode between the platform and creators at the expense of innovation and diversity. We argue that this standardized labor process eliminates the autonomy of cultural production. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Data reflectivity and user reflexivity: New conceptual pathways for connecting structural approaches with user perspectives",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ongoing societal datafication and, most recently, the widely noticed launch of ChatGPT, continue to raise the “user question”: what role(s) does the user play in datafied, artificial, and automated environments? Recent technological advancements have begun to challenge fundamental assumptions in media and communication theory and, thus, urge scholars to (re-)visit and (re-)examine the interrelations, dynamics, and entanglements of (human) users with datafied environments. Two rapidly expanding but still largely distinct bodies of research are addressing these topics: critical data and platform studies, primarily focusing on structural approaches, and user-centered perspectives anchored in the tradition of audience research. Situated at the intersection of studying platform power and user agency, the aim of this special issue is to connect structural approaches with studies of lived user experiences through the lenses of reflectivity and reflexivity. We believe that linking platform and data perspectives dealing with questions of power, accountability, and governance on a societal level to users’ engagement with digital technologies and automated systems in an everyday context is a fruitful path when aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the societal implications of the widespread adoption and integration of digital platforms and intelligent technologies. The concepts of reflectivity and reflexivity provide a valuable conceptual starting point for a more integrated and holistic discussion of the complex user-data relations emerging in and from datafied environments. While the individual contributions in this special issue present their own take on the proposed concepts, the purpose of this introduction is to establish a broader theoretical foundation by outlining some overarching considerations on how these concepts can be understood and integrated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The main goal of this paper is to account for the ‘algorithmization’ of microstock imagery. By this term, the authors refer to a material process implying the chronic use of graphic editors, semi-automatic keywording allowing complex and dynamic proto-classifications, and access to the images via search engines. The algorithmization of microstock imagery also goes along with the exploitation of producers’ labour, so that the authors recognize in it a form of digital labour. Moreover, the term ‘algorithmization’ is meant to underline that this material process has symbolic effects on the image contents as well as on people’s expectations and imaginaries of these contents. The paper analyses, in particular, the case study of microstock images depicting artificial intelligence (AI). By producing hundreds of thousands of visual representations of AI that spread via the Web and beyond it, algorithmized microstock imagery also produces its own symbolic conditions of possibility, that is, the expectations and imaginaries that contribute to the success of AI beyond its concrete effectiveness. The paper is structured into three sections. In the first section, the authors account for the existing literature on stock imagery. They contend that this literature focuses too much on the symbolic message, and too little on the material processes of production of these images. In the second section, the authors describe an empirical analysis they conducted on Shutterstock images depicting AI. In the third section, they distinguish three forms of digital labour and show that microstock imagery entertains resemblances to and differences from each form. They contend that despite its peculiarities, microstock image production is a paradigmatic form of digital labour due to its convergence towards algorithmization. In the conclusion, the authors show how, for microstock images depicting AI, the algorithmic loop of microstock imagery is complete. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The great replacement: Strategic mainstreaming of far-right conspiracy claims",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper assesses how the ‘Great Replacement’ conspiracy theory (the idea that ethnically homogeneous populations in European nations are being ‘replaced’ by people of non-European origin) is articulated online by three different actors. By analyzing argument patterns and multimodal features of the cases, the paper shows that the conspiracy theory is a flexible political discourse that can be used strategically by both far-right and mainstream right-wing actors. It highlights the role of affect in online communication, and particularly how anti-immigration actors feed off circulating emotions such as insecurity and fear among the citizenry. The results show that processes of demographic change, caused by immigration, are negatively politicized through the use of pseudo-scientific sources, historic narratives of ethnic homogeneity, threat frames, visual fear appeals and other elements that constitute the wider conspiracy theory of an ongoing ‘replacement’ of native populations. The paper argues that the mainstreaming of conspiracy claims and theories related to immigration poses a threat, not only to democratic institutions and societies, but also to people of immigrant backgrounds. </jats:p>",

    "title": "From ranking algorithms to ‘ranking cultures’",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Algorithms, as constitutive elements of online platforms, are increasingly shaping everyday sociability. Developing suitable empirical approaches to render them accountable and to study their social power has become a prominent scholarly concern. This article proposes an approach to examine what an algorithm does, not only to move closer to understanding how it works, but also to investigate broader forms of agency involved. To do this, we examine YouTube’s search results ranking over time in the context of seven sociocultural issues. Through a combination of rank visualizations, computational change metrics and qualitative analysis, we study search ranking as the distributed accomplishment of ‘ranking cultures’. First, we identify three forms of ordering over time – stable, ‘newsy’ and mixed rank morphologies. Second, we observe that rankings cannot be easily linked back to popularity metrics, which highlights the role of platform features such as channel subscriptions in processes of visibility distribution. Third, we find that the contents appearing in the top 20 results are heavily influenced by both issue and platform vernaculars. YouTube-native content, which often thrives on controversy and dissent, systematically beats out mainstream actors in terms of exposure. We close by arguing that ranking cultures are embedded in the meshes of mutually constitutive agencies that frustrate our attempts at causal explanation and are better served by strategies of ‘descriptive assemblage’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2022–2023, the gaming house LL35, live-streamed on Twitch.tv, was the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s (NRK) content strategy to reach one of the most elusive audiences: male gamers between 18–29. This article discusses the case of LL35 in the light of Norwegian media policy, with particular focus on the Norwegian public service mandate. Through an analysis of how the content and scheduling of the live Twitch broadcasts developed over the span of its first year of existence, informed by interviews with the production crew behind LL35, we discuss whether LL35 was able to live up to the public service mandate and how LL35 can be part of preparing NRK for the competition in a world of (inter)networked broadcasting. The article centers on two research questions: How did the content and scheduling of LL35 develop over time, and to what degree could this development enable NRK to fulfill its commitment to offer public service content to its target group? The research shows that despite the will for innovation in NRK, combining the social media logic of Twitch and the media logic of NRK was a challenge. It also underlined the mutual dependency of legacy television and streaming, and how their roles shift. The theoretical foundation for the study is a combination of perspectives from media policy studies with insights from research on esports, game streaming and Twitch, and studies of public service youth content.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article focusses on the musical history of the telephone, an aspect of telephonic history that is often overlooked and has not yet received systematic academic attention. The article is structured around two musical themes of telephonic history: (1) public performances of telephones as musical instruments and (2) the telephone network as musical instrument. Two historic periods are considered for both themes, (a) the late 1800s/early 1900s and (b) the late 2000s. The article’s approach draws loosely on media historic and media archaeologic perspectives to analyse existing material about telephone history (with a musical focus) alongside empirical field work on the musical use of mobile phones in the late 2000s. The results contribute to debates regarding the ‘newness’ of media, and to sound studies approaches to media histories. The article shows how the theme of the musical telephone has been re-occurring but often overlooked throughout its history, and also sketches out a future research agenda. The article contributes a new understanding of the musical uses of the telephone across history, relevant for both understanding contemporary uses of telephone technologies such as smartphones and the Internet of Things, and for a richer understanding of historic telephone uses. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Affordances and aesthetics of digital media platforms have given politicians new ways to connect with potential voters and actively manage their own self-image. Digital political communication is also often influenced by current trends in PR or commercial marketing; for example, the tools and tactics of social media influencers. Based on qualitative case studies of YouTube channels belonging to two Swedish party leaders, this article examines the adaptation of influencer practices in the politicians’ online presence, and what impact it has on the presentation of themselves and their politics. It analyses how different genres of beauty and lifestyle influencers are embraced and adapted to a political context, as well as the ways in which specific audio-visual elements are used to construct the mediated performance of political authenticity, giving viewers ‘behind-the-scenes’ access to the politicians’ personal as well as professional life. The analysis shows how the adaption of videos in confessional genres such as story time, Q&amp;A, and vlog, which feature personal expressions of emotions and experiences, is illustrative of an increased personalisation of political communication, where the dimension if intimacy is emphasised.</jats:p>",

Findings show that people are relatively good at discerning between correct and misleading statements about the war. Prior negative attitudes about the Ukraine invasion, the level of concern about the war, not having a conspiracy mindset, self-perceived media literacy, and the extent to which people believe fact-checks to be effective in fighting misinformation are all predictors of the accuracy of misinformation detection of the respondents. These results offer insights into how ideologically based/motivated misinformation could be countered in a war crisis context, in a country bordering the conflict.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article sets out to explore the phenomenon of willing digital disconnect by reconsidering and reworking some of the central ideas that currently fall under the umbrella of technological non-use. The presupposition of binary divisions between the dichotomies ‘users’–‘non-users’ and ‘analogue’–‘digital’ is put into question as the article explores the taking up of predigital technologies and the explicit and implicit disengagement from contemporary digital technologies. In short, this article asks: What does the contemporary revival of analogue technologies reveal about the social and material processes that constitute ‘use’, and what are the implications for the conceptual division of the terms analogue and digital? To answer these questions, the article draws on assemblage theory to describe the material and expressive performativity of social structure – that is, how individuals interact with technology. Empirical evidence comes from three illustrative cases where predigital technologies have replaced an existing digital alternative. Results emphasize the importance of understanding the material and expressive reconfigurations that underline technological use in a post-digital society in order to move beyond binary concepts such as analogue/digital or use/non-use as well as concepts such as the digital divide. </jats:p>",

Digital housework, like other forms of domestic labour, contributes to identity and self-worth. The concept of housework also affords visibility of the digital housekeeper’s enrolment in the project of maintaining the household.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Theatre is increasingly exploring the potential of interactivity, especially as the growing experience economy reveals that people actively seek activities that offer new ways to engage with stories. The inclusion of interactive elements akin to game mechanics, which I call ergodic mechanics, shifts these performances into an intermedial sphere between digital games and conventional theatre. I use the term ergodic theatre to classify this specific subgenre of immersive theatre where the traveller works to form their path through the storyworld. Ergodic mechanics are the systems through which the traveller works or interacts. But what impact does the inclusion of ergodic mechanics have on storytelling? This question is critical to producing meaningful ergodic theatre performances and preventing interactive elements from becoming gimmicks, as some theatre reviewers have labelled them (Gardner, 2014). I interrogate the relationship between and impact of ergodic mechanics on the creation of story and meaning by examining narrative moments from The Under Presents, a VR ergodic theatre experience, and What Remains of Edith Finch and Dream, both digital ergodic theatre experiences. Analysing these case studies helps demonstrate the value of weaving ergodic mechanics with the story. When there is harmony between the interactive and story elements, the included ergodic mechanics heighten the traveller’s narrative engagement and emotional connection to the play’s characters or themes. I argue that ludonarrative harmony loops are a powerful tool that can enrich the traveller’s theatrical experience. I present an interdisciplinary approach by applying digital game theory parsed through dramaturgy to address the nuances of telling meaningful and engaging stories in ergodic theatre. Analysing the incorporation and dramaturgical function of interactivity highlights the potential of ergodic mechanics in intermedial ergodic performances. Furthermore, creating ludonarrative harmony is central to ergodic theatre’s continued success and growth as a storytelling medium.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Apart from the exchanging of information, an important role of conversation and communication is to promote social harmony through the maintenance of relationships. This is referred to as the ‘phatic’ function of communication. Indeed, digital communications technologies, and social media in particular, have been lauded for their potential to promote activism and social change through ‘raising awareness’ of injustices, their ability to motivate people into political action and the facility to organize and coordinate that action for maximum effect. In this article, I build upon previous arguments, which suggested that the rise of social networking demonstrated that online culture and communication had become increasingly phatic and less dialogic. Here I use previous empirical work to challenge the above claims of digital politics enthusiasts. I then suggest an alternative theoretical account of the function of digital media activism which better suits these empirical findings. I suggest that digital politics demonstrates a rise of ‘phatic communion’ in social media. Incorporating Heidegger’s notion of ‘idle talk’, I further suggest that the rise of a phatic online culture in social media activism has atrophied the potential for digital communications technologies to help foster social change by creating a conversational environment based on limited forms of expressive solidarity as opposed to an engaged, content-driven, dialogic public sphere. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This text concerns conflict between users of 4chan and Tumblr, two groups said to have formed a vanguard to the ‘online culture wars’ of the last decade. Specifically, I focus on a 2014 clash known as the ‘Tumblr-4chan raids’. Predating the more infamous Gamergate controversy, I see this event as a useful alternative microcosm to study polarisation among online subcultures in the mid-2010s. Drawing from subculture studies, I first theorise cross-site clashes as puncturing a sense of ‘subcultural territoriality’ whereby an online platform is appropriated as a secluded refuge. Through a quali-quantitative archival study, I find that the raids were initiated and exacerbated by trolling 4channers rather than a clash between equal sides. I ultimately argue that the feud partially arose out of 4channers’ reactionary ‘media ideologies’ on the Internet, wherein sensitivity, empathy, and care were seen as incongruous with ideas on the online as brutal and unforgiving. Next to better-known political clashes between feminists and anti-feminists, the paper thus highlights the polarising role of media ideologies at the onset of the ‘online culture wars’ in the mid-2010s. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines a new form of philanthropic fundraising as pioneered by the YouTuber MrBeast. We argue that MrBeast, by harnessing the advertising revenue sharing model of YouTube’s Partner Program, has created an innovative model of philanthropic giving funded by mobilising what Marxist communication theorists refer to as the ‘audience’ or ‘prosumer commodity’. Through this method, MrBeast has been able to use the algorithmically managed, revenue sharing model of YouTube, and the spectacle of philanthropy, to draw in ever larger audiences and thus create large amounts of advertising and sponsorship revenue to fund philanthropic activities. This revenue in turn funds even larger philanthropic acts in subsequent videos, drawing more audiences and revenue. Unlike previous media-based fundraising, which would ask audience members to contribute their own money or time to a cause, MrBeast positions his audiences as a knowing audience commodity whose viewership funds direct contributions of other people’s money to good causes, merely by watching and being entertained. We assess the implications of this both for current debates around the ‘work’, labour’, and ‘exploitation’ of audience and prosumer commodities, and their monetisation for philanthropic giving. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The terms ‘Internet’ and ‘Web’ are often mistakenly used interchangeably in everyday discourse. This article investigates the communication strategies employed by CERN, the birthplace of the Web, and by Robert Cailliau, one of its “inventors”, to differentiate between the Web and the Internet during the early 1990s. Using the marketing concept of brand confusion, which occurs when consumers confuse one brand with another that is apparently similar, we analyze CERN’s approach to fight this misunderstanding. Using previously unpublished historical sources housed in the WWW collection at CERN and an interview with Robert Cailliau, the paper identifies three marketing strategies employed to mitigate the confusion: direct marketing, content marketing, and event marketing/public relations. These efforts began in the mid-1990s in response to widespread public confusion exacerbated by inaccurate media portrayals of the Web. CERN’s goal was to educate its employees, early users, and the general public on the nature of the Web by leveraging analogies with familiar concepts, making the technology more understandable. In addition, CERN sought to establish the Web’s distinct identity by emphasizing its European origins and its development inside CERN. This was reinforced through consistent branding elements, including logos, colors, and experiential marketing at public events. Despite these strategic efforts, the persistent conflation of ‘Web’ and ‘Internet’ underscores the inherent challenges in effectively communicating complex technological concepts to the public, suggesting that even well-aligned marketing strategies may be constrained by external factors and contextual influences.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>While the widespread visibility on digital platforms and intensifying promotional cultures online have questioned ‘underground status’ in music and performance scenes, scene participants continue to construct underground identities online to increase their subcultural capital and manoeuvre politico-economic environments. In Shanghai, venues and event organisations negotiate their underground status through the dissemination of digital flyers on WeChat, targeting niche taste communities and navigating surveillance and censorship mechanisms of the digital platform and local authorities. Taking visibility as a lens to analyse underground status, this paper argues that multiple small but closely related music and performance scenes in Shanghai (including clubbing, drag, and BDSM) construct underground identities by negotiating their social, commercial, and political ethos within WeChat’s regime of visibility. Emphasising the interconnected nature of virtual and physical visibilities, it develops an understanding of ‘hybrid visibilities’ that consist of representational, coded, fractured, and offline visibilities. This paper contributes to debates in popular music studies by arguing that the notion of ‘underground’ still holds relevance within scenes through the negotiation of hybrid visibilities. It also engages with platform studies by suggesting a more nuanced conception of online visibility that includes (sub)cultural and social capital besides economic forms of capital.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Temporarily disconnecting from social media has become more widespread in recent years with users choosing to limit or stop engaging with social media platforms for a period of time. There are no published syntheses that integrate the collective research on this phenomenon, nor how this behaviour is experienced. This review provides insight into the research on this phenomenon and proposes a conceptual framework for understanding social media user’s temporal discontinuance experience. We conducted a scoping review of 27 articles published during 2010–2020, focusing on the most salient factors of temporal discontinuance. Our review revealed a number of issues related to users’ motivations for temporal discontinuance, including the need to address self-reported problematic and excessive social media use, the want to restore control and/or agency, as well as the desire to minimise distractions and address privacy concerns. We identified the various benefits and challenges temporal disconnectors experience and describe two specific practices related to their return to social media use: 1) manipulating technological and/or platform affordances and/or 2) self-regulating behaviours. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

Instead, we have witnessed an inversion whereby mobile games, once categorized as ‘casual’, became ‘serious’ and now casual again. With the ubiquity of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and location aware services along with the transformation of the mobile phone into the multi-mode mobile media, the capacity for mobile location-aware games to teach us new types of experience of place and sketch new cartographies for place has burgeoned. By traversing the online and offline simultaneously through haptic (touch) screens, the possibilities for mobile gaming to teach us new ways of experiencing place upon various levels — that is, not just as a physical geography but technologically, emotionally, psychologically — is endless. In this article I explore the various forms of urban mobile gaming, especially around the experiential and experimental types such as location-based mobile gaming. I focus upon a case study of the Korean mobile game group, Dotplay, in order to flesh out some of the ways in which place reflects, and is inflected by, mobile gaming.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent fears of data capitalism and colonialism often argue using implicit assumptions about cybernetic technology’s ability to automate data about culture. As such, the level of data granularity made possible by cybernetic engineering can be used to dominate society and culture. Here we unpack these implicit assumptions about the datafication of culture through memes, which both act as cultural data and cultural memory. Using Alexander Galloway’s critical method of protocological analysis and descriptions of media tactics, we respond to fears of cybernetic domination. Protocols – the source by which cybernetic technologies enable automated datafication – enables us to respond to fears with optimism, and it further enables a more extensive development of how memetic memory functions. Our development shows that memetic memory often emerges before cybernetic datafication, offering moments of resistance from cybernetic domination. Further, this development enables a vitalist development of memetic memory, borrowing from Bergsonian theory and related contemporary media theories. Such a work contributes by providing cybernetic context in which culture, characterized through memes, resists cybernetic domination. In the process of this contribution, it also contributes a novel theory of memetic memory. Inspired by recent posthuman new media theory, we provide a novel reading of Richard Dawkins’ genetically inspired meme as well as Limor Shifman’s notion of memetic ‘stance’. Taken together, we contribute the beginnings of a memetic theory of vitalism which speaks more readily with critical cybernetic discourse.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Art museums and the incorporation of virtual reality: Examining the impact of VR on spatial and social norms",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Art museums implicate established spatial and social norms. The norms that shape these behaviours are not fixed, but rather subject to change as the sociality and physicality of these spaces continues to develop. In recent years, the re-emergence of virtual reality (VR) has led to this technology being incorporated into art museums in the form of VR-based exhibits. While a growing body of research now explores the various applications, uses and effects of VR, there is a notable dearth of studies examining the impact VR might be having on the spatial and social experience of art museums. This article, therefore, reports on an original research project designed to address these concerns. The project was conducted at Anise Gallery in London, United Kingdom, between June and July 2018 and focused on the multisensory, and VR-based, exhibition, Scents of Shad Thames. The research involved 19 semi-structured interviews with participants who had just experienced this exhibition. Drawing on scholarly literature that surrounds the spatial and social norms pertaining to art museums, this study advances along three lines. First, the research explores whether the inclusion of VR might alter the practice of people watching, which is endemic of this setting. Second, the research explores whether established ways of navigating the physical setting of art museums might influence how users approach the digital space of VR. Third, the research examines whether the incorporation of VR might produce a qualitatively different experience of the art museum as a shared social space. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In an age marked by the Post-media condition, the term ‘New Media Art’ remains in use in reference to a professional territory not autonomous, but also different from the territory of Contemporary Art, and its members use various rhetorical tactics to maintain and expand their professional authority. This study aims at analyzing the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey using Thomas F. Gieryn’s concept of the ‘boundary-work’. The data obtained via semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with a purposively sampled population of artists, curators and producers are used to assess whether a common cultural repertoire exists in this territory and whether it conforms to or contradicts its global counterpart. The study finds that since the mid-1990s, the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey has developed in parallel with the world, but not monolithically. The curators/producers’ ideology is defined by potential for democratization, intersections of art, science and technology, interaction/interactivity and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, they exhibit two repertoire variants positively correlated with the subjects’ career orientations. The artists’ common ideology is similar to the curators’/producers’, but their cultural repertoires are more flexible thanks to the variety of their individual practices. The study concludes that this duality emerges due to the limited funding sources in Turkey.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper argues for a fluid approach to the study of agency in relation to algorithms, one that promotes crossing the boundaries of established analytical positions and breaking away from dualistic forms to frame its study. Building on various intellectual traditions, we develop three sensibilities for implementing such an approach: (a) working with tensions as an alternative to thinking about algorithmic power and human agency as an either/or binary; (b) examining mediations to reverse the tendency to treat algorithms as an ahistorical and universal force; and (c) exploring transversalities to navigate the spaces that emerge between various temporalities and levels of analysis. To make our case, we examine a crucial tension in the study of agency and algorithms, namely how scholars have either attributed power to algorithms or agency to users of algorithmic systems. The conclusion situates our argument for fluidity within larger historical debates in the study of technological power and human agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses the forced digitalization of activism brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in the case of the transnational environmental youth movement Fridays for Future (FFF). Theoretically, we engage with social movement action repertoires to study the shifts in protest tactics associated with the social restrictions during the early stages of the pandemic. A qualitative content analysis of 781 posts across all 27 national FFF Facebook pages in the European Union reveals four clusters of digital action types: digital contentious actions; online information and education; digital community engagement and online partnership development. While digital media were part of FFF’s action repertoire in pre-pandemic times, our findings yield that the shift from the movement’s iconic street protests to exclusively digital tactics privileges community-building and education over contentious actions, potentially softening the political impact of the movement’s landmark ‘school strike’. Furthermore, although timely tactical flexibility kept the movement going during country lockdowns, the forced digitalization in the early stages of the pandemic primarily recombined existing action tactics rather than innovating them. </jats:p>",

Bourdieuvian field analysis is utilized to reveal the local forms of capital that characterize those sites as fields of cultural production. Special attention is given to the enabling function of photos in the exchange between cultural, corporeal and social capital. Unlike both ‘home mode’ photos aimed for family and friends and professional photos aimed for strangers, photos in SNSs are an instrument aimed at making strangers into friends through their incorporation in a consumerist visual representation of society as a catalogue. Rather than an expression of a reflexively chosen identity, the photos produced by different actors are explained by their corresponding position in the field and composition of capital, as well as by the photos’ functionality.</jats:p>",

In the fields of community storytelling, documentary and social activism, it is possible to see an emerging intersection between the affordances of digital technologies and the recognition of the stories of marginalized people.

The study concludes that a digital newsroom designed to handle 24 hour reporting does not necessarily nor automatically have a suitable structure to deal with a crisis event. Rather, in this particular case the structure used for 24/7 coverage, based on journalists’ independence and decentralization, was directly counterproductive when dealing with a crisis event. </jats:p>",

However, as Alexis Weedon pointed out in Convergence 2, no. 1, before the new product can be brought to the consumer a business infrastructure has to be created to bring together previously competing supplier or distribution systems. Thus interactivity in the form of technological compatibility of communications systems is a prerequisite for these new media products and the convergence of previously separate and perhaps competing business interests is also necessary before the consumer market can be accessed. And while the extent of that market may be determined by the ’user friendliness’ of the product, the delivery system also has an effect on the customers’ perception of the value of the product. Therefore it is vital that the business equation is optimal = that both the product and the delivery infrastructure combine to create the interactive experience which will appeal to the market. In",

    "abstract": "The work Exchange Fields was commissioned by the exhibition Vision Ruhr, held in Dortmund, Germany, in 2000. The work was a collaboration between the Dutch dancer/choreographer Regina Van Berkel, myself and the programmer Gideon May. The central question dealt with the generation of a new kind of interface how might an embodied experience of interface be layered into the content of an interactive media/dance comprised of video, text, a sculptural installation and music? Exchange Fields sought to develop a novel interface strategy by eliciting culturally determined environmental ’behaviour in relation to objects’ as a grammar of gesture that could be used as input to the reacting system. The physical interface system functioned as an embodied intuition. The work sought to tap into prelinguistic environmental knowledge related to the use of particular varieties of objects. A series of furniture/sculptures were developed. Each furniture/sculpture was designed with a unique implied ’suggestion’ of how the body might be positioned in relation to that",

This category includes technologies as diverse as head-up displays, augmented reality, military gunsights, and others. This article identifies and discusses the first see-through graphical interface, the British Mark II gyro gunsight, a computing gunsight used in the cockpits of fighter aircraft during the latter half of World War II. On the basis of an analysis of the design and history of this gunsight, this article considers the implications of see-through graphical interfaces for prevailing ideas on virtuality, materiality, human–computer interaction, and media history. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rethinking digital media and political change",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of new digital media in politics has often been discussed for individual countries and technologies, or at a general level. So far, there are few studies which compare countries and treat new media in the context of the media system as a whole, including traditional and new digital media. The main contribution of this article is to compare two countries at the extremes of the political spectrum and with quite different media systems, the United States and Sweden. It synthesizes what is known to date about digital media in these two cases, including about the uses of Twitter, Facebook and other new media. The article discusses the shortcomings of existing analyses of political communication and of how digital media work in a way that is different from traditional or mass media. The argument is that new media expand input from people into the political systems only at the margins, where they can circumvent established agenda setting and gatekeeping mechanisms. The article develops a framework for understanding digital media which highlights how they extend and diversify the public sphere, even as this sphere is monitored and managed, and still faces the constraint of the limited attention devoted to political issues. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book review: Into the universe of technical images",
    "abstract": "The basis for an ‘emerging universe and emerging consciousness,’ Czech-born philosopher Vilém Flusser (1920–1991) wrote in 1985, ‘is the calculation of probability.’ That is, the use of mathematics and information theory to determine what would, could, and will happen. But make no mistake: the Flusserian universe is no dystopia. Rather, it is seeped in thick ambivalence; at once utopia and hell. On the one hand, the new universe of technical images, which has already begun to materialize, will ensure a ‘fabulous’ future society full of ‘creativity’. But on the other hand, Flusser admits, ‘I am horrified [of] the emerging universe. Thank God I will not experience it.’ (p. 128). These constitutive tensions run throughout the highly provocative and uniquely written Into the Universe of Technical Images. Flusser’s ‘telematic’ universe was conceived in 1985. It consists perhaps entirely of what he terms ‘technical images’. Unlike ‘traditional images,’ where one can grasp the world and environment through magical action (p. 9), technical images are not surfaces but rather ‘mosaics assembled from particles’ (p. 6); particles assembled into visual images (p. 10). What exists between these particles? Voids or ‘intervals that hold the elemental points apart’ (p. 15). The technical universe is a cosmos of pure particles. Technical images begin as ‘raw’ particles, which, through the rubrics of information theory and cybernetics, are then sorted into a new order of ‘negative entropy’, as he terms it elsewhere. However, technical images are not exclusively digital and this is where Flusser’s philosophy of technology is truly distinct from his contemporaries. The universe of technical images includes film, photography, television, video, computing, and even the typewriter. How is this possible? Recall first that the logic of computation existed long before the electronic computer. Second, all of these media involve technical sorting and ordering processes that transform raw materials— photons, electrons, or dye substances—into a new order and intelligibility. Technical images turn a ‘concept’ into a ‘visualization’ by making the abstract concrete. In distinction, traditional images, like paintings, depict the empirically perceived world more or less directly (they do not require any ‘keys’ for translation like a shutter release or keyboard). At the same time, Flusser suggest that electronic images are purer forms of technical images. ‘After the Information Revolution,’ he writes ‘contemporary films [will] resemble the cave paintings at Lascaux more closely than they do images of fractal equations of computer screens’ (p. 102). Electronic images are better technical images because their transcoding is more substantial. It is on the level of interpretation, however, that images in the telematic universe mark a radical departure from conventional visual studies. Traditional images mean and explain things and this is why, they are the age-old friend of hermeneutics. In contrast, technical images cannot be grasped or interpreted for ‘meaning’ in the way that traditional images can. Instead, they are posthermeneutic and consist of no tangible substrate; projecting organized particles into an empty field (p. 47). Thus, what a technical image means is also how it is structured—that is, the algorithmic protocols that condition its possibilities for visualization (p. 44). ‘To decode a technical image’ Flusser writes ‘is not to decode what it shows but to read how it is programmed’ (p. 48). The future requires these post-hermeneutic reading strategies that run along the surface of material relations, operations, and connections. Book reviews 119",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Societal crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, produce societal instability and create a fertile ground for radicalization. Extremists exploit such crises by distributing disinformation to amplify uncertainty and distrust among the public. Based on these developments, this study presents a longitudinal analysis of far-right communication on fringe platforms, demonstrating radicalization dynamics. Public Telegram communication of three movements active in Germany (QAnon, Identitarian Movement, Querdenken) was analyzed through a quantitative content analysis of 4500 messages posted to nine channels between March 2020 and February 2021. We study the movements' discourse using several indicators of radicalization dynamics. The increasing prevalence of conspiracy narratives, anti-elitism, political activism, and support for violence indicate radicalization dynamics in these movements’ online communication. However, these dynamics varied within the movements. It can be concluded that, when studying radicalization dynamics online, it is crucial to not just focus on one single indicator, but consider longitudinal changes across several indicators, ideally comparing different movements.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines what smartness does on the ground by examining how its anticipatory media visions have been interpreted and acted on in policy decisions and local implementations since the early 2000s. Using a comparative-historical analysis that draws on fieldwork in aspiring smart cities in the United States and Europe, we argue that the visions of smartness are neither singular nor fixed across time and space. Instead, the role of smartness in diffusing new technologies is recruited and reshaped in the present to lend legitimacy to future public and private interventions. We first demonstrate that the narrative of crisis, often associated with smartness, shifted from a pre-2008 emphasis on sustainability and climate change to a post-financial crisis engagement with entrepreneurship and platformization. We then discuss how the development of smart city initiatives has followed divergent paths in the United States and Europe, with big tech companies dominating in the former and the ‘living lab’ model prevailing in the latter. Our analysis highlights the importance of investigating the complex relationships between anticipatory media visions of smartness and their varying, down-to-earth implementations in the built environment rather than solely focusing on the discursive appeal of techno-idealism. It also explains the enduring appeal of smartness as an urban vision, despite its various shortcomings, by revealing its adaptability to the changing social and political–economic shifts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Within this article, we explore the rise of predictive policing in the United States as a form of big data surveillance. Bringing together literature from communication, criminology, and science and technology studies, we use a case study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA to outline that predictive policing, rather than being a novel development, is in fact part of a much larger, historical network of power and control. By examining the mechanics of these policing practices: the data inputs, behavioral outputs, as well as the key controllers of these systems, and the individuals who influenced their adoption, we show that predictive policing as a form of big data surveillance is a sociotechnical system that is wholly human-constructed, biases and all. Identifying these elements of the surveillance network then allows us to turn our attention to the resistive practices of communities who historically and presently live under surveillance – pointing to the types of actions and imaginaries required to combat the myth and allure that swirls around the rhetoric of big data surveillance today. </jats:p>",

At their best, such mixtures shake us free of everyday paradigms, producing rich insights into and new forms of the technological mediation of everyday life. Scripted Spaces was organised as just such an event and included an eclectic and interesting array of ’space-makers’. Participants, ranging from academics to filmmakers to architects to computer programmers, convened to think through how spaces script stories, how places narrate and are narrated. The successes and limits of the conference provide important lessons for how we might continue to navigate between theory and practice.",

It also opens discussions on electronic publishing, piracy, exploring untapped markets both locally and internationally, among others. In-depth interviews were conducted in order to investigate the firsthand experiences of contemporary comic book publishers in the Philippines. We limited our study to independent publishers, noting that their experiences are also testament to the end of the monopoly of big, commercial presses in comics publishing. Findings reveal that comics publishers in the Philippines (1) belong to a close-knit community of creatives and academics; (2) benefit from comic conventions and cult followings; (3) manage to operate with insufficient support from local bookstores; and (4) use various coping strategies in the form of novel roles, products, and distribution systems. </jats:p>",

Within formal Media Studies courses, student production has often been perceived as merely an adjunct to (or an illustration of) the theory; although most teachers would now recognise it as an indispensable aspect of the subject. Meanwhile, both in schools and in informal settings, media production has also been seen as a valuable means of developing young people’s social and communication skills. In practice, most media production courses are based on a combination of these different rationales albeit often an uneasy and contradictory one.2 2",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>From documenting human rights abuses to studying online advertising, web archives are increasingly positioned as critical resources for a broad range of scholarly Internet research agendas. In this article, we reflect on the motivations and methodological challenges of investigating the world’s largest web archive, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine (IAWM). Using a mixed methods approach, we report on a pilot project centred around documenting the inner workings of ‘Save Page Now’ (SPN) – an Internet Archive tool that allows users to initiate the creation and storage of ‘snapshots’ of web resources. By improving our understanding of SPN and its role in shaping the IAWM, this work examines how the public tool is being used to ‘save the Web’ and highlights the challenges of operationalising a study of the dynamic sociotechnical processes supporting this knowledge infrastructure. Inspired by existing Science and Technology Studies (STS) approaches, the paper charts our development of methodological interventions to support an interdisciplinary investigation of SPN, including: ethnographic methods, ‘experimental blackbox tactics’, data tracing, modelling and documentary research. We discuss the opportunities and limitations of our methodology when interfacing with issues associated with temporality, scale and visibility, as well as critically engage with our own positionality in the research process (in terms of expertise and access). We conclude with reflections on the implications of digital STS approaches for ‘knowing infrastructure’, where the use of these infrastructures is unavoidably intertwined with our ability to study the situated and material arrangements of their creation.</jats:p>",

News gamification emerged as a way to offer a more personalized news experience and a playful content by employing tools like badges, points, and leaderboards. As we are beginning to understand the benefits and pitfalls of gamifying news, the influence of the gamification on the news reporting techniques and news delivery structures is still not fully explored. The current study analyzes two games: Pirate Fishing: An Interactive Investigation and #Hacked Syria’s Electronic Armies, for the main generic news frames employed within interactive gamified contexts. Drawing on the integrative framing analysis approach, the study employs an innovative qualitative content analysis to investigate the multimodal – structural, textual, and visual – generic frames each game involves. By revisiting a contemporary list of news values, the study provides a further discussion about changing news values in the gamified setting. </jats:p>",

    "title": "New territories for fan studies: The insurrection, QAnon, Donald Trump and fandom",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The following roundtable is a recorded and edited discussion between four fan studies researchers that took place in March 2022. Having all worked with QAnon and the insurrection in the context of fan studies, our discussion took its departure from the US insurrection on January 6, 2021, as QAnon fans, Trump fans, and other right-wing groups stormed the US Capitol building while live-streaming their endeavor to social media. The discussion draws out some main perspectives that may guide our future thinking in the context of fandom, complicity, and politics and points toward new cultural and social territories for research into fandom and fan practices. Centrally, as fandom enters into the domain of politics and conspiracy theories, it seems increasingly unfruitful to distinguish between fan practices and participatory culture. Instead, participatory culture’s primary mode seems to be deeply driven by fan practices, that is, textual poaching and enunciative and textual productivity (Jenkins, 2013; Fiske, 1992). Instead, understanding this amalgamation of fan practices into other social domains can help us make sense of current phenomena in the seeming growth of conspiracy theory communities and right-wing movements alike. Participatory culture is a source of great creativity, playfulness, and mobilization of social and political movements, but, as Jenkins pointed out as early as 2006 “has benefited third parties, revolutionaries, reactionaries, and racists alike” (Jenkins, 2006, p. 221). In some instances, it seems that these online communities are driven by fan practices, in other instances fan communities are weaponized in order to serve a political agenda. While research into fandom and politics (see Hinck, 2019; Jenkins et al., 2020, Sandvoss, 2012, etc.) and toxic cultures (Proctor et. al., 2018) is certainly not new, it seems that the current transmedial landscapes drive participation and complicity in very specific ways that fan studies would do well to focus on in the coming years. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Streaming diversity: Studying screen diversity in the streaming era",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The unprecedented growth of video-on-demand (VOD) streaming platforms has brought both new optimism and new complications to concerns around screen ‘diversity’. To what extent have major global and smaller regional VOD platforms invested in screen diversity, at the level of genres, languages, country-of-origin, social representation or creative labour? Just how ‘diverse’ are the catalogues of VOD services? How is this content represented to audiences and made discoverable through platform interfaces and recommendation systems? How might this vary across the major US-based services, compared with smaller and more niche platforms, or with local broadcaster VODs, or with national public service VODs? This introduction to a special collection on diversity in the streaming era surveys recent developments in screen and media studies scholarship that attempt to address these questions. In doing so, we examine how streaming platforms are addressing diversity at the levels of industry, policy, texts, technologies and audiences. At each level, we observe different definitions, operationalisations, and practices of ‘diversity’ that are informed by a range of disciplinary theorisations, policy histories and priorities, and national and regional contexts, all of which come to intersect with each other in new and challenging ways in the VOD era. In conclusion, we argue that to properly respond to the problem of ‘diversity’, research on screen diversity and on VODs must engage with these diverse dimensions of ‘diversity’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Abtract: This paper proposes that to understand the meanings that technological innovation holds for social life, empirical evidence must accompany theoretical analysis. Using data from the large-scale and longitudinal UK-wide futura.com survey conducted by the University of Leeds (UK), the key questions of emergent technologies' relationships to the formation of social solidarity and identity, and the patterns of social activities found among IT users are addressed. The evidence to date does not support the argument that technological innovation is directly linked to changes in identity, or is resulting in declining levels of social activity. IT uptake is an evolutionary rather than revolutionary process. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "multi-channel Arab television illuminates recent changes in the TV industry as well as new patterns of media use, and thus corresponds well with the key questions raised in the introduction. Likewise, the last chapter, written by Anthony Y.H. Fung, provides a useful insight in Chinese TV-culture and the impact of global format exchange on national production. This chapter provides a useful analysis, and includes relevant empirical examples. As opposed to some of the other chapters, the examples are accessible as references also for readers outside the domestic TV culture of the authors. In sum, this highly relevant book approaches significant and interesting aspects of television and the current regulatory, technological and cultural changes dominating television worldwide. The ambition to understand recent trends in post-broadcast television, while at the same time reflecting significant ongoing global changes, though, is only partly achieved. The book is nevertheless original in its inclusion of studies of television outside Anglo-American regions, and thus lays the ground for further studies of television, globalization and fragmentation.",

Previous literature has examined individuals’ digital citizenship with some determinants of technology use. However, individuals’ level of social media competence (SMC) has not yet been examined in relation to digital citizenship. To increase knowledge of the ingredients that may be important for education programs to improve individuals’ digital citizenship, this study examined SMC and digital citizenship among 772 college students. The results identified that five of the six social media competencies examined were predictors of individuals’ digital citizenship. These findings provided empirical evidence of a relationship between SMC and digital citizenship, which should be considered by researchers and practitioners when formalizing educational programs, developing curricula, and designing pedagogy for improving individuals’ digital citizenship. </jats:p>",

The digital discourse on the Serial subReddit can be understood, using concepts derived from network society theory (Castells, 2005) as a form of deliberative digital democracy (Dahlberg, 2011) in which crowdsourced evidence bears the weight of establishing the “rational” nature of a constructive, public discourse about practices employed by democratic institutions. However, the same evidence serves to reveal the limits of this form of digital deliberation when it is used in the practice of “doxing”—the online, public posting of private information about private individuals (Davison, 2012). This tension reveals the complicated relationship between democracy, privacy, and emerging technologies.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2004, artist David Firth launched the lo-fi animation Salad Fingers in the user-generated content sharing platform Newgrounds. The series, focused on a strange, unsettling narrative about a character that acts as a child but commits unhinged violent acts, went on to become viral in the earliest days of YouTube. Created with the software Flash (launched by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe), which generates vector images, Salad Fingers is a significant stylistic and generic contribution to the early period of participatory digital cultures. The series operates as a bridge between analogue and digital artforms that privilege the sensorial over narrative cohesion, while also cultivating a distinctive ‘uncanny-weird’ mode tied to early participatory digital cultures, trends that perdure in contemporary animation. We articulate how Salad Fingers operates in the distinctive ‘digital uncanny’, an aesthetic and cultural mode that would become pervasive in visual media cultures on YouTube and beyond. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Popular social media platforms in China, such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu (REDnote), use machine learning algorithms to curate personalized feeds and enforce content moderation. But the opacity of such algorithms introduces socially consequential and often problematic mechanisms of classification. Given the playful resistance of queer individuals against a normative social environment, the interaction between algorithms and content creators warrants close examination. This study investigates how LGBTQ+ content creators navigate these algorithm-driven platforms, focusing on their negotiation of digital normativity to share non-heterosexual content and foster queer sociality in China. Avoiding the oversimplification of viewing algorithms and those implementing them as monolithic entities, I explore how content creators creatively manage to produce and distribute their work within the constraints of these platforms, and even by playing with these constraints. I collected data from an ethnography on algorithms, interviews, and an open-source investigation into recommendation algorithms, through a scavenge approach. I argue that LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithms in ways that are simultaneously non-conforming and non-confrontational. They imagine algorithmic effects, appropriate outcomes, and play with the opacity of machine learning to navigate three aspects of digital normativity in China: heteronormativity, Internet civilization, and commercialization. Empirically, I identified three strategies used to create and expand queer sociality within these constraints: camouflaging, filtering, and verticalizing. Theoretically, I introduce ‘workarounds’ as a framework that transcends the binary perspectives of conformity and resistance in discussions of authoritarian governance, algorithmic control, and user-platform interaction. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Pokémon Go is a hybrid reality game (HRG) that research suggests is played by families in the context of joint-media engagement. Yet, the game interface itself provides little information about how to approach the game. Given this and the fact that many parents play this HRG with their young children, we examine the process of parent online social learning to play Pokémon Go. Drawing on an original study of Pokémon Go conducted between August and November 2019, including a Facebook survey on a non-probabilistic purposive sample, and semi-structured interviews with a range of parents who play this HRG with their children, the aim of this article is to explore parent online social learning as a path to optimising in-game performance. In the main, we found that the frequency with which parents followed tips provided by individuals online related inversely to how well they knew them and was differentially linked to the sources of information parents used. We nuance these findings with insights from the interviews. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I argue that indigenous Latin American food delivery workers organize to defy information and knowledge asymmetries by utilizing technology built to mediate online social interactions. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, this paper investigates transnational modes of community-building and network formation and examines how these networks are instrumental for delivery workers in New York City to exercise agency, forge their narrative, and resist platform control by resisting, pushing, and extending a variety of digital and communication technologies. I analyze how public and private means of communication facilitate and constrain social forms of organization by mapping how delivery workers communicate and engage collectively both in the physical and the digital worlds. My research reveals two platforms that workers use to share information: one that operates inwards (WhatsApp) and another that operates outwards (Facebook). These channels represent opposite sides of the spectrum between public and private and synergize to form a transnational distributed knowledge network to shape and interpret the collective identity of Latin American delivery workers. Overall, this article sheds light on how the flow of information through different spaces and times enables delivery workers to construct a place for subversion and negotiation with roles assigned to them by broader socio-political forces. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Modern society is characterized by technological and social acceleration. Digital devices and technologies have been integrated into nearly every aspect of our lives, from the public to the personal, transforming the material, social and mental worlds at an accelerating rate. To deal with the feeling of acceleration, carefully limiting the number of choices and features in the digital devices we use every day is central in order to facilitate and sustain creativity and focus. Under the umbrella term of post-digital artifacts, there are today several examples of ‘alternative’ products that offer limited functionality as a feature – and they seem to be growing in popularity. Using a qualitative analysis of online texts surrounding a selection of post-digital artifacts: two mobile phones (the Light Phone and the Punkt), a writing tablet (reMarkable), and a writing tool (Freewrite), the aim of this article is to understand the emergence of these post-digital artifacts and what the emergence says about a contemporary post-digital condition. The analysis results in an analytical framework identifying trajectories of opposing conceptual pairs of the digital and the post-digital. In addition, the article applies Rosa’s concept of ‘alienation’ and ‘resonance’ in order to further understand how and why these artifacts play a role in creating meaning and resonance in a digital society characterized by acceleration. Arguably, resonance (or a lack thereof) emerges as the key currency around what is at stake in the post-digital condition. Reclaiming control over knowledge, activities, spatiality and temporality emerges as essential to understanding what resonance means and what the case products produce. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article considers artistic engagements with string figure performance and collection as ‘imaginary’ articulations of digital media. As an object of anthropological inquiry, the string figure emerges in 1888 with a short paper by Franz Boas. Encouraged by more mainstream publications by Caroline Furness Jansen (2008) and Kathleen Haddon (1930), over the course of the 20th century the string figure would become a model through which largely western writers and artists have explored both the anxieties and dreams of ideal, embodied and networked communication technologies. The present article explores, specifically, the collecting projects and films of Harry Smith in the 1960s and 1970s; the video-performance piece of 1974, titled String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, by the interdisciplinary artist Vera Frenkel; and the string figure exhibit at David Wilson’s Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California. Through a media-archeological lens, the history of string figure fascination takes shape as a repository of dreams about (digital) communication, which, it is additionally suggested in a final section, might yet allow for the expansion and enlargement of conceptions of both digitality and media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines early videogames as part of a tradition in twentieth-century art. Looking at Pong (Atari, 1972) alongside works of Barnett Newman and Nam June Paik, I argue that this tradition grapples with the problem of attention: how to engender a deeper relationship, or an intimacy, between a playing body, mediating spaces or technologies and a pictorial surface. It is this relationship which is the locus of aesthetic practice - flattened, abstract depiction grounds experimentation with new media in visual, cognitive and haptic consumption, production and, progressively, co-production. Shading this with ambiguity is the consideration that games, and the rest of the tradition, can be seen as part of a disciplinary reconfiguration of attention along the lines of postindustrial production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> By reconstructing a basic temperature sensor and its chains of translation, the text presents a new approach to experimental media archeology, critical making and speculative design. Based on this experiment, the text proposes to investigate how sensoric mediation transforms data into operational signals, challenging the myth of ‘raw data’ as unfiltered representations of the environment and the clear distinction between analog and digital. In a micro-analysis, the text reconstructs the translations between the analog and the digital as processes of virtualization, through which what is processed by the computer shares an efficiency with what it refers to, without being of its nature or substance. In order to better understand how autonomous machines adapt to their environment by means of such translation chains, without assuming an isomorphic representation of the world or direct access to the environment, the text follows the first steps of such chains of translation in detail. Experiments with a simple temperature sensor and an Arduino microcontroller show how often unreflected and black-boxed pre-decisions flow into the necessary sensory mediations. This in turn sheds light on new forms of co-existence between humans and autonomous, sensor-based machines such as autonomous vehicles or robots. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The proliferation of conspiracy theories surrounding George Soros and the ‘Globalist invasion’ had been concentrated primarily in Eastern Europe, Russia and the United States. However, since Jair Bolsonaro’s presidential victory in Brazil, Soros has become a target of the far-right in the country. On Soros’ 90th Birthday in August 2020, the right-wing group ‘Movement for Conservative Brazil’ (Movimento Brasil Conservador – MBC) launched a campaign called ‘International Day Against George Soros’, aiming to attack the billionaire’s reputation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how this campaign worked across online platforms as a strategy to popularize the Globalism conspiracy theory in the biggest Latin American country. We aim (1) to map the dynamics of disinformation dissemination across chat apps using hyperlink analysis; and (2) to interpret conspiratorial narratives about George Soros shared on chat apps during the month of his 90th birthday. We collected messages mentioning the anti-Soros campaign in WhatsApp and Telegram public groups and channels to extract hyperlinks and domains. These websites were manually categorized in an effort to analyze which conspiracy theories about George Soros are being disseminated on chat apps in Brazil. Our results suggest an increasing cross-platform dissemination of narratives attacking Soros. This case study illustrates how the rise of a transnationally networked political right has been accompanied by an emerging alternative digital communication infrastructure through which conspiracy theories circulate.</jats:p>",

As industry-led discourse presented VR as a vision of opportunity and change in the tech industry, Launch Pad presented a vision of social progress through improved diversity. However, a variety of contextualizing factors within that first year complicate these visions of progress, including the gendered and racialized norms of the tech industry, the politics of Oculus’s co-founder and the mixed feelings of the first beneficiaries of the program. I argue that even if Launch Pad is a good faith effort to address historical and current forms of marginalization and underrepresentation in the tech industry, such efforts must go much further than mentorship and tokenized inclusion, requiring a genuine recognition of the need for systemic change.</jats:p>",

For the news industry, in the midst of its own debate over the role of 'new media' in its future, the stakes are high. This study uses Q methodology to illuminate two divergent views on the internet, one emphasising the First Amendment and the other stressing parental control. A Q study yielded two types: the 'Cyber-Jeuersonian', who firmly believes the government should not restrict cyberspace; and the 'Pragmatic Guardian', who has a greater interest in protecting children and less faith in the marketplace of ideas, and who believes some control is necessary. Recent polls and an apparent reinvigoration of the mass society theory indicate the Pragmatic Guardian's views are likely to be accommodated as legislation is crafted, industry response negotiated and parental action demanded. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How do we interpret the extraordinary visibility and ordinariness of social media as delivery workers resist their precarious working lives? Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, photo elicitation, and digital data collection in Turkey with a focus on delivery workers’ strikes in early 2022, we argue that understanding the delivery workers’ movement requires not only considering spectacular strikes and social media protests but also workers’ everyday forms of resistance and their ordinary uses of social media as part of what we call weapons of the gig. Although not as visible as spectacular street action and social media campaigns, these weapons (motorcycle drivers’ solidarity, algorithmic resistance, and social media use for information sharing, as well as production of humor and resentment) enable the subtle formation of a movement. Our contribution lies in reframing social media use as both an ordinary and extraordinary weapon of delivery workers and approaching workers’ solidarity as a question of continuum. Enabling us to look beyond the antagonisms in the labor process and locate affective tensions in the everyday, this approach allows for seeing workers not only as economic but also as political and affective subjects demanding freedom and searching for meaningful connection in their lives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article studies social perceptions of gig work and its conditions through the lenses of visual humour created and shared in digital environments. Food delivery services have thrived in cities, and riders – gig workers associated with such services – have become popular urban figures, easily recognisable through light means of transport and backpacks. These iconic elements have spread to forms of visual humour like memes and cartoons in social media. We aim to analyse the depiction of food delivery services and riders through graphic humour in digital environments, and its role as critical stances of gig work conditions. We draw from the literature on gig work, as well as critical humour in the workplace, approaching the phenomenon from the perspective of critical visualities and the memetic qualities of digital visual humour. Thus, we have conducted an analysis of rider memes, and carried out a focus group with Spanish cartoonists to better understand each form. From our analysis, we have observed that a) memes showcase less explicit critical stances but reflect a shared understanding of the hurdles associated to rider work; b) cartoons place riders in a contextualised, wider critique of platform economy and capitalism; c) while most graphic humour on riders takes an external, observational position, there is also an ‘inner look’ to the rider work, emphasising the promises and deceptions associated with the gig economy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines how people have constructed touchscreen smudges, those oily marks left behind by users’ fingers on shiny glass, as a form of ‘mess’. It offers an historical account of smudges between 2007 and 2010, when users, corporations, journalists, third-party accessory manufacturers and others began to first frame smudges as a problem for mobile media due to users’ constant touching and the evidence of their finger trails which functioned as a kind of ‘ visible tactility’. Solutions took the form of engineering special screen coatings or cultivating responsible users who would maintain their devices through cleaning and caretaking practices. In both these cases, smudges were denigrated not for degrading media content or breaking the device’s functionality, but rather for violating high-tech aesthetics and drawing attention to porous, tactile and germ-riddled bodies. The piece, bringing together this case with the present, encourages scholars to attend to the ways that users are entreated to tame and groom both their bodies and their media devices in particular socio-historical contexts. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘Hello, this is Martha’: Interaction dynamics of live scambaiting on Twitch",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growth of the Internet has seen the emergence of elaborate examples of cybercrime in the form of ‘scams’. Alongside this, a resistance has also developed, with ‘scambaiters’ engaging in complex and deceptive scenarios to waste scammers’ time and educate others about online scams. This has been facilitated by the evolution of new media platforms inclusive of the live stream video-sharing site Twitch, where scambaiters take part in interactions with scammers in real time in front of large audiences. Such platforms present significant potential for diverse interaction and participation roles that move beyond those of other sites and audiovisual media. Scambaiting texts thus present a valuable opportunity to explore the complex interactive affordances of live stream video-sharing platforms. In this article, we aim to map an interactional framework for live-streamed video-sharing platforms by analysing a scambait call by the scambaiter ‘Kitboga’ on Twitch. The results show that the platform of Twitch and the novel context of a live-streamed scambait call offer new insights into online interaction within the context of emerging digital genres. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital culture meets data: Critical perspectives",
    "abstract": "This special issue emerged from a need to explore how the turn to data is influencing work in digital culture and communication. Historically, digital culture is the focus of scholars positioned in a variety of disciplines that research digital cultures, including media and communication studies, digital humanities, science and society studies, and other critical theorists working at the intersections of social and cultural studies. The special issue ensued from the conference ‘Digital Culture meets data: Critical approaches’ organized by the Digital Culture and Communication Section of the European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA) at the University of Brighton in November 2017. With Ryan Burns and others in the organizing committee, we invited delegates to consider both theoretical and empirical perspectives that combine critical data studies and studies of digital culture. We posed a number of questions and provocations: What does this turn to data mean for our research, scholarship, and pedagogic practice? How can new approaches to data be used to augment and diversify our research and educational approaches? But also, how might researchers challenge data paradigms or aim to show alternative or complementary ways to address digital culture and communication? Since the conference took place in 2017, a lot of critical accounts have been written in relation to data, with focus on workplace practices and employment patterns (Moore, 2017; Till, 2018), but also activist and citizen practices (Jenzen et al., 2020; Mendes et al., 2019; Milan, 2019; Stephansen and Trere, 2019). Many of us have been particularly concerned with gender identities, gendered practices, including digital motherhood practices (Cobb, 2020; Das, 2019; Fotopoulou, 2017; Jarrett, 2019; Rich, 2018, 2019; Thornham, 2018). And there is a wealth of literature around digital health practices and platform infrastructures (Charitsis, 2019, Williams et al., 2020, Lupton, 2017) and what these mean for algorithmic persons (Kant, 2020). In the business world, digital culture is seen as the result of technological innovation. When bloggers write about it they refer to the ways in which digital technologies are shaping our",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The revived popularity of vinyl records in the United States provides a unique opportunity for ‘rethinking the distinction between new and old media’. With vinyl, the new/old dichotomy informs a more specific opposition between digital and analog. The vinyl record is an iconic analog artifact whose physical creation and circulation cannot be digitized. Making records involves arduous craft labor and old-school manufacturing, and the process remains essentially the same as it was in 1960. Vinyl culture and commerce today, however, abound with digital media: the majority of vinyl sales occur online, the download code is a familiar feature of new vinyl releases, and turntables outfitted with USB ports and Bluetooth are outselling traditional models. This digital disconnect between the contemporary traffic in records and their fabrication makes the vinyl revival an ideal case example for interrogating the limitations of new and old as conceptual horizons for media and for proffering alternative historical formulations and critical frameworks. Toward that end, my analysis of the revitalized vinyl economy in the United States suggests that the familiar (and always porous) distinction between corporate and independent continues to offer media studies a more salient spectrum, conceptually and empirically, than new-old or analog-digital. Drawing on ethnographic research along vinyl’s current supply chain in the United States, I argue that scholars and supporters of independent culture should strive to decouple the digital and the analog from the corporate, rather than from one another. The pressing question about the future of vinyl is not, will there continue to be a place for analog formats alongside the digital; but rather, to what extent can physical media circulate independently of the same corporate interests that have come to dominate popular culture in its digital forms? </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "clear example of the convergence between TV and the social web. ‘Affect and the television text’ is the title of chapter four. There, Bury studies the affective relations and commitment between viewers and serial narratives. The motivations to engage in piracy, to rewatch or to binge (or marathon view) certain shows are some of the aspects discussed. The chapter also serves as an introduction to fannish viewing practices which seem to be closely related to, for instance, the act of collecting DVDs. Finally, fandom 2.0 and participatory culture are the backbone of chapter five. Drawing on the results of her empirical work, Bury proposes a novel continuum of participation that considers ‘information seeking’ as the lowest degree of involvement (e.g. searching for upcoming episodes’ previous) and ‘cultural production’ as the highest degree (e.g. fanfiction writers). ‘Reaction and collective interpretation’ (e.g. sharing one’s opinions about the shows on the internet) and ‘community making’ (e.g. the establishment of personal connections between viewers) are placed in the middle of the continuum. It is in this last chapter where one of the principal topics of the manuscript, previously announced in the subtitle of the book, fully blossoms. Finally, the disclosure of the questionnaire used in the online survey is not to be missed. This annex not only allows the reader to reach a deeper understanding of Bury’s investigation, but it is also useful for those who want to know more about the construction of surveys in the field of media studies. The scales used for all of the questions would have also made a good addition to this annex. Moreover, and because of the usage of an online survey, enabling participation of respondents’ from non-Western countries would have further enhanced the relevance of the study. All in all, Bury demonstrates the potential of qualitative interviews in the exploration of how digital TV is transforming viewing experiences. The summaries provided at the end of each chapter help the reader digest all the nuances of the data presented. The information provided is mostly descriptive and in some places would benefit from a more critical approach. Introduced with an attractive and original cover, Television 2.0. Viewer and Fan Engagement with Digital TV (Peter Lang, 2017) is Bury’s second book and is a brief and insightful study about the consumption of TV in (primarily) Western countries at the beginning of the XXI century. The book is an informative resource for both academics and students working on and interested in television, new media and fandom.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a predominance for cute characters among Japanese virtual YouTubers (VTubers). Men who publicly use feminine avatars to conduct online entertainment are called babiniku in Japan. This research paper investigates whether embodying cute avatars impacts males’ perception of self. Examining the process leading some online performers to turn into outwardly feminine characters, we address the reasons why babiniku reproduce gender stereotypes. Our presumption is that such role play is part of a strategy with purposes yet to be deciphered. We deployed quantitative and qualitative methods, such as survey and semi structured interviews, to collect first-hand testimonies from 24 babiniku participants. This article contributes to an existing literature about digital gender swapping with avatars and Japanese cross-dressing from an anthropological perspective. As stressed by the babiniku who took part in this research, digital cross-dressing enables them to create a world where they can indulge in fancy and fantasy. All together with their fans, babiniku build a notion of femininity that allows users to act and live outside of societal pressures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade, large public screens and globally organized public viewing areas (PVAs) have become increasingly significant elements of media events, expanding the possibilities for mass audiences to collectively watch events together in real time. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in connection with the British Royal wedding (2011) and the London Olympics (2012), this article explores the ‘sociality’ of public space broadcasting, focusing on interactions and performances of identity by people gathered for collective viewing in the city centres of London, Birmingham and Manchester. The analysis shows that public space broadcasting mobilizes a variety of social identities and performances, spanning from ‘relaxed’ forms of engagement to more fannish articulations of nationality, cosmopolitan hybridity and spectacle participation. Geographical location and structural embedding strategies clearly impinge on public performances within PVAs. The article concludes that the degree of commercialization and presence of journalists and other media professionals are particularly central external drivers of performativity in connection with public consumption of media events. </jats:p>",

This study addresses digital hostility levelled at public figures, and does so through the case study of Wilson Gavin. Gavin had cultivated a minor public profile in Australia through his conservative activism. In January 2020, after protesting at a drag storytelling event in Brisbane, Gavin was subject to significant online abuse; a day after the protest, he died by suicide. This study examines the forms, themes and frameworks of that abuse as it played out across a small sample of publicly available Twitter posts. The study also addresses Twitter responses to the death. These responses are significant in that they individualise Gavin’s suicide and portray him as unable to protect himself and thus inherently vulnerable to taking his own life. Conversely, the study suggests that Gavin’s death points to the need for an understanding of how digital hostility harms those who are subject to it and how public figures can become resilient to that hostility.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> On June 12<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> 2019, in the middle of the UK Conservative party’s leadership contest, journalist Marie le Conte tweeted ‘so this is my first proper leadership contest as an actual Westminster person and honestly it’s such a hoot…huge fan of the drama’. This tweet is exemplary of a wider phenomenon. Politics is the activity through which power and resources are allocated across society – who gets what, when and how. Politics, and what it does to all of our lives, is consequential. Yet, despite this, many of those who pay the most attention to politics do so from the position of a fan, engaging with it in the way that others engage with entertainment forms like sport and television shows. Previous studies have paid attention to the fandoms and anti-fandoms that develop around individual politicians and movements – in other words, they maintain a focus on the behaviours and actions of these fans of politics. By contrast, in this paper we explore the construction of politics itself as an object of fandom, asking what happens to politics when it is treated in this way. The activity of politics can be socially constructed by humans to serve some purpose. Thus, who does the constructing and how they do this, affects what it becomes. Our claim is that constructing politics as an object of fandom (i.e. constructing it as ‘the drama’) affects politics itself. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Convergence has become part of burgeoning mobile media. Whether we like it or not the mobile phone has become a vehicle for multimedia par excellence. Epitomising contemporary convergence by way of its smorgasbord of applications and multimedia possibilities, it seems almost impossible to get such a device just for voice calling without all the `extras'. But is mobile media a new emerging art form? Is it new media? Or is it a domestic technology? And in an age of convergent media can we distinguish the different media histories? As a symbol of convergent global media, mobile phone practices are also marked by divergence. This divergence is particularly the case in terms of the increasingly tenacious role of the local in informing and adapting the global. The history of the mobile phone as a communication device inflects the localized practices of mobile multimedia, fusing communication with new media discourses. This article will discuss the rise of mobile communication studies and the role of locality, then turn to one of the centres for mobile innovation, Seoul, to discuss the role of mobile media as a domestic new media.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The essay analyses two cases of digital activism in Turkey, which visualize ‘networked erasure’ to illustrate how censorship is a systematic process. The first case, an interactive online database called Blocked Web, launched in 2007, collects and organizes data on state-classified web site bans, and represents cyber censorship as grounded in legal and media infrastructures. The second example, the Interactive Mass Grave Map, produced by the Human Rights Association of Turkey, marks the locations of hundreds of unmarked graves in which disappeared citizens are thought buried and connects historical human erasure to contemporary censorship. Through visual analysis and personal fieldwork interviews, I explore the ways that these projects extend theoretical approaches to control in the digital age and hack into ‘switching power’ (Castells, 2009). Foregoing the sensationalism that can accompany close-ups on a victim or banned web site, the examples employ a distanced approach that visualizes and points to state-media cronyism, institutionalized discrimination, and widespread apathy. </jats:p>",

To capture a wide range of conditions around VR affordances (avatars, embodiment, immersion/presence), we turn to spotlines, a method that combines various medialities, to compare and describe the temporal rhythms of VR habituation. Through sustained engagement in VR, this study reveals how meta-spaces function as habitats that foster avatar sociality, metalearning, and embodied moments of friction. </jats:p>",

The idea was to offer insights into graffiti audiencing on digital and street-based spheres of perception while discussing the method’s limitations. After listing convergences and divergences between human-centric and algorithm-centric viewpoints, results revealed an interesting set of details uniquely brought up by computer vision metadata, but which, in turn, exposed limitations in recgonizing graffiti as a politicized practice with deep radical roots. </jats:p>",

This comparison will shed light on how the development and transnational diffusion of new forms of online video-mediated communication have changed the social perception of everyday media practices and experiences. Ultimately, the recent use of camera-drones and live-streaming technologies will be discussed in relation to pioneering forms of collective digital witnessing and their implications in the contemporary political landscape. </jats:p>",

Situating the ban in the context of Chinese digital economy, this paper investigates the politics of fun as it intersects with censorship and popular nationalism in China today. Drawing on user-generated content and social media discussions of the game and its ban, the paper discusses two outcomes deriving from China’s precarious environment for gameplay, where fun could be easily confiscated by authorities: the first is the emergence of participatory censorship where netizens voluntarily and collectively set the limit for self-expression in an effort to depoliticize gameplay; the second is the convergence between fun and nationalism, which transforms gameplay into a vessel for expressing and strengthening official ideology. In doing so, the paper reconsiders the thesis of digital democratization by shedding light on the regulated processes of digital self-making. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article contributes to research on children’s YouTube, online video genres and media consumption practices by focusing on genres that take shape at the intersection of digital media content and embodied sensation and in particular ‘oddly satisfying’ (OS) videos. This type of content has become popular on YouTube, where examples of satisfying and OS content include the manipulation or movement of a range of colourful or tactile materials such as slime, kinetic sand or icing a cake. To document the evolution and key characteristics of this genre, we analyse YouTube videos using content analysis methods. Our findings show the characteristics of this sensory genre can be understood through the concept of visual tactility, which highlights the synaesthetic feel of watching these videos. Further, we identify and examine how OS videos demonstrate ambiguities in children’s YouTube content, audiences and regulation by overlapping with other sensory genres and more adult content, such as ASMR. This analysis thus situates this sensory genre in relation to the developing study of children’s YouTube entertainment industries and media regulation. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article questions the rhetoric of objectivity attached to cartographies of migration and their relationship to a contemporary political context. A search on Google Images for the keywords ‘migration’ + ‘Europe’ allows us to observe the increasing popularity of maps to portray displacements of people. These maps are created by geographers and analysts from data collected and compiled by international organisations and NGOs. These visual messages are widely disseminated in mainstream media, research papers and educational resources. An examination of these cartographies shows that in their greater part they are representing human displacements by broad arrows, often in warm colours, pointing in the direction of European countries. These cartographies have a war-like aspect conveying the idea of a threatening invasion. How can one reveal the relationships between the messaging conveyed by migration mappings and the public narratives on the same topic? Building on a wide scholarship on critical geography and on art historian Aby Warburg’s theories on the survival of images later theorised by Georges Didi-Huberman, this article focuses on cartographies illustrating the so-called 2015 migration ‘crisis’ to highlight the collective imaginary attached to mainstream cartographies of migration. As a first step, it provides an historical perspective on the way this kind of messaging has impacted visual descriptions of human mobilities to the point of influencing the Brexit referendum campaign. As a second step, it explores the experimental cartographies created by geographers and artists that embrace subjectivity and offer unique overviews of the experience of the border. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we discuss how ‘action research’ as an experiential research approach allows us to address challenges encountered in researching a converged and digital media landscape. We draw on our experiences as researchers, co-developers and marketeers in the European Union-funded Innovation Action project ‘INnovative Journalism: Enhanced Creativity Tools’ (INJECT) aimed at developing a technological tool for journalism. In this media innovation process, as in other media practices, longstanding delineations no longer hold, due to converging professional disciplines and blurring roles of users and producers. First, we discuss four features of innovation in the current ‘digital’ media landscape that come with specific methodological requirements: (a) the iterative nature of innovation; (b) converged practices, professions and roles; (c) the dispersed geographic nature of media production and innovation processes and (d) the impact of human and non-human actors. We suggest action research as a possible answer to these requirements of the digital media landscape. Drawing on our experiences in the INJECT project, we illustrate how adopting an action research approach provides insight into the non-linear, iterative and converged character of innovation processes by highlighting: (a) how innovation happens at various moments, in various places and by various people; (b) how perceptions and enactments of professions change over time and (c) how roles are (re)combined and expanded in such a way that clear delineation is not easy. Ultimately, we argue that experiencing convergence through action research enables us to do justice to the complexity of the current media landscape. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Sensing data: Encountering data sonifications, materializations, and interactives as <i>knowledge objects</i>",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital and networked media are characterized by a fundamental disconnection between the modes of operating of these media, the human sensorium and knowledge. In order for humans to consciously participate in this expanded domain of sensibility, additional mediation is required to ‘presentify’ what is not accessible to human perception. This situation has motivated the creation of manifold ‘data objects’ in the form of visualizations, soundscapes and sonifications, 3D materializations, and data-driven interactives in the neighboring domains of art, design, science, and humanities scholarship. These new knowledge objects, as we propose to call them, both produce and mediate knowledge in the process of making data experienceable. They turn that what essentially does not correlate to human sensory capacities into something that the human sensorium is capable of engaging with. As such, they can play a crucial role in providing access, and thereby modalities of critical and creative relating, to what Hansen (2015) describes as the expanded domain of sensibility. Yet, the effects and implications of the sensory specificities of these knowledge objects remain underacknowledged, as are the potentials of these modes of presentifying data. Here, we explore and compare a diversity of such knowledge objects and look at their different media modalities and different experiential qualities, and how these afford ways of knowing. By approaching several knowledge objects as ‘theoretical objects’ (Bal (2013); Damisch in Bois et al. (1998), we investigate which and how experimental sensory techniques are used for data presentification. With this, we want to draw attention to the onto-epistemological implications of the design of these knowledge objects, the main implications being relationality and performativity. Understanding the potential and implications of this performativity would benefit from what we call a creative humanities approach that combines insights from the critical and digital humanities with those from the fields of creative arts and design. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The increased level of technical abstractness poses a challenge for laypersons and politicians alike to notice the political impacts specific technical developments might bring. By presenting qualitative research on Europe’s oldest and one of the world’s largest hacker organizations – the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) – the article shows that the CCC acts as a civil society organization that brings together a wide range of knowledge, skills and experiences related to media technologies and infrastructures. By deconstructing the abstractness of a given technology, the CCC materializes its formerly unrecognized political quality. Yet, the political endeavour of closing the expert-public gap, in the interests of public democracy, is only brought to life once the outcomes of a particular hack are communicated in comprehensible manners to diverse publics and audiences. Overall the article points to the emergence of new modes and practices of expertise by conceptualizing the Club’s active demonstration of expertise through hacking and its articulation of expertise through media-related practices and interactions with institutional politics as interlocking arrangements. Today, hackers – and in particular hacker organizations – are best considered actors whose skills, knowledge and experiences are ever more relevant for political cultures and democracy at large. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Wikipedia, despite its volunteer-driven nature, stands as a trustworthy repository of information, thanks to its transparent and verifiable processes. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) often use Wikipedia as a source without acknowledging it, creating a disconnect between users and Wikipedia’s rich framework. This poses a triple threat to information literacy, Wikipedia’s vitality, and the potential for dynamic, updated information. This article explores the interplay between representation, accessibility, and LLMs on Wikipedia, highlighting the importance of preserving Wikipedia as a space for access, representation, and ultimately advocacy in an increasingly LLM-dominated information landscape. This article contends that, despite being over two decades old, Wikipedia remains vital not only for knowledge accumulation but also as a sanctuary for the future of knowledge representation, championing representation and accessibility in the age of closed-system LLMs. </jats:p>",

I provisionally call this approach creanalytics. To enact this coupling, I designed a system to annotate and classify a large corpus of film clips, automatically extract fragments from this corpus, and edit them into new compositions, rendered into a computational supercut, which I go on to argue can be understood as the minimal expression of a broader emergent form of media: the computational video essay. Below I describe the most salient technical aspects of this system, analyse the principles of its design, and discuss the methodological and conceptual possibilities of its use as a format that mediates between critics and their networked environments, and between individual media artefacts, their parts, and the larger collections to which they belong. </jats:p>",

    "title": "#NoSnowflakes: The toleration of harassment and an emergent gender-related digital divide, in a UK student online culture",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, some political commentators and mainstream media outlets in the United Kingdom have pejoratively labelled young people, especially university students, a ‘snowflake generation’ – a term used to mock their perceived intolerance and over-sensitivity (Fox, 2016; Gullis, 2017; Slater, 2016; Talbot, 2020). This article challenges this discourse by drawing on findings from a large-scale study ( N = 810) conducted on a university campus in England that critically examined student’s perceptions of and attitudes to different forms of online harassment, including abusive, offensive and harassing communications, using survey and interview data. Key findings indicate that online harassment is so pervasive in digitised spaces that it is often viewed as the ‘norm’ by the student population who appear willing to tolerate it, rather than take actions to address it, which challenges pejorative claims that they are intolerant and easily offended ‘snowflakes’. Respondents who identify as female and transgender are more likely to be targeted by online harassment. We argue that the label ‘snowflake generation’ is diverting attention away from student’s everyday experiences of online harassment and its adverse effects, particularly on women and transgendered people, which has the potential to create a gender-related digital divide (Jane, 2018). The implications of these findings for the higher education sector will be outlined. </jats:p>",

    "title": "An Intersection of Ideals: Journalism, Profits, Technology and Convergence",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Journalism needs advertising and advertising needs journalism: advertising pays for good reporting just as good reporting attracts customers for advertising. Problems arise when the equation becomes unbalanced, such as during the recessions in the early part of the twenty-first century. This paper asks the key question of whether editorial managers and journalists are embracing convergence at this time for business reasons or to do better journalism. It begins from the perspective that media organisations around the world are adopting various forms of convergence, and along the way embracing a range of business models. Several factors are influencing and driving the adoption of convergence - also known as multiple-platform publishing. Principal among them are the media's desire to reach as wide an audience as possible, consumers who want access to news in a variety of forms and times (news 24/7), and editorial managers' drive to cut costs. The availability of relatively cheap digital technology facilitates the convergence process. Many journalists believe that because that technology makes it relatively easy to convert and distribute any form of content into another, it is possible to produce new forms of storytelling and consequently do better journalism. This paper begins by defining convergence (as much as it is possible to do so) and describing the key competing models. It then considers the environments that lead to easy introduction of convergence, followed by the factors that hinder it. Examples of converged media around the world are provided, and suggestions offered on how to introduce convergence. The paper concludes that successful convergence satisfies the twin aims of good journalism and good business practices. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Combating contamination and contagion: Embodied and environmental metaphors of misinformation",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, government agencies, information institutions, educators and researchers have paid increasing attention to issues of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theorizing. This has prompted a seemingly endless supply of guides, frameworks and approaches to ‘combating’ the problem. In studies of mis- and disinformation, a constellation of analogous concepts are defined in multiple ways across multidisciplinary literatures and institutional contexts. Misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theory are often conflated, lacking specific, portable definitions across fields of study. Linguistic metaphors are often leveraged in place of this definitional work. The larger conceptual metaphors that they connote contain normative assumptions that often impose values and moral imperatives, imply deficiencies, assume intent, and foreground individual agency or lack thereof. Metaphors are as restrictive as they are illuminating; once used, a metaphor also applies constraints to the way in which a phenomenon can be understood. Metaphors not only shape the ways in which science is communicated to the public, but also the kinds of questions that are asked, the theories and methods used, and the parameters of the research design. By analyzing instances of linguistic metaphor, this exploratory study identifies and develops two conceptual metaphors that are frequently evoked to discuss mis- and disinformation: embodied health metaphors and environmental health metaphors. The former includes linguistic metaphors like viral/virality, infodemic, infobesity, information hygiene, information dysfunction, and information pathology. The latter includes linguistic metaphors like information pollution, infollution, and digital wildfires. Uncritically invoking such metaphors adopts tacit arguments deriving from the original field of study (e.g., public health’s tendency to equate individual embodied health with virtue), or the image of the metaphor itself ( digital wildfires implies quick spread and immediate danger), or both. Widespread and uncritical use of such metaphors, we argue, rewards speed and epistemic homogeneity in mis- and disinformation research – ultimately discouraging in-depth inquiry.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article contributes to recent scholarship on platform, software and media studies by critically engaging with the ‘social coding’ platform GitHub, one of the most prominent actors in the online proprietary and F/OSS (free and/or open-source software) code hosting space. It examines the platformisation of software and project development on GitHub by combining institutional and cultural analysis. The institutional analysis focuses on critically examining the platform from a material-economic perspective to understand how it configures contemporary software and project development work. It proposes the concept of ‘connective coding’ to characterise how software intermediaries such as GitHub configure, valorise and capitalise on public repositories, developer and organisation profiles. This institutional perspective is complemented by a case study analysing cultural practices mediated by the platform. The case study examines the platform vernaculars of news media and journalism initiatives highlighted by Source, a key publication in the newsroom software development space, and how GitHub modulates visibility in this space. It finds that the high-visibility platform vernacular of this news media and journalism space is dominated by a mix of established actors such as the New York Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg, as well as more recent actors and initiatives such as ProPublica and Document Cloud. This high-visibility news media and journalism platform vernacular is characterised by multiple F/OSS and F/OSS-inspired practices and styles. Finally, by contrast, low-visibility public repositories in this space may be seen as indicative of GitHub’s role in facilitating various kinds of ‘post-F/OSS’ software development cultures. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ageing is starting to matter in popular cultural studies but the matter of ageing within YouTube is, at present, unwritten. This article is an attempt to start that process. YouTube hosts the music video for PJ Harvey’s single release The Community of Hope (2016) . Shot by Seamus Murphy, it shares screen space with official music videos from Harvey’s 23-year career. Raising questions about the relationship between her past and present, this article examines the link between YouTube and ageing through two concepts, repetitive circularity and the flat archive. These rely and inform each other in a process that prioritizes the presence of youthfulness through the absenting of age, whereby the ageing body is erased from a popular cultural forum. YouTube’s ‘wallpaper of the past’ has a nagging impact on how we might read the body’s progress through time, in particular, how it ages. Tackling the paucity of work on ageing as it surfaces within the changing topographies of popular music encounters, the article considers how ageing is presented within a digital environment such as YouTube and concludes that the story is one of age erasure. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Converging experiences, converging audiences: An analysis of doctor who on Twitch",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> While primarily considered to be a platform for live streaming of video games, Twitch has recently diversified into streaming archival television content. In 2018 and 2019, episodes of the television show Doctor Who, originally aired between 1963 and 1989, were shown on the service, which also provides a synchronous chat function for viewers to communicate with each other as they watch. This article examines this phenomenon through conducting qualitative and quantitative surveys with a segment of the viewership of these streams in order to uncover a diversity of age and experience with the content that exposes a convergence of viewership. Results indicate that the convergence of audiences and novel affordances of the service provide opportunities for new experiences and forms of interaction, both with the media content and with other viewers. The live, synchronous nature of the broadcast is a key feature, and while some viewers found having less control over their viewing experience disconcerting, it resulted in different watching and production practices. This included the creation of memetic content which was shared with the wider community of fans beyond those watching the stream. We argue that new forms of communal watching are enabled by digital convergence and emerging technology platforms and services. These lead to new shared media experiences and outcomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article articulates screenness to comprehend the agency of screens in the postmedia condition. Being a common element in different kinds of media, screens contribute towards medial collaboration and relationality in postmedia where they do much more than display. Screenness, understood in Karen Barad’s agential realist framework, is performative and contingent upon the relations of the postmedia assemblage, considered here as an arrangement of technical, medial and human components brought together by the transferability and exchange across different media. The unstable, ever-changing relations in postmedia assemblages help in understanding the various operations of screens in image-making, display and dissemination practices. If screens can be understood in and through practices in which they emerge then their agency too is not static but changes as per the relations screens are in. To demonstrate the performative agency of screens – screenness – I will discuss intra-actions that can be gleaned via the activity of navigation using Google Maps application on a smartphone. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Twitch, Fish, Pokémon and Plumbers: Game live streaming by nonhuman actors",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this exploratory paper, we consider the phenomenon of gameplay live streaming by nonhumans. The live streaming of games, exemplified by the platform Twitch.tv, has emerged in recent years as a major and growing component of gaming culture. Although previous research has addressed some agential dimensions of streaming, scholarship has yet to examine the unusual phenomenon of watching streams lacking any kind of human agent. Ordinarily a human streamer operates gameplay and directs the flow of conversation, curating the content of the stream and mediating the agency of other participants. Removing the central figure of the human streamer thus creates what we call an ‘agency gap’ to be filled by other users. In this article, we explore different ways this occurs through four case studies involving the broadcast of gameplay by biological and digital nonhumans. These range from random number generators and automated controller inputs, to a live fish with a motion tracker observing its movements around its tank (with these movements then being used to attempt completion of a digital game). Through these case studies, we argue that the absence of a human streamer democratises video game play through ways of experiencing games which were not possible until the emergence of game live streaming. To this end we interrogate when and how nonhuman streamers can also be influenced by the agency of human spectators, and how the stakes of these streams are understood in relation to the game being played and spectator motivation. We further characteristic the distinction between human and nonhuman agencies in terms of affective intentionality. Game streaming allows for an unprecedented visibility of nonhuman play which merits close attention; this paper consequently problematises current understandings of nonhuman play in an era of gameplay streaming, and extends and challenges scholarship in both of these areas. </jats:p>",

Outreach work includes campaign drives in bars, clubs and saunas, peer-led workshops, support groups, condom distribution in community venues and one-to-one intervention programmes to help raise HIV/AIDS awareness. But what happens to community activism and outreach when the community one seeks to engage moves online? In this article, we report on a study capturing the experiences of workers engaged in THT’s digital outreach service, Netreach. Using ethnographic and other qualitative methods, we identify the shifting nature of health promotion outreach work and the changes in expert–client relationship that occur when community outreach takes place on digital platforms. We identify how issues of (dis)embodiment, expertise and cultural capital play a role in determining the success – or failure – of online outreach work. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Negotiating freedoms in the convergent mediascape",
    "abstract": "The research in this issue questions whether media convergence is opening new possibilities for a greater range of voices to be heard or threatening to close down channels through which diversity and democracy is being expressed. Ross Tapsell argues that convergence is both contributing to and undermining freedom in Indonesia. He observes that scholars have viewed media freedom as threatened and explores the factors that have led technological convergence to commercial convergence. In comparison, Sarah Harris’ analyses of two cases of digital activism in Turkey evidence how censorship is a systematic process grounded in legal and media infrastructures. Her case studies show the effect of erasure on both public and individual discourse; for example, Blocked Web collects and organizes data on state-classified website bans, whilst Interactive Mass Grave Map marks the locations of hundreds of unmarked graves in which disappeared citizens are thought to be buried. Both are unpleasant reminders of the attempts of the powerful to shut down voices of dissent. Beyond state and media infrastructures media creators are exploring the textual and linguistic borderlands provided by new technologies for spaces for discourses of diversity and formation of new meaning. Megan Condis cites BioWare’s decision to include diversity in games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Dragon Age II, by adding the option to play as a gay male character. Through her analysis she questions how titles such as ‘fan’ or ‘gamer’ are being contested along the lines of gender and sexuality. Aylish Wood on the other hand examines how virtual spaces afford new locations for meaning construction. Her examples are the three-dimensional (3D) cinematic space in Hugo and the IMAX format in The Dark Knight. Such a space offers multiple points of engagement for an audience. Both articles focus on case studies that extend the vocabulary of their media discourse. The new media aesthetics of 3D cinema previously featured in a guest-edited special section of Convergence (November 2013, Vol. 19, issue 4). Wood’s article follows on from this and extends",

A documentation of policy development for commenting on news articles, this research considers these reader-content areas as places of boundary work for the journalist—audience relationship in interactive news environments. This ethnographic examination demonstrated significant internal conflict among both journalists and readers. The ‘traditionalists’ — those who want to maintain a hierarchal relationship between journalists and audiences — clashed with the ‘convergers’ — those who felt users should be given more freedoms within the news site. The resulting policy privileged journalism by relegating reader input to specific, structured spaces. But for the first time, audiences participated in that policy development, asserting their own textual privilege according to a value system apart from journalistic norms. The result was a grand identity complex for the news profession characterized by interrupted information flow patterns and diffused power over knowledge. Institutional hierarchies for policymaking and execution are radically changing. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Mobile Effect",
    "abstract": "In considering the mobile phone I shall here return to a text by Shuhei Hosokawa on an earlier form of mobile media, 'The Walkman Effect'.1 This text, published just a few years after Sony's introduction of the Walkman in 1980, is less about the Walkman as technological artifact than about the emergence of a cultural object at a specific historical moment, with the event of the Walkman or Walkman as event and with the kind of spatial and urban strategies it makes possible. In March 2005 Sony Ericsson unveiled the Walkman phone, but my interest is likewise not in the evolution of the mobile as media player or multifunction device.2 Rather, I shall consider Hosokawa's insights into the relationship between the Walkman and the embodiment and context of Walkman users, and how these can help us to account for the way that the mobile phone operates simultaneously as a node within networks and the point of intersection between the virtual space of telecommunications and physical or embodied space. Like Hosokawa, I am interested less in the object in itself, than in the object 'under use'. I shall approach this by drawing upon a consideration of the practice of artists and technologists exploring social and creative applications of mobile technology, as well as upon certain representations of the mobile phone user within popular culture.",

    "title": "Digital placemaking and its discontents: Exploring practices, power relations, and socio-spatial dynamics in Salzburg’s ‘Andräviertel’",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research on digital placemaking shows that digital media, especially those that have a direct or indirect spatial reference, can alter belonging and attachment to space and place and can thus create a spatial identity. Emerging digital practices evolve the practice of placemaking and refer to space as a nexus of experiences, online and physical components. This is created by people perceiving urban space differently through digital media and appropriating it according to media affordances and their needs and preferences. At the same time, digital placemaking is not necessarily community-driven, nor does it always lead to an increased quality of life for all people equally, but rather encompasses changing power relations and can even reinforce existing inequalities. Using the example of the ‘Andräviertel’ neighbourhood in Salzburg, Austria, we explore which practices of digital placemaking can be identified, and how and by whom these practices are used purposefully and consciously to shape the neighbourhood and its identity. Employing a multi-method approach that includes semi-structured interviews, a hashtag analysis and the examination of digital platforms, three levels of practices were identified (reflecting upon one’s own practices, representations of the practices, judgements about the practices of others). The results show that there is a conscious and deliberate demarcation of the Andräviertel from other neighbourhoods in the city. Furthermore, we found resistance to excessive digital practices with a clear preference for face-to-face networks. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How does the tendency toward series reboots, sequels, and remakes in contemporary Hollywood intersect with television’s capacity for serialization? How does the logic of promotion in transmedia entertainment connect to television’s ability to perform simultaneity in relation to other forms of screen media? This article will describe and analyze how the Resident Evil films have been broadcast on Japan’s Asahi TV network throughout the 2010s, focusing on how the week-after-week programming of the films acts as a case for demonstrating how transmedia serialization brings into relief qualities of narration and aesthetics within the context of convergent screen industries and global media production. Focusing on the concept of accumulation, this article will argue how the mode of viewing invited by Asahi TV’s mode of presentation is one that can be addressed both in terms of how viewers make sense of complicated networks of meta-textual continuity and of how convergent media forms rely on practices of simultaneity in media consumption. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examined media use and attitudinal predictors of public willingness to censor fake online political news among representative samples in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia (total N = 2880). The study utilized research on the corrective action hypothesis (CAH) and the theory of presumed media influence (TPMI) as frameworks. The CAH holds that an individual’s belief that media are hostile and influential increases the likelihood that the individual will participate in public discourse urging countermeasures. TPMI maintains that the belief that media are influential is associated with attitudes about media, though those attitudes need not be negative. Perceived exposure to fake news online positively predicted willingness to censor fake news in all countries, aligning with some prior research on both the CAH and the TPMI. Facebook use was negatively associated with willingness to censor fake news in two of the countries, while trust in news media was a positive correlate in two countries. Implications for research on both willingness to censor and on fake news are discussed. </jats:p>",

However, the possibilities of the Internet combined with the growth of online social networking activities have enabled this process to become rapidly more extensive, easier and potentially problematic. This paper focuses on the analysis of the politics of social filtering through social network sites. It argues that what is needed is both a closer examination and evaluation of these processes and also the development of a framework through which to begin such an evaluation. There is also a second intent: to (re)assert the argument that any analysis necessarily needs to take into account and critique the development, implementation and use of technologies (this includes the software, algorithms and code) themselves as well as the people that build and use them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses the role of technology under the framework of Critical Technical Practice specifically in the form of constructing artefacts and deconstructing tools in order to produce what Philip Agre would describe as ‘reflexive work of critique’ (Agre, 1997:155). By presenting the activities and methods used in the teaching and shaping of undergraduate courses, this paper aims to show how technical objects, such as data, datasets, application programming interfaces and machine learning models, can be considered as discursive subjects, demonstrating pedagogical understanding across fields. The courses operate in the humanities tradition and take critical technical practice as a didactic approach, insofar as software and data are understood and manipulated on an instrumental level, while encouraging critical engagement and embodied reflection that bridge the technical and social/cultural domains. Within this pedagogical approach, critical is not only understood as a paradigm of rationality or quantitative, data-driven argumentation, but as adopting a critical position – that is, to research and reflect on the social structures and cultural phenomena entangled with digital objects, bodies, tools, methods and software production. By embracing work-in-progress and reflexive exploration, we aim to extend the notion of critical technical practice by unfolding how (de)constructing machines can be achieved beyond thinking of technology as neutral instrumentalisation. The challenge is how to find a balance, not only as researchers but as educators, unfolding aspects of both formality and functionality as well as questioning and understanding technology at a discursive and critical level. We argue that learning technical practice in an educational setting is not an end, but rather a means to question existing technological structures and create further changes in socio-technical systems. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Editorial",
    "abstract": "As we write this editorial (in November 2011), the British Library are celebrating the launch of a huge project to digitize their newspaper content and make it available via the internet. Researchers will be familiar with Gale’s digital archive of The Times 1785–1985 and other 19th-century newspapers. Now The British Library has teamed up with Brightsolid to create the britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk (Brightsolid, 2012). Users can access 4 million pages from 200 newspapers from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the long term aim is to make every paper ever printed in Britain available online. Chris van der Kuyl from Brightsolid asserted that every single person in the UK will be able to find a story in the online newspaper archive that relates to them, either via family, friends or the place in which they live (BBC News UK, 2011). In this it complements other online resources that document various aspects of social history, like The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674–1913 (Old Bailey Online, 2011), which enable users to search the court’s criminal trial records and explore the lives of non-elite people. As the number of these online resources increases, so too do the number and complexity of the possible narratives that can be constructed about our lives. It seems highly appropriate therefore that this issue starts with a special Debates section on archiving digital narrative, introduced by Tom Abba. While the British Library and Old Bailey projects have digitized existing analogue material, the essays in this section emanated from a symposium Abba organized at the University of the West of England to explore issues relating to narratives that are born digital. Despite popular perception to the contrary, archiving digital artefacts – preserving them for the future – is, as Abba demonstrates fraught with challenges, both practical and financial. But as he goes on to explain, the difficulties are multiplied when the ‘artefact’ is participatory, experiential, and hence highly ephemeral, with no pre-existing fixed analogue point of reference. In his contribution to this section James Newman offers a specific example of such challenges through an examination of Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog game series, exploring the impact of it being ported (transferred and translated) to different operating systems",

Earlier concepts of passages and thresholds may enrich today's understanding of recent mixtures and flows across borders within contemporary digital media culture. Charting traces from Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project through the borderlands of a contemporary shopping centre, this study explores late modern thinking about flows across borders in media culture and cultural studies, in which contextualising, dialogic and critical interpretation assume crucial functions. The combination of 'multi' and 'inter' stresses plurality and interrelations rather than monolithic and essentialist reductions. The first section presents sociological, anthropological and philosophical ideas of passages and borderlands. The second part outlines important kinds of media passages through real and virtual spaces. The third segment discusses interrelations between multi- and inter-concepts that have taken on a crucial significance for cultural theory, suggesting new ways of understanding their mutual connections. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Debate over Universal Service in the European Union",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article looks at the concept of 'universal service' in the European Union (EU). It starts by placing the evolution of universal service policies into their national and EU contexts. The implications of liberalisation are then examined, followed by the more recent factors which have raised questions about the definition and delivery of universal service. Convergence in communication technologies, the prominent position that the vision of 'information society' occupies in the EU and national policy agendas, the internet and its commercialisation have all combined to bring renewed interest in the concept of universal service, in policy rhetoric at least. It is maintained that the focus of 'information society' and 'digital divide' policy frameworks has been misplaced. Drawing from a synthesis of former sector specific approaches, it is argued that the emphasis needs to shift from access to infrastructure (a traditional telecommunications consideration) to content issues. In turn, content regulation will continue to be important whilst intervention for the attainment of public policy objectives has already been proved necessary. Taking into consideration the weakness of the European Commission in dealing with content matters, it is suggested that reliance on the subsidiarity principle can assist member states to effectively perform their universal service policies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The internet facilitates outrage, encourages debate, and ultimately accommodates balanced response. It allows for knowledge to be acquired and then shaped into shared meanings and understandings. Even if the digital record of the mainstream media is perhaps the more informed and balanced, the arguably greater significance of the internet - content aside - lies in its exemplification of the value of free communication. This argument is explored in the context of two 1996 paintings by contemporary Canadian painter Gertrude Kearns. The works were the subject of controversy when they went on display at the new Canadian War Museum, which opened on 5 May 2005. While Kearns’s works had previously been reproduced in a newspaper and a journal, they had not been exhibited in public before. The two compositions portray Master Corporal Clayton Matchee and Private Kyle Brown, the Canadian soldiers responsible for the 1993 murder of Shidane Arone, a Somali youth. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the intersection between platforms, their sociotechnical process of aging and memory practice, by focusing on local social platform OakdaleTalk and its use in reflecting on September 11, 2001. Founded in 1997, OakdaleTalk serves the town of Oakdale in New Jersey, a place significantly affected by the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. Situated in literature on digital memory work, this analysis draws on interviews with 15 OakdaleTalk members who have used the platform to reflect on September 11th. Asking how users maintain particular meanings of this date while negotiating sociotechnical changes to the site over time – including the loss of posts from 2001 – it discusses how users perpetuate hyperlocal interpretation and describes how community members grapple with lost content. The article concludes by proposing a ‘preservation paradox’, an emerging memory practice under platformized media conditions describing a contradiction in user preservation attitudes and behaviors toward posts of memory-related significance. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the digital age, it seems that participation has been conflated with literacy, content with engagement, novelty with innovation and ubiquity with meaning (e.g. see Thornham and McFarlane, 2014; Gillespie, 2010; Dean, 2008; Livingstone, 2009; van Dijck, 2013) and encapsulated in terms such as ‘digital native’, ‘digital divide’ or ‘born digital’. In turn, these conflations have done something to technology, which is constructed as malleable, a supportive facilitator, and the user, who is constructed as active agent. Neither of these account for mediations nor for – crucial for us – the notion of the imaginary, which emerges in our research as so central to expertise. Drawing on ethnographic work carried out in Studio12, a media production facility for young people with disadvantaged backgrounds in Leeds, United Kingdom, we propose that the concept of expertise emerges through a bigger array of social capital as well as traditional structures of power such as class, gender and race. Expertise is claimed, evidenced and generated. For us, however, expertise emerged not only as elusive but also because it was premised on a disjuncture between lived and everyday youth and the promises of becoming in a future orientated (technological, imaginary and creative) landscape. </jats:p>",

Disconnection studies have challenged the power of commodified disconnective practices to create real social change. In this article, we build on the notion of affective attunement to explore how disconnection commodities provide differential ways for individuals to respond to the challenges of connectivity, and how they can form larger patterns of resistance that cannot be dismissed as futile. We examine the ambiguity of disconnection commodities through three examples: a smartwatch kill switch and stealth mode features, detox floatation tank therapy, and make-up lines. Our approach turns the perspective from ends to the means of disconnection. We argue that these commodities do not offer hard breaks but they do let users attune to connectivity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses the main Spanish independent podcast networks. It is a two-phase qualitative study based on direct observation of the networks, a number of secondary sources and, especially, on semi-structured in-depth interviews with the coordinators or managers of these networks. From the political economy of cultural industries, the main objectives are to determine the motivation, perspective, and dynamics of these networks, as well as to explore their financial model. As podcasting implies cultural practices and meanings, we want to analyse whether independent podcast networks are basically a grassroots cultural production that maintain their amateur philosophy, or whether, in contrast, they are evolving towards an institutionalization that moves them closer to cultural industries and their practices, and the study of Spanish independent podcast networks is a useful starting point for putting mainstream and historical definitions to the test. This study sets forth how the progressive formalisation of podcast networks has generated tensions in the grassroots-industrialization balance. Spanish independent podcasters are pro-ams entering the production process of an industry in which other industrialized actors have already been established. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is now widely accepted that videogames are a cultural form, and that they generate cultural meaning through the possibilities and constraints through which they shape players’ experiences and choices. However, the cultural processes through which videogames are themselves produced remain understudied and too-straightforwardly imagined. The videogame maker does not simply conceive of a videogame idea and then execute it. Instead, the videogame is produced through processes of negotiation and iteration between videogame maker, software and hardware environments and the broader expectations of the field. In this sense, videogame production can be fruitfully understood through the lens of craft. I argue that in order to politicise agency in digital play, as is this special issue’s goal, videogame research must also consider the agency of the videogame maker, and the iterative, embodied, and social processes through which videogames are produced. This article draws from interviews with videogame makers and existing research on craft production to provide a preliminary consideration of how the agency of the videogame maker as a cultural producer can be accounted for. </jats:p>",

I use cultural intermediation as a framework to locate the automated processes, such as algorithmic generated recommender systems, that influence content consumption practices driven by digital first personalities. First, the article applies cultural intermediation to celebrity, social media influencers and algorithms to highlight how media is produced and distributed by new forms of intermediation. This section outlines the new players in social media, how the value of media content is transferred from one stakeholder group to another and how algorithms increasingly place prominence on particular types of content. The article then presents fieldwork from several digital agencies that are responsible for creating the digital first personality role. These agencies are demonstrable of those that produce commercially oriented content alongside other more public affairs-oriented content. Finally, the article argues that digital first personalities are crucial actors within cultural intermediation to ensure public issues remain visible to those stakeholders who are most impacted by timely information on societal issues. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘Relive the passion, find your affair’: Revising the infidelity script online",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Affairs websites such as Victoria Milan, Gleeden or Illicit Encounters are the latest in a long line of commercial online ventures offering different kinds of intimacy. While online dating sites have long been used as a covert way to find additional partners or extramarital intimacy, recent years have seen an increase in the variety of new media services explicitly targeted at unfaithful partners. However, as the July 2015 hacking (and subsequent media coverage) of well-known affairs site, Ashley Madison, showed, the status of these sites is still contested and the services they offer still highly provocative. With this in mind, this article explores the intersection of new media and the contested form of intimacy often referred to as ‘infidelity’. In this article, I analyse material from four websites offering non-consensual non-monogamies to examine how they are attempting to change the cultural script of infidelity through a combination of content and material affordances. To do so, I draw on the idea of intimacy as a kind of organizing ‘public’ narrative that determines ‘private’ acts of intimacy (Berlant, 2000). </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital hostility, subjectivity and ethics: Theorising the disruption of identity in instances of mass online abuse and hate speech",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The experience of hostility, hate speech and adversarial behaviour in everyday online spaces has increased substantially in recent years, with known health and mental health outcomes for users. This paper argues that due to the ‘massified’ form of contemporary hostility experienced in the internet ‘pile on’, a new framework for understanding and remedying hostility is required. This paper draws on Judith Butler’s theories of identity to present an account of digital hostility as cultural and as having a negative effect on the identities and selfhood of users. It discusses the impact of the online pile-on, shaming and the ways in which hostility positions victims as ungrievable subjects. The essay recommends new ethical approaches grounded in the recognition of subjects as vulnerable, arguing that cultural ethics approaches are valuable not only as public pedagogies but for development of technological solutions and moderation interventions to help prevent hostility and hate speech. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digital fanfic in negotiation: LiveJournal, Archive of Our Own, and the affordances of read–write platforms",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Fanfic is the unauthorized rewriting or adaptation of popular media narratives, utilizing corporately owned characters, settings and storylines to tell an individual writer’s own story. It is often abbreviated to fanfic or even fic and exists in a thoroughly grey legal area between copyright infringement and fair use. Although there were a few cases of cease-and-desist letters sent to fan writers in the 20th century, media corporations now understand it is useless to attempt to prosecute fanfic writers – for one thing, there are simply too many of us and for another it would be terrible publicity. Although modern fanfic can be reliably dated to the 1960s, it is now primarily an online practice and the fastest growing form of writing in the world. This article uses participant observation and online ethnography to explore how fanfic archives utilize digital affordances. Following Murray, I will argue that a robust understanding of digital read–write platforms needs to account for the social and legal context of digital fiction as well as its technological affordances. While the online platform LiveJournal in some ways channels user creativity towards a more self-evidentially ‘digital’ text than its successor in the Archive of Our Own (AO3), the Archive encourages greater reader interactivity at the level of archive and sorting. I will demonstrate that in some ways, the AO3 recoups some of the cultural capital and use value of print. I argue that a true appreciation of digital fiction is less about projecting fiction as becoming more and more ‘digital’ along a linear trajectory than application of a nuanced sociotechnological perspective that addresses the aims, ideology and provision of particular platforms in practice. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the views of Indian journalists on media convergence in a context where the print media is thriving and Internet penetration is relatively low. Findings show that many journalists do not view convergence as a matter of survival as the print media remains robust. The lack of a strong revenue model for multimedia journalism also contributes to dampening enthusiasm about convergence among many journalists. However, forms of tactical convergence such as cross promotion of content among outlets owned by the same media conglomerate are becoming common. Coordination among journalists working on multiple platforms is more visible in the case of breaking news events than other areas. The desirability of multi-platform delivery by the same reporter is strongly contested among Indian journalists. Overall, journalists working at smaller organizations are more supportive of convergence than those working for large ones with an established reputation in a particular medium. Finally, the study indicates that any effort at introducing convergence in Indian newsrooms must take into account the strength and reach of the print media in the country. </jats:p>",

This article questions who is able to lay claim to titles like ‘fan’ or ‘gamer’, how those titles are being contested along gendered, racialized, sexualized, and classed lines, what happens when new groups lay claim to those titles, and how some fans are reacting to the loss of their privileged relationships with content producers. I look at fan responses to North American game developer BioWare’s decision to diversify games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Dragon Age II by adding the option to play as a gay male character. I discovered that what was often framed by fans as a desire to prevent politics from leaking into gaming and ruining its unique attractions manifested as the maintenance of a heterocentric construction of the gamer identity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article uses the concept of intermediality to explore four different adaptations, across three different media, of the infamous supervillain the Joker. Independent of the medium representing him, a recurring practice is to have the Joker engage with media technologies.

Understood as media combination, intermedial referencing (Rajewsky (2005) Intermediality, intertextuality, and remediation: A literary perspective on intermediality. Intermédialités 6: 43–64), and through concepts such as contingency and liveness (Doane (2002) The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive. Cambridge: Harvard University Press), these intermedial moments, by way of emphasizing the materiality and temporality of media, are found to promote immersion while simultaneously causing tension by destabilizing the act of viewing. </jats:p>",

The article situates deathlogging in a history of media and communication theory interested in the relationships between life and death, and in particular the concept of forensic mediation to describe technologies capable of documenting and reconstructing accidents. The wearable GoPro camera is a camera of choice for action sports athletes to easily record and share things like BASE jumping to gain audience views and capital in the form of sponsorships. Representative examples are discussed and analyzed to demonstrate how fatal accidents transform the value of GoPro footage from social-economic capital into forensic or juridical evidence to reconstruct accidents, make sense of fatalities, and, in some instances, argue for legal culpability. The article offers deathlogging as a concept which can be applied to a variety of recording situations with different kinds of wearable cameras. </jats:p>",

Here, the virtual culture of information is characterised as an interaction between two different socio-technical drives and processes- the archive and real-time drives. The question of how this interaction can be culturally signified is discussed firstly in terms of various tendencies to integrate the two processes on the basis of pre-existing limits of culture, and secondly in terms of a concept of 'dead-time' which is implicit to the interplay between technology and culture. The latter concerns the ways in which the limits of culture can never be fully experienced or represented within culture except as an irreparable loss of presence. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Smart mobile devices like the iPhone, Android, Kindle Fire, and iPad have energized educators’ interest in using mobile media for education. Applications from clickers to games to augmented reality game creation software are thriving in research settings, and in some cases schools, but relatively little is known about how youth use such devices for learning outside of school. This research study seeks to add to the research literature detailing the technological affordances of such devices by using a Social Construction of Technology (or SCOT) approach, to see how one user group – adolescents – construct the technology particularly in regards to learning. It employs a design intervention approach in which we gave fully operational iPhones with unlimited data plans to three cohorts of youth to use throughout the day. Participants included homeschooled students, students enrolled in alternative schools, and students at a conventional American high school. Participants strongly valued these devices for learning, and constructed them as personalized devices for amplifying learning, specifically through amplifying access to information, social networks, and ability to participate in the world. Access to mobile devices was deeply tied to personal power for these youth, as they were able to function more effectively to meet their goals with employers, teachers, and peers. Although they destabilized relationships, they caused almost no friction, and instead, parents, teachers, and peers reported valuing how youth could participate more fully in the world. The article concludes with implications for how educators and software designers might best capitalize on these social affordances when designing for mobile-enabled classrooms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as the internet and mobile phones, facilitate the spread of knowledge and interactions across borders in previously unimagined ways, questions are being asked about whether the benefits of this digitization process are equally distributed between and within countries. Motivated by the way technology adoption and usage patterns may differ in the Arab Middle East, this paper examines how the Kuwaiti context shapes people’s understanding of a survey instrument used for evaluating digital inequalities, as they relate to access, skills and engagement, and outcomes of ICT use. Specifically, it discusses the adaptation and validation of the survey measures of socio-digital inequalities through a process of cognitive interviewing and provides insight into the theoretical and empirical linkages between cultural conceptions of digital and traditional inequalities in ways that explore both their universal and contextual aspects, or denotative and connotative meanings. Evidence suggests that important cross-cultural complications relate to language issues, socio-economic conditions, citizenship, and differing perceptions of social desirability. These findings offer important considerations for improving the reliability and validity of future survey-scale adaptations in the broader MENA region, especially in countries containing significant multicultural populations. Simultaneously, they call into question the extent to which global conceptualizations of digital inequalities and their measures reflect complex local realities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Abstact: Online personals, also known as internet dating sites, are a fast growing phenomena on the web. This article focuses on one Australian site, RSVP, and seeks to understand the modes of subjectivity that are engendered by the practices and discourses of this cultural form. Central to this discussion are the construction of personal profiles, the processes of contacting other users online and in real space, and the way users of the site negotiate the codes and systems that govern RSVP. The ways in which the self is narrated through the use of online personals is structured both by the spatiality and the ordering of everyday life and the increasing intimacy of the computer/user relationship. It is also fundamentally bound up with the ideologies of consumer culture and the interpellation of the self-actualising, or enterprising, individual. This analysis works to locate the self of online personals within the current phase of modernity and its articulation in cultural theory. </jats:p>",

The development of 'gay' magazines in the early 1970s is outlined, although terms such as 'gay' and 'homosexual' which were produced in a Western context are shown to have undergone a shift of meaning when imported to Japan. Many of the functions of these Japanese gay magazines are shown to have been taken over by gay sites on the internet. The variety of gay material on the internet is described, and, using interview information derived from Japanese gay men over the internet, the different ways in which these men use the internet is discussed. Finally, the role the internet is playing in the process of 'global queering' in which a variety of western discourses about homosexuality confront and interact with non-western indigenous constructions is questioned. </jats:p>",

However, this misses out on an important trope in videogame fanfictions, where authors transplant game procedures, systems, mechanics, and play styles into their stories.

This article examines how three popular fanfictions based on the Chinese MMO Jian 3 narrativize ludic elements in a way that reinforces hegemonic masculinity.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of transmediation might be one of the most influential intellectual tools for studying, discussing and fostering innovative phenomena across fields of study. One could argue that the term itself is self-explanatory. Etymologically, it suggests a transition (to go across) between different media but the concept of transmediation has been shaped both by the somewhat historically lax definition of media and the disciplines that have adopted the term. And while the looseness of media gives transmediation a potential for interdisciplinarity, the siloed nature of academic disciplines could have, at the same time, hindered such potential. In this paper, we introduce a framework for transmediation based on an analysis of the use and evolution of the concept and our own explorations over the last few years. This framework aims to provide a common language and a set of conceptual prompts to explore the notion of transmediation further. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Story Blocks",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital technology is changing, and has changed the ways we create and consume narratives, from moving images and immersive storyworlds to digital long-form and multi-branched story experiences. At the same time, blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is revolutionizing the way that transactions and exchanges occur. As a globally stored and collaboratively written list of all transactions that have ever taken place within a given system, the blockchain decentralizes money and offers a platform for its creative use. There are already examples of blockchain technologies extending beyond the realm of currency, including the decentralization of domain name servers that are not subject to government takedown and identity management and governance. By framing key blockchain concepts with past and present storytelling practices, this article raises questions as to how the principles and implementation of such distributed ledger technologies might be used within contemporary writing practices – that is, can we imagine stories as a currency or value system? We present three experiments that draw on some of the fundamental principles of blockchain and Bitcoin, as an instantiation of a blockchain implemented application, namely, (1) the ledger, (2) the blocks and (3) the mining process. Each low-fi experiment was intentionally designed to be very accessible to take part in and understand and all were conducted as discrete workshops with different sets of participants. Participants included a cohort of design students, technology industry and design professionals and writing and interaction design academics. Each experiment raised a different set of reflections and subsequent questions on the nature of digital, the linearity (or not) of narratives and collaborative processes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Technological developments have led to a rethinking of how obsolete media should be treated when it becomes relatively inaccessible. This article focuses on Video Home System (VHS) videocassettes in digital culture. Using semi-structured interviews undertaken with people who converted their videocassettes into a digital format, this study explores the notion of participatory and convergence culture. It shows how media innovation results in emergent roles and functions for videocassettes, attributing new experiences and meanings to both digital and VHS formats. Specifically, divergence helps videocassette owners control and manage family memories, strengthening ties between family members and relations between friends. This culminates in the creation of an inherited object of memory. The findings indicate a lack of confidence in technology, especially in its ability to preserve family memories. In addition, it was found that a sort of spiritual power is attributed to videocassettes, which prevents their owners from throwing them away. This study offers a model of the divergence process and a set of terms relying on research into religion transformations and human–technology relations. These frameworks can be applied to participatory culture, more accurately accounting for old versus new media user behaviors. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents and justifies Gephisto, an experimental tool visualizing networks in one click. Gephisto’s design exemplifies how we can interfere with a user’s utilitarian goals, by giving them what they wish (an easy way to get a network map) but in disobedient ways (the produced map is different every time the tool is used) that encourage them to engage further with the tool’s methodological tenets. As an apparatus, Gephisto aims to incentivize untrained users to become more critical of their network mapping practices. As an intervention into the field of digital methods, it aims to show that tools that support critical thinking do not have to be hard to use and hostile to beginners. We criticize the idea that tools range from easy-to-use black boxes for unreflexive lazy-thinkers, to complex and demanding instruments for hard-thinking experts. We argue that learners need ease of use and critical thinking at the same time, and that it is possible to design tools that support both needs at once. We offer an alternative model where we acknowledge the active role of the user in deciding the tradeoff between learning to master the tool, and progressing toward their utilitarian goals. We argue that the design of the tool should not oppose the beginner’s need for assistance in decision making, but find other ways to incentivize critical thinking. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Many stereotypes of new media workers exist: they are exemplary of the future of work and of working in the new economy; their work is emotional; their passion for new media translates into creativity in the production process. Of course, none of these stereotypes paints a full picture. This article proposes that a study of the micropolitics of a new media production process, which explores the articulation of the emotional with commercial imperatives, results in a different story about new media work and points to some of the many complexities of making new media objects. The article further suggests that there is a need for a nuanced unpacking of the concepts of emotional and affective labour, which recognizes the different, sometimes opposing affects and emotions that drive new media work. It concludes that the science and technology studies' term 'interpretative flexibility' provides a useful conceptual tool with which to conceive of the complex emotional and commercial imperatives that drive new media work. </jats:p>",

A critical position is taken to the general trend of communication science research on computer media, which tends to focus on technological form and theoretical distinctions stemming from the study of mass communication. An alternative description of computer media is developed which focuses on a) the computer's inherent semiotic nature and their capacities for symbol manipulation and b) the responsive context of reception characteristic of computer media. Four analytic typologies for research treating computer media are reviewed. A new typology which responds to the Peircean category of representation is introduced. This typology evaluates 'representational character' - differentiating common computer media by content scope, and temporal and spatial qualities. </jats:p>",

A grounding in his fundamental philosophy is given first as a means to set the stage and become familiar with his approach to perceiving the environments in which we find ourselves. This is followed by a review of his theory of types of learning which shows how individuals gain knowledge through various levels of corrective strategies. From this body of Bateson's theory I draw forth a set of heuristics appropriate for critical analysis of interface design. Finally I use these heuristics on a particular case study to illicit both the strengths and weaknesses of the interface involved and those of the heuristics themselves. </jats:p>",

Although many scholars concur that girls benefit from access to safe spaces where they feel comfortable expressing themselves, such sites have historically been sparse. The World Wide Web (WWW) now allows those with access and expertise to construct personal home pages to present their thoughts to a geographically removed, anonymous, yet potentially global public. This qualitative study describes adolescent girls' expression on their web home pages. Three general tones captured the diversity of self-expression on girls' home pages; these tones were labelled spirited, sombre, and self-conscious. Tones were differentiated by their presentation style, content, and degree of self-disclosure. In addition to extensive description of the girls' home pages, the web's potential as a new 'safe space' for girls' self-expression is discussed. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Rhetoric in the metaverse",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the summer of 2021, the concept of the metaverse emerged as a macro goal for Big Tech and entertainment industry leaders. The concept is a familiar one: the creation of an embodied internet facilitated by wearable virtual reality technologies (e.g. smart glasses). References to the metaverse often identify Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel, Snow Crash, as the place where the term was first coined, although the concept itself can be traced back to Stanley G. Weinbaum’s 1935 science fiction short story, ‘Pygmalion’s Glasses’. Other media critics, like Wired’s Kevin Kelly have also used the term mirrorworld to describe immersive virtual and mixed reality worlds in the same vein as the metaverse. </jats:p><jats:p> The aim of this article is to offer a speculative and pragmatic reimagining of rhetorical pedagogy for the metaverse. For instance, in place of reading Plato, how might students come to understand Plato’s philosophy by walking and talking with the Socrates trope or engaging in a dialog with an AI Plato? How might students feel the affective significance and impact of Martin Luther King, Jr’s ‘I Have Dream’ speech by attending a virtual simulation of the event or sitting alongside MLK in a jail cell as the author pens ‘Letter from Birmingham Jail’? The metaverse holds potential for creating these sorts of embodied learning experiences to enhance traditional pedagogical and post-pedagogical methods, as well as to foster a new level of engagement with arts and humanities curricula at a time when administrative leadership and governing bodies in higher education are exploring new options for delivering high-quality, engaging learning experiences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Book review: Inventing the medium: Principles of interaction design as a cultural practice",
    "abstract": "Inventing the Medium examines a pressing predicament: how do professionals design for the digital medium, a broad category that includes websites, video games, and handheld devices? Digital media are often merely a ‘good enough’ translation of a legacy format, such as with eBooks. At the same time, digital is disruptive; society is ‘creating complex digital environments faster than we are creating the means of conceptualizing and overseeing them’ (p. 127), leading to a splintered field with few standards. Inventing the Medium unifies interdisciplinary scholarship to propose a design process focused on everyday use. Janet Murray here pushes concepts introduced in Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace (1998) towards pragmatic questions of how to design interactions with technologies. Her theoretical stances, vocabulary, elicitation techniques, and perspectives on design will appeal to a range of scholars interested in software studies, technological histories, computer-mediated communication, and humancomputer interaction. Murray’s primary argument is that digital (primarily but not exclusively related to computers) is a medium still in the process of being collectively created through shared culture. Similar threads of scholarship include Anne Balsamo’s assertion that technological design is a cultural process that begins in the imagination (Balsamo, 2011) and Thomas Streeter’s history of the Internet as deeply tied up with romanticism (Streeter, 2011). A more humanistic design process involves an attentive eye to the user, prototypes, and simulations. More broadly, good design unfolds through interactive rituals between users and digital artefacts in society. She refers to this collective work of expanding the depth and breadth of symbolic representations as ‘enlargening the circle of shared attention’. Her optimistic vision reinforces how coming together around good design practices can connect us and make us, essentially, more human. Designers must recognize that the digital medium is still in flux and draw on previous affordances while also forging ahead. They should balance cultural context, core human values, and functionality to create artefacts that encourage the experience of autonomy. She connects cognitive and cultural facets of design by drawing on Donald Norman’s interpretation of affordances (Norman, 2002) to describe the natural but often unconscious ways users interact with objects. Individuals unconsciously store conventions of previous media formats in cognitive schema. Designers must master articulating affordances as they activate new and hybridized schemas to ‘accelerate the collective project of inventing a new medium by creating and refining the conventions that will bring coherence to new artifacts and enhance their expressive power’ (p. 39). She thus extends Norman by suggesting that affordances are collectively emergent rather than simply created, and shifts the role of designers towards that of astute interpreter. The first part of the book summarizes her vision for the design process and proposes how to imagine new artefacts in the digital medium while fostering conventions of inscription, transmission, and representation on specific platforms. Next, each affordance (encyclopaedic, spatial, procedural, and participatory) is considered within the purview of a specific tradition; procedural affordances are considered in the realm of computer science as she traces layers of abstraction from code to digital artefact and advocates for the use of flow charts and pseudocode. She calls on fellow Georgia Tech professor Ian Bogost’s concept of procedural rhetoric (Bogost, 2005) to describe Book reviews 117",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Ranting has a bad reputation. But is it always deserved? Online ranting has been alternatively decried for its emotion-laden hostility and praised as a beloved video genre. By exploring a qualitative corpus of YouTube rant videos, this article analyzes how problem-centric rants may serve as forms of proto civic engagement. The article shows that problem-centric rants contribute to emotional public spheres, in which emotions and logic combine to publicize personally-experienced participatory problems and to contribute to civic discourse for others similarly impacted. It reveals the discourse strategies that ranters use to persuade viewers that the site’s policies and the behavior of other participants are complicating self-expression through video. Discourse strategies include counter-balancing criticism with praise, interpellating addressees into a civic public, and focusing criticisms on the powerful. The article contributes to research on social media-based civic engagement and emotional public spheres by analyzing rant videos that expose issues with tech- nologized and commercialized communicative frameworks in digital spaces. </jats:p>",

This article introduces a set of theoretical propositions relating to the industry’s responses to such changes and, in particular, to the implementation of networked technologies and social media in television news organizations. The technological frames analytic lens was used to identify journalists’ assumptions and expectations about technology use and to explain the outcomes of technological and professional change in the journalistic environment. Through interviews conducted with journalists working for television news desks in Israel, we show that the interviewees’ perceptions of the technologies, the role of their organization, and the essence of their profession provide a meaningful explanation of the actual implementation of networked technologies. The findings resolve the contradiction between potential contribution of the emerging technologies and their limited use in journalistic organizations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues for Netflix’ efforts to create a transnational middlebrow, highlighting especially the strategy of visibility politics as a measure to create a metrics for ‘diversity and inclusion’ in a process I call the quantification of diversity. Hence, the article seeks to draw together themes of Netflix’ efforts in transnationalism, the platform’s efforts in diversity and inclusion and the strategy of visibility politics, common to middlebrow television as visual signifier of marginalisation, rather than narrativisation. This process becomes part of a larger grammar of transnationalism to formulate a kind of transnational text specific to Netflix. Visibility politics seeks to quantify visibly marginalised bodies on screen as a measure of ‘progress’ and is, thus, particularly relevant for a Silicon Valley company that seeks remedy social problems via mathematical solutions. This leads to a politics that produces highly visual measures of social progress, but does not offer narratives to communicate barriers to full participation. The metrics for ‘otherness’ are hardly universal, though and Netflix cannot provide such a metrics for its transnational productions. Instead, it seeks to combat ‘universal’ issues of discrimination by means of visibility politics. The platforms’ earlier American texts tried to remedy issues of marginalisation via the narrativisation of barriers. To document this change, the article analyses the Netflix series One Day At A Time with the popular 2023 series Wednesday. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The artist and the automaton in digital game production",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses discourses around procedural content generation (PCG) as automation of creativity in the games industry. PCG refers to techniques for creating game content algorithmically, by manipulating data through sets of computational operations and parameters. By producing scalable results with combinatorial diversity, procedural generation is touted as the future of content, yet flouted as the harbinger of technological unemployment in game art production. Critical scholarship on automation suggests that the real danger is not job loss per se, but the constitution of an underclass of artists whose vital work of conditioning algorithmic outputs is denigrated as derivative and ‘manual’. Framed by liberal humanist ideas of agency, PCG naturalizes trade-offs where the autonomy of generative machines is contingent upon the automatism of its human conditioners. This qualitative analyses of talks on PCG at the Game Developers Conference (2015–2020) shows how procedural systems bifurcate the creative work of algorithmic cultural production into affective and mechanical forms of conditioning that map onto stratifications of racial capitalism. Affective tuning resists documentation and is reserved for artists with technomasculine forms of cultural capital; mechanical tuning is relegated to automatable and outsourced labour and relies on replicable technique that is considered artistic but not creative. This article argues that PCG’s reclassification of creativity through racialised dialectics of human agency and machine automaticity overlooks the autonomy of procedural systems. PCG pipelines are organised less around the agency of human toolmakers and more around the autonomy of systems that assimilate tasks in the management of complex networks of dependencies. Instead of pitting artists against machines, this analysis politicises automation’s racial stratifications by examining the momentum of more-than-human systems in which toolmakers and tool users negotiate granularities of control and degrees of concession. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The ethical dilemma of modding digital games: A literature review of the creation and distribution of mods",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In parallel with the rapid growth of the digital games market, the modding phenomenon has been gaining momentum. Mod culture, a manifestation of the convergence and the remix cultures, emerges as a way to adapt digital games to the needs of their players and incorporate content from other media, such as books, movies, or series, into the game world. This systematic literature review aims to discuss the ethical considerations of modding by understanding its impact on the overall gaming experience and comprehending how players and game companies perceive and respond to modders’ motivations. 15 studies from various scientific fields were analysed. Overall, mods impact the gaming experience in a variety of ways, ranging from educational purposes to deeper social concerns. While modders find motivation to create mods stemming from a myriad of reasons, including leisure and self-improvement, the stance taken by game companies, gaming communities, and players tends to discourage them from developing new mods and deter new modders who aspire to contribute with creative content. In conclusion, it remains important to recognise that specific ethical dilemmas linked to mod culture require in-depth debate to reach a consensus. Furthermore, other aspects demand more stringent scrutiny to ensure that we can all benefit from the enriching playground of personal experimentation and exploration that modding offers in this contemporary era of convergence. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Exclusionary inclusion? Streaming platforms and trans inclusive policies and practices: A case study of Netflix",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the incongruence within Netflix’s corporate practice: while on the one hand the streamer promotes trans inclusion along with trans talent development in Netflix’s production culture, both on and off screen, on the other hand its industrial practices and representational output demonstrate a different approach. This article argues that, while the streamer positions itself as a champion of inclusion and diversity in the television industry, Netflix is invested in transness as an economic frontier rather than in adopting anti-transphobic practices. In making this argument, this article fosters a three-pronged approach to explore the treatment of trans identities by Netflix. Firstly, the article analyses Netflix’s corporate practices in relation to promotion of its limited series, Tales of the City. Secondly, the article explores the media event of Dave Chappelle’s comedy special The Closer and the subsequent trans employee walkout. Thirdly, it performs on audit of Netflix’s website and corporate materials to highlight how Netflix has developed a response to trans inclusion in relation to the walkout. Exploring these facets through Aron Kundnani’s (2023) critique of the diversity industry, this article argues that, on a policy and corporate performativity level, Netflix’s approach to trans inclusion can be defined as transliberalist (Raha, 2015), so that its practices result in a platform catalogue that is simultaneously at best trans-affirming and at worst transphobic. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology have begun to position the medium for widespread adoption and cultural impact. But these ongoing technical victories give way to pressing challenges in the area of content creation. As the page differs from the screen, so too do the hybrid design spaces of AR differ from the virtual reality of the desktop. Caught in the transition from the personal computing era to the ubiquitous computing paradigm, multimedia producers in many fields will need to adapt to AR platforms. To which traditions, then, might we turn for aesthetic models? This article aims to incite an aesthetic transference between French Impressionist painting and AR media practices, while acknowledging the influences of other avant-garde legacies. I draw upon a transdisciplinary matrix of scholarship in media theory and visual culture in order to emphasize the relevance of Impressionism as an art historical precedent for understanding contemporary AR projects, and to suggest how Impressionist principles of composition might inform AR media aesthetics. </jats:p>",

To date, the impact of various technologies on the music cultures and industries of the rest of the planet have been little examined. While these cultures and industries may 'lag behind' their better-facilitated western counterparts in terms of provision of new equipment and associated creative and industrial practices, the impact of new technologies on these territories is just as marked and complex as it is in the West. </jats:p>",

Its ethnographic research design allowed the researchers to interact with the rural people under study and obtain first-hand data on their adoption and usage of the internet. The results show that in the context of rural China, where the local economy and infrastructure can hardly sustain such an advanced technology as the internet, the diffusion and usage of the internet are determined not much by the will of individuals, but by the change agency. As the weakest social class in terms of their share and control of social resources, Chinese farmers as individuals do not play an important role in the adoption of the internet, which tends to be the result of organizational initiatives. </jats:p>",

Whilst existing understandings tend to focus on the assumedly predatory monetisation techniques that players are subjected to by game developers, I instead argue that a logic of gambling is integral to the f2p experience economy of Asian players. Drawing on an analysis of in-depth interviews with Singapore-based game players/developers, I show how the virtual items and worlds that players engage with through f2p gamespaces are imbued with experiential value, whilst developers leverage the volumes of data generated by players to maximise this value in ways that might eventually lead to their monetisation. Embracing these complementary facets of f2p gamespaces can help expand normative understandings of gambling in/and gaming. </jats:p>",

Cees J.

This dilemma is exacerbated when you look at the range of issues and debates addressed: subjects as diverse as the Internet and new technology, law, finance, health, Third World development, politics, privacy and urban planning among others.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors systematically investigate the evolution of the modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the associated changes in protest – related tactics employed by two main stakeholders in the contemporary contentious political processes – dissenters and incumbent political authorities. Through in-depth investigation of the cyberprotest cases in the former Soviet states of Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine, which occurred during the last decade, a coherent outline is developed of the co-evolution of the ICT-enabled protest tactics of the main counterparts in the contemporary political struggle in these countries. Particularly, it was found that there were at least three highly distinguishable levels of development of modern ICTs and the associated types of protest-related tactics employed by the main stakeholders in these events. It was established that as soon as the authorities were able to effectively counteract the previous ICT-enabled tactics by the dissenters, new developments in modern ICTs always empowered the latter to devise new effective strategies to overcome previously successful counterrevolutionary measures of the political authorities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article investigates the memory work concerning Michael Jackson on Reddit. By means of their posts, comments, and replies, people contributing to this site – Redditors – enter into a process we call mnemonic stabilization. This is a collaborative process in which networked individuals share their memories about, in this case, Michael Jackson. We argue that this process resembles Jackson’s dance technique called moonwalking: Redditors seem to go back in time, but they continually alter how Jackson is remembered and forgotten, depending on the (personal) context of the present and an imagined future. These theoretical observations are assessed empirically by a content analysis of comments and replies ( N = 917) posted on the subreddit /r/MichaelJackson between June 25, 2009, and December 31, 2018. This revealed that most posts with a mnemonic dimension focus on personal memories of Michael Jackson’s music, performances, and (perceived) positive characteristics, rather than on how he should be remembered. These findings can be partially explained by Reddit’s socio-technical infrastructure. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Echolocation as theory of digital sociality",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public attention on disconnection and digital detox focuses on the health and wellbeing associated with disconnecting without much attention on what happens to selfhood or identity when abruptly disconnected. In an age of ubiquitous internet and “always on” use practices, what does disconnection do? Focusing on what happens when we disconnect, at the micro level, reveals interesting echolocative communication patterns otherwise not noticed. Abruptly stopping the continuous call and response pattern of interaction among youth produces deep anxieties and feelings of existential vulnerability that are commonly brushed aside. The work in this article is part of a larger project related to echolocation as a theory of communication. In an era of constant connectivity and “always on” or more importantly, “always available” internet, the seemingly seamless and steady state of connectivity is, at the more granular level, a process of continual echolocation, in the way we might think of sonar, whereby certain animals like bats determine the shape and location of objects in space by sending steady streams of signals and attending closely to the quality of the echo. Echolocation challenges researchers and theorists to reconsider the core elements and processes in an era of continuous, machinic as well as human interaction in multiple and massive networks of information flow. This does not mean we no longer experience dyadic (two person) or intra interactions, of course, but echolocation, the process of moving, navigating, and positioning through radar-like call and response provides a promising model to apply to how humans make sense of who they are in the complexities of continuous and tangled data flows. </jats:p>",

In other disciplines there is a definite sense of some things being more fundamental than others. Think of three speeds: the speed of light, the speed of sound and the best speed achieved by Bode Miller (my favourite skier.) No physicist would have any doubt: the speed of light is more fundamental than the speed of sound (it is even called a fundamental constant) and the speed of sound is more fundamental than the speed of any skier. This doesn’t mean that only the speed of light is important. In its appropriate context each is important.",

The purpose of the study is to contribute to recent discussions digital disconnection and digital wellbeing by using an extraordinary event of involuntary disconnection as point of departure. Our research questions were: Where were people when the services shut down, what did they think and what did they do? What correlations can be found between usage/attitudes to social media and the experiences of the outage? How can the outage of October 4th be understood as a snapshot of our cultural condition? The questionnaire was distributed to 463 Swedish university students and 191 responses were received. Our analysis shows how the involuntary disconnection caused by the outage was an event that highlights the ambivalence of digital life. It also points to some correlations between general social media use and attitudes, and the experiences and activities during the outage. The paper ends with a discussion on the implications that these findings may have for further research into digital disconnection. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is found throughout many websites. By challenging users to read a line of scrambled letters, identify crosswalks in an image, or some complete another task that is difficult for a computer to do, but comparatively trivial for a human user, a CAPTCHA verifies that the user is an actual human, and not software meant to interact maliciously with the website. This mundane and easily overlooked interface element is an important site where corporate interests and priorities act upon the people who encounter it. CAPTCHAs operate under the assumptions that difference can be detected and that it should be enforced. Because not all humans are able to solve a CAPTCHA, the test additionally enforces a boundary between humans and users. In this article, I analyze the discourses of Google’s reCAPTCHA and argue that this common interface element is a multi-faceted site of production where user labor is extracted every time they solve a reCAPTCHA. The products of this labor are threefold: (1) spam reduction, (2) artificial intelligence and machine learning training data and (3) an ideal of a normative web user. This last product is often overlooked but has wide-reaching implications. Users who solve reCAPTCHAs are producers but simultaneously are produced as users by the reCAPTCHA. The only humans who qualify as ‘authentic’ users are those who can perform this productive labor. Because Google’s reCAPTCHA operates as a site of invisible digital labor, this article works toward making such labor more visible so that users can become more aware of the work they are being asked to perform, and to what ends.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Invisible Belfast: Flat ontologies and remediation of the post-conflict city",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> [in]visible belfast was a research-driven indie alternate reality game (ARG) that ran for 6 weeks during the spring of 2011 in Belfast and was subsequently adapted, 5 years later into a fictional documentary for BBC Radio 4. The ARG is a participatory and dispersed narrative, which the audience play through. The text expands outward across both physical and digital platforms to create a mystery for the players using everyday platforms. The ARG is a product of media convergence and at its heart transmedial, defined by its complexity and modes of participation. The fictional radio documentary which remediated the ARG into a more simple linear structure, but possibly a more complex narrative form, retells parts of the story for new audiences. The premise of [in]visible belfast – the game and later the documentary – is itself an adaptation of writer Ciaran Carson’s novel The Star Factory (1997): a postmodern adventure through the complex psychogeography of Belfast. A trail through the labyrinthine text, which paints the history of Belfast in poetic prose. This article will map the concept’s journey from novel to game to radio, contextualising its development within its political and urban landscape and charting the remediation of the narratives as they fold out across multiple media and complex story arches. The article will draw together ideas from previous publications on ARG, transmediality and complex textualities from the authors and reflect on the textual trajectories that the remediation of the narrative has taken from the original book, through the ARG, into the radio documentary. Building upon recent approaches from environmental philosopher Tim Morton and games theorist Ian Bogost, the authors argue that Belfast’s history propels medial adaptations of a particular kind, characterised by a ‘flat’ ontology of space and time and a sort of diffuse and dark urban experience for designers/producers and players/listeners. </jats:p>",

The global justice movement that started in Seattle in 1999 extended global networks to organize action. In recent years, with the development of what has been called ‘Web 2.0’, spontaneous mass mobilizations emerged in large cities. These struggles are specific to each country and context; however, in all cases, they create shared spaces both in the physical world and in the networks, connecting the streets to the global flow of indignation. The intricate urban and digital spatiality of these insurgencies brings a demand for democracy that goes beyond national identities, through forms of protest that are more prefigurative than programmatic. </jats:p>",

Whilst analogies are being made between the VHS/Betamax format war of the 1980s and the emergence of two rival next-generation DVD formats (Blu-ray and HD-DVD), it is clear that the future of the DVD is now much more complex than the identification of a dominant new and higher-capacity format. The emergence of domestic broadband and authorized movie downloading may challenge the role of the DVD as a distribution medium. At the same time, unauthorized downloading, Web 2.0 and renewed debates around intellectual property rights and legislative jurisdiction are challenging the foundations of film making and distribution. These trends in DVD and online movie consumption suggest, in particular, that DVD add-ons may be a short-lived transitory phenomenon rather than a continuing and integral part of movie consumption in the home. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Taking the renewal of the management contract (2007—11) of Flemish PSB as a case in point, this article — by means of a policy analysis model — intends to contribute to a better understanding of the role of the technological argument of digitization in policy making and to the ongoing discussion in public and academic forums about the role and position of PSB in the 21st century. Theoretically, the article concentrates on the dominant and alternative paradigms that feed contemporary discussions regarding the possible and `legitimate' role(s) of PSB in a globalizing and digital interactive cross- and multimedia environment. Special attention is paid to the positions of technology and culture in the discourses on what constitutes a `legitimate' future for PSB, as these two aspects seem to have (re)gained momentum in the renewed debates regarding the raison d'être and accountability of PSB. This article focuses on the policy process leading up to the new management contract of Flemish PSB. In particular, it analyses the discourses of relevant stakeholders that have dominated the process and influenced the eventual outcome. To this end, desk research and close reading of relevant texts are combined with interviews with relevant actors and privileged witnesses. These findings are then evaluated against the wider international context of European discussions regarding the future of PSB and some of its core characteristics in a media world dominated by digital convergence. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Speaking, but having no voice. Negotiating agency in advertisements for intelligent personal assistants",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> With the popularisation of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant, natural language-based interaction with machines is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life. The conceptualisation of these tools as agentive assistants who help with a variety of tasks in both the household and at work is guided by their marketing: When Apple introduced the Siri-technology at their keynote event in 2011, the system responded to the question ‘Siri, who are you?’ with ‘I am a humble personal assistant’. This claim to a speaking subject position while at the same time locating this subject firmly in a servile social role has become a defining feature of the social place of IPAs: Designed to postulate agency, they do so not in equality with humans but as their servants. This paper offers an interdisciplinary analysis of video advertisements for IPAs, combining sociological and linguistic approaches. We treat agency and actors not as something given but as something that becomes visible through communicative acts, suggesting an understanding of these advertisements as socio-technical visions in which the negotiation of agency in human–machine interaction serves two functions: Firstly, the asymmetrical relationship between the human and the machine promises a symmetrisation of human–human relationships. In an imagined diversified world of equal human rights and relationships, social inequality is reconfigured in the relationship between human and non-human entities. Secondly, the negotiation of agency between humans and machines deflects from questions regarding the increasing agency and power of the companies behind these IPAs and their growing access to and influence on people’s private lives. Our paper will thus provide insights into how agency is ascribed in human–human and human–machine interaction considering social practices of symmetrisation and hierarchisation as well as a critical investigation into the triangular relationships between humans’, machines’, and companies’ agency. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Lockdowns and social distancing measures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made remote participation a necessity for a wide range of social situations. This article examines one example: the abrupt transformation of the Finnish doctoral defence into a remote-access experience facilitated by video-conferencing technologies. The event is regularly centred on a formal public academic debate, rife with local academic ritual and ceremonial formality and firmly tied to the assumption of physical co-presence in the material space. Following the tradition of spatial conceptualisations of the digital, we draw inspiration from Henri Lefebvre’s theory on the production of space, particularly the analytical framework of the spatial triad, which enables regarding the doctoral defence as a social space made up of relations between things. As remote-access tools are introduced, new actants enter the field; the relations they mediate are affected, as is the social space that the relations constitute. This facilitates the examination of the effects that remote-access technologies have on conceiving, perceiving and living the doctoral defence, and ultimately on the social space as holistically understood. Our analysis is based on observations of remote-access defences and interviews with doctoral candidates who defended their doctoral theses remotely. Our findings highlight how the social space of the defence is both curtailed and broadened by remote-access technologies; some relations that make up space are narrowed while others stretch sufficiently to be included. As a result, the remote-access defence conceptually counts as the real thing in our material, but it remains unsatisfactory as an experience. This finding suggests how to mediate social space without reducing it: focusing on the lived experience and ensuring that it is not inadvertently distorted. </jats:p>",

At 25, Ars Electronica may seem to be in the first flush of adulthood, but as both Itsuo Sakane and Roger Malina pointed out, its first public outing was preceded by at least two decades of intense activity in the electronic arts. As a consequence the Timeshift symposium, Ars Electronica’s strategic reflection on its own phenomena, had a distinct whiff of mid-life crisis. Under the control of Michael Naimark’s sure and easy stewardship, the symposium (which has always set the collective tone for Ars) took a long view, looking back over 25 years in order to see the next generation of Ars enthusiasts in 2029. And as if that was not challenging enough, so called senior pioneers were invited to speculate about the future while the newer members of the Ars community were given the task of writing up the history.",

The inclusion of GPS in ‘smart phones’ such as the iPhone now allows users to view the spaces they are moving through in new ways. This article examines how we are now remapping places through mobile technologies, which poses the question of how our relationship with local spaces may be changing.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Growing awareness of the ubiquity of algorithms online has established a new discursive space for making sense of their role in individuals’ lives and society writ large. Within this space, social media users have come to think of algorithms as uniquely powerful forces shaping everyday experiences. This article explores how people make sense of algorithms, as seen through (dis)belief in algorithmic conspirituality, where users ascribe divine significance to algorithmic curation on TikTok. We ask: how do users understand algorithmic conspirituality, and under what circumstances do they believe (or not) in the mystical power of algorithms? Drawing on focus groups and interviews with TikTok users ( n = 25), we observed what we call reflexive ambivalence. This refers to a reflexive process in which participants examined their cognitive and affective responses to algorithmic conspirituality videos to untangle seemingly contradictory logical and mystical mentalities. With this insight, we complicate past work by demonstrating the co-occurrence and interdependency of rational, technical vs. affective, socially situated ways of knowing algorithms. We additionally highlight conditions under which belief in algorithmic conspirituality gained plausibility for our participants and how they rationalized the phenomenon as grounded in the worldly realm. </jats:p>",

Digital media constitute a growing area of emergent creative practices where traditional categories of high art and popular culture are increasingly ruptured, eroded and abandoned for broader, interactive/participatory concepts of self-expression, fuelled by an experimentation with and appropriation of both emerging technologies and symbolic languages. In ever more mediated and technologically (over)saturated environments we find both digital life styles and digital media arts as social practices that intersect with each other and engage with digital technology and self(re)presentations of digital culture in hybrid formations.",

While journals have experienced widespread migration to digital, scholarly monographs in print form have been resilient and digital alternatives have faced significant problems of acceptance, particularly in the arts and humanities. Focusing in particular on the arts and humanities, this article asks how, and under what conditions, the digitally mediated long-form academic publication might hold a viable future. It examines digital disruption and innovation within humanities publishing, contrasts different models and outlines some of the key challenges facing scholarly publishing in the humanities. This article examines how non-traditional entities, such as digital humanities research projects, have performed digital publishing roles and reviews possible implications for scholarly book publishing’s relationship to the wider research process. It concludes by looking at how digital or hybrid long-form publications might become more firmly established within the scholarly publishing landscape. </jats:p>",

As fast as the technology evolves, a growing impatience to realise even more of the future drives new media projects and new interactive applications, which, in turn, impact on individual identity and alter the concepts of community.

Reading it raises interesting questions about how parents and teachers perceive children’s use of computers and provide contexts in which children can experience their use in purposeful and relevant ways. A related, but also interesting, question is why such a book should be considered controversial or revealing of the nefarious plots of technophiles.

    "title": "Book review: Towards a market in broadcasting: Communications policy in the UK and Germany",
    "abstract": "Histories of media systems are often written narrowly and deeply, telling stories of a particular technological or sociopolitical evolution impacting a particular place in time. Attempts at comparative analyses are difficult, for the act of widening the scope often results in the disposal of details in such work. Potschka, however, manages breadth and depth in his forensic take on the evolution of broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Germany. Loosely grounded in ‘media [i.e., political] and cultural economics’ (p. 22), Potschka is primarily interested in exploring how public service broadcasters in the two countries have navigated the transition of core values in media policy from a quasi-collectivist ‘public interest’ paradigm to a neoliberal ‘marketplace’ one. A remarkable amount of archival research is supplemented by more than 20 ‘elite interviews with political, economic, and public actors involved in the crucial processes of policy-making’ (p. 8), which adds a dimension of life not often found in such treatises. In a nutshell, Potschka argues that the British and German trajectories of public service broadcasting have been shaped in large part by where power is located in the structure of their respective governments. In the United Kingdom, government structure has remained relatively stable throughout the country’s contemporary history, and decisions about broadcast policy primarily occur at the national level. Not so in Germany, where formative media policies stem from post–World War II reconstructionism, in which power is devolved to the state level and a stringent judiciary exists. Potschka takes the UK trajectory all the way back to 1750, where the roots of Western economic liberalism and notions of a ‘public corporation’ are found. He claims there is no clear trend in the British classification of media as a social or economic good, and the relative primacy of these values has been continually contested throughout the history of British broadcasting. However, the establishment of Ofcom in the last decade, which shifted the UK regulatory regime firmly into the realm of competition law, seems to suggest that marketplace conceptions of broadcasting have triumphed – though Potschka does not see an existential threat to the BBC on the horizon, given its competence in reading the political–economic winds at any given moment. The evolution of broadcasting in Germany is a much more complex story. Strong traditions of regional autonomy, coupled with disastrous experiences of broadcast nationalization during the Weimar Republic and Nazi regime, have led to ‘the most decentralized and regionalized broadcasting system within Europe’ (p. 146). The post-War reconstruction of German government rekindled tensions between regional and national priorities, finally resolved by the Federal Constitutional Court, which firmly placed most broadcast operations (save those strictly technical) under the control of German states. More importantly, the Court decreed that program producers needed ‘to be free from governmental control, and its boards ought to be constituted by incorporating representatives of political, ideological, and social groups’ (pp. 170–171). The socially democratic norms of German broadcast regulation effectively kept commercialism at bay until the 1980s, and certainly it has dampened the effects of neoliberalism on its broadcast environment. But the trend still seems clear here: Germany ran roughshod over sociocultural and regional sensitivities in its regulation of cable and satellite services and its postal and phone systems have long been privatized, which seems to suggest that the values inherent to the broadcast regulatory 372 Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies 20(3)",

Drawing from a broad range of literature across various disciplines, this article both explores these limitations and demonstrates that alternative approaches exist, which can greatly enhance the understanding of digital piracy on a more holistic level. The article concludes with suggestions for future research, arguing in particular that cross-discipline research will best serve the field by promoting innovative methods of data collection and analysis. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The conventional view of new media technologies stresses the economic and political benefits of a free market in telecommunications and broadcasting. However, the evidence to date is that, far from bringing unalloyed benefits, the combination of laissez faire economics and new media technologies represents a way for monopoly capitalism to further invade our lives. The result is that the everyday discourses which bond human society are replaced with commodified images. Yet in the current political climate no scheme that does not conform to the prevailing freemarket ideology is likely to appear on the agenda. The consequences of not finding alternatives to the market are so serious that I would argue that we need an intellectual focus on the notion of a public information utility.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This feature article applies the concepts of ‘make-believe’ and ‘make-belief’ formulated by performance theorist, Richard Schechner, in a study of two role-play communities, Midian City and Gor in the online 3D environment Second Life. With make-believe fantasy role-play at their core, members of the two communities negotiate the social and political norms, the goals of the community and as well as the boundaries of the virtual role-play. The article explores the innovative forms of interaction at play in these negotiation processes, using (cyber)ethnographic methods and the analysis of various textual sources, Goffman’s theories of social performance as well as various types of performance discussed by Schechner and Auslander. The innovative forms of interaction are analysed in the light of the new technology and as performances and make-belief strategies directed towards realizing performative utopias, towards influencing the direction in which leaders and residents of this digital context want the role-play to develop, and towards shaping the emergent social and cultural rules and the political framework of the role-play. </jats:p>",

Of course, forecasts about technological convergence between television, computing and telecommunications are hardly new; we’ve been led to believe that convergence has been imminent ever since broadband cable first made its appearance in the television debate many years ago. And there have long been those who have prophesied the integration of interactivity with a greater degree of personal control over television viewing habits. Indeed, Nicholas Negroponte has argued that: ’The key to the future of television is to stop thinking about television as television’, suggesting that what we currently know as television is set to become more of a ’random access medium’, thereby overcoming the tyranny of scheduling, and incorporating many new ’bits’ or services as well as the old ones we already know and love.2 2",

    "title": "Online Media Within the Public Service Realm?",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Public service media are no longer limited to radio and television as new media genres emerge. Among others, the online medium has supplemented radio, television and the press since the mid-1990s and has become a medium in its own right. Moreover, online media have become essential elements of media consumption patterns. Public service media compete not only with private radio and television broadcasters but also with the press. The question arises, whether such competition in the online field results in more diversity and higher output quality, serving the public interest better. In Europe, there are at least two different schools of thought. One line of argument accepts the public service expansion into online media and regards online media as a necessary and important field for public service activities. Another line of argument suggests limiting the public service remit strictly to radio and broadcasting and considers online media as an emerging market subject to competition among private companies only. Based on the results of a comparative empirical analysis of online media provided by public service broadcasters and print publishers in Switzerland, Germany and Austria (from 2006) this article shows that the achieved results in media output are disappointing. Only few online media live up to the expectations. The article finally argues that the extension of the public service remit to online media might enhance quality and diversity. </jats:p>",

Thus, the desire to create a space in which to share both the pleasures and pains of the often devalued 'feminine' remains a powerful one.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Spain, like other countries of Western Europe, has struggled against Hollywood to maintain its national film industry. Most of the films that are produced lose money, and producers are increasingly reliant on state subsidies. This article outlines the potential benefits of digital technologies to Spanish cinema and recommends changes in government film policy to take advantage of these benefits. State subsidies, in Spain as well as elsewhere in Europe, have created a weak national film market. Most Spaniards view national cinema as low-grade, and consistently opt for foreign fare. This article argues that the government should decrease production subsidies in favour of an investment in digital theatre projectors, thus permitting all productions to take advantage of the cost-saving aspects of digital filmmaking. In the course of researching this article, interviews were conducted with among others Bigas Luna (director of Jamon, Jamon, 1992 and La Teta y la Luna, 1994); Tomás Pladevall (President of the Spanish Association of Cinematographers); José-María Aragonés (Artistic Director of Filmtel, the post-production arm of Filmax production company); Ricardo Gil (Marketing and PR Director of UCl/Cinesa theatres in Spain and Portugal); and J.M. Caparrós Lera (Director of the Center for Cinematic Research in Barcelona). All were interviewed about the audience appeal, artistic merit and technical advantages or disadvantages of the digital medium. </jats:p>",

But Black argues that on-line journalists can find not only abstract wisdom but solid practical advice in the tenets outlined in codes such as that of the Society of Professional Journalists, the largest journalistic association in the USA. He suggests that carrying standards from the ’old world’ into the new can provide the stability journalists need to deal effectively with an inherently unstable environment.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Bioprinting is increasingly recognised for its substantial potential in facilitating customised artistic creations. This field, inherently interdisciplinary, enables the exploration and utilisation of novel materials, techniques, and conceptual frameworks, leading to the emergence of innovative and intellectually engaging art forms. The article refers to ‘MetabolA.I.’ and other interdisciplinary projects as examples of how theoretical and artistic reflections on possible biological or techno-biological forms of life sprout into reality through a mediation of technologies, such as bioprinting. The work on the project and subsequent research in this domain led to the development of two bioprinter prototypes, based on the philosophy of open source. The advent of do-it-yourself (DIY) bioprinting has significantly contributed to its incorporation into educational curricula and artistic endeavours. The democratisation of advanced tools foster a conducive environment for research and experimentation within the arts. It also allows students to experience the methods which will define the future of research. Art projects involving bioprinting also prompt a reassessment of reproducibility in art, since inherent biological variability makes each ‘print’ fundamentally irreproducible. This breathes new life into the discourse on the ‘aura’ of artworks in the technological age, when control over the creative process seems unlimited. The posthumanist perspective on this trend brings us back to the question of whether the creative process is exclusively a human prerogative. </jats:p>",

By definition, multimedia features open and non-hierarchical structures, which also tend to increase interactivity and immersion of the user/viewer or participant. Multimedia develops systems that operate in combinatory or expansive modes and that evolve around integrative or interactive processes. ln concert, multimedia developments illustrate the state of the art of contemporary information societies.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the streaming era, the very thing that defines it is what threatens to impede access to important media history and cultural heritage. Streaming’s barriers to entry and its interim content catalogs challenge the actual collection and preservation of it for research and teaching purposes. If researchers and libraries do not work together to document and preserve these, we will keep losing important sources and data. From a collection perspective, we argue that streaming services consist of their catalog, metadata, and graphical user interfaces. First, we map the large-scale legal deposit collection of streaming at a national library as well as a media researcher’s small-scale targeted collection. Second, we compare the resulting collections of web sites and graphical user interfaces in order to discuss methodological challenges. The findings of this comparative analysis indicate the existing deficiencies in both collections and suggest potential improvements in the collection and preservation of streaming services. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Streaming forward: Adoption considerations for the major recorded music markets in CARICOM",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Music Streaming Services (MSS) have recently emerged as the main format for showcasing and monetizing sound recordings by record labels and artists in the international recorded music sector. In the Caribbean, however, stakeholders have been slow to adopt and integrate these digital music platforms into their overall recorded music strategies. Within this context, this paper explores the key economic opportunities and challenges associated with the late adoption of the platform-based streaming music model. Using self-administered structured interviews with nine regional experts from the three major music markets, as well as an analysis of audio-visual and digital materials and review of documents, the information is derived using a qualitative research approach, supported by a grounded theory strategy of inquiry. The findings illustrate that on one hand there is cautious optimism with respect to the potential for the re-construction of revenue streams, due to stronger royalty inflows associated with new uses of music in the digital arena. The extent to which this is realized contends with the quantum of royalty payouts actually received by rights-holders and their overall willingness to licence their rights to MSS. Additionally, MSS provides the platform for rights-owners to reach glocal audiences. However, this is reliant on the content and user-friendly features embedded in the platforms and the readiness of regional artists to be discovered and monetized via third party playlists. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Popular music, digital technologies and data analysis: New methods and questions",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores how respondents to The Harkive Project ( www.harkive.org ) are enfolding streaming services and automated recommendation systems into their everyday music reception practices. Harkive is an online project running annually on a single day in July that invites people to provide detail and reflection on their experiences with music. Since the project first ran in 2013, it has gathered over 10,000 individual entries. It is conceived as an ongoing experiment in research methodology that attempts to produce an online social space that encourages reflection from respondents about the detail of their music reception practice, while simultaneously acting as a place able to replicate commercial practices around data collection and analysis. This article will demonstrate how such a research process can produce rich descriptive data from respondents who provide a useful snapshot of contemporary music reception practice. The article begins with an overview of how streaming services, data collection from numerous online channels and automated recommendation systems interrelate, and how together they raise questions around how people engage in acts of music reception. It then describes how Harkive is based on similar types of computational/algorithmic processing to those used by key players in the digital music space. The analysis that follows shows that although respondents are engaging in everyday use of streaming services and dynamic recommendations, this engagement tends to be spread across a variety of online channels used in differing combinations, and that it is often recommendations from ‘traditional’ routes, such as media outlets (newspapers, radio stations) and users’ own social groups, that feature prominently in respondent descriptions. Indeed, what Nowak (2016) calls the ‘affective’ element of recommendation appears to be rooted in existing practices that are still in the process of being transposed to the relatively recently emerged digital platforms, rather than – and sometimes in spite of – the rhetorical framing of those platforms as key sites for recommendation and discovery by the companies who operate them. Through a discussion of those findings, and based on an update of Michael Bull’s concept of ‘auditory nostalgia’ (2009), it is then suggested that examining how listeners are enfolding the new technologies of music reception into their everyday routines and routes to meaning-making may be a useful direction for future research. The article then suggests that a mode of working where scholars attempt to reflexively harness data-derived processes may be useful in producing that work, and that experimental and practice-led approaches could enable popular music scholars and listeners alike to develop better epistemic responses to the data-related technologies that have recently helped bring about such huge changes in our everyday music reception practice. </jats:p>",

Using a theoretical framework adapted from digital history and historiography, it will investigate the implications of archival digitization. Through an empirical study of the National Library of Israel’s digital depository of ephemera entitled ‘Time Travel’, the article demonstrates how the selection of archival records for digital preservation, the design of the search interface, and the crowdsourcing of metadata collection are all directing archive users toward certain narratives about Israeli history and away from others. Drawing on interviews with professionals, analysis of reports, and investigations of user experience, I will unearth the political, religious, and cultural tensions that lie beneath the surface of ‘Time Travel’. This research demonstrates that digitization of archival documents is not just a technical process but a cultural, social, and political one as well. </jats:p>",

This article examines (in)fertility blogs written by women trying to conceive, arguing that blogging helps women to renegotiate their experiences of femininity when motherhood is denied or difficult. To do this, I focus on blogs as a space for knowledge production, creating a new paradigm for fertility information which challenges both the doctor/patient power dynamic and traditional discourses concerning fertility. I show how bloggers use their blogs to ‘make sense’ of their (in)fertility experiences by looking at the distinctive content, style and format of their blogs. Finally, the knowledge produced in the blogs is problematized by ‘situating’ them within a broader sociohistorical framework. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the modern financial system, the ability to create money is in the hands of a few central institutions. Blockchain networks, and by extension cryptocurrencies, were created with the promise of giving that power to users. The most well-known example of a blockchain technology achieving such decentralization is Bitcoin, but its popularity has arguably been matched by an alternative-currency named Dogecoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, which have marketed themselves on differentiating technical features, Dogecoin’s allure likely stems from its cultural roots as a meme. Where cryptocurrency is typically regarded as a difficult topic to grasp, the introduction of Doge’s (2013) most popular meme, into the crypto-space increased crypto’s accessibility to new participants. Consequently, Dogecoin exists in two economies: the financial economy and the cultural meme economy, with the latter having unprecedented tangible impacts on the former. Dogecoin’s unique cultural significance provides an example of how blockchain can succeed in promoting alternative money systems. At its peak in 2021, Dogecoin achieved a market capitalization of $88 billion. Where analysis of the Dogecoin phenomenon is lacking in the current literature, we will fill that gap with a case study of Dogecoin. By studying Dogecoin as a combination of money and meme, we can further our understanding of how to better promote social finance initiatives through the virality of memes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The debates on new communication patterns between journalists and their audiences have been coupled with the concept of interactivity, which has become one of the pillar terms in discussions on the future evolution of journalism. By exploring general understanding of interactivity between news editors and organisational circumstances where interactivity as a set of new communication practices is articulated in journalism, this study shifts the attention from the user perspective to occupational ideology, news production culture and the organisation of news production. The aim of this study is to explore to what extent such realities can be identified to Slovenian online news culture that has gone through many changes in recent years. By adopting two ethnographic methods – news website analysis and in-depth interviews with print and online editors – the article offers a case study of the new websites of three prominent Slovenian print media organisations: Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal. Productivity, efficiency and profitability have pushed traditional journalistic values in Slovenian online media to the margins. When it comes to interactive modes of audience engagement, editors and journalists control online news production. As a consequence, despite various interactive features provided on news websites, news production culture develops with the aim of retaining control over information delivery rather than of creating a new space of dialogue and interactive communication. </jats:p>",

It also stresses textual analysis of DVD menus (something largely neglected in contemporary scholarship) as an important tool for understanding the DVD as a novel `intra-text' (as referred to by Brookey and Westerfelhaus in a 2002 essay). The article focuses on the DVD of The Lion King (dir. Allers and Minkoff, USA, 1994), emphasizing the relationship of the disc and its management of a series of attractions to the Disney theme park. This analysis reveals that, in following a path through The Lion King 's two discs, audiences do not simply view a series of activities and materials `extra' to the film, they circulate and participate in an `enclosed environmental artwork' akin to the Disney theme park. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / This article explores the ways in which the films In the Valley of Elah (2006), Battle for Haditha (2007) and Redacted (2007) act as forms of testimony to the Iraq conflict and to the roles played by digital technology in bearing witness to it. The article argues for a greater recognition of the materiality of the digital and for an acknowledgment of its indexical properties as this has significant implications for its status as testament and for its claims to authenticity. Drawing on Wilfred Bion's work on the container/contained relationship, the article also suggests that the films perform a valuable function as containers that provide historical events such as the conflict in Iraq with a graspable form. Works of mainstream cinema that engage with recent history are often viewed ambivalently but the article argues that, on occasion, they can make a significant contribution to the production and dissemination of cultural memory. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article suggests ways in which research into a nineteenth- century technology such as early cinema might be valid in understanding digital technology. It identifies a number of stylistic resemblances between early cinema, personal computing and the internet. It also claims that there is some value in applying one analytical methodology to both 'old' and 'new' media. By looking at digital technology through the filter of an extremely well developed discourse in early film history, softer determinist accounts of digital technology can emerge which are not dependent on the premises of progress nor those of various forms of Postmodernist criticism. In a reverse angle, so to speak, it also argues that a close tracking of digital technology and its critical discourses as they unfold in various entertainment forms can tell us much about the attractions and fascinations that early cinema had a century ago had for its audiences. In short it claims a continuity in audio-visual history and criticism which is a valuable addition, even antedote, to the hyperbole and unsupportable technological determinism that digital media has attracted both in academic and commercial commentary. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> How is it that persons, places, things, and language elements come to have unique identities? In particular, how do notions of the hybrid play into our understanding of identities? In what way does the computer change the way we communicate about and come to understand these entities? How does embodied experience play a part in identity forming? The paper explores concepts surrounding spatial/temporal patterning as a generator of emergent meaning. Identity is here considered as linked to an embodied recombinant gathering of abbreviations of experiental pattern residues. It is a collage-like construction arising out of fragments of associated pattern flows. In this sense identity is always the result of a construction process built of pattern reinforcements and pattern updating. Identity as a product of human understanding draws on an ongoing constructive assembly of processes inherent to meaning-becoming. In this definition there is no such thing as an invariant pattern - only accretive patterns that are similar but different. Here understandings are constantly recombined to address the nature of emergent context. Thus, understanding is always an accretive, hybridising process. An expanded linguistics arises as an ability to fragment, combine and recombine particular pattern instances in the service of evocation and exchange - articulation through intra-action. I am proposing a non-logocentric (or non-word-centred) linguistics, with which we can bring a series of sensual instantiations and media forms into language study, not mimicking the functional nature of words, but exhibiting their own patterned qualities. The complexity that arises out of this re-interpretation is profound yet it is none-the-less necessary to clearly understand an accretive, non-dualistic approach to meaning production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "In his article 'Inter Between: Actus Done' in Convergence, 2, no 2 (Autumn 1996) Luke Hockley contends that interactivity in its current forms merely creates an 'illusion of control' for the user. He argues that this trivialisation results from the power structures which control the media attempting to maintain their hegemony through safely limiting the forms of interactivity. True interactivity, he states, is dialectical and such two-way communication is radically challenging to all forms of mediated communication. His examples, however, are limited to the crudest user interjections into dramatic plotting or choice of web pages. Perhaps if we examined artists' experiments with interactivity and the nature of narrative, a fuller understanding of the potentials of the medium could lead us to different conclusions?",

Exploring the aesthetic and structural changes the trailer has undergone in its journey from the cinema to the iPod screen, the article focuses on the new mobility of these trailers, the shrinking screen size, and how audience participation with these texts has influenced both trailer production and distribution techniques. Exploring these texts, and their technological display, reveals how modern distribution techniques have created a shifting and interactive relationship between film studio and audience.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers stressed the increased efficiency, safety and flexibility that the devices offered, while critics lamented the detrimental impact on driving, privacy, health, etiquette, and even society itself. This analysis, which focuses on the American response to mobile phones between the years 1 ~$1 and 2000, emphasises the negative and critical themes, though this is not meant to suggest that the majority of press coverage was in this vein.2 The bulk of the articles on the topic focused on innovations or interactions amongst the various manufacturers, regulators, and service providers. By exploring the tensions aroused by mobile phones, however, tensions revealed and expressed through critical press coverage, the goal is to gain insight into the unspoken social etiquette that manages mundane, daily activities, and also to discern patterns in the way society adopts new technologies.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> As a result of the emergence of convergent ‘media houses’ at all levels of news journalism, few modern media organizations publish on only one platform. Changing professional practices related to this raise a number of important questions about the relationship between organizational strategies, new technologies, and everyday news journalism. This article addresses these developments from two perspectives, news work and news texts, through the concept of ‘cross-media’. This concept describes communication or production where two or more media platforms are involved in an integrated way. The article argues that in order to be more precise for theoretical and analytical purposes we have to distinguish between cross-media communication, and cross-media production processes. The article concludes by outlining a model that integrates the perspectives of news work and news texts in convergence journalism. </jats:p>",

Following this discussion, we present data from a longitudinal study of MMOG players, focusing on our study’s unintentional provoking of participants to react to (and ultimately reject) these stereotypes in their survey responses. We argue this is of particular interest to researchers studying MMOG players or members of other heavily satirized communities, as these stereotypes influence the ways study participants practice identity management and frame their own gaming practices, even in the context of an academic study that was explicitly not about addiction or the negative effects of digital game play. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Creating successful newsgames requires effective boundary work between journalists and game developers. Both groups come to the job with different professional vocabularies, technical know-how, and work cultures. Our goal was to understand how they approach these challenges as they create a product that satisfies their professional expectations and the demands of media organizations and audiences. This article presents the results of semistructured expert interviews with pioneers in German newsgame production. We found that effective newsgame creation entailed complex coordination efforts. However, expected clashes between the different professional cultures did not occur. Conflicts were eased by a general agreement on news as a public service and by emphasizing nonhierarchical decision-making in teams. Our interviews detail the economic and technical obstacles that have resulted in newsgames not making major inroads. The decline of newsgames was related to the development of other digital media forms that matched journalistic conventions more closely. These findings led us to extend the model of journalistic boundary work to a more interactional concept that highlights the contributions of both sides while acknowledging the obstacles of operating in a larger media system. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Co-creative relations among professional media producers and consumers indicate a profound shift in which our frameworks and categories of analysis (such as the traditional labour theory of value) that worked well in the context of an industrial media economy are perhaps less helpful than before. Can this phenomenon just be explained as the exploitative extraction of surplus value from the work of users, or is something else, potentially more profound and challenging, playing out here? Does consumer co-creation contribute to the precarious conditions of professional creative workers? This article draws from ethnographic research undertaken from 2000 to 2005 with Auran games (a game development company based in Brisbane, Australia) to engage with debates about the status of user co-creation as labour. The article argues that as a hybrid and emergent social network market these relationships introduce a form of creative destruction to labour relations in the context of the creative industries. </jats:p>",

This study examines the authority-led conspiracy theories in China by analysing 44,068 conspiracy theory relevant Weibo posts. The sample was collected by 46 sets of keywords representing popular conspiracy theories circulating online in the pandemic. Through structural topic modelling and textual analysis, we revealed the thematic features and rhetorical strategies of authority-led conspiracy posts. Authorities were found to employ conspiratorial narrative as a regular tactic in the political discourse, and often phrased them in a connotative manner with specific rhetorical strategies. And non-authority users would often elaborate relevant topics endorsed by authorities to apparent conspiracy theories. This study enriches our understanding of authority’s role in spreading conspiracy theories during uncertain times in authoritarian countries. </jats:p>",

I do not ask whether or not digital disconnection is possible, is good or bad, or should be advocated or overcome. Instead, I adopt Eva Illouz’s framework of a negative sociology of social bonds to explore what it would mean to study digital culture from the perspective of negative choice. The conceptual framework is illustrated with three empirical cases that show what it would mean to engage in a negative sociology of digital culture. The shift in perspective from positive bonds to the choice to disengage, not use, or exit certain fora makes visible how digital culture is not only increasingly characterized by polarization, but also how disconnection emerges as a civic virtue that puts the individual user’s responsibility at the forefront. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While the project of game preservation is still in its infancy, it is already clear that its practitioners find themselves facing a number of serious contradictions and predicaments. This article focuses on the challenges and opportunities presented by videogame emulation software and (illegally) ripped game code (‘ROMs’). The use of ROMs within communities of players gives rise to creative practices and performances that constitute a key part of the culture of gaming, yet which heritage organisations find problematic to hold given the (il)legality of origination. Moreover, while many game preservation practitioners and scholars see emulation as the only viable solution for ensuring the long-term playability of games, few practical concessions or legal defences are presently available to support its use. The article begins by briefly exploring the videogame industry’s attitudes and position in relation to practices of copying, ripping and software piracy. It moves on to consider how this stance impacts on the efficacy of the project of game preservation in terms of collecting policies, preservation and exhibition practice. Finally, the article concludes with a call for greater collaboration between preservationists, games industry partners and communities of players, in order that long-term access to games might be assured – or at least debated. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Immigrant space – a place of convergence of multiple movements – engenders through rhythms of the everyday and an art of inhabitation of its people. It comprises stories of resilience that must be amplified and celebrated, especially when they are at a threat of erasure on account of systemic and structural violence, and/or a lack of concerted effort to document them. Little Pakistan is one such immigrant space inhabited by Pakistani Americans in Brooklyn, New York City. In this article, I propose a framework titled ‘Engender(ing)’ for a rediscovery of meanings vested in immigrant space, explaining its emergence and expansion across forms, delimitations and associations. The framework is then applied through a confluence of collaborative storytelling and interactive documentary. The outcome, Little Pakistan – Future Histories, is an interactive documentary project presented as a case study, with people – artist, community, publics – assuming the role of ‘innovators of meanings’ to rediscover Little Pakistan as an ‘ensemble of meanings’. I infer that this framework and its praxis offer promise for future collaborative new media documentary practice and research in the context of other immigrant enclaves, neighborhoods and similarly structured spaces. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A wave of social, domestic robots is poised to enter our homes. Robots such as Jibo, Kuri and Olly are networked with other ‘smart’ devices and use cameras and voice control to provide companionship, care and household management. These robots are proposed as members of the family, and as such must encourage intimacy and trust with their human caregivers. In this article, we explore the nexus between the cute aesthetic of home robots and the kinds of affective relationships this aesthetic enables with the human user. Our argument is that the cuteness of home robots creates a highly ambivalent relationship of power between (human) subject and (robotic/digital) object, whereby the manifestation of consciousness and the production of lasting emotional bonds require home robots to exceed the affective and semiotic limitations, even as their cute appearance may encourage the production of intimacy. By exceeding the borders established by their own design, home robots are able to manifest as conscious beings, a manifestation which both destabilizes the power differential between user and robot and, paradoxically, points to the possibility of their own replacement. To explore these ideas, we discuss three soon-to-be-released social robots: Mayfield Robotics’ Kuri, Emotech’s Olly and Jibo Inc.’s Jibo. Each promises a unique personality that will integrate them as a member of the family. </jats:p>",

From the perspective of Olympic and sports officials, these developments possess a Janus-faced character, simultaneously offering additional avenues to promote the Olympic brand and experience globally and challenging their capacity to maintain control over Olympic related media in online environments. This situation is the result of long-established broadcast media strategies colliding with the networking capacity of Web 2.0 and the operation and popularity of ‘social software’ such as blogs and Facebook. The evidence presented is drawn from Olympic policy documents, media reports and interviews with sports officials and athletes. </jats:p>",

This policy “implementation gap,” signals a failure to take into consideration the complexity of a system or issue. Failure often results in policy that is a misfit for the issue of concern and is lacking in the hoped for remedial or preventative impacts. This study explores policy prototyping as a remedy for policy failures in bills aimed at privacy protection. After selecting three privacy-related bills, we created prototypes that represented one of many ways that privacy policy could be translated into features in online platforms. Using the prototypes, we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews to gather feedback and insights on the challenges with the laws. Our findings illustrate how different roles emphasize protections, harms, and word choice when communicating levers of change like civil rights protections in law to privacy design elements. This solidified the opportunities to better bridge policy and practice by outlining common and distinct bill themes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The internet is often portrayed somewhat paradoxically as both integral to the development of contemporary society and yet out of direct human control. A bio-evolutionary element frequently accompanies such techno-determinist rhetoric: the social transformation associated with the internet is a natural process and a force of human progress. In this autonomous-evolutionary understanding, debate about the role of the internet in society is largely irrelevant. Governments, industries, organisations, and citizens are simply advised to connect up to and keep up with the rapidly changing techno-sphere. Failing to adopt and adapt to the internet’s evolution will mean falling behind, or being left completely out of, the unfolding information society. Internet research and academic commentary sometimes resembles this techno-determinist rhetoric. Cyberspace is believed to bring about such radical changes to social relations that any previously useful concepts and under-standings are rendered obsolete. New tools of analysis and ways of thinking are needed. These will be revealed, so the argument goes, by the phenomena itself, rather than by way of the rational-critical processes of social investigation developed from investigations of offline life.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The term digital divide refers to disparities in digital access, infrastructure, and opportunities. However, it is important to recognize that information and communication technologies (ICTs) do not operate in isolation. They are influenced by social and structural factors. This study focuses on Tunisia and Morocco to examine access to and usage of digital technologies, factors shaping these patterns, and the impact of unequal access and usage on employment and socioeconomic well-being in the post-Arab Spring era. Using Afrobarometer household surveys from 2013 to 2022, encompassing 9595 respondents, we construct a digital inclusion index and disaggregate results to illustrate the dynamics of digital inequalities. We employ pooled logistic regression to explore the determinants of digital inclusion and examine how disparities shape well-being. Findings show improved digital inclusion in Morocco and Tunisia from 2013 to 2022, yet over 80% of their populations remain partially or entirely excluded. We confirm previous studies suggesting that digitalization mirrors or exacerbates preexisting inequalities, with gender, age, education, and socioeconomic status significantly influencing digital inclusion, indicating persistent inequalities and barriers. Our findings also have broader implications for the MENA region, emphasizing the need to address the complex interactions among sociodemographic factors, including gender, age, education, and socioeconomic disparities, in order to achieve equitable digital inclusion. </jats:p>",

This study sought to better understand LGBTQ+ adolescents’ and young adults’ (age 14–29) perceptions of OFCs regarding LGBTQ+ representation and community climate. Qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze open-ended survey questions from respondents in the United States and Canada ( n = 3665). Three primary themes emerged: (1) LGBTQ+ mass media narratives remained insufficient but were improving; (2) counternarratives produced within OFCs were even better; however, (3) the climate of OFCs created challenges and limitations, including to the quantity and quality of depictions of diverse LGBTQ+ identities. Findings indicate OFCs may take on simultaneous qualities of networked publics and counterpublics, allowing youth opportunities to contest LGBTQ+ mass media depictions and problematic representations within OFCs. </jats:p>",

The game played, Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, belongs to the author-designated ‘televisual’ sub-genre, remediating (Bolter and Grusin, 1999) aspects of televisual coverage such as the broadcast angle, action replays and commentary teams. We investigate the use of these games and their position within both gaming and sport culture. To do so we approach the player from four perspectives: dress, body language, argot (slang, group-specific dialect), and proxemics (examining how people spatially situate themselves in regard to one another within the social environment). These categories then combine to formulate the last section, ‘Social Play’, where we discuss the social meta-game being enacted between participants to barter social status, capital (Bourdieu, 1984) and specific gamer capital (Consalvo, 2007). </jats:p>",

Through an analysis of current trends in television, it examines the difficulty of applying traditional broadcasting policy norms, and how digital technology itself is far less important than the deregulation and commercialisation of the analogue broadcasting sector in recent years. The paper argues that strategies developed by public service broadcasters and policymakers at both a national and European Union level may not be sufficient to counter longer term threats to plurality and diversity. These threats stem from the lack of a clear role for the public sector and from the increasing domination of the emerging digital television market by a small number of companies, who are active across converging industry sectors, and who control the key chains of production and distribution. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Across a number of disciplines, hybridity is regularly invoked when two previously distinct elements – whether objects, concepts, frameworks, practices, models, mediums or institutions – are brought together. However, this is often done with a vague theoretical nod. Labeled a hybrid and left at the level of broad theory, scholarship has tended to ignore a critical issue: what happens when the disparate elements of a hybrid are introduced in practice? This conceptual paper takes the case of academic explanatory journalism, a nascent intentional collaborative practice between academic authors and journalist editors, in order to illustrate how the theoretical concept of hybridity plays out in practice. This particular case presents a number of opportunities and benefits within a Western democratic context. However, our examination highlights that without a more nuanced discussion of how hybridization plays out in real life, its potential benefits are compromised. We propose a five-step framework that can be applied to other examples of hybridity, across varied disciplines beyond media and communication studies. This five-step framework helps uncover the complications that might arise when disparate elements are hybridized, moving from theory into practice. The approach helps create the space and understanding needed to design solutions pre-emptively.</jats:p>",

In order to investigate one of the most developed areas of new media, a traditional feminist approach of explaining factors that exclude females from new media technologies was avoided in favour of a focus upon the experiences and attitudes of females who already view themselves as 'gamers'. Synonymous with 'grrl gamer' and 'game girlz' this paper uses the term 'girl gamer' to describe females who possess an aptitude for the games that currently define the contours of the gaming culture. In-depth interviews and ethnographic game-play observations conducted with a small sample revealed that 'girl gamers' possess an alternative playing orientation, style of play, the importance of cultural competency in game preference, as well as knowledge on the ways gaming is embedded in household dynamics. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "people, is a concept relevant to research on virtual worlds. As a medium, the strength of virtual worlds lies in multiple users interacting in the same platform through creating not only avatars, but also artifacts, dwellings and visual narratives. Crafting and making to connect with others who share one’s interest can provide a simple and thereby effective frame to look into virtual worlds. User-generated content in virtual worlds where participants connect around events that focus on producing virtual artifacts, such as machinima events, design competitions or other gatherings, are some of the activities that can exemplify how participants in virtual worlds in a number of ways also display connecting via making.",

    "abstract": "most recent collaboration, Times of the Technoculture, offers a sustained critique of technopopulist rhetoric. By and large the authors offer a lucid and polemical survey of contemporary theories, concepts and applications of new information technologies. As the title of the book indicates, Robins and Webster focus much of their attention on a diachronic appreciation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), in so doing attempting to debunk their mythic revolutionary power in the new millennium. Bill Gates is henceforth chided for being too ’friction free’ while Marshall McLuhan is admonished for his love of technological determinism. And while such figures are rightly critiqued for their contributions to an ahistorical view of technology, they have also clearly reached the status of straw man, or should I say fibre-man (that has been routinely taken apart, packet by packet). To be fair, this is probably more of a critique of the technoculture literature as a whole than Robins and Webster’s book per se. Yet, on the other hand, the authors",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In the film and television industry, many social movements as #MeToo, #BuryYourGay or #BlackLivesMatter have highlighted the necessity of better representations of marginalised communities on and off screen. As diversity and inclusion have become major issues in contemporary societies, video-on-demand (VOD) platforms have publicly committed to diversify representation in the films and series they produce and distribute. This article investigates how streaming platforms with different commercial or public interests and in different national contexts understand and promote diversity and inclusion through the analysis of paratext. Focussing on the visual analysis of thumbnails, we compare the French and Norwegian national public platforms (France TV and NRK TV) with the most popular commercial national platforms in each country (Canal + Series in France and Viaplay in Norway). The visibility and invisibility of gender, race, sexuality and (dis)ability on TV series’ thumbnails reveal certain national and platforms’ social, cultural and political values. By using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods including interviews conducted with industry professionals, we aim to highlight the impact of streaming platforms’ promotional practices on the (in)visibility of diversity. </jats:p>",

The study involved working with a group of 28 children aged 8 to 10 years. Data analyzed in this article are paper-based activities, semistructured interviews, and field notes. The article investigates dominant constructions of children as ‘not yet complete’ and as ‘active, knowing beings’ (Cook, 2005). These dichotomous constructions are explored across the literature concerning children and virtual world games, particularly in relation to online risks and opportunities. The analysis focuses on ways data collected for this project challenge constructions of children as either at risk or active and empowered. The analysis reveals that many children’s online engagements in virtual world games are casual (i.e. they are not investing time or money in the games) and structured by factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and Internet access. The article suggests that studies of children online need to distinguish between different digital childhoods, particularly in relation to research and policy suggestions.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "’By the time you read this letter, 1 may be dead. I have so much to tell ou and perhaps so little time. Will I ever send it? I don’t know.’ So begins Lisa Bernie’s final letter to the man she has loved all her life, whose child she has borne and who, for most of Max Ophuls’ film, Lefier from an Unknown Woman (USA 1948), cannot place the woman who has written to him. The film retells the story of Lisa’s all-consuming love for Stephan Brand, a sybarite who is so self-obsessed and casual in his affairs that he cannot recall this particular woman until it is too late. She has a beautiful child by him who, on the threshold of manhood, contracts typhoid and dies, ultimately infecting her too. Despite the gloomy story, those who know the film can vouch for its passionate (if misplaced) optimism; throughout we are never once asked to pity Lisa, save for the time when she is taken away from Vienna (and Stephan) by her mother and stepfather. Ophuls, working with Howard Koch on the screenplay, altered the location of Lisa’s terrible exile into middle-class mediocrity from Innsbruck to Linz in northern Austria. This change might well have been an act of revenge on the city that had nurtured Aldolf Eichmann, and was selected by Hitler as the place for his retirement after his work on the world had been done. Notwithstanding this, since 1979 Linz has been the home of the Ars Electronica Festival, and for the last 15 years has hosted the Prix Ars Electronica sponsored by ORF (www.prixars.orf.at). Moreover, since 1996 Linz has been the home of a permanent collection of interactive",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research delves into the digital reproductions of a specific monument in locative media employing Walter Benjamin’s conceptual framework presented in ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility’. The monument in question, namely, the recently reconstructed and rescaled Atatürk, His Mother and Women’s Right Monument in İzmir, Turkey serves as an exemplary case for examining the reproducibility of monuments within both physical and digital environments. Its significance lies not only in the ongoing political and scholarly debate revolving around the decision of local municipality to undertake its reconstruction, but also in its growing popularity in social media as a consequence of this debate. The analyses of digital reproductions of the monument in the paper are twofold: The first gives insights into the effects of digital reproductions on the aura and authenticity of the monument in locative media. The second focuses on how the local municipality and individual users instrumentalize these productions to perform official and mundane rituals and aestheticize not only their own political agendas but also their everyday life. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Towards the Preservation of Local Computer Game Software",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> / New Zealand's digital game history includes a significant quantity of locally written software titles from the 1980s. Currently, few people are aware of this, no institutional collections exist, and institutional preservation efforts are directed elsewhere. This context prompted the assembly of a multidisciplinary team of researchers to bring legal, technical, and media-historical expertise to bear on these titles' preservation. This article briefly introduces the game preservation landscape, before outlining the case for the preservation of local game software. It reports on the challenges faced in a pilot study to preserve locally written game software for the Sega SC3000 computer. The initial plan — to secure licence agreements that would, in turn, enable technical preservation — gave way as a more complex intertwining of the legal and technical emerged. Navigating these challenges required a change of strategy: from emulation to translation. Translation — from BASIC to Java — is an elegant solution, in the circumstances. As well as recounting the project's practical realization, this article considers the fidelity of the conserved digital game to its `original'. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The emergence of virtual production – a research agenda",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Virtual production is increasingly seen as a way to make film and television more efficiently by harnessing the power of game engines to create unique locations and sets, offer directors more flexibility, and to cut carbon emissions. But while the technologies at the centre of virtual production are not new, their combination into filmmaking pipelines is in its infancy and the field is evolving fast. Indeed, so rapid is its evolution that pinning down what virtual production is, or might become, is a challenge in itself. What is clear, however, is that the approach is seen as an important element of filmmaking that is here to stay. In this article, we outline the emergence of virtual production and constituent technologies to pin down its current form. We also examine the emergent orthodoxies about what virtual production can do, what it can’t do and what it might allow filmmakers to do in the future. We finish the article by outlining a research agenda for further work on virtual production for scholars interested in its technologies, impact on working practices, how it might impact equality, diversity and equality agendas, and its implications for existing and emerging skills gaps across the film and TV industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The surveillant capacities of smart phones have generated an array of safety apps targeting cis female users. Current feminist scholarship studies these apps from a variety of disciplinary perspectives that stress their detractors, namely, that they are largely ineffective and that they instead burden the user with the labor of continuous assessment of oneself and one’s surroundings. This article acknowledges the apps’ numerous failings while at the same time turning attention to the surveilled, responsible, projected user they reproduce in order to tease out some of the internal contradictions and nuances of this figure and its place in digital culture. The study samples a number of safety apps that focus on gender violence in public spaces and finds that the apps solicit a form of gendered labor which asks largely cis women users to work towards ‘feelings’ of safety. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents how assemblage theory, as taken from Deleuze and Guattari, can be used to understand the intensive approaches of startup accelerators in supporting startup companies. Through a study of a startup accelerator in Jakarta, Indonesia, we present three snapshots to exemplify manifestations of what we argue as the accelerator’s “ seed accelerator” form of content and “ seed funding” form of expression as well as their reciprocal presupposition to demonstrate the multiplicity of assemblage as the organizational principles of the accelerator. Employing the tenets of formalization and territorialization from assemblage theory to analyze the results, this article shows that the “ seed accelerator” form of content is manifested by way of how the accelerator’s bodies of its human elements, activities, events, and infrastructure relate and interconnect throughout the accelerator’s 12-week program towards its end point, that is, fulfilling the stakes for the Final Demo-Day, while, on the other hand, the “ seed funding” form of expression is manifested by way of the usage of terms related to fund-raising, expressions of worry, and the expectations of the hub management and the VC in preparing the startups for the next level of funding. Moreover, we argue that the formalized function of the accelerator assemblage is to intensively seed scalable startups. This assemblage analysis thus offers an interrelational perspective regarding startup accelerators, and demonstrates the value of formalization and territorialization in assemblage theory to understand the programming arrangements in a startup accelerator. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This qualitative study examines how the spring 2020 COVID-19 restriction measures impacted adults’ gaming in Finland. The study draws on a thematic analysis of qualitative data ( N = 201) collected in April 2020, which is explored through the lens of Apperley’s (2010) theory of gaming rhythms. The results illuminate the ways in which gaming was situated in everyday life both during and before the COVID-19 restrictions, and how the pandemic and its associated restrictions disrupted, reinforced, and reconfigured the everyday rhythms of gaming. The situation impacted individuals and families differently, being beneficial to some and detrimental to others, contingent on other aspects of respondents’ lives. The results underline how an individual’s gaming does not happen in isolation, but takes place in the confines of everyday life, shaped by factors outside the individual’s control. Developing Apperley’s theory, the results show that gaming can be a very resilient activity, given the right circumstances. </jats:p>",

The V-chip will likely limit choices for most users as a result of the ideological commitment to 'family values' underlying its practical implementation. Invested in the V-chip's technological and discursive construction are processes of regulation designed to determine the representational limits of television texts, prescribe the formation of familial identities and the arrangement of domestic relations, and reproduce social norms.

    "title": "Different diversities: Policies and practices at three European public service VoD services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> While globally operating SVoDs have discovered identity-based diversity as a branding strategy, diversity has a longer history and broader meaning in public service media (PSM) tied to the foundational ideals of universality and pluralism that oblige PSM to speak to all members of a society and to offer diverse programmes and viewpoints. We investigate: How are these two understandings of ‘diversity’ expressed 1) in legal and policy requirements to the PSM, 2) in strategy papers and audits issued by PSM, 3) in the presentation and exposure of content in VoD interfaces? And 4) How can PSMs' practice around diversity on VoD be tracked methodologically? The article examines these questions by comparing: BBC iPlayer (UK), DRTV (Denmark) and ARD Mediathek (Germany). A document analysis examines how legal remits and strategies governing these institutions talk about diversity. We analyse the presentation and exposure of ‘diversity’ in VoD content via longitudinal datasets that document the three VoD landing pages daily between early 2022 and late 2023, recording the position of every programme title at the VoDs’ front pages, as well as deck titles. We test four approaches to this dataset: Spotting diversity in deck titles, looking for content tagged as diverse on IMDb and by Chat GPT, calculating diversity of exposed content with the Gini-Simpson-Index and assessing diversity through a manual coding of deck titles and sampling content displayed in selected decks. The article shows how differently diversity can be conceptualised and operationalised in VoD practice and concludes that multi-dimensional methodological approaches are needed. This article is a report on different publishing strategies for ‘diversity content’ in PSM VoD interfaces; a discussion of the conflicting relation between public service ideals and the notion of identity-based ‘branded diversity' of globally operating VoDs; and a contribution to developing methods for monitoring diversity on VoD. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Prior to the 2004 season, pitcher Curt Schilling was traded to the Boston Red Sox baseball team. During trade negotiations, Schilling visited a web-based fan site of the team, and chatted with Red Sox fans. His visit was covered by sports radio and newspaper. Schilling discussed his visit with a sports radio show, where the hosts were not happy that he used the Internet instead of radio. Schilling’s actions make for an interesting real-world case involving media gatekeeping, where different media are intertwined, and where theory can be built from the observation of practice. Schilling used different media depending on his task, and chose media best suited to his purpose. Fans were delighted he chose the web, giving them direct access, but radio hosts felt threatened. Gatekeeping was found to be still useful for identity verification and access control. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "ing’), or electronics assembly. The authors’ privileging of programmers clears one fruitful path onto this terrain. Racing the Beam closes with an ‘Afterword on Platform Studies’, which provides further methodology. The authors ‘distinguish five levels that characterize how the analysis of digital media has been focused – each of which, by itself, connects to contexts of culture in important ways’ – reception/operation, interface, form/function, code, and platform (p. 145). It remains unclear why each level is cordoned off from ‘culture’, but the afterword indicates what makes platform studies so significant. The method departs from the rhetoric of ‘new media studies’, which inscribes in the discipline’s name a dubiously depth-oriented theory of mediation. By contrast, platform studies pursues formal analysis with materialist grounding. Thanks to the work of Montfort, Bogost, and fellow travelers, the notion of an image as having some numinous ‘content’ dissolves into readings of how specific devices function. Racing the Beam provides an instructive example of this refreshing direction in ‘media’ criticism, and it introduces a series that promises many valuable platform studies.",

    "abstract": "Almost ten years after the revolutionary changes of 1989, this special issue of Convergence focuses on the recent cultural, social and political implications of new media technologies in the post-socialist countries of Eastern, Central and South-Eastern Europe. One of the first lessons to be learned as the Iron Curtain rose was that the east bloc was hardly a bloc at all in the sense of a homogeneous, solid whole. Strategies and forms of media culture were quite different in the individual countries due to the varying possibilities of access to new media (eg video cameras, computers, xerox machines, etc) as well as the varying degrees to which independent mass media and ’divergent’ opinions were tolerated. While, for example, the subcultural or alternative scene in Yugoslavia especially in Slovenia had been working with video since the early 1980s, the situation in Czechoslovakia, the GDR, or Romania’ was entirely different because access to the technologies was not possible, for either political or economic reasons. In the past few years, new media centres and initiatives have been set up in several post-socialist countries in Eastern Europe. They focus on various forms of media culture and internet projects and are increasingly taking an active role in global digital culture 2",

    "abstract": "through to the more empirical Mitra’s ’Virtual communality: Looking for India on the Internet’. Section nine approaches the subject of colonialism and globalisation through cyber-culture. Topics such as the Saidian Orient, Westernism, race and the nation state are examined. Here the ideas broached at the start as to whether cyber-culture is a technologically enabled culture, in some way autonomous from mainstream culture or whether it is an aspect of mainstream culture are given further airing. Nakamura’s paper on racial identity tourism ’Race in/for Cyberspace’ sits well with Stratton’s account of the globalising aspects of cyberspace, ’Cyberspace and the Globalization of Culture’ and Sardar’s ’ALT.CIVILIZATIONS.FAQ’ presents an account of the dystopian prospect of cyberspace. As with any collection of readings all the works have been previously available in some format and some in several. The skill in this volume, however, can be seen in the grouping of the readings and the intelligent and insightful introductions that preface each section. It is these overviews and the groupings of the works that add value to the highly useful collection of the papers into one volume. The groupings provide an anchor or framework for analysis above and beyond specific subject approaches. However, this framework did seem to suffer from some notable absences, particularly both Mark Poster and Kathleen Hales are absent. Such post-structural (or post-human) positions would certainly have benefited the ’Post-(cyber)bodies’ section. This aside the volume’s structure provides an excellent approach to the diverse nature of the fields of study; who knows, perhaps in such a collection of papers from different disciplines a new coherence of approach can be found.

    "title": "Navigating sociotechnical spaces: Comparing computer games and sat navs as digital spatial media",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital media increasingly mediate everyday spatial and navigational practices. From in-car satellite navigation (sat navs) to computer games, overpowered gadgets are combining multiple sources of abstract information to give users spatial guidance and experiences of movement. For example, open world computer games such as Grand Theft Auto IV render rich fictional spaces, and include intricate maps and indicators that allow players to navigate large gamespaces. Sat navs such as the TomTom Navigator follow similar practices of automated navigation in helping to guide cars through actual spaces. Their calculated routes display on personalized maps, including live data and visualizations that complement, or even override, what the driver sees through the windscreen. Games and sat navs are harbingers of historical shifts in technosocial space, suggesting that Henri Lefebvre’s (1991) influential critical analysis of space deserves to be revised. Digital spatial media open up abstract relationships to space, but not from the distance that Lefebvre associates with ‘conceived’ spaces. Instead, they work in ‘lived space’, which is becoming dominant. They calculate space in real time, and open up new political and aesthetic questions. The article examines three characteristics of navigation with digital spatial media: (1) they reify routes as persuasive data and procedures; (2) their maps become subjective and privatized; and (3) they offer an array of spatial information that become incorporated into the user’s ‘perceived’ space. These examples show that critical understandings of social space need increasingly to incorporate readings of digitally mediated spatiality. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "This is an essay about bodies and technologies which culminates in a reading of the ’technological body’ from a feminist perspective grounded in contemporary culture. I would like to present it as a ’snapshot’ point in time and as the starting point of a continuing pursuit. It is an attempt to follow feminist theorist Donna Haraway, in an examination of the cyborg body and cyborg body politics as a possible new feminist construction. Does Haraway’s work allow us to begin to articulate Stone’s ’New Creature’ as a promising hybrid embodiment for new feminist theory?",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Mobile media, especially cellphones, are now seen and heard everywhere, forming an intrinsic part of the daily lives and habits of billions of people worldwide. Curiously, despite this wide diffusion and remarkable rate of adoption, as an advertising platform the cellphone is, in the words of one commentator, still very much ‘a mass medium waiting for the kiss of life’. This article examines why this is the case, by exploring the ‘complex mobile phone ecosystem’ and the factors that contribute to the rather hesitant adoption of mobile advertising, with particular attention to the inherent conflicts amongst the interested parties in the system. It does this through a meta-analysis of themes and issues evinced in mainstream media and the advertising trade press. Study of this data is supplemented by drawing on a number of critical studies within the available research literature on the subject. </jats:p>",

    "title": "An audience studies’ contribution to the discoverability and prominence debate: Seeking UK TV audiences’ ‘routes to content’",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite discoverability and prominence emerging as crucial to contemporary industry and policy debates in relation to online and internet-distributed television, there remains relatively little rich, qualitative data about how contemporary audiences discover content. This article addresses this gap through empirical audience research focused on the ‘routes to content’ through which UK audiences find and decide what television to watch. Defining television broadly to include all forms of video content accessed in the home, we argue for the importance of thinking about discoverability as an audience activity, not just an industrial strategy. Building on TV audience studies’ longer history and more recent literature on engagement, media literacy, algorithms and technological affordances in contemporary media platforms, we argue for new understanding of the imaginaries shaping people’s habitual viewing activities. The article proposes four new concepts for thinking about discoverability as an audience activity. First, we explore technological affordances and default behaviour, developing the concept of the negotiated-null affordance to explain how technological affordances can be rendered invisible by habitual behaviours. Second, we focus on algorithmic literacies and propose a new dissonant algorithmic imaginary to explain our participants’ ambivalences towards algorithmic personalisation. Third, we unpack the dynamics of access that emerge in our participants’ negotiations of television technologies, services and content. Fourth, we examine the role of word of mouth and promotional paratexts, theorising a second-order algorithmic imaginary to help us understand how these forms of communication can often, themselves, be subject to algorithmic processes. In doing so, we argue for the need for further qualitative research that looks beyond the ‘savvy’ consumers that dominate audience research in order to unpack the technological, industrial, cultural and social processes that shape people’s routes to content in a platform-dominated media landscape. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The internet offers teens (especially girls, who have embraced social aspects of the web) a voice in the books they read, from reviewing, blogging, and creating fan sites, to actually collaborating on books-in-progress — such as The Amanda Project — by writing portions of the book or suggesting storylines. But while these new means of participation are seemingly empowering for teenage girls, is this participation a form of empowerment, or is it merely a way for publishers to exploit teens’ labor to create commodified cultural products which they in turn can sell back to the teens who helped shape them? In an era of user-generated content, this article examines how teens’ affective labor as peer-to-peer-marketers and content creators is changing the transmedia cultural products created for them. </jats:p>",

As a parallel discursive arena (see Fraser, 1995; Hauser, 1998), the Sydney Graffiti Archive infiltrates and transgresses normative conceptions of place and cultural narratives through the formation and circulation of unofficial visual discourses embedded in graffiti photographs. This article evaluates the place of the archive as a heuristic device and heterotopic entity and encourages new ways of seeing illicit graffiti, and other everyday digital cultures of commemoration, in that it reshapes present relations to the past through photographic reframing, image digitization, interface design and user engagement. Essentially, this research is about hacking into, recovering and honouring graffiti’s discursive sites to reimagine graffiti’s place as digital heritage. </jats:p>",

The research utilises Albert Bandura’s concept of moral disengagement to analyse the game’s content and its reception on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. By assessing how the game frames moral considerations through its narrative and gameplay, this study reveals the potential of digital games to affect player perceptions and contribute to the broader media landscape surrounding political issues. The analysis also explores the reception and re-interpretation of the game by players and content creators, thus offering insights into the complex interplay between video game content, ideological influence, and audience engagement. </jats:p>",

Paul McCartney's December 1999 show at the Cavern in Liverpool, UK, took webcasting beyond specialist users. The show was staged for mass exposure and timed for net transmission. On and off-line publicity naturalised it by making tenuous comparisons to original Beatles gigs and commenting on the size of the subsequent internet 'audience'. 'Little Big Gig', as McCartney's show became known, encouraged the further disappearance of 'live' events into the realm of mediation. In short, the penetration of webcasting and the digital commodification of pop was encouraged by offering established content. </jats:p>",

This study found four conditions present when the audience converged. The conditions were a spark, or ignition event, that has the potential to arouse dialogue, journalism that makes the broader public aware of such an event, a sufficient mass of audience commentary to create debate, and a channel through which the debate can occur. This process represents a convergence of different public spheres, where audiences overlap and interact across platforms, taking with them bits and pieces from other public spheres to create a new one, a converged conversation. Further, this study found that audience convergence stayed within the confines of the journalism channels that offered initial coverage of the event, suggesting journalism as a key element in the creation of such a space, but, once created, journalism is no longer the curator. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Consuming the illegal",
    "abstract": "Considerations of media consumption typically focus upon the relationships fostered via economic exchange for the purposes of receiving a service, such as a licence fee, a subscription fee, or some other single-use cost. However, the growth of alternative electronic distribution channels enabled via the Internet have presented a number of challenges and opportunities for all involved, be the media organisations, artists, or consumers. Digitisation of media content, coupled with increased connectivity between individuals, has acted as a fertile breeding ground for the emergence of unofficial distribution of media and its subsequent consumption. The increasing affordability of technology that allows users to alter, modify, remix, or create their own content before sharing that across the network poses a range of problems to those groups who seek to control how content is accessed, distributed, and appropriated, especially if their ownership rights have been compromised in some manner. Anxieties of this type were manifested in several high-profile legal battles between the recorded music industry and music consumers in the United States (e.g. Virgin/Capitol v. Thomas, Sony BMG Music Entertainment v. Tenenbaum), after individuals were caught sharing music files across peer-to-peer networks. Many subsequent discussions of illicit media consumption tended to concern themselves with economic predictions regarding the future livelihood of the content industries. Much has been made of the potential threat posed by networked digital distribution to the established interests and business practices of the culture industries. Lobbying on behalf of the content industries by powerful groups with deep pockets – such as the Motion Pictures Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), and so on – has produced a particularly skewed picture of the ‘problem’. This often features huge numbers, whether they are speculative estimates about the damage caused by piracy cannibalising sales or the estimated damages expected from a successful court ruling. Indeed, in March 2011, it was estimated that the peer-to-peer network Limewire owed the RIAA",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> / This article addresses the speculative role of digital preservation from the standpoint of convergent literatures. `Cross-sited narratives', multimodal stories told across media channels, are introduced here as a specific mode of narrative instrumentality. It is argued that contemporary models of the archive structured on organizational models such as genetic criticism and on preservational models such as emulation and migration are not equipped to handle cross-sited works, as they are premised on mono-media sensibilities. Primarily exploring Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves (2000) and Neil Young's Greendale (2003), two works that resist digitization both materially and thematically, the claim is made that although there are no functional models that might accommodate either of these productions, by speculating about their future we not only can obtain a better understanding of the implicit assumptions of digital preservation, but also of cross-siting itself. </jats:p>",

News organisations have been experimenting with the idea of interactivity for more than a decade; with the emergence of the World Wide Web, they have begun aggressively exploring and developing ’interactive’ on-line services. The reason is simple. News executives believe such services will become increasingly important to the bottom line and perhaps a threat to their traditional print or broadcast products.2",

In this article we apply Benjamin’s concept of aura to new (digital) media, and in particular to ‘mixed reality’, a group of technologies that blend computer-generated visual, aural, and textual information into the user’s physical environment. We argue that mixed reality increases the options for designer-artists and apparently allows the invocation of aura in new ways. Our culture’s pursuit of auratic experience remains problematic in mixed reality as it was for Benjamin in the case of film. New media maintain aura in a permanent state of oscillation or crisis, and this crisis is a key to understanding new media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>/ In media cultures of late, the synergy between two global dominant industries — mobile communication and gaming — has attracted much attention and stargazing. As part of burgeoning global media cultures, gaming and mobile media are divergent in their adaptation at the level of the local. In some locations where broadband infrastructure is strong and collectivity is emphasized (such as South Korea), online multiplayer games prevail. In locations where convergent mobile technologies govern (such as Japan), mobile gaming platforms dominate. In order to address the uneven adoption and definitions of mobile gaming, this paper will focus on the convergence between mobile technologies and gaming in the Asia-Pacific. By focusing on a phenomenon that prevails in both realms and cute culture, this paper will also consider how consumption and production of new technologies are conceptualized in the region. This paper argues that by looking at the phenomenon of cute culture, we can gain insight into the divergent definitions of gaming and mobility in the region, which in turn reflect the continuing localized nature of contemporary global culture.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a 'world' which is 'navigated'; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement that slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary human-computer interface (HCI): (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of 'interactivity' itself. To explore these issues, we built an infrared (IR) multi-camera machine vision system that constructs a volumetric model of the whole of the user's body in real time. We have also developed custom thee-dimensional vision tools, graphical techniques and a range of techniques for generating and managing semi-autonomous agents in immersive environments. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Ports and patches: Digital games as unstable objects",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem for curators and archivists of digital games is that the games are inherently unstable. As a range of commentators have explored, gameplay in digital games often takes quite unexpected, unpredictable and emergent directions as players probe at the boundaries of rules and systems. For those engaged in the archiving, curation and exhibition of digital games, a clear challenge comes from the contingency of playing preferences, and that various ‘playings’ might be differently informed by prefigurative and regulatory materials such as walkthroughs, FAQs and reviews. However, before we get to considerations of the ways it is (re)configured through the performance of play, in fact regardless of whether it is ever played at all, we should recognise that a digital game is a potentially changing, unstable object. In fact, it is typically better thought of as a growing and mutating collection of many objects. This article centres less on ideas of performance or the changing nature of the game at play but rather concentrates on the instability of the fabric of the game to-be-played-with. As media that are routinely ported (transferred and translated) to different operating systems and platforms with differing hardware and software capabilities, and patched (updated to fix bugs or modify gameplay mechanics), digital games simply cannot be conceived of as static objects or texts. To demonstrate the impact of porting and patching on the instability of digital games, this article draws on an analysis of Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog series. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Printing is not a new media technology, but it is continuously being renewed. In this sense, it is an example of novelty going largely unnoticed, woven into the quotidian and ordinary in unassuming ways. One reason for this is the incomplete way we tell the story of printed paper, which privileges narratives of readings, access, and dissemination. To complicate the way media scholars think printing, this article turns to the case of security printing, which produces objects like banknotes and passports that circulate with trust and authority. Here, printing emerges through the specific need to print securely, offering a narrative based on the need for order and protection. The work of security printing, always straddling between art and science, produces artefacts understood as authentic copies. Such a transformation of paper into valuable object relies on the technical artistry of the security printer, who sets the aesthetic and material standards of authenticity through physical features like watermarks, engravings, holographs, special substrates, threads, or inks. Drawing on a close reading of informational materials produced by the major actors of today’s security printing industry, this article explains how the need to print better than the (counterfeiting) competition fuels the need for novelty in the how of printing. It expands on three guiding principles that work in unison to keep printing on paper new: printing as material science, as complex composition, and as the display of matchless quality. Ultimately, this material quality of securely printed papers helps us think about the new in a way that is not tied up to the digital, so that security printing both complicates the way media scholars engage with printing and offers a reconsideration of the ways we categorize and theorize the differences between media ‘old’ and ‘new’. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of short message services (SMS) on mobile phones has gained huge popularity in most western and many developing countries — so much so that it has become established as the preferred medium for mobile communication especially among young people. This article explores SMS as used for discreet communication between people in the same physical space (‘shared physical space SMS’ — or ‘SPS-SMS’). Drawing from semi-structured interviews with young people in Norway, 10 different scenarios of SPS-SMS use are explored and analysed within an interactionist framework. These sites of SPS-SMS are presented here as ‘communicative affordances’. It is concluded that the mobile phone, by the application of SPS-SMS, affords communicative layers of transparency, by which various SMS users maintain semi-synchronous communication, both for care and coordination. Although a qualitative study of this nature does not lend itself to generalizations about SPS-SMS communication, it does demonstrate how detailed studies of extraordinary uses of mediated communication may be used to widen analyses of social interaction. </jats:p>",

But research regarding intimacies in both disciplines has yet to fully account for the connection between sound and normativity, which is essential to podcasting and important to mediated intimacies more broadly. In this article, we mobilise scholarship from these two fields to analyse the award-winning music podcast Song Exploder. Our study highlights that attending to intimacies in podcasting involves both analysing how the story structure aligns with social norms and listening critically to the ways the sound design and audio editing complements and complicates these intimate stories. We contend that identifying the intersection of sound and normativity in this podcast contributes to understanding the cultural work of podcasting and underscores the key role of sound in mediated intimacies.</jats:p>",

Drawing on data from more than five years of ethnographic fieldwork amongst ‘AAA’ videogame development studios, the specific case of Spider-Man 3’s development is used as a lens for understanding the complexity of modern media production practice. This case sheds light on our understandings of cross-media development practice and the labor involved in the effect of media ‘flow’ from platform to platform. Actor-Network Theory serves as a guiding analytic framework for understanding how videogame production in this context, given the sheer number of actors, has significant implications for the kinds of cross-media products created and the labor involved in bringing these projects to fruition. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The binge-watcher’s journey: Investigating motivations, contexts, and affective states surrounding Netflix viewing",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The growth of Internet-distributed TV services has transformed video consumption, enhancing the level of control that viewers have over what they watch. Along with the release of entire seasons of programming at once, this has led to the phenomenon of ‘binge-watching’, in which several episodes of a program are viewed in one sitting. This article presents the results of a novel exploratory study focused on 40 Netflix viewing sessions from 11 millennials in their homes. Methodologically, we employed a novel mixed-methods approach that combines objective data (collected through a browser extension) and subjective data (collected via questionnaires completed before and after viewing). This novel approach allowed us to describe the binge-watcher’s experience in a holistic fashion. Results suggest that binge-watching is an individual activity mainly performed at the end of the day to relax, for boredom relief purposes, or for escapism. Furthermore, a binge-watching session lasts for an average of 2 h and 10 min, and variations on binge-watchers’ affective states were identified after Netflix exposure. Participants’ levels of valence (unhappy–happy) significantly decreased after binge-watching; their positive affect values increased primarily after watching sci-fi, while their negative affect values decreased after watching comedy and slightly increased after watching drama. However, the levels of arousal (relaxed–stimulated) remained the same. This study extends our current understanding of binge-watching in terms of viewer motivations, how it affects their viewing experiences, and participants’ subjective affective states. The investigation contributes, thus, to a relatively new domain of research concerned with the understanding of binge-watching behavior of serialized TV fiction. </jats:p>",

A total of 142 children’s essays and lists of their metagame activities were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The children’s metagame activities included game-enabling activities, strategizing activities, discussing activities, information-seeking activities, creating and sharing activities, and consuming activities.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The rapidly evolving nature of emerging technologies renders artworks made using such technologies a challenging category of objects to be handled by institutions. This paper presents real scenarios of how art made with Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) is acquired, exhibited and finally preserved by museums and art institutions, presenting a clear picture of a particular period. Though an extensive body of literature and studies deal with the preservation of ‘New Media’, very few focus on the challenges faced by museums and private institutions when it comes to artworks that use VR/AR. We used in-depth interviews with eight museum professionals working in six key institutions that engage with VR/AR artworks, and four artists, who create such works, in order to define current institutional practices, understand the challenges museum professionals face when dealing with VR/AR artworks, and identify the preservation-related concerns of artists working with these technologies. </jats:p>",

It engages in social-semiotic analyses of the selfies clicked at instaworthy cafes and pubs in Kolkata to highlight how the photographic performativity of selfie-taking reconfigures the notions of placemaking. It accounts for: how is an ‘instaworthy’ spot made and consumed? What ramifications does showcasing the self within these specific sites have upon perceptions of identity, both of the self and the space in question? In locating photographic practices of selfies within the wider shifts of the heuristics of ‘instaworthiness’, this article teases out how the self interacts with a diverse range of non-human actors toward conferring visual apartness upon certain spaces. Thus, producing and circulating selfies as a performance warrant thinking through how discourses of the self and that of spatiality co-constitute each other. </jats:p>",

Theoretically, the digital divide is closely related to conceptualisations, and the considerable past research, on the knowledge gap hypothesis. The digital divide is the gap that exists between individuals advantaged by the internet and those individuals relatively disadvantaged by the internet. Here we synthesise available findings about socio-economic and other characteristics of individuals who are users and non-users of the internet, explore data about whether the digital divide is widening, and discuss strategies for bridging the digital divide. We suggest that the access-divide, which has received the most attention to date, may eventually be replaced by a learning- divide, a content-divide, and by other types of divides through which the internet will continue to advantage certain individuals, and disadvantage others. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Remediation is one example of an intermedia theory. If intermedia is about the relationships between media forms, remediation constitutes a specific reading of that relationship. Remediation is concerned with the cultural or economic competition of various media forms. The competition takes the form of a dispute over the 'real' or authentic - not, of course, in any metaphysical sense, but rather in terms of how our culture (or segments of our culture) define the authenticity of experience offered by each of these media forms. Remediation offers a way of understanding how the borrowing of formal elements takes on cultural significance. Remediation could therefore serve as a 'bridge theory', showing that formal and cultural theories of media can be seen as two aspects of the same phenomenon. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Cynical technical practice: From AI to APIs",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we examine how critical thinking, methods and design are used within the tech industry, using Philip Agre’s notion of critical technical practice (CTP) to consider the rise of ‘cynical’ technical practice. Arguments by tech firms that their AI systems are ethical, contextual, situated or fair, as well as APIs that are privacy-compliant and offer greater user control, are now commonplace. Yet, these justifications routinely disguise the organisational, and economic, reasons for the development of technical systems and features. The article considers how different forms of ‘technical critique’ are used by technical practitioners such as software engineers, applying Agre’s work on CTP, AI planning, grammars of action and empowerment to evaluate, and contextualise these justifications. As Agre understood, technical practitioners are not necessarily ‘a-critical’ or ‘uncritical’ in their approach to the design of technological systems or methods, but ordinarily compare the utility or performance of such according to a golden ethic: ‘does it work?’. Drawing on Agre’s studies of AI in the 1990s, the article considers how and what Agre considered to be the ‘Cartesian soul’ of AI research, on linguistic structuralism, and continues to frame much work within the wider tech industry today. Yet increasingly, as the article shows, ‘narrow’ and cynical forms of technical criticality are being used to legitimise, and publicise, corporate strategies of tech firms, whether through the development of AI systems by automotive start-ups such as Comma, or the management of relations with external developers through APIs, in the case of Facebook. Rather than judging the moral character of technical practitioners, however, the article offers an approach – via the work of Philip Agre – to examine how critical thinking is used, and often abused, within and beyond the tech industry. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This research reveals how social media advances gender responsiveness in the context of China’s digital transformation by exploring ride-hailing services, a fast-growing though often under-regulated sector. Specifically, the rise of ride-hailing has been accompanied by incidents of sexual harassment and gender-based violence, leading to social media outrage. Building on Habermas’s concept of the public sphere, this study – perhaps the first to explore the gender dynamics of ride-hailing policymaking in China – centers on the notion of digital public sphere. This study investigates how citizens, corporations, and government agencies have markedly differed in their discourses on gender and safety. Results exhibit that as corporations and government agencies seek technological and legislative solutions to improve safety, Chinese citizen-based activism efforts have amplified gendered perspectives, addressing gender-responsive policymaking. These actors generate discourses that echo various strands of feminism and further cultivate the policy trajectory, including pressuring government agencies to enforce the social accountability of private corporations. This research addresses a pragmatic perspective to demonstrate how liberal, socialist, and cultural feminisms coexist and negotiate in China’s digital public sphere. It aims to enhance one’s understanding of online civic engagement and resulting policy change in contemporary China, enriching the public sphere theory with emerging technology under a contentious political context. </jats:p>",

    "title": "A feel for the game: Exploring gaming ‘experience’ through the case of sports-themed video games",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Video gaming is often understood and narrated as an ‘experience’, and we would suggest that this is particularly notable with sports-themed video games. However, we would argue that how the game experience is curated and consumed, and how this relates to wider social process and forces, is rarely given any detailed consideration within the existing game research literature. Hence, this article explores how game experiences can be understood and articulated around four key themes. First, we begin with the argument that video games connect with, but also lead, a wider social trend: understanding social reality as a set of designed experiences. The real is progressively becoming a repository of technologically mediated experiences, and the logic of video games is anticipating this process. Second, we suggest video games are translations of phenomenological worlds: When successful, key aspects of the meaning of things remain similar even as one moves between spaces, domains, mediums and platforms. Developers often seek to bring others’ experiences into a game environment, such as translating the geography and mechanisms of sporting locations and competitions into a game environment. Third, following this translation of meaning across domains, gamers often narrate their encounters with video games as they would with any other experience, such as winning the Champions League in Football Manager becomes recounted by gamers like any other achievement. Fourth, video games are interactive and explicit bodily experiences because they must be enacted in order to exist. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Players in the European market have developed a series of transnational collaborations and practices in the cross-border production and distribution of audio-visual content, media ownership, regulation and audience reception. Transnational subscription video-on-demand platforms have also visibly increased their investments in original content, in their attempt to expand and maintain their international subscriber bases. Among them, Netflix has been particularly active in investing in European markets. This article traces the evolution of Netflix investments in European original scripted series produced between 2012 and 2020 and analyses the platform’s investment strategies in European markets through the lens of transnational television theory. The findings point to various elements of transnationalisation, placing European originals at the intersection between local and global, through market dynamics, strategic collaborations and content with transnational appeal. The findings also confirm the growing importance of rights retention and premium content offerings through the increase of big-budget commissions, particularly in developed European markets. </jats:p>",

In contrast to player-to-player games in which both players can take action in real time without fixed turns, the closed ecosystems of action- adventure console games tend to articulate player-to-game interactivity. Within the context of a longitudinal study into the nature of players' relationships with action-adventure games, a contradiction between design-intent and player-treatment was observed that constituted a natural component of a game's life-cycle. Video footage taken within the social contexts in which play is actualised revealed instances in which participants transformed one-player games into an effective and highly structured social hybrid of game-play. A single case study is provided of a natural occurrence of collaborative play with the console version of the game Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain (Eidos). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes ‘Boomer Remover’ the controversial term for COVID-19 popularized on social media in early 2020. It mobilizes digital media theory and discourse analysis to ask what makes Boomer Remover acceptable for its users. It conceptualizes Boomer Remover as an internet meme and argues that memes use intertextuality (the way new texts build upon older texts) as a core mechanism of meaning making. This allows the meme form to communicate a high-level of complexity and depth in an easily consumed format, however, it also bifurcates audiences as a meme is understood differently depending on the audience member’s familiarity with reference points. This article analyzes these divergent understandings through a framework of ‘discourse communities’. It unpacks how for a discourse community familiar with internet memes the term has come to be connected with progressive politics, and contrasts this with readings of Boomer Remover as ageist attack for those unfamiliar with the memetic contexts. Rather than privilege one reading of the Boomer Remover meme as correct, this article shows that in order to understand the social impact of memes, we must recognize their inherent polysemic nature. </jats:p>",

This paper explores the design of such a tailored methodology for investigating the value-driven development of online public service media platforms in Germany. While qualitative methodologies are time- and resource-consuming and digital methods leave out less context to the field, this mixed methodology emphasizes the context and invests in collecting thick data. It encompasses multiple stages of recording and mapping that employ qualitative and quantitative approaches to bring together various vignettes, unveiling complementary context and contradictory accounts with the help of visualization. In each mapping and visualization stage, the paper investigates actors and relationships heuristically and emphasizes the work-in-progress nature of mapping regarding platforms. </jats:p>",

Research addressing ‘Arab Spring’ upheavals and Islamic military movements has demonstrated grassroots level and often spontaneous uses of social media platforms. However, little attention has been paid to political apps as an emergent means of communication. Specifically, this study asks how users and developers view the use of political apps within the Israeli–Palestinian context by focusing on iNakba – an app that enables users to navigate Palestinian villages that were destroyed during the 1948 war and its aftermath. Ethnographic fieldwork and qualitative analysis of interviews with iNakba users and developers uncover three key facets of the app: (1) crowd mobilization, (2) educational tool that reanimates the invisible landscape of pre-1948 Palestine, and (3) promoting the Palestinian narrative. The study illuminates the role of political apps as agents of change for identity building and shaping users’ political consciousness. </jats:p>",

However, our empirical research suggests the specific combination of technologies in The Hobbit had paradoxical perceptual and experiential effects. Whereas the groundbreaking hyperrealistic aesthetic enhanced both spectacular and narrative immersion for many viewers, a significant number experienced this same visual aesthetic as unconvincing and distracting and as undermining suspension of disbelief. In this article, we identify key factors contributing to polarization among Hobbit viewers on aesthetic grounds and offer empirical insights into how emerging cinematic technologies may be reshaping film spectatorship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Alan Kay explaining Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad system. Unfortunately the CD-ROM format forces the editors to trim back on file sizes – removing explanatory sound tracks in some cases – to fit the material on the disk. Another drawback is inherent to digital archiving – a consequence of multimedia’s heterogeneity. Since technology has evolved considerably since the 1940s it is to the editor’s and publisher’s credit that the material is even accessible with today’s computers. However to make this possible, they bog viewer’s experience with necessary, if cryptic, instructions. An example: ‘Drag a Z-machine story file (either ‘Advent.z5’ or ‘Curses.z5’) onto the interpreter for your platform: ‘ZipV6carbon’ for Macintosh or ‘Frotz.exe’ for Windows.’ Happily not all the material requires this effort, and the resulting collection gives added depth to the book’s text. The Multimedia Reader is an important resource for artists, researchers and anyone interested in the history of cultural technologies. As an edited work it is a landmark in multimedia literature, and will find its place alongside Benedikt’s Cyberspace: First Steps and Laurel’s The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design. It not only gives readers a perspective on the past, but also prospects for the future. Not all the included works were conclusive; many pointed to developments that have yet to be. Ted Nelson’s Xanadu is still incomplete; Sutherland’s Sketchbook pointed to a design interface whose intuitive clarity has yet to be matched by today’s CAD software. What will happen in the next 50 years? The Multimedia Reader lets us stand on the shoulders of these and other giants, and foresee with them the many futures of multimedia to come.",

Newspaper-led convergence with broadcast stations occurs in converged newsrooms, where newspapers have superior overall abilities to broadcast stations; thus, one-sided help from newspaper to broadcast stations is more typical than vice versa. This study incorporated both surveys and in-depth interviews with journalists from three South Korean multimedia groups that have maintained newspaper-led convergence since late 2011. It has been approximately 3 years since these convergences; thus, this study outlined characteristics of the initial stage of convergence. The results indicated several asymmetries in terms of workload perceptions, multiple skills, cultural clash, and content quality among different media reporters. Unlike previous studies, psychological and cultural issues were not found to be obstacles to newspaper-led convergence. Based on these findings, this study concluded with suggestions for media firms that aim to converge newsrooms. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the stakes of digital transformation through a consideration of digital expertise. Expertise is investigated as it operates in everyday situations – drawing on empirical research undertaken in Brighton, UK, as part of the Communities and Cultures Network+ project. It is also deployed as a heuristic for inquiry into questions of use and the policy of use and investigated in relation to questions of automation that provoke reconsideration of the role of humans and machines in circuits of expertise. This latter necessitates reconsideration of how expertise can be theorized, and this is developed through an account that insists on the importance of both the material and the circulating imaginary for understanding the operations of digital expertise. Drawing these together to develop a new understanding of the economy of digital expertise, inspiration is finally drawn from earlier attempts to develop new models of technological expertise in the context of public science, undertaken with the specific intent of contributing to furthering the democratization of knowledge. In this article too, expertise is invoked albeit in a rather different way as constituting the grounds for the development of a political demand. The article closes with a question concerning the stakes of a demand for digital expertise. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses how broadcasts of electronic sport (e-sport) condition the gameplay practices of those who watch. Extending and deepening a limited body of past work, I conduct this analysis through a post-phenomenological perspective, adopting Bernard Stiegler’s theory of technicity. Stiegler provides a useful theorisation of how technical forms carry significant implications for the human, whose status is always already technical. As Stiegler sees it, adopting new advancements or changes in technical forms conditions human experience and behaviour profoundly. Mobilising this post-phenomenological view, I examine how players, through the prism of broadcast e-sport, negotiate the temporal, corporeal and technical aspects of their own gameplay. To do this, I draw upon findings from a wider research project about e-sports broadcasts in Valve Corporation’s popular game Dota 2, showing how various complicated and sometimes antagonistic entanglements emerge from the assemblage of e-sports broadcasts and the gameplay of its viewers. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Interactive television (iTV) has enjoyed increasing penetration within the UK's emerging digital television market. As with many new media technologies, its initial marketing positioned iTV as a spectacular new form of television. This has since given way to representations and applications that rely increasingly on a positioning of iTV as `everyday'. Drawing on the work of Tom Gunning, William Boddy and Lyn Spigel, I suggest that the discursive formation of iTV is not simply one of the now familiar stories of a new technology's movement `from the spectacular and astonishing to the convenient and unremarkable' (Gunning, 2004). Rather, this movement is one that is facilitated by the prominence of `window-on-the-world' discourses that not only relate television's digitalization to the initial inception of television into everyday life, but are also illustrative of the particular institutional backdrop of the UK's television landscape and, in turn, suggestive of particular gendered assumptions and positionings. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines a relationship between ethnic celebrities and diasporic communities by focusing on one case of Korean diasporic women gossiping about Korean actress Seo Min-jung. After a 10-year hiatus following her sudden migration to the United States and marriage to a Korean American dentist in 2007, Seo made a successful comeback to show business by starring in Korean reality shows and opening her Instagram account. Seo’s struggles as a Korean immigrant woman/housewife/mother, portrayed in TV shows and on Instagram, positively resonated with diasporic Korean women’s online communities (DKWOC). This positive discourse around Seo, however, transformed into celebrity bashing when her Instagram scandal happened in 2019. We trace the change of gossip around Seo in DKWOC concerning Korean diasporic women’s identity and status. We argue that DKWOC members’ gossiping of Seo functions as a way of coping with their situation, as they come to recognise the class difference between themselves and Seo and feel disempowered by their dissatisfying circumstances as immigrants. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In contemporary life, the mobile phone is integral to digital and material placemaking practices. In this article, drawing on ethnographic analysis conducted in Perth and Melbourne (Australia) in the first months of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, we explore how this relation has been recalibrated as an effect of ‘stay-at-home’ restrictions. We first provide a brief overview of our methodological and interpretative approach – drawing from postphenomenology as a useful framework for understanding the mobile–body–place relation and digital placemaking at home. Second, we consider how mobile media are ‘situated’ in the domestic environment. Third, through an analysis of participant narratives, we explore the concept of net locality (Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011) through the lens of embodiment theory and suggest that the Covid-19 context has altered our experience of ‘networked corporeality’. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity of digital intimacy in the decoupling of mobile media and the body as a result of a rapid increase in both screen time and time spent at home. Throughout the article, we argue that mobile media use in the home is thoroughly enmeshed in the shifting boundaries of privacy, placemaking and domestic space. We question how the placemaking functionality of mobile media, the intimate body–technology relation specific to mobile media practices and ‘being-at-home’ were subsequently modified by physical distancing and isolation. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Locative media: From specialized preoccupation to mainstream fascination",
    "abstract": "In 2010, Google generated global controversy when their Google Street View cars recorded data sourced from unsecured WiFi networks. While, in February of the same year, mobile social networking service Foursquare became embroiled in its own controversy when it was revealed that much of the traffic on their site was appearing on Please Rob Me.com, a website which streams updates from various location-based networks that shows when users check-in to a geographical location that is not their home. These controversies are of note not just for the salutary lessons they offer about the risks associated with digital data retention, privacy and security. At a more general level, they are noteworthy in that they testify to the dramatically increased public awareness of, and mainstream (especially press) exposure granted to, location-based media services. Such services are now well established and booming commercially, with consumers accustomed to using sat nav devices in their cars, Google maps on desktop and laptop computers and mobile devices, geoweb and geotagging and other mapping applications, and various apps on iPhones and smartphones that use location technologies. Not only do location-based services ‘comprise the fastest growing sector in web technology businesses’ (Gordon and de Souza e Silva, 2011: 9), questions of location and locationawareness are increasingly central to our contemporary engagements with the internet and mobile media. Indeed, as Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011: 19) suggest, ‘unlocated information will cease to be the norm’ and location will become a ‘near universal search string for the world’s data’ (2011: 20); or, as McCullough (2006: 26) puts it, information ‘is now coming to you . . . wherever you are’ and ‘is increasingly about where you are’. In this special issue, ‘locative media’ is the term that is used to capture this diverse array of location aware technologies and practices. The term ‘locative media’ (that is, media of communication that are functionally bound to a location) is preferred for the precise reason that it is economical and expansive but also precise. That is to say, it captures a lot in two words while also retaining a sense of the term’s very particular history, which is anchored within the field of new media arts. For instance, various sources trace the origin of the term ‘locative media’ back to Karlis Kalnins, who is said to have first proposed it during the Art þ Communication Festival in Riga,",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital platforms have reshaped the creative industries and restructured relationships between media sectors. Creative writing and reading social media platforms like Wattpad are challenging what it means to publish fiction in the early 21st century, and digital streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu and others have begun looking to these platforms to source creative content for adaptation. Praxis on creative writing social media platforms is shaped by a complex and ongoing interplay between the technocultural and socio-economic conditions of platforms and their users. This article argues for an integration of publishing studies and platform studies by applying a media ecology framework to map behaviour on Wattpad, one of the largest creative writing social media platforms, and the relationships it has developed with other media companies. Specifically, it draws on and extends José van Dijck’s ((2013) The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.) microsystem/ecosystem connective media model and proposes a broader conceptualisation of the entertainment ecosystem that incorporates adaptation of content across the book publishing and entertainment media sectors. Mapping these platforms alongside legacy media and publishing companies offers a productive framework for theorising contemporary entertainment media production within the platform media landscape. </jats:p>",

It argues that the themes emergent in the advertising of internet firms provide for a vision of the future of the internet which reifies issues of linguistic hegemony, technological solutions, a consumerist (rather than a citizenry) culture, and reiteration of the traditional discourses of masculinity and class. It suggests that we think about the future of internet technology in the developing world as intimately connected with issues of global capitalism and cultural hegemony in place of a focus on objects of technological innovation or individual innovators of technology. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> While plenty of research have provided useful insights into political parties’ use of Twitter, comparably few efforts have focused on the arguably more popular Facebook service. This article presents a comparative approach, detailing similar functionalities on each platform and providing statistical analyses of the social media activities undertaken by Swedish political parties during the 2014 elections. Moreover, the types of attention and feedback received by these parties are analyzed, suggesting that while sizable parties are not necessarily the most ardent at using their social media presences, they receive the most attention. The study largely complements previous research, suggesting that larger actors receive the bulk of new media attention on both platforms – with some internal variation. However, the role of the right-wing populist Sweden Democrats is clearly felt throughout, suggesting the apparent prowess of controversial parties in the online context. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> During the early adoption of e-books, this unfamiliar digital format was made more palatable through analogy to the printed book. Texts were divided into ‘pages’ that could turn on screen, and e-book repositories were referred to as ‘libraries’. However, as digital texts have increasingly taken on characteristics of digital systems, the metaphor of the printed book has lost currency. Given the limitations of this conventional metaphor for the digital text, I propose an alternative conception, one that is as archaic in origin as the printed-book metaphor, yet surprisingly robust for describing the customizable texts of today’s Academy: the metaphor of movable text. The image derives from German printer Johannes Gutenberg’s 15th-century innovation for the mass production of books, a mechanical system that used paper, ink and the relatively cheap and reusable display of cubed, metal letters that could be arranged and rearranged into words on a tray ready to be pressed into print. This metaphor of book-as-movable text is useful in that it captures how the form of the academic textbook is now entangled with its process, as much as its context. But, how does this metaphor apply to the academic text in particular? If a movable academic book asks to be interpreted, does the mobility of meaning that it creates defy such interpretative engagement? In this article, I argue that when automated texts are effectively scaffolded by cultural critiques, they can support deep research processes. To become more effective, these searches demand focus as much as evaluation and thus drive towards the crafts of collation, synthesis and eventual reconfiguration. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Homestuck is a hypermediated webcomic adventure that tells its story through music, animation, gameplay and even the structural features of its Web site interface. But it has also been 1) published in print as a book series and 2) ported to a new host to preserve content that used Flash Player, which is now obsolete. Both print publication and digital port simultaneously reproduce and recreate the first iteration of Homestuck – that is, they do and do not adapt it. This article uses adaptation theory to approach the under-researched question of the transition of a work from a digital format to print and porting. It identifies key sites of adaptation in what might otherwise be called versions and discusses the consequences of changes in medium/mode. The article highlights areas where the interactive mode must be adapted to showing or telling and explores how new interactive modes can emerge from a codex. It argues that Homestuck’s metafictional narratives in particular must be adapted in these new versions because they arise from an interactive relationship with the reader. Because the earlier webcomic has now been wholly replaced by the port, understanding these changes as adaptation allows us to see what is at stake the preservation of digital-born works. Homestuck’s versions show adaptation theory to be a vital lens for understanding the consequences of the differences that arise when multimedia digital-born works are reproduced with other technologies, an occurrence that will only grow more frequent over time. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents a detailed overview of podcast production in New Zealand. This is the first broad survey of podcasting in New Zealand, and seemingly the first of its kind globally. It tracks the development and growth of podcasting in New Zealand from a medium pioneered by independent producers to a growing sector of the local media market. Drawing from the New Zealand Podcast Directory – an extensive database of podcasts produced from 2005 onwards – this article categorises and assesses the 722 podcasts listed, before more broadly discussing key characteristics of New Zealand’s podcast sphere. The titles are coded across 12 categories, providing just under 10,000 data points for analysis. Producer typologies are discussed, before the publishing status of shows is explored. The number, length, and frequency of episodes are surveyed, followed by a breakdown of podcasts by format. Podcast subject matter is then considered, before the global reach of New Zealand’s most successful podcasts is evaluated. Undertaking this research project revealed inconsistencies with podcast terminology and issues with conventional podcast categories. There is no ubiquitous list of podcast formats, and accompanying definitions of each. When discussing podcasts, genre and topic are often used interchangeably. Aside from True Crime, podcast genres in the main lack definition. Conventional podcast categories lack the specificity needed to adequately identify many shows. Consequently, this article presents and tests a new podcast classification system designed to provide greater flexibility and specificity. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses Twitter responses to the death of musician David Bowie as an inroad to a discussion about characteristics and functions of Twitter in the mediated relationships between celebrities, fans and the popular culture industry. The study focuses on questions regarding the nature of the Twitter community, types of emotions as well as expressions of fan creativity and the composition of online mourners. To this end, it provides a broad analysis of all tweets with #Bowie in the first 48 h after Bowie passed away ( N = 252,318) and in-depth, quantitative and qualitative analysis of tweets with 100+ retweets ( N = 130). Results show high levels of retweeting and a limited number of tweets retweeted exceptionally often, suggesting a Twitter ‘elite’ leading the online mourning. This elite consists predominantly of media figures, celebrities, artists and music industry representatives rather than ‘regular’ individuals and fans, resulting in limited expressions of parasocial relationships. Besides being conduits of expressions of grief and information exchange, tweets focus on positive affirmation in tribute to Bowie’s work. Results confirm that Twitter provides a virtual gathering of mourners who are (presumably) looking for recognition of loss and for expressions of support. </jats:p>",

Offering another type of digital archive than the ones found online, ANARCHIVE provides the user with what is arguably the most original form of digital archive today in the fields of contemporary and media arts. The rise of digital archives has accompanied a number of critical efforts that inquire into the ontological nature of the artefact once it has been `dematerialized'. More than a question of materiality or lack thereof, I wish to show that a project such as ANARCHIVE introduces another way of conceiving of cultural memory and digital preservation in the age of new media. Indeed, what such a project demonstrates is that relational aesthetics has come to occupy a more central role than materiality in the appreciation and preservation of cultural and media memories. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyses the particular use of personal mobile communication by Italian politicians. Research was carried out in 2004 with semi-structured interviews to professional politicians, journalists and politicians' assistants. The paper intends to demonstrate that personal mobile communication technologies were introduced in a 'Darwinian' phase of political activity, at least in Italy, where every professional politician had to help themselves and survive in a milieu that almost suddenly had become very competitive, without significant support from party's organisation as it were in the past. Personal mobile communication, in this frame of thinking, appears as a 'help yourself' and timesaving technique, especially for second rank politicians who do not have access to large crews of assistants. Personal mobile communication technologies contributed to determine relevant transformations in the public sphere, especially regarding to: a) bargaining and making deals with one's peers and political partners; b) relationships with journalists and the media. At the same time, mobile communications fasten the oral dimension of politics, already pushed by audiovisual media, showing more 'politics' than 'policies'. </jats:p>",

    "title": "How are civic cultures achieved through youth social-change-oriented vlogging? A multimodal case study",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Debate over conceptual definitions is prominent within the body of literature dealing with emerging patterns of civic engagement and political participation among youth information and communication technology–enabled politics. This article contends that advancing new knowledge in this field is also dependent upon fine-grained empirical analysis of digital traces of youth participation. Drawing on a close analysis of two youth-produced vlogs, we show that adolescents’ commitment to social change can be creatively achieved through video making. Informed by a socio-semiotic approach to multimodal analysis and by Peter Dahlgren’s concept of online civic cultures, our qualitative analysis highlights two main patterns we found in young people’s vlogs aimed at raising awareness about social issues. First, we found that to impact their intended audiences, vloggers presented themselves as creative choice makers and as savvy insiders of youth civic cultures on YouTube. Second, we found that vloggers successfully managed the risk of being the target of online hostility using rhetorical devices and tactics that smoothed counterpositions. Overall, our multimodal case study shows that contrary to traditional approaches to successful communication based on textual coherence, a mix of consistency, disruption, and contradiction can be used purposefully in public speech in order to manage difficult, risky topics. As we demonstrate that visual-based communication on social network sites such as vlogs posted on YouTube is not neat and tidy, we illuminate the vloggers’ shifting identities, opinions, and concerns. This evidence-based observation calls for more in-depth small case qualitative analyses for investigating the multiple affordances of civic talk online and its democratic potential. This article contributes to the ongoing conceptual redefinition of youth civic engagement and political participation in the face of fast-evolving sociotechnical change. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Instagram has become a place of work for many content creators, including influencers; however, the inherent power imbalance between creator and platform dictating influencers’ success, requires creators to negotiate user expectations and the platform environment for their potential (commercial) success. Therefore, this article proposes approaching the influencer industry from the framework of platform imaginaries by developing a mixed qualitative method approach to visualize the precarity of Instagram influencers through their Instagram imaginaries with a cross-national comparison of US, German, and Japanese influencers. The results reflect a constant renegotiation of their own positions in relation to platform features and algorithms, follower interaction, as well as commercial partners, within three main imaginaries around Instagram’s use, namely, Instagram as a social space, Instagram as a workplace, and Instagram as a marketplace. The analysis highlights the interdependencies with and situatedness within Instagram’s platform environment, which need to be considered to understand the precarious working conditions of influencers. </jats:p>",

We argue that commensuration is performed as a discursive technique by institutional actors in the videogame industry to shape the form of, and ultimately derive value from, videogame markets – doing so by influencing collectively held perceptions concerning public policy and financial investment. This article draws on two case studies. First, the use of commensuration techniques by the Entertainment Software Association in lobbying the US government on behalf of large publishers, hardware manufacturers and videogame holding companies within the videogame industry. Second, the use of metrics and enumeration by videogame software companies in their financial reporting to craft narratives of user scale, engagement and ultimately value, particularly as it relates to articulating the value of their data-driven advertising services.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Published in 1983, David Sudnow’s Pilgrim in the Microworld performs an autoethnographic analysis of videogames that details how he acquires the gestures and postures required by skilled videogame play. While often seen as a curious experiment in early videogame analysis, Sudnow points to a descriptive mode of evaluating videogames that sees the audiovisual and mechanic aspects as irreducibly constituting a holistic embodied experience of the videogame as played. This article highlights the interventions that Sudnow’s under-examined work can provide contemporary critical videogame scholarship to account for how videogames meaningfully fuse embodied gestures with audiovisual spectacle. At a time when scholars are paying increased attention to the embodied aspects of videogame play, this article argues that Sudnow provides a unique opportunity to re-evaluate the expressive potential of videogames as not just ‘digital games’ nor as ‘computer toys’ but as performed, haptically augmented audiovisual media. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Re-enacting machine learning practices to enquire into the moral issues they pose",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> As the number of ethical incidents associated with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms increases worldwide, many actors are seeking to produce technical and legal tools to regulate the professional practices associated with these technologies. However these tools, generally grounded either on lofty principles or on technical approaches, often fail at addressing the complexity of the moral issues that ML-based systems are triggering. They are mostly based on a ‘principled’ conception of morality where technical practices cannot be seen as more than mere means to be put at the service of more valuable moral ends. We argue that it is necessary to localise ethical debates within the complex entanglement of technical, legal and organisational entities from which ML moral issues stem. To expand the repertoire of the approaches through which these issues might be addressed, we designed and tested an interview protocol based on the re-enactment of data scientists’ daily ML practices. We asked them to recall and describe the crafting and choosing of algorithms. Then, our protocol added two reflexivity-fostering elements to the situation: technical tools to assess algorithms’ morality, based on incorporated ‘ethicality’ indicators; and a series of staged objections to the aforementioned technical solutions to ML moral issues, made by factitious actors inspired by the data scientists’ daily environment. We used this protocol to observe how ML data scientists uncover associations with multiple entities, to address moral issues from within the course of their technical practices. We thus reframe ML morality as an inquiry into the uncertain options that practitioners face in the heat of technical activities. We propose to institute moral enquiries both as a descriptive method serving to delineate alternative depictions of ML algorithms when they are affected by moral issues and as a transformative method to propagate situated critical technical practices within ML-building professional environments. </jats:p>",

At stake are not only the principles of economy of scope and the strategy of repurposing content that DVD accomplishes, but also the way the studios use DVD like the TV industry uses the internet for an old media's `augmentation', to use John Caldwell's term. Additionally, the extras on DVDs create a frame of reception through their exploitation of institutional practices which are familiar to the viewer from television and home video. The movies on DVD are marketed by the Hollywood cinema in a double mode: the DVD offers theatrical spectacularity as well as the intimacy and `imperfection' of television and home video. DVDs with their high-budgeted franchises provide the best opportunity for combining spectacle, narrative openness and complexity with a sense of intimacy and authenticity. </jats:p>",

I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium's progressive potential, while the marketing of cell phones in the USA indicates the medium's reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, the cell phone's potential as `technological nanny'. The comparison tries to steer between two orientations in cultural studies — which I characterize as the optimism of technoutopianism and the pessimism of techno-phobia — in order to appreciate the political potential of cell phones, in particular, and technology in general. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The Development of DAB Digital Radio in the UK",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the cultural, economic and political pressures and influences that determined the adoption of the ‘European’ technical system of digital radio in the UK. Debates over the potential of the new technology to expand both programming content and the range of individuals, companies and organizations with access to radio broadcasting were curtailed in favour of a bureaucratic and technocratic approach to media policy and a desire by the European Commission to establish a new product for the consumer electronics market that would be developed and made in Europe. The article shows that the development of the new system resulted in a ‘forced marriage’ between the BBC and the commercial sector and that the convergence between DAB and other ‘platforms’ has profound implications for the relationship between public service broadcaster, government and industry. Furthermore, in order to encourage the larger commercial radio groups to commit themselves to the new technology, they were granted new and unprecedented control over content regulation. This had the effect of further consolidating the hold of dominant interests in the UK radio sector and stifling new initiatives and approaches to the medium. Finally, the article analyses the extent to which DAB digital radio has succeeded in establishing itself in the UK media landscape against strong competition from other, converging technologies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Dan Schiller’s book provides a detailed historical examination of the evolution of the global political economy of cyberspace. As the Unitd States has stood at the forefront of the global communications revolution and its governmental policies have defined the worldwide integration of information systems, Schiller focuses on the USA communication and information networks. These systems, such as the internet, were originally developed by the government, the military contractors and allied educational institutions. However, Schiller demonstrates that there has been a decisive shift away from the public sector to the private corporate integration of these USA networks into the heart of the global political economy as USA governments have established ’neo-liberal’ or market driven communications policies during the last two decades. This, Schiller contends, has been at the expense of labour rights, the public interest and democracy as multi-national corporations have been able to streamline their labour costs and integrate digital communications systems into the centre of the global political economy. Moreover, such ’neo-liberal’ policies indicate that the USA government has not only been compliant to the interests of corporations, but has actively pursued multi-national corporate interests, under the guise of globalisation and efficiency, as a nexus of vested political and business interests have come to define American politics.

    "title": "Follow the user: Taking advantage of Internet users as methodological resources",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, I introduce a novel epistemological approach meant to re-adapt the digital methods paradigm to a fast changing digital landscape. This change was mostly brought about by the transformation of Web 2.0 into a platformized social media environment and the advent of the post-API and platform surveillance era. This approach is premised on the idea of considering the Internet user as a source of methods, rather than an object of study. To this purpose I suggest to ‘ follow the user’, meaning to take advantage of the natively digital methods that Internet users employ to gather, organise, manage and create their own digital data throughout their everyday digital practices. In order to illustrate my approach, I show how to practically follow the users in each of the key phases of a digital research project within social media platforms: keywords selection, data collection, data sampling, data analysis. In doing so, I mean to contribute to an emerging strand of research within the digital methods tradition which is trying to: (a) update digital methods, given the continuous mutations of the digital landscape; (b) seek a more organic and systematic integration of digital and qualitative methods; (c) go beyond the classical quali-quanti dichotomy. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We describe a novel computational dictionary for the study of right-wing populist conspiracy discourse ( RPC) on the internet, specifically in the context of contemporary German politics. After first presenting our definition of conspiracy discourse and grounding it in antecedent research on mediated rhetoric at the intersection of right-wing populism and conspiracy theory, we proceed by outlining our approach to dictionary construction, relying on a combination of manual and automated methods. We validate our dictionary via parallel manual coding of 2,500 sentences using the categories contained in the dictionary as labels and compare the consensus result with the label assigned to each sentence by the dictionary, achieving satisfactory results. We then test our approach on two different datasets composed of alternative news articles and Facebook comments that spread conspiracy theories. Finally, we summarize our observations both on the methodological premises of the approach and on the object of populist right-wing conspiracy discourse and its dynamics more broadly. We close with an outlook on the potentials and limitations of the dictionary-based approach and future directions in applications of content analysis to the study of conspiracy discourse.</jats:p>",

I trace its emergence through a genealogical lens, and revive and reintegrate older debates, so as to include these tensions in the ongoing conceptualization of locative media. In tracing the discursive events of the field, which encompass both formations and tensions, it will be made apparent that locative media is not happenstance. Rather, it is a field of cultural production that is perpetually evolving and continuously reproduced vis-à-vis struggles between technological interpretations and different visions of future use. </jats:p>",

It is argued that digital devices and networked media facilitate a vast production and circulation of persistent digital traces that are potential memories. An approach that privileges sociotechnical practices is used to empirically examine the roles of digital devices, software, and social media in reconfiguring personal memory. In-depth interviews with 30 individuals aged between 20 and 30 are used to examine the details of reflexive and routine modes of forgetting and remembering related to the prevalence of devices and the digital traces produced in quotidian use. The increasingly visual life of data of many kinds promotes a ‘continuously networked present’ (Hoskins, 2012), but this is highly differentiated and actively negotiated in complex ways that both reproduce and reconfigure established memory practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is part of an ongoing ethnography of the Japanese television industry focusing on its attempts to experiment with live, interactive content that was manipulable via smart devices, laptops, and remote controls. Based on 18 months of fieldwork in the Japanese television industry in four major TV network offices and two production companies, it also incorporates interviews with more than 30 broadcast company employees. I use two case studies of early interactive television programming to discuss the strategies producers have used to create community and promote identification among audiences of these shows: ‘ Arashi Feat. You’ was a live music event that courted a large audience through the involvement of a massively popular boy band and promoted the idea of ‘turning viewers into users’ by allowing them to play musical instruments along with the band. ‘ The Last Award’ allowed participants to submit and evaluate each other’s videos live through a dedicated user interface. Through these examples, I argue that participation alters the nature of television spectacle and results in changes to the way producers address and inscribe audiences as cocreators of content. The rhetoric used by interactive television accordingly defaults to ‘we’ and ‘us’ and features accessible and relatable celebrities as surrogates for the audience. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a 1980 interview, Roland Barthes attests that ‘what is terrible about a photograph is that there is no depth in it, that it is clear evidence of what was there’. In the social media age, photographic equivalents of sound bites pass between users and groups for mere seconds before they leave forever one’s field of vision. To what extent is it still possible to be wounded by a photograph in the ways Barthes famously described? This essay proposes to explicate some of the psychological and sociopsychological effects of networked images, specifically as they have come to play an increasingly essential role in peer-to-peer and small group communications. As smartphone technologies and data-processing speeds have improved, virtual communities have come to form around and communicate largely through photographs. This essay first considers the evolving nature of subjectivity and otherness in this new era of selfies and self-spun spectacle; it then revisits Lacan’s dialectic of eye and gaze to further assess the radical reconfiguration of self and society at stake in the social media imagescape. Platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram force us to rethink some of psychoanalysis’ long heralded heuristics for understanding vision and visuality; at the same time, however, these same heuristics can provide a critical groundwork for recognizing what, indeed, is so ‘terrible’ – and terrifying – about this new cult of the image. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article aims to outline the critical framework of a gendered identification procedure that conditions the female’s approach to the auto blographical inquiry, highlighting the links between female practices of self-representation and feminist agendas. Utilizing existing theories upon identity and selfhood to support my own, I present the procedure as a consciously gendered practice that has re-appropriated the act of blogging into a ‘feminized situation’, an ideal space that best suits the contours of female self-discovery models. To support this claim, I explore why, given the freedoms of cyberspace and the fact that the computer cannot recognize the dichotomies between masculine and feminine, gender biases and gender intensification still exist within the multiple realities of blogging practice. I ask why women exaggerate societal notions of femininity as a formative and integrative part of self-representation and explore whether this act of gender stamping compromises online self-presentation or invites the female to think about and express herself in entirely new ways. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "authors’ flights of speculation (for example: has music really been ‘catapulted to unprecedented heights’ by technology or has it become mind-numbingly repetitive and robotic?) This would be to miss the main thrust of the book’s intent, which is an attempt to rethink the traditional business model on which most of popular music has been founded. It does this in the light of the impact of recent technological forces, looking in particular at how this affects copyright law, intellectual property rights and music distribution. The book is at its strongest when surveying the manifestations and implications of new technologies in the popular music field, which are comprehensively and authoritatively summarized, despite an occasional tendency to overstate the case in an attempt to provoke a response. It is perhaps a little less surefooted when dealing with possible solutions to the questions it raises, at times straying into utopian speculation. The opening passage of Gibsonesque, cyberpunk-style future-gazing also seems a little half hearted, as this stylistic approach is soon abandoned for a more matter-of-fact tone throughout the rest of the book. Possibly the most important underlying fact that emerges from The Future of Music is that the free music ‘tap’ has already been turned on by advances in recording and playback technology. Notwithstanding the ingenious business models the authors put forward later in the book, it is hard to see how any model can successfully compete with music that comes free of charge. As Kusek and Leonhard rightly point out this ‘tap’ is not going to be turned off any time soon despite the best efforts of the copy protection software writers. As the authors state ‘the genie is out of the bottle’ and the truth is, no one really knows how the dust will settle. From this perspective it seems most likely that the dust will not settle and the constant flux and turmoil of the past few years is here to stay. The survivors may well turn out to be those who surf the chaos with the most agility, exploiting the fleeting eddies in the digital whirlpool and moving on quickly before being swept away in the tide. Kusek and Leonhard welcome the reader to the music industry of the 21st century. To sum up then, a thought-provoking and wide-ranging book on the impact of new technology on the popular music business, which raises more questions than answers, but is none the less interesting for that.",

The KakaoTalk-scape shows that smartphones and their apps are articulated with community-based local modes of communication and the rhythm of urban space. It also demonstrates that media convergence occurs not only between different media platforms but also between global and local media practices. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Historically, artists and scientists predominantly created moving images of scientific phenomena using optical instrumentation such as cameras and light microscopes that enable direct observation of their subject. However, the perception and representation of nanoscale phenomena, which are too small to be detected by optical systems, rely upon complex technological mediation via layers of  instrumentation, hardware and software. This mediation has profound implications for the perception of phenomena that exist outside the range of the human sensory system. This article describes the scientific representations of temporality in the work of Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey and the complications of visualising the nanoscale. I analyse imperceptible phenomena in the contemporary moving image and draw upon my creative practice with the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), using this instrument as a framework for discussing the temporal and sensorial challenges of working with nanoscale phenomena. This creative practice-based research resulted in the creation of several experimental moving image works collected under the title Wildly Oscillating Molecules. Through the adoption of scientific instrumentation and data for creative  production, the collection of moving image practices discussed uncover temporal and sensorial assumptions and suggest alternative experiential encounters with scientific phenomena. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Mirroring journalistic work in newsroom metrics: A longitudinal study of Estonian journalists’ making sense of data",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> While a substantial body of research has explored the intricate relationship between journalists and metrics, there remains a notable gap in systematically understanding how evolving metrics over time influence journalists’ use of data as feedback. This study addresses this gap by investigating how alterations in the most valued metrics influence the utilisation of audience data for reflection and feedback in national and local newsrooms. The study spans multiple waves from 2012 to 2023 and comprises 72 interviews with Estonian journalists. It employs the Data Loop framework to analyse the circulation of audience data among media institutions, audiences, newsrooms, and individual journalists’ reflexive actions. Examining data reflexivity within newsrooms involves considering the interplay between newsroom culture, metrics-gathering technology, external pressures from changing business models, and journalistic agency. Over time, the metrics valued by newsroom managers have shifted – from prioritising clicks as a measure of audience interest to rewarding journalists based on minutes spent on stories or the acquisition of subscriptions. In this article, we argue that instead of considering the audiences behind the data, journalists and editors mostly use the data offered by metrics to reflect on their work. Noteworthy trends include journalists conforming to data dominance and shaping their work to align with prevailing metrics, particularly in the context of paywalls where individual article readership can be linked with direct income through subscriptions. Contextualising newsroom data within the Data Loop, this study illustrates how data serves as a source for reflections at both the individual and newsroom culture levels. Despite assertions of an audience turn, our findings indicate that a focus on metrics does not necessarily signify a focus on the audience but rather an unwavering interest in journalistic production. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the democratic implications of the wide adoption of XR (eXtended Reality) technologies, drawing on Hannah Arendt’s political theory and her concept of common reality. Arendt argues that the intersubjective construction of a common reality is what enables the establishment of factual truth and that both are prerequisites for a functional democracy. Without them, ideology can be established as truth by anti-democratic forces with power over media outlets, paving a path toward totalitarianism. This article argues that XR technologies can be used to inhibit the construction of a common reality through the same individualization of media experiences that has been shown to impede democratic processes in the social media context. The companies generating increased revenue through individualized micro-segmentation are now also vying for dominance in the XR media arena. It is argued in this article that such individualization can impede the co-construction of a common reality and a factual truth because XR media are hyper-persuasive and capable of altering an individual’s overall perception of reality. The viability of such platform-controlled individualization in XR is demonstrated through an Arendt-based critique of four properties related to XR technologies: Hypertargeted personalization, false memory creation, reality indistinguishability, and predictive processing theory. Based on these analyses, the article concludes that XR policy and regulation must consider how XR gives platforms unprecedented persuasive powers as they become capable of altering a user’s reality perception remotely and how, per Arendt, this may threaten democracy. </jats:p>",

Focusing on Tim Dean’s critique of online cruising in his book Unlimited Intimacy, this article interrogates the assumption that objectification is politically toxic and proposes that it may have something politically useful to offer. Inspired by the ‘antisocial thesis’ in queer theory, and in particular work by Leo Bersani, the article argues that being treated as an object usefully preserves a gap between oneself and one’s potential partner, thwarting the desire to know, speak for, and act in the interest of others – a tendency that may appear altruistic but has annihilative ends. The article frames this gap in terms of both mediation and market relations.</jats:p>",

    "title": "Streaming<i>Diversité</i>: Exploring representations within French-language scripted series on Canadian SVOD services",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>Canadian subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services have commissioned French-language ‘original’ content to attract local audiences. ICI TOU.TV, Club Illico and Crave have indeed commissioned more than a hundred French-language scripted series, mostly produced in the Quebec province. However, the current state of research only marginally documents these services. Even in Canada, most research focus on US-owned streaming giants such as Netflix and Amazon, thus providing little information on Canadian national SVOD services, and their affordances in terms of storytelling and representation. Current research also completely overlooks French-language original content. This paper therefore discusses the results of the very first research project to specifically focus on the production of original French-language series for Canadian streaming services. After reviewing all original (scripted and unscripted) French-language content available on Canadian-owned SVOD services, a textual analysis of more than 40 scripted series has been conducted, which led to intricate insights regarding prevailing narrative trends and characteristics of main and secondary characters. In so doing, the objective was also to determine the level of diversity included within this so-called original content. In a context characterized by an unprecedented proliferation of scripted series, it indeed becomes crucial to ascertain whether a greater quantity of productions necessarily leads to a greater diversity in representation, that is, the inclusion of a ‘multiplicity of forms’, and an equitable plurality of cultural expressions and identities. This research produced several findings that testify to a significant inclusion of sexual, gender, and racial diversity, as well as a noticeable trend towards intersectional representation. Yet, the analysis also led to identify persistent issues, such as the qualitative marginalization of non-normative characters (queer, BIPOC, with disability, etc.), as they mostly are relegated to supporting roles. These findings therefore call for a nuanced assessment of the ‘progress’ in representation on streaming services.</jats:p>",

The study shows that people participating in CryptoParties reflect on and criticize current processes of datafication. Moreover, they aim at shaping datafication by encrypting their online communication and digital media technologies. Therefore, CryptoParties are discussed as examples of re-active data activism in this article. Applying a critical perspective hierarchies and inequalities at these events are revealed. </jats:p>",

The book’s co-authors supplemented the traditional ‘blind’ peer-review system with a range of practices including the informal, DIY review of colleagues and ‘clever friends’, as well as using the feedback derived from grant applications, journal articles and book chapters. The article ‘explodes’ the book into a series of documents and non-linear processes to demonstrate the significance of the various forms of feedback to the development of Fuller and Rehberg Sedo’s monograph. The analysis reveals substantial differences between book and article peer-review processes, including an emphasis on marketing in review forms and the pressures to publish, which the co-authors navigated through the introduction of ‘clever friends’ to the review processes. These findings, drawing on science and technology studies, demonstrate how such a research methodology can identify how knowledge is constructed in the arts and humanities and potential implications for the valuation of research processes and collaborations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been assumed that Web 2.0 has democratized participatory culture, challenging the significance of ‘expertise’ via ‘collective intelligence’ (Jenkins, 2006). However, fan-cultural logics of expertise remain stratified in relation to ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) where fandom-specific wikis transform pop-cultural narratives into databases of information (Booth, 2010: 105). Such fan-generated content also challenges separations of database and narrative (Bassett, 2007: 178). Focusing on Doctor Who fandom, I consider the ‘epistemological economy’ (Hastie, 2007) of Who fans’ expertise. It has been argued that fans can be ‘industry driven’ or members of communities with histories of expertise (Busse and Gray, 2014: 431). However, this industry/community binary is problematic, and instead, I argue that Doctor Who fan expertise has become part of a ‘nexus of multimembership’ (Wenger, 1998: 159) – placed in an uneasy position between the ‘official’ knowledge of showrunner fans and unofficial fan practices of re-narrating/archiving. </jats:p>",

The project’s system was functionally built based on three operational principles derived from convergence technologies that facilitate a mutual functional shift between bio-media and digital media and reveal the extent to which this shift leads to a reconciliation between our biological and narrative identities. </jats:p><jats:p> Empirically, the project remodelled visual maps of cellular activities during the induced differentiation processes by which cells acquire their identity. Finally, a generative biological–digital mirror was architected by which the viewers see their faces resynthesized as the result of the interactions between the artificial remodelled differentiation processes and the participants’ activities at the project’s physical place and its Twitter page. Within this context, Bio-pixels highlights the consequences of today’s bioinformatics on in vitro artificial processes of self-making through which the public can control, enhance or resynthesize their identities. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The banal imaging of ourselves and our environments has led to new aesthetic modes where the conventions of imaging, subject–object relationships and what is pleasurable or popular often draw on the ludic, the unexpected or the surprise element. One such image genre is photobombing, where a transgressive object or entity within a conventional image setting subverts it, adding popular appeal through its ability to reconfigure its aesthetic conventions, opening it up for public pleasure and consumption and inscribing it with a possibility of going viral. Photobombing as an image genre online reflects our aesthetic modes and the age of distraction, where the unexpected remains a mode of ocular appeal underscoring the convergence of popular culture and the fluidity of Web 2.0’s convergence architecture. As such, people’s aesthetic modes of the popular can be invented, renewed and subverted with new formats. The phenomenon of photobombing equally affirms the spectacular as a liminal site where pleasure is experienced with the breaking down of norms and the conjoining of a communal gaze through the aesthetics of transgression. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Everyday communication management and perceptions of use",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> For media users enjoying a context of near constant connection across a changing set of platforms, the management of that communication environment is a central concern in the management of everyday life. The multiplication and divergence of possible uses across these platforms emerge alongside the increasing cross-media integration of informational, interactive and entertainment practices with interpersonal communication. The individual’s perception of that environment of increasingly differentiated communication possibilities becomes a site for managing and partially negotiating the limits, form and organization of one’s social world. Expanding upon Gershon’s (2010) notion of media ideologies, this article focuses on the increasing divergence of the perceived and preferred uses of media technologies. The analytical terms ‘social tool’ and ‘social device’ are deployed to tease apart the central ordering experience of perceived ‘mutual engagement’ within media practices. The perceived presence or lack thereof within such engagement serves to recursively delimit and order the media user’s social landscape, pointing to further reflexive management of one’s own media ideology through a highly idiosyncratic ‘relational ordering’ of perceived and preferred platform uses, amidst social and technological change. </jats:p>",

It draws attention to the close parallels between various modes of 'mobile subjectivity' associated with moving image/sound technologies and mechanical forms of transportation. The kinetic experiences associated with the freeway and the roller coaster are offered as two quite different examples of how the interpenetration of media, objects and subjectivities takes place in the realm of moving images and bodies. It is argued that the same modes of perception and motion associated with the car and the roller coaster also figure in a variety of new media forms that appeal to the contemporary body-in-motion/perception-in-motion nexus (from virtual environments to ride films and location-based entertainment). Like other communication networks of the present, both exist as ambivalent spaces for the representation of social interaction and social fears. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Marginalia has been studied as discourse, as historical documentation and as evidence of reader response. As many academic texts are now available electronically, it seems a natural step to incorporate the interactive, social functions of the Web 2.0. Digital marginalia in an academic publishing context has been a largely unsuccessful venture to this date, yet there are several promising developments. Tools have emerged that enable readers annotate online texts in an approximation of paper-based marginalia, with the additional affordances of two- (or many-) way discourse, digital archiving, and the ability to hide the annotations. This article reviews the contemporary practices of digital marginalia, narrowing in to focus on digital marginalia as a form of academic discourse and peer review. I analyse several case studies of digital marginalia and discourse within this context, including Nature’s trial of open peer review, Wellcome Open Research, PLOS ONE and PubPeer’s systems, as well as my own experience using open peer review with Hypothes.is in a special ‘disrupted’ issue of the Journal of Media Practice. The article examines the relative success of these initiatives, attitudes toward open peer review and concludes with some promising developments for the future of digital marginalia and discourse in academic publishing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Through in-depth interviews with all 10 youth representatives who worked in the Australian Youth Forum (AYF), Australia’s first online government youth forum, this article explains how online engagement was experienced and understood by those who managed its day-to-day operation. While the AYF was decommissioned in 2014, it was the first, and, till date, only online federal initiative that invited young people to run a government-funded youth public forum. Despite its relatively short existence, the AYF provokes questions about the influence of historically entrenched political values on online youth political participation and policy. Findings from this article have uncovered a series of challenges faced by youth in adjusting to government efforts to regulate consultation within the AYF. Building on Collin’s (2015, Young Citizens and Political Participation in a Digital Society: Addressing the Democratic Disconnect. London: Palgrave Macmillan.) observation of a ‘democratic disconnect’ in Australian youth policy, an incompatibility between government expectations of youth political involvement and how young people value participation, this article suggests that the AYF provided key insights into the centralized bureaucratic arrangements that have historically defined Australian youth participation and how they influence youth participatory experiences in online government initiatives. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The return of the social author",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The rise in self-publishing, digital folk culture and social media participation, have revolutionized reading and writing practices. Readers can directly contact their favourite authors, and publishers, through social media and become authors, and publishers, themselves. One of the outcomes of digital reading and writing is that writing is now becoming more democratic: traditional publishers are no longer the sole gatekeepers of culture. The popularity of social writing platform Wattpad is a recent example of how a new generation of influential and innovative writers is entering the publishing arena. This also demonstrates that there is a demand for authorship without the intervention from publishers. Despite this, traditional notions of authorship, ownership and control are prevalent in contemporary publishing hindering the true potential of creativity. The disharmony between the rise of the amateur author and the control of the traditional publisher is confronted in the digital public sphere. Consequently, issues such as authority and influence are mediated during the activities and interactions that take place on social media and other online platforms. Established authority figures, such as famous authors or well-known publishers, that exert authority and influence in the traditional sphere, can shift this authority and influence to the digital world; however, this sphere is also occupied by emerging networks of influencers, such as emerging authors or micro-celebrities, who gain popularity as a result of specific trends, in specific domains, at specific times. This article will examine how new and established authors are using social platforms, and social media, to publish their writing, build communities and extend their dialogue with readers and other writers. A netnographic study of Wattpad will identify which authors are the influencers and innovators in social publishing. Consequently, this article will underscore the increasing importance of social networks and social relationships in 21st century publishing. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers how the emergent digital pedagogies used in a new creativity course run at the Univeristy of New South Wales contribute to the building of sensed, intuitive and embodied creativity literacies. In doing so, it addresses questions around the function of tertiary education within an accelerated, digitised and COVID-19-saturated globe. For while creativity is being touted as what every student needs – and what every employer wants – there is little understanding of how this most mystifying of skills can be taught to students in broad disciplines. There is even less understanding of how full-bodied modalities of creative cognition can be leveraged as moments of deep insight in the socially distanced realm of the digital. Drawing on hands-on methods from ground-breaking musicians, performers, dancers and writers, this article shows how the neuroscience and psychology of taking ‘beautiful risks’, committing to uncertainty and paying attention can be harnessed in digital learning. These dynamic digital pedagogies are principled in embodied liveness, playful interactivity and generative curiosity. They support students with practical strategies to take risks with imagination, discover through collaboration and work responsively in relation to diverse situations. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article delves into the hip-hop scene in India, by locating its particular relationship with digital platforms, Instagram, YouTube and music streaming services such as Spotify, SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Because of hip-hop’s self-referentiality and its peculiar form of realism, discourses around platform capitalism have inadvertently entered the culture at large. Cultural artefacts produced by the scene reflect on the condition of music’s interaction with platforms and in turn, lay bare the evaluative tendencies vis-à-vis platforms. The article argues that digital platforms are productive in giving form to culture wherein the audio track is accompanied by a range of other trans-textual and trans-medial linkages of texts, audio, images and videos, that is, discourses which circulate outside of the audio form creating a crisscross of lines which come to form the cypher of hip-hop culture. It isn’t merely the offline cyphers then which are crucial in giving form to the community but also the digital platforms and their affordances. </jats:p>",

It examines the evolution of the European regulatory package for telecoms and gives an overview of the reforms implemented at national level to transpose the European policy framework. It also draws on some of the most recent EU-level studies to present an analysis of the effects of liberalisation on telecoms markets in member states. As such, it is intended to complement and provide a contextual background for the more analytical articles in this special edition.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Examining the case of the Chilean influencer industry, this paper argues for situating affordances within a wider context in which the features of platforms acquire meanings. Our analysis focuses on two dynamics. On the one hand, we examine how the Chilean influencer industry is shaped by a ‘technological frame’ that structures the valence of affordances. We show that affordances are neither ‘naturally’ nor ‘neutrally’ imagined by actors but rather culturally located within technological frames that shape the discourses, values, and practices from which they obtain cultural meaning. On the other hand, we analyze how affordances provide a material support for the temporal and spatial expansion of these technological frames. Thus, cultural contexts and platforms’ features mutually configure each other in ways that have not always been recognized in the scholarly literature about affordances. We situate negotiations about what it means to be an influencer in Chile, the role of intermediaries (eg branding agencies), communication with followers, and the global influencer industry as part of this mutually constitutive relationship. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> BeReal has become a popular app among younger social media users, with a premise that privileges a brief, random, and unvarnished look into one’s life once a day. Hailed as the ‘anti-Instagram’ or ‘anti-TikTok’, the app eschews filters, performance, influencers, and sponsored content in favor of authenticity. While curated authenticity has long been a hallmark of internet culture, BeReal seems to employ authenticity not as a performance strategy but as a value, tapping into criticisms of the inauthentic. Through the walkthrough method of social media app analysis, I employ ethnographic research tenets to analyze how BeReal forwards a different type of authenticity to its users from its discourse, design, interface, and features. The findings are two-fold: First, BeReal privileges authenticity-as-realness instead of authenticity-as-performance, using spontaneity and timed posting windows to severely limit the time one can craft a post. Second, BeReal acts as a panopticon, because the omnipresent possibility of posting means users are always already aware of the potential. Authenticity-as-realness is not uncomplicated; it relies much more heavily on neoliberal self-monitoring and panopticism to be ready for anything, as opposed to a finely tuned and intricately crafted performance with lighting, makeup, and editing. This indicates considerations of authenticity are changing on social media platforms, putting performance at odds with panopticism. </jats:p>",

This sonic perspective allows us to understand the temporal, situated and embodied aspects of locative media. Informed by debates from sound studies and mobile media studies, a locative smart phone application where users experience specific sounds depending on their locations, is discussed. The concept of ‘Placed Sounds’ is introduced for a more detailed analysis of locative sound experiences. A framework for analysis is developed to discuss how locative sound engages with the auditory aspects of our spatial perception, how immersion operates for locative media and sound, and also to consider the role of situated experience, the role of walking as remixing, and how agency and exclusion operate in locative sound. This framework explains how walking operates in terms of interacting with locative media, and how we experience being immersed in physical and media contexts at once via sound. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the social technology company Meta’s public communication on problematic content, via their official ‘Meta Newsroom’, within the context of growing regulatory scrutiny. For nearly a decade, the Meta Newsroom has been a major outlet for Meta company announcements, and since 2016, the Newsroom has increasingly become a key source for company responses to concerns regarding mis/disinformation and other kinds of problematic content on Meta’s platforms. Using a mixed-methods approach informed by discourse analysis, this article critically examines Newsrooms posts from 2016 to early 2021. It asks: how is Meta framing ‘problems’ on its platforms? How is Meta identifying ‘solutions’ to those problems? And is Meta ‘nudging’ policymakers in specific conceptual directions? Overall, we find that Meta is framing content moderation issues through four key frames – ‘authenticity’, ‘political advertising’, ‘technological solutions’, and ‘enforcement’ – that benefit Meta, as they shift responsibility while also demonstrating that Meta is an active and capable problem-solver. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Online piracy, anonymity and social change",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyses current trends in the use of anonymity services among younger Swedes (15–25 years old) and focuses on individuals engaging in illegal file sharing in order to better understand the rationale behind both file sharing as well as online anonymity, especially in relation to enforcement of copyright. By comparing the findings of a survey conducted on three occasions (early 2009, late 2009 and early 2012), we measure the fluctuations in the use of anonymity services among approximately 1000 15–25-year-olds in Sweden, compare them with file sharing frequencies and, to some extent, trends within legal enforcement. The article also suggests that the key to understanding any relationship between copyright enforcement and fluctuations in online anonymity can be found in the law’s relationship to social norms in terms of legitimacy by showing a correlation between file sharing frequency and the use of anonymity services. The findings indicate that larger proportions of frequent file sharers (downloaders) also use anonymity services more often than those who file share less. However, in comparison to the earlier surveys, the strongest increase in the use of anonymity services is found in the groups where file sharing is less frequent, suggesting that reasons for actively making oneself less traceable online other than avoiding copyright enforcement have emerged since the initial two surveys in 2009. Further, the overall increase (from 8.6 per cent to 14.9 per cent) in using anonymity services found for the whole group of respondents suggests both that high file sharing frequency is a driver for less traceability, as well as a larger trend for online anonymity relating to factors other than mere file sharing of copyright infringing content – for example, increased governmental identification, data retention and surveillance in the online environment. The results are analysed in Merton’s terminology as file sharers and protocol architects adapting in terms of both innovation and rebellion in the sense that institutional means for achieving specific cultural goals are rejected. This means, to some extent, participating in or contributing to the construction of other means for reaching cultural goals. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, location-based real-time dating apps like Grindr and Tinder have assumed an increasingly pivotal role in brokering socio-sexual relations between men seeking men and have proven to be fertile ground for the study of identity negotiation and impression management. However, current research has given insufficient consideration to how various contextual elements of technology use interact with one another to shape self-presentation behaviour. Through analysis of interview data, we found impression construction on these apps reflects tensions between authentic depiction of the self-concept and self-enhancement via deception. Whether and the extent to which one engages in deception depends on how a number of technological affordances, platform-specific community norms and userbase characteristics interact with each other. Self-presentational choices were a result of a combination of deception facilitators, for example, belief in the normalcy of lying, and constraining determinants, for example, the expectation of brokering physical connection. Impression construction determinants also interact in ways where the influence of any one element is dependent on others. This was most plainly evidenced in the interactions between stigma management concerns, the affordances of audience visibility/control and locatability and common ground reinforcing social hierarchy. </jats:p>",

This maps the how AP producers develop their practices through complex relational networks.

    "title": "Writing while wandering",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In digital writing, there is a discrepancy between the dynamicism that is associated with born-digital narratives and the rigidly encoded structures of content management that shape digital media technologies. Locative media narratives – site-specific narratives that are designed for accessing digital mobile devices – are therefore interesting because they cannot be written without reference to real space and are subject to the dynamic relationships that device users have with material space. This article reveals the ontological complexities of digital reading and digital writing for the locative media narrative user. Writing and reading digitally through locative media narratives, I argue, require users’ dynamic and reflexive negotiation between the experience of reading and the material circumstances that offer insight into the element of contingency in digital writing. Specifically, I explore the element of contingency as a ‘counter’ to paradigms of standardization and rationalization during the age of modernity; its nullification through the introduction of predefined digital parameters; its resilience in the figure of the walker; and its contemporary resilience in the media user. Contingency is thus delineated as a condition through which a dynamic narrative can emerge between the parameters of digital writing and a user’s narrative play. The material spaces explored are contingent upon which paths users choose to take; also, the produced story is contingent upon the narrative trajectory that is formed through users’ wandering through material space. As users choose real spaces with historiocultural contexts, this article shows that locative media narratives allow us to write digital narratives while also engaging in the discourses of material space, media materiality, and emerging forms of narrative. In turn, by conceptualizing and identifying dynamic forms of narrative for how they complicate notions of reading and writing, this article proposes the initial shaping of a narratology for dynamic digital narratives. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In most writing on video games, whether within or beyond the academy, the availability of gaming media is implicitly taken for granted. However, we propose that the act of video game purchase should be seen as an important aspect of the player–video game relationship. Drawing on original interview data, this work explores two types of video game purchasing that are common in contemporary Western gaming culture – the ‘pre-order’ (paying for a game before its release), and what we term ‘backlog purchasing’ (buying a cheap game unlikely to ever be played). Through Marx and Adorno’s theorizations of value, specifically exchange-value and use-value, we argue that, according to players, the meaningful aspects of those purchases are more than simply obtaining the entertainment value realized through gaming. Instead, different kinds of purchases activities are themselves imbued with varied and powerful values, by both players and the industry. We call these ‘gaming-value’ and ‘culture-value’. Furthermore, drawing on Lewis’ conceptualization of consumer capitalism, this article also traces the ideological root of, and the flow of power beneath, these two particular types of consumption. Through analysing video game purchases, we aim to shed light upon a crucial element of the audience–media relationship, as well as other theoretical issues, most notably adapting and updating Marxist concepts for the purpose of researching modern video games. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Computer-mediated technologies (CMT) have created many opportunities for the arts. Some of those opportunities have been about re-purposing or re-mediating existing practices. Elsewhere, emergent practices, which are significantly different to what have gone before, are evident. A growing body of CMT works contest traditional practices in that there is no single unique or master copy; in the way the roles of maker and consumer are reapportioned; in the ways digital media themselves, physically and extra-linguistically, differ from previous display technologies; and in the user’s knowledge of what is missed or skipped.3 A particular feature of CMT art practices is ’new media’ interactivity: sequences of textual, visual and aural display guided by human actions of varying complexity which create new variations or instances of the work which are unique to the occasion and result from the reflexive selection of the user. Widening cultural and economic access to fast, reliable and responsive, local and networked systems means that such interactivity is now an increasingly important site of cultural activities.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores the digitization of Swedish pen-and-paper role-playing games through the inflamed online discussions in the role-playing community that followed in its wake; discussions that in some cases resist the very idea of Digital in an age where Digital has become synonymous with ubiquitous progress and efficiency. The case in question focuses on Riotminds, a Swedish RPG publishing company that in 2010, in one broad stroke, transformed and converged all their analogue printed products into a single, online subscription service. Drawing on a general theoretical framework of materiality and (cultural) practice, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of digitization by asking: What does this particular instance of technological transformation and expressions of resistance reveal about materiality and the ongoing tensions between what constitutes meaningful digital and analogue immersive experiences? The results contribute to a critical, materialist perspective on digitization that encompasses both Digital’s virtues and challenges in terms of the digital transformation of physical practices and physical space. In other words, forwarding an understanding of digitalization as an intricate aesthetic shift, where identified analog sensibilities are converted into digital sensibilities, and its consequences for creating meaningful gaming experiences on behalf of the user (or player). </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article uses John Berger’s idea (1972) that images are connected to ‘ways of seeing’ to reflect on the creation of interactive visualizations of peace agreement and peace process data. We reflect on three visualizations created during a three-year long collaboration. We first describe our data, the peacebuilding ambitions for its use, and why we produced interactive forms of visualization. Second, we describe how the process of producing these visualizations created an interdisciplinary conversation and collaboration, which also connected different epistemic and geographic communities involved in peace processes. We term this ‘visualization-as-scoping’. Third, we reflect on both ‘what we saw’, through the process of visualization, how it affected policy, and the lessons we learned regarding visualization in the peacebuilding field. In the article, we argue that our experience of ‘visualization-as-scoping’ inverts traditional assumptions about the connection of data visualization to policy influence. In place of the notion of visualization-as-communication, focused on transmitting clear policy ‘messages’, we point to visualization-as-scoping as a practice of interchange, critique and re-iteration. Using John Berger as inspiration, we suggest that the ‘ways of seeing’ that result can usefully disrupt the idea of a data producing singular policy prescriptions, and rather enable people to grapple better with the complex political processes they are involved in. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> We now live in an age of unhidden gender wars where direct violence occurs within online and offline spaces. These online spaces on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram become venues for attacks on gender and woman’s rights, as well as its intersection with race and ethnicity. Such online hate expressions and networked harassments channelled towards women provide clues for us, social scientists, to understand the underlying dynamics/nature of misogyny. In this paper, by studying the online misogynistic narratives developed around the Istanbul Convention as a counter movement, I aim to highpoint the conservative and polarizing discourses that frames gender-based violence as acceptable in Turkey. More specifically I show how Twitter can be used as a platform for anti-feminist and misogynistic groups, aiming violence and hostility directly at women and their rights. As these tweets illustrate, the right-wing populist and anti-gender discourses and conservative and authoritarian politics, are being implemented on many fronts and social media is one of them. </jats:p>",

Business writers claim to offer the ideal technological and social forms central to the emergence of cyberculture.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> YouTube experienced large-scale criticism in early 2019 for predatory behavior toward children on the platform. To address concerns about children’s safety, YouTube acted quickly by demonetizing and deactivating comments on videos featuring minors. In this paper, we analyze both the company’s response to this scandal and how users received that response. We argue that YouTube’s reaction was governance-washing, which presents the appearance of vigorous platform moderation and leverages popular perceptions of technology to create the look of authority while deflecting questions about substance. While YouTubers and users did not dispute that the pedophilic comments were heinous, they questioned the effectiveness of the company’s solutions, arguing that YouTube’s platform governance actions did not solve the problem. Ultimately, we show that users have cogent critiques of governance policies that pretend to be comprehensive but fail to solve what they purport to address, and offer up the term “governance-washing” as a useful framework to make sense of such cases. </jats:p>",

    "title": "‘Definitely not in the business of wanting to be associated’: Examining public relations in a deplatformization controversy",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In August 2019, a mass shooter in the United States posted a violent manifesto to the anonymous forum 8chan prior to his attack. This was the third such incident that year and afterwards hosting and security services conceded to calls to drop 8chan as a client, pushing 8chan to the margins of the accessible internet. This article examines the deplatforming of 8chan as a public relations crisis, contributing to understanding ‘governance by shock’ (Ananny and Gillespie 2016) by examining who is shocked and their power to turn shock into online regulation. Online platforms and media attention created opportunities to study how the deplatforming was justified, drawing on the theoretical framework of economies of worth (Boltanski and Thevenot 2006) and controversy mapping methods. The examination finds: (1) that this case of deplatforming indicates the openness of infrastructure-as-a-service companies to external challenges over content, rather than hegemonic control. (2) That regulatory gaps, including the broadness of U.S. free speech laws, made these companies, rather than legal processes, the relevant authority. (3) That framing responsibility as following the law – as Cloudflare attempted to do – misunderstands the importance of normative principles, voluntary measures, and contestation in governing online content, underselling the value of policy-making at other levels. The success of the campaign to deplatform 8chan affirms the significance of PR crises in the regulation of online content, rewarding deplatforming as a political tactic for civil society groups and online networks pushing for governance in regulatory gaps. However, the significance of normative enforcement in this case underlines the difficulties of this semi-voluntary style of governance. While normative opposition to violence contributed to 8chan’s deplatforming, other normative oppositions contribute to deplatforming vulnerable users, as in the moral panics that drive the deplatforming of sexual content ( Tiidenberg 2021 ) and feed suspicion over the ideological application of deplatforming. The ambivalence of PR crises as a strategy for influencing platform governance underlines the need for clarity in policy-making at multiple levels. </jats:p>",

The position we take in this article is that place is not a thing that is merely recorded through this platform. Rather, place is something that is continually enacted, negotiated and renegotiated across multiple levels of media engagement. In developing this position, we first review the previous research on Snapchat that relates to placemaking. Then, we examine placemaking through two primary lens: Snapchat’s design and Snapchat’s business model. Our argument is that close examination of the place-based materiality and meaning of the Snapchat service for itself and for its clients reveals the interconnected construction and commodification of place through this service. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Regional discrimination is a significant social issue that leads to divided societies. In China, people from Henan Province, who are verbally abused by non-Henan users on the Internet, are often victims of regional discrimination. This article presents a case study of Chinese Internet users’ discriminatory practice against Henan people in the commentary sections of two major Chinese news portals – Tencent and NetEase. By advancing an affective critical discourse analysis approach with the assistance of content analysis, I analysed user comments on news reports that covered a news event relating to regional discrimination against Henan people. The analysis showed that Internet users’ discriminatory practice was notably amplified by the locative IP-address function in NetEase’s commentary section. The research findings shed light on the interplay between Internet users’ discursive practice and the technological architecture of interactive digital platforms in the context of regional discrimination. </jats:p>",

What distinguishes the present work from the extensive literature that precedes it is the effort to characterise the nature of interaction between image and form and, as such, could be of interest not only to architects but to those that work with media.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this article is to propose a first exploratory analysis of the Spanish YouTubers’ main productions and practices. Following the description of the emergence of YouTube in the context of media ecology, the article presents a general overview of the top 10 Spanish YouTubers’ production based on quantitative data. The study continues with a semiotic/discursive analysis of their audio-visual production’s main distinctive traits. As traditional television is imitating nowadays these new media expressions, this article also addresses the aesthetics and grammar of Yutubers, a TV program produced by Comedy Central that simulates the Spanish YouTubers channels’ aesthetics and language. The analysis concludes with a discussion on the study’s findings and a series of questions about these new media subjects. </jats:p>",

In the 'mediamorphic' process, old and new journalism should not only co-exist but also be co-evolving and converging within a complex adaptive system.

Here, I engage the ‘CST flash mob’ and its use of Bollywood dance to grapple with the democratic potential that lies at the intersection of live performance, popular culture, and new media. Situating the flash mob within Bollywood dance scholarship, I explore the global proliferation and online circulation of Bollywood flash mobs as fandom in performance. I am particularly interested in the implicit political dimensions of these performances and how these play out in local and new media contexts. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores how and why some online protests manage to gain digital resource abundance, that is, mobilising large numbers of people and attracting wide interest and support in a short space of time. The study focuses on the case of the Swedish Petrol Uprising 2.0 which after a few months managed to mobilise 630,000 members on Facebook. The article expands established theories on online mobilisation by stressing the structural elements of social media platforms and the shaping of online mobilisations through three types of factors: resources, discourses and social positions. By combining contemporary social media research with classic stage theory, we discern the significance of each factor in the three-stage mobilisation process, leading towards digital resource abundance. The article shows that digital resource abundance serves both as a blessing and a burden for online organisers. Paradoxically, social media platforms serve as a fertile ground for bringing ‘the many’ together yet also force successful groups to stay in a stage of constant mobilising. </jats:p>",

From speedrunning communities to esports leagues, expert game cultures offer key cases to explore the conventions of expert gameplay, the politics of digital play itself and the formation of networked careers. These include performances (on/off screen, by players and spectators), ownership/governance (of the game, of third-party organizations and products), and the expressions of player rights. Specifically, via two case studies, we look at how two veteran franchises – Valve Corporation’s Counter-Strike and Nintendo’s Super Mario – have engaged with the moving foundations and expressions of co-creation practices made by those engaged in high-performance networked careers of play. </jats:p>",

This article introduces terminology to illustrate how and why the online serial Homestuck qualifies as a distinctive form of storytelling. I introduce the term transmodal engagement to illustrate how Homestuck uses the affective, experiential affordances of different media forms to sculpt and shape the experience of the text in completely different ways to ‘transmedia’ storytelling. The second term this article introduces is metamedia storytelling, which describes how the audience’s familiarity with storytelling across multiple media forms can be used to manipulate their experience of fiction. Homestuck deploys metamedia storytelling to continually destabilize the reader’s understanding of the text and their investments in the storyworld by forcing re-evaluations of not just what is happening, but what kind of mediated relationship the readers have with the content of the story. </jats:p>",

Even those who have become popular for producing lifestyle content have begun to merge societal issues with personal and commercial posts. In this article, we explore how popular Finnish influencers experience the new expectations set for them and how they handle the mixture of intimate and algorithmic logics of Instagram. Our analysis draws from eight semi-structured, in-depth interviews with influencers and influencer agency representatives. Theoretically, we use the lexicon of cultural and media theory to examine Instagram as a platform for vague intimacy, where feelings and commercial exchange flourish and circulate in proximity to the political. The article revolves around three interconnected themes arising from the data: problems in producing political content for everyone, Instagram as a platform of likeness and the fear of an exploding inbox. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets (e.g. Oculus Go) have brought VR non-fiction (VRNF) within reach of at-home audiences. However, despite increase in VR hardware sales and enthusiasm for the platform among niche audiences at festivals, mainstream audience interest in VRNF is not yet proven. This is despite a growing body of critically acclaimed VRNF, some of which is freely available. In seeking to understand a lack of engagement with VRNF by mainstream audiences, we need to be aware of challenges relating to the discovery of content and bear in mind the cost, inaccessibility and known limitations of consumer VR technology. However, we also need to set these issues within the context of the wider relationships between technology, society and the media, which have influenced the uptake of new media technologies in the past. To address this work, this article provides accounts by members of the public of their responses to VRNF as experienced within their households. We present an empirical study – one of the first of its kind – exploring these questions through qualitative research facilitating diverse households to experience VRNF at home, over several months. We find considerable enthusiasm for VR as a platform for non-fiction, but we also find this enthusiasm tempered by ethical concerns relating to both the platform and the content, and a pervasive tension between the platform and the home setting. Reflecting on our findings, we suggest that VRNF currently fails to meet any ‘supervening social necessity’ (Winston, 1996, Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television. British: BFI.) that would pave the way for widespread domestic uptake, and we reflect on future directions for VR in the home. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Each new textbook strives to find a way of dealing with complex subjects that is neither simplistic nor overly complex. It is perhaps a common aim to discover a particular style or approach which will enable students to perceive the value in a forbidding subject such as semiotics prior to a more intensive study. Marcel Danesi has specialised in introducing the topic of semiotics. His Of Cigarettes, High Heels and Other Interesting things: an Introduction to Semiotics’ was set in a restaurant and illustrated the subject via the items on display. This has the virtue of beginning with a common experience and showing the relevance of media theory to a recognisable setting.",

I also argue, however, that writing studies scholars should not rely solely on these rubrics because they function in designerly, not readerly, ways that would help readers understand a text's rhetorical situation. I apply the rubrics to a new media text, ‘While Chopping Red Peppers’ (Ankerson and Sapnar, 2000), to show their limited use and to suggest that while these multimodal and new media theories have a place in writing studies, we need better methods and/or reading heuristics in order to interpret (and teach) such works. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This contribution makes a case for the convergence between technologies as a basis for public access to digital cultural heritage in an age where citizens increasingly seek alternative sources of information and have the power to choose, compare, and publish opinions of their own online. The stage on which European public broadcasters perform nowadays is being thoroughly transformed, and although the preconditions for multimedia strategies seem to be much more advantageous than just a few years ago, public broadcasters will need to decide to extend their portfolio of platforms and channels if they want to reach out to all generations, including the young ones. The Dutch public broadcaster seems to adopt an active strategy in the digital domain, however, this strategy is still expressed in technological and economical terms and takes insufficient account of the viewers' present and future media use. This touches on another angle from which to view the link between public broadcasting and ICT: the necessity for PSB to capture new user groups with innovative content, consistently clustered, and in line with the public service mandate. </jats:p>",

These platforms are spending and charging significant amounts of money to adopt a generalist strategy that rhetorically disregards demographics . However, not all SVODs operate in this manner. This article will consider examples of second (subsidiary) and third (independent) tier SVODs for whom traditional demographic thinking remains fundamental to their core business model. We examine second tier service Hayu and third tier service Passionflix as female-targeted SVODs that represent a spectrum of approaches to gendered curation, from the online extension of reality programming long-linked to cable interests, to the production and promotion of softcore erotica SVOD originals. We combine analyses of catalogues, interfaces, marketing, paratexts, and original production to consider how SVODs conceptualise, address, and court female audiences in different ways. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the textually constructed 'virtual museum' of LambdaMOO and the users that manufacture their virtual bodies within this structure. As in traditional museums, the MOO museum functions as a legitimising force for the population's activities and as a strategy for constructing aesthetic values. The traditional museum relies on a stable culturally shared understanding of what bodies, objects, spaces, art, and viewers are in order to shape meaning. It is these very characteristics that are disordered by virtual MOO environments. The on-line virtual museum requires a new theory of spectatorship because it presents a quotation, or view, of a museum rather than a physical building structure that can be explored by the corporeal body of the viewer. These performative 'views' destabilise the spectator's ability to access a factual narrative or to remain invested in the realness of the museum system. Thus, the term 'museum' and the traditional viewing body are redefined by the components of MOO environments. This article considers the ways that virtual spectatorship and the virtual museum can constitute a kind of critical work on the traditional museum. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article engages with prominent arguments about the role of public service broadcasting in the digital age and suggests that the BBC's role as a national universalist provider is one that can be accommodated within an age of identity and media pluralism. Taking the BBC's 2004 coverage of commemoration events that marked the end of the Second World War as a case study, this article combines industrial and textual analysis to investigate how the BBC utilized event programming and interactive television as a `portal' to drive viewers to online spaces. In so doing, it examines how such programming strategies worked to reassert traditional public service concerns with the national whilst simultaneously exploiting its brand value across new media platforms to cater for a fragmenting audience. The forms of interactive television discussed here are characterized by a desire to bring viewers together into one space to `engage' and `participate' under the familiar terms of the national, but crucially within the new media spaces opened to them by the BBC as `trusted guide'. The conclusion outlines how this case study might help us understand a `remediation' of public service broadcasting's role in the digital age, suggesting that the BBC's 2004 commemorative programming was particularly successful in articulating this role. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "newest technology in cars. The pocket size and the extreme portability of these technologies facilitate their role as ubiquitous mediators in the growing mobility that characterises modern societies.2 As numerous studies indicate, such technologies, particularly mobile phones, are reconfiguring work and leisure, and the way social interactions take place.3 We propose that two features of portable sound technologies are especially important in these new, increasingly global, arrangements. The first is often overlooked by media researchers. These portable devices are sound technologies. Sound instantly crosses conventional social, visual and physical boundaries and, in doing so, opens up the potential for new, often unanticipated networks of connection. Sound, in a word, travels. When sound devices travel, they further reconfigure the way private and public space is managed by how they and their user moves through them, and by how this affects hearing or overhearing. Sound, in effect, mobilises both space and social arrangements. We explore this further below.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article introduces the special issue, ‘Social Media and Platform Work: Stories, Practices, and Workers’ Organisation’. In recent years, platform labour studies have increasingly focused on how the growing platformisation of labour has changed work activities, labour processes, work organising, identities, and collectivities. The literature has highlighted the role of media, communication, and social media in platform labour, but more research is needed on these interrelationships. Precisely, the analysis of platform work is necessary due to its complexity and interest in political, economic, social, cultural, and health terms. Throughout the special issue, different contributions are presented that analyse how the emergence of these new jobs brings a set of inequalities that complexify the notion of ‘work’ and dilute workers’ rights, leading to a precarious situation. The use of social media plays a crucial role in the platformisation of labour as it enables the creation of social relationships between workers but also opens the door to communicating, disseminating their work, and even learning informally and about their work. However, the use of social media can also lead to a precarious combination of platform work and content creation – or cultural production. In this regard, it is worth noting to analyse and approach the relationship between platform work and social networks precisely by addressing both perspectives, considering possible vulnerabilities derived from these situations and situations of precariousness. </jats:p>",

    "title": "eBay Ethics",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In their efforts to construct a stable and secure digital marketplace eBay designers may have also created a workable template for an efficient neo-liberal social enclave. At one level, the business ethic on the internet’s largest auction site has the appearance and feel of honest, timely commodity exchange. With all the panoptic controls now in place, it is difficult to do otherwise, lest one risk being banned from eBay altogether. This article describes the key features of eBay’s user interface and argues that particularly in digital contexts, top-down (i.e. corporate, quasi-governmental, administrative) entities can very effectively enhance their abilities to rationalize and control an otherwise seemingly democratic, bottom-up, and peer-to-peer situation. The study also highlights important relationships between the concepts of citizen, consumer, and socio-political actor today, and speculates into the significance these various roles might play in a full-fledged digital democracy of tomorrow. </jats:p>",

The implications of these changes vary based on a range of structural dynamics such as national scale, language and pre-existing norms tied to particular macroeconomic conditions, of which, the balance of funding is key. This article looks beyond the general sense of crisis tied to digital disruption to investigate the macroeconomic conditions that shape how national television industries are able to adapt and respond to the disruption. Although disruption is universal, different macroeconomic conditions enable different industrial impacts and possible policy solutions. The article uses comparative analysis of three English language countries with very distinctive television ecologies to reveal the under-acknowledged role macroeconomic features – particularly the advent of new tools for advertising – play in shaping the options and opportunities for national industries going forward. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>What do social media users think about social media data mining? To date, this question has been researched through quantitative studies that produce diverse findings and qualitative studies adopting either a privacy or a surveillance perspective. In this article, we argue that qualitative research which moves beyond these dominant paradigms can contribute to answering this question, and we demonstrate this by reporting on focus group research in three European countries (the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain). Our method created a space in which to make sense of the diverse findings of quantitative studies, which relate to individual differences (such as extent of social media use or awareness of social media data mining) and differences in social media data mining practices themselves (such as the type of data gathered, the purpose for which data are mined and whether transparent information about data mining is available). Moving beyond privacy and surveillance made it possible to identify a concern for fairness as a common trope among users, which informed their varying viewpoints on distinct data mining practices. We argue that this concern for fairness can be understood as contextual integrity in practice (Nissenbaum, 2009) and as part of broader concerns about well-being and social justice.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>This article represents our editorial contribution to the exploration of immersive storytelling, broadly conceived in this Special Issue as a set of creative and design practices, audience experiences, a field of study and a toolkit of rapidly developing digital technologies. Herein we set out our motivation for collaborating as an interdisciplinary team seeking to interrogate and expand on celebratory industry-led discourses that (over-)emphasise the transformative potential of digital innovations for immersive storytelling without properly situating these as part of longer trajectories of creative and audience practice. We provide an account of this background context that purposefully shifts the focus from technologies of the moment – Virtual Reality, the Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence – to the underpinning storytelling that can give rise to, as well as make use of, these technologies to facilitate immersion. Having introduced the various perspectives on immersive storytelling presented in the articles collected in this Special Issue, we go on to draw out key themes, topics and approaches from the body of work as a whole. Our analysis encompasses definitional questions, interdisciplinary perspectives and the sharing of expertise. It highlights the role of users as the nexus of technology and narrative, including emotional and sensory interactions, which contribute to their agency within immersive experiences. The discussion of immersive storytelling moves beyond a focus on VR to consider the wider context, including the overlap between real-world locations and narrative content of experiences, and the importance of setting audience expectations. Because, taken together, the articles include multiple projects and case studies involving designing and making immersive experiences, it is apparent that this is an expanded, rather than normalised, design space in which inclusion and exclusion are important considerations. From these findings we put forward a future agenda for the field of immersive storytelling, which revolves around issues of accessibility, ethics and audience research.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Theories of deception in digital media often rest on the assumption that deception occurs when something in the process of communication does not work as it should – due to an intention to lie, or to faults and mistakes in the communication process. Such perspectives, however, do not fully account for the more subtle practices by which deception becomes normalized in the very functioning of digital media. This article advances the concept of ‘banal deception’ to describe deceptive mechanisms and practices that are incorporated in the functioning of media technologies, to the point that they appear indistinguishable from the media themselves – in other words, to the point of becoming ‘banal’. Through a range of examples encompassing digital and non-digital media, the article illuminates nuanced mechanisms of deception that are often not understood as such but are integral to people’s experiences with media. Banal deception mechanisms applied to media even before digitalization processes, but they are becoming increasingly relevant and ubiquitous due to the automation of communication processes sparked by platform algorithms and AI.</jats:p>",

In this phenomenon, not only did digital access become synonymous with social inclusion but inequalities were also amplified – particularly in the case of older adults (65 years and over). Contemporary older adults represent one of the most diverse spectrums of digital media users – spanning from technologically savvy to non-users. As the first generation of older adults to age\n            <jats:italic>in</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>through</jats:italic>\n            data in a data-saturated world, their understandings and experiences can teach us much about the possibilities and limitations of new media. Understanding these practices through cultural probes – like drawing, photos and writing prompts – can enable playful behaviours that not only elicit new thoughts and actions but also allow insight into some of the tacit lived experience that can support opportunities for technological use. In this paper, we ask:\n            <jats:italic>How can we playfully co-design through personas to enhance understandings of older adults’ lived experience of digital media?</jats:italic>\n            In this paper, we focus on the six co-design workshops in which we deployed personas as representations of digital experience to challenge, explore, provoke and help build nuanced tools for implementation.

Usage of hyperlinks, interactions between bloggers and readers, and accessibility of blogging sites are probed. Significant findings of the study show that bloggers have generally received positive feedback from blog readers. Study participants were satisfied with the accessibility level of blogging sites, as some viable textual alternatives to visual media elements are provided. However, inconvenient time constraints and writing about topical issues were among the most critical challenges facing visually impaired bloggers.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Public engagement, digital or in-person, is mostly adult-centric and ableist, often universalising the experience of participation of a narrow demographic (white, older and middle class). In Mindset Revolution we combined arts-based and creative methods with civic tech to co-design participatory spaces with a diverse group of young people, where to discuss and influence mental health policy and practice. The paper examines the digital element of the project, where young people, supported by a team of academics and digital designers, used the Decidim civic tech platform to engage with their peers and policymakers. This co-design work helped inform changes to the platform towards more accessible and margin-responsive participation that can better support active engagement of traditionally excluded groups. The young people evaluated their own participation and social impact, challenging assumptions about youth participation. The flexibility afforded by the digital platform was crucial to sustain engagement. However, although often branded as digital natives, the young people we worked with perceived digital participation as an enabler but not a central element of their work on social change. Follow-up work on the platform is shaping it as a space for collective oversight, with opportunities for open-ended dialogue between young people, the community and policymakers to identify and navigate barriers to implementation of young people’s proposals.</jats:p>",

Results indicate that party leaders emerge as more successful than parties in gaining attention through ‘likes’ and comments and that they offer personalized content to higher degrees than the parties they represent.

    "title": "A new understanding of ‘New Media’: Online platforms as digital mediums",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>For the last few decades, media theorists have been faced with the understanding that the networked digital computer is the meta-medium to end all mediums. This places researchers in the curious position where online platforms, such as YouTube, cannot legitimately and directly be contrasted with traditional analogue mediums, such as cinema and television. To address this inconsistency, I developed the theory of foundation technologies and their respective proto-affordances, which demonstrates the existence of past periods of ‘new media’. These were brought about by the introduction of key technologies that each offered, at the time, a new and unique underlying affordance to a society. Each new ‘proto-affordance’ inspired social disruption, as new specific mediums were spawned – each remediating existing mediums of similar mode. This framework shows digitality as another evolutionary step in a line of foundation technologies, which includes the artefact, the machine and electricity. The theory of foundation technologies permits software-based online platforms, such as YouTube, SoundCloud and Twitter, to be called digital mediums, and thus aids in understanding their technological substrate and unique affordances. Justifying this relation between old mediums and new, digital, ones equips us to more effectively comprehend and analyse these platforms as to their social adoption and uses, cultural practices, implications and effects. This allows us to better understand and control our present, and even guide our potential future.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Across Western Europe, public broadcasters have built their internet presence into sprawling sites encompassing a multitude of services. This development illustrates the need for redefining the role of public service media in a digital era. The article scrutinizes dilemmas following the emerging EU competition law-inspired policy approach to public broadcasters' internet activities, and discusses the potential public service value of online communication. The article draws on three cases representing services seemingly far removed from redistribution of radio and television: an internet discussion forum (ZDF), a web-based game (NRK), and a virtual online world activity (BBC). These sometimes controversial experiments are well suited to challenge both accustomed perceptions of public service, and ideas about the potential contributions of online communication. By scrutinizing marginal parts the article explores the limits of public broadcasters' publicly funded activities. It thereby aims to revitalize the discussion about the functions of public service as a media policy tool. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Audio for extended realities: A case study informed exposition",
    "abstract": "<jats:p>An area of immersive storytelling in rapid evolution is that of extended reality. This emergent mode of experience employs spatial mapping, and both plane and object detection to superimpose computer-generated images in the volumetric context of a physical space via a head-mounted display. This in turn produces a unique set of challenges and opportunities for associated audio implementation and aesthetics. Creative development of this audio is often a function of evolving toolsets, and the associated workflow is far from standardized. This paper forms a context for such audio workflow, one that draws from precursor technologies such as audio for games and virtual reality and develops this into an outline taxonomy that is both representative of the state of the art, and forward facing towards evolution of the technology stack. The context is framed through a series of case studies. Between 2019 and 2021, BBC and Oculus TV commissioned Alchemy Immersive and Atlantic Productions to produce virtual reality and mixed reality experiences of several classic documentary series by Sir David Attenborough: Museum Alive, Micro Monsters, First Life VR, Museum Alive AR and Kingdom of Plants. This portfolio received numerous award nominations and prizes, including from the Raindance Festival and a double Emmy. The sound design, audio postproduction and spatial audio for these experiences were implemented by the company 1.618 Digital, and drawing from first-hand-creator involvement, the workflows are deconstructed and explored with reference to tools, technologies, techniques and perception. Such an exposition forms the basis for an analysis of both this and broader creative practice in the field of audio for extended reality, and this is subsequently used to present a speculative vision of audio in the future of immersive storytelling.</jats:p>",

    "title": "When journalism and games intersect: Examining news quality, design and mechanics of political newsgames",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of games to convey the news involves wrestling with two different narrative logics: the professional culture of journalism, based on the verification of information and the standards of objectivity and truthfulness, and the culture of games, characterized by the creation of imaginary worlds, the persuasive potential of entertainment and the mechanics of the gaming experience. This article examines a sample of eight newsgame designs and the mechanisms through which they transmit information on issues related to political activity. We designed a qualitative analysis tool to examine the journalistic and gaming quality of the newsgames by analysing 28 parameters in four categories: formal parameters, content parameters, quality of use and architecture and design. Our results show that the use of playful elements is compatible with the fulfilment of journalistic quality standards and the choice of mechanics and dynamics determines how the user perceives and interacts with the information. However, the balance between both aspects does not guarantee that a newsgame provides the narrative resources to understand the information autonomously. Thus, newsgames are a genre with great journalistic potential when using the correct choice of mechanics and dynamics that allows communicating information according to news standards. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Using Netflix’s weekly Global Top 10 lists for English-language and non-English-language series and films, this article highlights some of the ways in which the world’s most popular streaming platform misrepresents both the production and consumption of its most popular geographically diverse global content. First, the Global Top 10 lists create a series of false equivalencies between the popularity of English-language and non-English-language content that mask the difference in production budgets between the two categories. Second, Netflix’s publicized data isolates the global audience distribution of non-English-language content from other economic, technological, cultural, and political factors affecting local media ecosystems as demonstrated through an analysis of South Korea. Third, in failing to account for genre-related differences, the Global Top 10 lists distorts audience behavior in the Ibero-American region. Despite the variety of limitations presented by the incomplete audience data from Global Top 10 lists, when properly contextualized with recent academic research and economic information extracted from the specialized trade press publications, this article argues that the relationship between global streaming audiences and geographically diverse content is far more complex than it appears in the Netflix’s industrial discourses. </jats:p>",

It was difficult at this point not to feel a little disappointed, given the expansive promise of the title, but it is clear that this vast topic needed to be limited in some way and Haddon provides a convincing justification for his narrow focus. The book includes chapters that address issues such as access to and careers in ICTs, children, youth and ICTs, managing relationships and social networks through ICTs, time, movement and space, and the place of ICTs in the life trajectory. The book presents a clear and helpful synthesis of research across these",

By selecting three companies in Finland, Norway and Sweden, we look at the transition from subculture into formal companies. The study is informed by an oral history approach, supplemented by a variety of other sources, including industry reports, mainstream press stories and online materials. The article argues that the presence of the demoscene in the Nordic region had an influence on the game companies, but the transition from hobbyism to professional work processes was not straightforward or simple. However, without the demoscene, the game companies would have had a difficult time finding interested and qualified employees.</jats:p>",

Variants of cyberpunk fiction are both celebratory and critical of these imaginative explorations. However, a common narrative diegesis is the dystopian account of social life under postindustrial corporate capitalism. Unlike other genres, a feature of this fiction is the use of incidental disabled characters. They are used as part of the articulation of the cultural anxieties of the able-bodied concerning new technology and the social organisation of work. One preoccupation of cyberpunk is the relationship between the body and cyberpunk technology. As the human body, in this fiction, is increasingly measured against superhuman standards, cyberpunk visualises a future of common disability in the work environment. Members of this workforce fear disability in a future where they have lost their civil rights, have little welfare provision and where physically and mentally impaired characters have the advantage in negotiating disabling environments. </jats:p>",

The new look of television, the windows aesthetic, strongly resembles the graphical user interface of the now domesticated personal computer, suggesting an interface instead of a surface. Through an examination of relationships between formal elements of television, concepts of interactivity, and modes of address, this essay demonstrates how this new commercial aesthetic is linked to an increasing commodification of television's supertext and a commodification of viewers through their participation in the text. Among the many texts and textual elements analysed are The Eurovision Song Contest, WebTV, station idents, watermarks, and the use of computer graphics in news. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "as an appreciation for one’s place in the world. This interest also grows from the belief in the educational advantage of a community approach to learning, in which learning becomes as much about building social relations and personal identities as about learning content. Leveraging the power of the internet, this interest also comes from the commercial sector which views community as a marketing strategy that both attracts new customers and creates a meaningful context for sustained participation of repeat custom. However, there are few criteria and fewer examples that illuminate what does and does not constitute community. Even less is known about the educational value of employing a community model for supporting learning, especially when most of the participation occurs online.’ It is in response to these questions that Ann Renninger and Wesley Shumar’s edited volume, Building Virtual Communities, is situated.",

    "title": "Achieving agency within imperfect automation: Working customers and self-service technologies",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we propose to treat agency as something which is accomplished in the entanglement of humans with technologies. This redirects our attention away from the question of what distinguishes humans from smart machines and towards querying how people and automated apparatuses join in processes of mutual sociomaterial engagement. To further our argument, we look at self-service kiosks, which are ubiquitous yet largely overlooked components of mediated environments. We reflect on a participant observation in groceries stores and interviews with customers familiar with self-checkout facilities. They make us aware that operating this equipment is not an individual affair but a joint activity by default, taking place in a temporally regimented setting prone to human errors and malfunction when people try to respond to the terminals’ protocol. This sort of imperfect automation has ambivalent ramifications which rely on the capabilities of users and the capacities of an interface and its underlying operations. Agency, we conclude, thus becomes a matter of viable performance in which humans may act machine-like while machines perform an expanding share of activities. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Created Identities: Hybrid Cultures and the Internet",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Homi K. Bhabha has written that authorised power in a hybrid culture ‘does not depend on the persistence of tradition; it is resourced by the power of tradition to be reinscribed through conditions of contingency and contradictoriness’ (Homi K. Bhabha, The Location of Culture, London: Routledge, 1994, p. 2). This view of culture is one aligned with concepts of flux and transition. Hybrid cultural identity is created as time progresses, in part based on contingency. The boundaries of hybrid cultures are negotiated and able to absorb diverse cultural influences: borders are active sites of intersection and overlap, which support the creation of in-between identities. Hybrid cultures are antagonistic to standing authority and cultural hegemony - hybridisation engenders diversity and heterogeneity, once framed as bastardisation. Heterogeneity and multiplicity are here underlined as important aspects of hybrid cultures. Heterogeneity, multiplicity and rupture are three aspects of Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizome that have been identified by Stefan Wray as similarly characteristic of the internet. This makes the internet an entirely suitable place to manufacture a hybrid cultural identity, with a cultural profile akin to that reported in mainstream news media. This paper maps out the above points with reference to the online/internet project the District of Leistavia welcomes you created by the author. </jats:p>",

Despite the scant attention paid by media and film studies, the author maintains that the language support functionality afforded by DVD is significant and argues that the approach treating language options as an essential add-on feature of DVD offers a productive research direction in the light of continuing globalization of audiovisual content. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The final part of the recent anthology Serialization in Popular Culture (2014) is called ‘Digital serialization’ and is devoted to ‘the influence of digital technologies on serial form’. The chapters throughout the anthology focus on modern serial phenomena such as TV series and computer games, but apart from a chapter on serial fiction in the 19th century, literature is conspicuously absent. However, the digital revolution has also left its mark on literature and given rise to new publishing strategies, including a resurgence of different forms of serialization. Some of the most notable examples of digital serial fiction are published via Twitter, and through analyses of recent Twitter stories by Jennifer Egan and David Mitchell, the article discusses how the micro-serialization of Twitter fiction both differs from and draws on the pre-digital tradition of serial fiction. In order to address these differences and similarities, the analyses focus on two interrelated aspects of serialization, temporality and interaction. Furthermore, they discuss the promotional dimension of Twitter fiction that arises as the financial dictates of legacy publishing intersect with fiction distributed via digital social media. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper considers the question of how to protect our children in conditions of information and communication technology convergence. It focuses on three traditional centres of action- government, industry and parent - in the context of the European Union. Firstly, it argues how the European Commission, in tackling the issue of internet content regulation and child protection, draws on an 'advanced liberal' form of governance. Drawing on a particular example from the UK, it secondly considers how industry has been constructed as a responsible actor and thus how the internet industry in the UK has aligned itself with the programmatic objectives of the European Commission. However, industry has also come up with regulatory solutions which are more ambivalent with regard to the European Commission objectives and the traditional principles of media and communication content regulation. Thirdly, it argues that the European Commission objective of making parents responsible for children's internet use in the home faces considerable resistance, inasmuch as the agency and geography of domestic supervision are both changing and highly contested. </jats:p>",

Another arose out of the continuous interest of Hungarian artists in new media and new tools of expression, from photography to performance, from happenings to experimental film, from installations and environments to video and computer (see Anna Balint’s review of the Artpool web site in this issue). For instance, as early as the 1920s L6szlools of expression, from photography to performance, from happen The Dynamics of the Big City (1922-24), and later in the mid-",

    "abstract": "How often have futurologists ever succeeded in making accurate global predictions? Bell’s utopian vision of a leisure-laden ‘Post-Industrial’ society now seems hopelessly naive; Fukuyama’s ‘End of history’ thesis was arguably just a fleeting Reaganite delusion about the stabilization of post Cold War politics. Notwithstanding the failure of such widely hailed prophesies, and despite the lack of any well-attested laws about the historical development of information technologies, a brazenly upbeat futurology pervades many debates on new IT. This is most obviously the case in Bill Gates’ recently updated The Road Ahead. To challenge Gates’ prognostications about the future of information technologies, I will argue for the importance of users (vis-a-vis producers) in the social shaping and ‘consumption’ of IT, especially the power of many (if not necessarily all) such users to resist falling into futures that others prescribe for them. I contend that the non-passivity of IT users undermines the cogency of any claims about the inevitability of technological change, and helps to explain why so many past ‘futures’ of IT have never fully materialized.",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is a redevelopment of my previous studies, characterizing the media genre of – and community building through – transgender video blogging. Focusing on one of the most famous video bloggers at the moment, the Canadian Julie Van Vu, I investigate new forms of transgender vlogging that embrace money making/self-commodification in a degree not seen before. Here, activism/advocacy co-exists with and goes through an explicit self-commodification. Drawing on existing research, I explore the mechanisms and characteristics of Vu as a micro-celebrity within YouTube as a platform. I suggest the concept of ‘subcultural microcelebrity’ to nuance, diversify and specify micro-celebrity as a concept and a practice. The article departs from – but also redevelops – the concept and characteristics of micro-celebrity to specify the ‘affective labour’. Micro-celebrities are expected to perform various kinds of labour, many of which are time and energy consuming but not necessarily economically profitable. Micro-celebrities must signal accessibility, availability, presence, and connectedness – and maybe most importantly authenticity – all of which presuppose and rely on some form of intimacy. I propose that intimacy as genre and as capital is deeply ingrained in the strategies, dynamics and affective labour of micro-celebrities. Intimacy is an important and necessary signifier in relation to both the form and content of the videos and the relation between the creators and their audience. Furthermore, intimacy works as an important currency within social media; thus, intimacy can be capitalized in manifold and intersecting ways, for example, for monetary purposes, social recognition and as a tool in advocacy work. The article hereby contributes to existing research on YouTube by redeveloping the concept of micro-celebrity in relation to affective labour and intimacy, analysing how these play out in new forms of transgender vlogging. </jats:p>",

Moreover, we reflect on the theoretical and empirical significance of merging news with games as a way to reformulate normative assumptions, production practices and consumption patterns. As a result, the boundaries between journalism and game’s logics start to erode, and they begin to find new ways of converging. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> In a context where Twitter has come under criticism for enabling and encouraging hostile communication, this article explores how users adopt a ‘Twitter face’ when navigating interactions on the platform. Extending Goffman’s observation that face-work is applicable to both immediate and mediated interaction, this article provides a novel application of face-work on Twitter. Reporting on data from an online questionnaire completed by general Twitter users, we explore how uncivil interaction is experienced on the platform and the interaction strategies users employ to protect their face. We examine how interactions on the platform can lead to a ritual break-down that generate forms of alienation arising from aggressive uses of face-work. We contend that attempts to enhance Twitter as a medium by limiting and restricting particular interactions are ultimately attempts at shaping Twitter’s affordances. In analysing user experience, our discussion considers how incivility is responded to and how the platform encourages users to engage in the avoidance components of face-work, while simultaneously inhibiting the easy adoption of its restorative dimensions. While both dimensions of face-work are vital, the downplaying of restorative aspects of face-work arguably undermines Twitter’s efforts to encourage inclusive interactions across the platform. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores how people have reconfigured their dis/connective repertoires during COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns. Relying on a media ecology approach and on 45 interviews carried out in different parts of the world, it tackles two limitations of the digital disconnection literature, namely social media reductionism and universalism, advancing a theoretical and empirical contribution. Firstly, it explores and unfolds dis/connective practices in relation to an intricate multiplicity of old and new practices, technologies, platforms and formats, foregrounding three key dynamics in the reconfiguration of dis/connective repertoires: intensification, (re)discovery and abandonment. Then, it critically drills down into the uneven power relations, divides and inequalities that traverse these three dynamics. This article demonstrates that dis/connective practices are carried out across variable configurations of devices, formats and platforms and shaped by privileges and imbalances that are particularly severe in the context of the Global South. In doing so, this article complexifies taken-for-granted assumptions regarding the meanings of dis/connection, establishing a dialogue with digital inequality and labour studies, hence unfolding new horizons of inquiry for digital disconnection studies. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> News and media web pages generate valuable consumer data, collected by third-party servers. Using longitudinal experiments, this article shows that third-party servers are active in 34 cases of European public service media (PSM) websites from 19 countries. This constitutes a pressing privacy problem in relation to GDPR and challenges the notion of PSM organizations as particularly trusted providers of media content. This has implications for their role and placement in the commercial media landscape as well as for their independency, but also for their survival in the future media landscape. Our analysis shows not only connections between the presence of advertisement and the number of third-party servers found but also a reflection of different types of European media systems. To provide a benchmark for our analysis, we also analysed 64 private media websites for the presence of third-party servers. The empirical results suggest a pressing need for discussions on whether and how PSM organizations can participate in the commercial web ecology of user data exchange and utilization, for example, for the purposes of user profiling, targeting and PSM performance measurement. </jats:p>",

We examined the resulting humorous and memetic discourse on Twitter as well as its coverage in news media combining a content analysis of the multimodal tweets with a qualitative discourse analysis of German and British news media. The results show that the ironic memes in which researchers addressed sexism in academia by parodying social norms and ideals of ‘sexiness’ yielded substantial media attention, but with differences in the two countries: While the hashtag #distractinglysexy initiated a broader debate on sexism and discrimination in academia in the UK news media discourse, in the German context, this form of ‘self-mediation’ was portrayed either as ‘something funny on the Web’ or as a harmful firestorm. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The article compares two key events that marked the narratives around the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in two different time frames: the game series between the Russian world champion Garry Kasparov and the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue held in New York in 1997, and the Go game series between the South Korean champion Lee Sedol and DeepMind’s AI AlphaGo held in Seoul in 2016. Relying on a corpus of primary and secondary sources such as newspapers and specialized magazines, biographic books, the live broadcasts and the main documentaries reporting the challenges, the article investigates the way in which IBM and Google DeepMind used the human–machine competition to narrate the emergence of a new, deeper, form of AI. On the one hand, the Kasparov–Deep Blue match was presented by broadcasting media and IBM itself as a conflictual and competitive form of struggle between human kind and a hardware-based, obscure and humanlike player. While on the other hand, the social and symbolic message promoted by DeepMind and the media conveyed a cooperative and fruitful interaction with a new software-based, transparent and un-humanlike form of AI. The analysis of the case studies reveals how AI companies mix narrative tropes, gaming and spectacle in order to promote the newness and the main features of their products. In particular, recent narratives of AI based on human feelings and values such as beauty and trust can shape the way in which the presence of intelligent systems is accepted and integrated in everyday life. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> What happens when a person engages with a virtual world? Are there unique processes of engagings that occur? One approach to understanding how a person makes sense of a virtual world is to compare the engaging processes with other media technologies, focusing on situated performative and interpretive sense-makings. This article reports on a study conducted to compare how novices make sense of four media technologies: film, console videogames, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and social virtual worlds. Using Dervin’s Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) and our conceptualization of media reception situations, we extracted five potential overlapping sense-making concepts to make comparisons that do not presume a priori the influences of characteristics of technologies and other structures. The five comparative concepts all focus on situated sense-making processes. Our purpose in this article is not to present a full study report but rather to illustrate the methodological approach used in the data collection/production and analysis of the study. Results of our analyses indicate the complexity of media reception situations, how they converged and diverged, and how they involve multiple potential influences on media reception outcomes. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Immersive storytelling includes narrative experiences that take place in the public spaces of theaters, theme parks, museums, and historical reenactment sites; on tabletops, where role-playing games are collaboratively played; in fictional spaces superimposed on the real world during a live-action role-playing (larping) event; and in hybrid, asynchronous, and transmediated spaces that blend the digital, the virtual, and the real. Understood as a kind of boundary object, a player typology can incorporate multiple perspectives and heterogeneous sources of information, producing ‘ideal types’, which provide a framework for observation and discussion across immersive modalities. This paper offers a typology of situated immersive preference, in which narrative immersion and embodied immersion are understood to vary independently of one another. Along the vertical axis listener-players of immersive storytelling experiences are classified as narratively attached, narratively detached, or narratively opposed. Across the horizontal axis of embodied engagement, listener-players are classified as invisible, aesthetic, or enrolled. Nine ideal types emerge at the intersection of these narrative and embodied preferences. Why someone might fit into one category rather than another reflects comfort rather than personality. Situated immersive types are understood to be fluid and temporary configurations. The degree to which players are willing to engage and are comfortable with what they are being asked to do may differ dramatically from experience to experience and from day to day, and even during a single session, reflecting how they feel at a given moment, which is affected by who they are with and how they are perceived and treated by others. This framework for understanding immersive preferences calls for the design of more widely inclusive story worlds.</jats:p>",

While the ethos of Agre’s work to bridge the split identity of critique and craft can readily be found in reflexive design or software art, these cases are not always situated within broader ecologies of practice that also grapple with the asymmetries and exploitative aspects of interface design. Drawing from software studies and media theoretical accounts of the interface as a fluid milieu, I provide a navigational matrix to contextualize modes of interface critique at large, namely specifying traps and enclosures, surfacing asymmetries and augmenting alternatives. I argue, finally, that these modes provide an invitation to develop new metacritical theories and common capacities, particularly through the possibilities of grappling with systems of domination otherwise built to prefigure our experiences of them. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Digital disconnection has risen as a new and necessary act of care that individuals perform to counter the burdens associated with 24/7 connectivity. Resources to perform such caring tasks, however, are known to be unequally distributed. Leaning on feminist theory and digital disconnection studies, this study explores whether this unequal distribution also extends to the realm of digital disconnection by examining who is portrayed to care about digital disconnection in marketing communication of digital disconnection products and services. Through a critical discourse analysis, we find that digital disconnection is foremost presented as an individualized responsibility, meaning that the particular responsibility to (re-) gain control, focus and productivity, lies with the individual user. This responsible individual is feminized in most communications, except for highly masculinized, entrepreneurial-oriented forms of commodified digital disconnection. Overall, our analysis highlights how stereotypical gendered caring roles and processes of individual responsibilization are reinforced in commodified digital products and services. To breach this vicious circle, we argue that it is crucial to bring awareness to the essentialness of digital disconnection care work to ensure that disconnection opportunities and responsibilities are not dictated by social inequalities generated by neoliberal logics. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Researching YouTube",
    "abstract": "As famously known, YouTube was founded in February 2005 by three PayPal employees. Less than 2 years later, Google acquired YouTube for a fee of $1.65 billion, at a point when the major significance of a raft of new websites based on user-generated content, such as Wikipedia, Myspace and Facebook, was becoming increasingly apparent. The cover of Time magazine duly announced ‘You’ as the winner of their Person of the Year Award for 2006, alongside a reflective mirror within a YouTube style of computer screen interface (Time, 2006). While many social media proved to be ephemeral, YouTube continues to rapidly expand and has become the second most visited website in the world. It has thereby established a unique role as a repository of popular culture, creating a diachronic archive over time as well as synchronically expanding in its scope. In his paper on ‘YouTube Channels, uploads and views’ published in this special issue, Matthias Bärtl estimates that by 2016 the total number of videos hosted on the site was around four billion. Showing how the quantity of content uploaded on YouTube has expanded exponentially over the years, Bärtl also demonstrates the waning probability of being in the top 3% of the most watched videos, which attract 85% of views. Fifty percent of videos uploaded in 2016, attracted 89 views or fewer. Even so, some new channels were able to attract a lot of attention with videos in the Comedy, Entertainment, Gaming, how to and style categories having an above-average chance of reaching the top 3%. But this distribution has changed over time. Entertainment has been the most popular category only since 2013, while the popularity of News and Politics fluctuates, with peaks occurring during the political upheavals of 2008 and 2016 as well as in response to shorter news cycles. The majority of newly created channels since 2010 have been in the People and Blogs category, reaching close to 75% in 2016. Despite the attention these channels have attracted from journalists and academics fascinated by the development of a new",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> The implementation of physical distancing measures and lockdowns across the globe to control the spread of COVID-19 has led to the home becoming a focal point of exercise and fitness activities for many people. A plethora of digital tools were hastily assembled to help people workout at home or in spaces close to home: including apps with workout suggestions, online videos and livestreamed fitness classes. In this article, we draw on our empirical material collected through semi-structured interviews and virtual ethnographic home tours with Australian adults to explore the ‘pandemic fitness assemblages’ generated with and through their improvised pandemic fitness practices inside and outside their homes. These materials illustrate how bodies, digital and non-digital technologies, and place and space came together and help to surface the affects, sensations and embodiments that emerged. We describe how people’s re-imagined fitness practices contributed to daily routines, transformed the atmospheres of the home and yielded affective experiences of escape. To do so, we think with sociospatial and feminist materialism theoretical frameworks that emphasise the generative relationships emerging between human and more-than-human forces and entities. Our analysis further illuminates the situatedness and relationality of these heterogeneous forces and considers how they come to matter within the broader sociomaterial context of COVID-19. </jats:p>",

Following an approach informed by media studies on wildlife photography and film, and science and technology studies as well as insights from interviews with users and participant observation in the Los Angeles area, this article makes the case that mobile applications such as iNaturalist sit at a tension because while they can ignite interest in the natural environment, they also prescriptively describe and normalize a ‘nature’ and an epistemology that are particular to the natural sciences. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Embodied parallelism and immersion in virtual reality gaming",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that virtual reality produces a sense of immersion through embodied parallelism – a technical mediation in which the embodied gestures and movements of a player must correspond to what is represented within a VR game, a correspondence which relies on, but exceeds the visual and requires strange requirements for both player (in terms of their gestures and movements) and game (in terms of including particular limits that police the movements of the player’s body). Attending to embodied parallelism refuses several longstanding assumptions about how virtual reality technologies, and media in general, generate the feeling of immersion – namely, the idea that immersion ‘disembodies’ in some way, or denies the existence of physical space beyond the boundary of a mediated simulation. Immersivity is premised on an explicit engagement with – and not exclusion of – both the physicality of the body and the physicality of a medium, if in deeply contradictory ways. As a case study to develop this concept, this article discusses the emerging virtual reality genre of ‘physics games’, games including, but not limited to, Blade &amp; Sorcery, Boneworks and Half-Life: Alyx. These games take great lengths to simulate the physics of objects – they require simultaneously intrusive and yet ‘natural’ interfaces, in which the game demands the body to move as if it were manipulating objects that have a specific mass. Becoming ‘good’ at these games depends on the ability to discipline the body and conform to the demands of movement required by the simulation. Immersion, in this context, depends on a willingness to submit to these machinic, embodied demands, relying both explicitly on technical form but deliberately forgetting the materiality of gesture and mediation at the same time. This seeming contradiction, an engagement with both the materiality of gesture and the materiality of medium, is ‘solved’ through embodied parallelism and how it links player and game. </jats:p>",

Connectivity has become the material and metaphorical wiring of our culture, a culture in which technologies shape and are shaped not only by economic and legal frames, but also by users and content. The emergence of social media platforms is at the heart of a shifting dynamic, where various actors (technology, users, content, legal and economic actors) are building a connective space for communication and information. In order to comprehend this interwovenness, Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory will be invoked to explore how social media platforms can be analysed as techno-socio-cultural artefacts; this theoretical framework will be complemented by Castells’ political-economy approach to arrive at a fuller understanding of how social media operate.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to understand the practices and meanings associated with the creation and use of private chat groups on instant messaging services such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger and WeChat that are accessible only to platform workers of online food delivery services. We draw on participant observation in five countries (Italy, Spain, Mexico, China, and India), in-depth interviews with 68 food delivery couriers and digital ethnography ( Pink et al., 2015 ) within dozens of online private chat groups of food delivery workers. Our fieldwork shows that private chat groups are extremely relevant in the daily work of delivery workers and are appropriated to restore forms of mutualism not afforded by the food delivery apps. Following Costa (2018) and her concept of affordances- in-practice, we describe how the practice of online private chat groups created by platform workers affords: (1) the emergence of communities of practice; (2) resistance and contempt; (3) mutualism and solidarity. We argue that these workers ‘enact’ the affordances of instant messaging apps, to supplement – from below – the affordances of food delivery apps that were denied or ignored by food delivery companies. We argue that these affordances constitute cooperative affordances. This concept captures the cooperative nature of peer-to-peer communication that occurs within the informal online chat groups created by the workers themselves. Finally, this article contributes to affordance theory by highlighting how affordances are not immanent properties of artifacts, or ‘invariants’, as argued by Gibson (1979) , but can be ‘enacted’ by specific users, like food delivery workers, within specific social and cultural contexts. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Dreaming with data: Cultivating critical consciousness in datafied living research",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses data reflexivity in terms of critical consciousness-raising by linking people’s everyday encounters with data to their speculative visions about datafied futures. We suggest everyday encounters with data about oneself might play an important role in facilitating both personal and collective imagination about data and devising future paths towards legitimate and meaningful datafied living. Lending inspiration from the figure of the researcher as critical companion and from speculative design, we posit that critical consciousness-raising is not something generated purely by way of informing people about datafication, but built from below, through people’s everyday experiences with datafying themselves and being datafied by others. Furthermore, it is deeply intertwined with datafication research itself, and the way we seek to establish links between individual and collective experiences and evaluations of data practices. Based on this, the paper offers three methodological entry points for exploring how critical consciousness can be cultivated and collectivized: longitudinal fieldwork with repeated interviews, data visualization derived from people’s own phones, and speculative workshops on future data practices. </jats:p>",

    "title": "Digitally skilled but socially disadvantaged: Enabling digital capabilities in low-income families",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a case study of smart home technology use in a low-income household, focussing on the paradox within the digital divide of having high digital skills while experiencing social disadvantage. Contextualised within a larger study of digital disadvantage in low-income households, we use an ethnographic case study approach to examine the experiences of a single parent who lives with her son in public housing and uses various smart home and assistive technologies to manage the home environment and their health and disability. Countering macro studies that equate low-income and disability with digital exclusion, we explore the ‘enabling capabilities’ associated with using digital technologies to address disadvantage. Our case study is contextualised against the typical digital inclusion challenges faced by low-income families and draws on Sen and Nussbaum’s capabilities approach to addressing social inequalities. The paper highlights the need to support situation-specific digital capability development and flexible technology and social welfare arrangements. Our findings and approach contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how to address digital inequality. </jats:p>",

    "title": "The new ethical thinking in CGI immersive journalism",
    "abstract": "<jats:p> Virtual reality (VR) journalism has become one of the popular formats of journalism, where people experience presence, empathy, and immersion through VR technology in digital environments. Although the term ‘virtual’ may appear to be the opposite of ‘real,’ the boundary between virtuality and reality has become blurred due to the virtual embodiment being part of reality for participants. As VR and real virtuality converge, little is known about the ethical issues in producing computer-generated imagery (CGI) immersive journalism and the viewers’ responses to CGI VR news reporting. Our study applied a concurrent mixed-method approach, including in-depth interviews with eight CGI professionals from the U.K. and a quantitative survey in Taiwan, to understand the production issues, ethical concerns, and audience perceptions toward CGI immersive journalism. Results from the interviews suggested that digital journalists need to rethink their ethical codes, particularly the representation of truth while producing news stories using CGI images and VR. Findings from the post-test survey showed that both immersive presence and interactivity in VR news resulted in a greater formation of believing and motivations to take action regarding the topic presented in the VR news. </jats:p>",
