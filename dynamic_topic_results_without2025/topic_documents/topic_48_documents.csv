This essay concludes by challenging whether conversations around authenticity will persist in dialogues about online video.","",""
"2011","YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?"," This article compares YouTube and the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) as resources for television historians interested in viewing old Australian television programs. The author searched for seventeen important television programs, identified in a previous research project, to compare what was available in the two archives and how easy it was to find. The analysis focused on differences in curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloguing. NFSA is stronger in current affairs and older programs, while YouTube is stronger in game shows and lifestyle programs. YouTube is stronger than the NFSA on “human interest” material—births, marriages, and deaths. YouTube accessioning more strongly accords with popular histories of Australian television. Both NFSA and YouTube offer complete episodes of programs, while YouTube also offers many short clips of “moments.” YouTube has more surprising pieces of rare ephemera. YouTube cataloguing is more reliable than that of the NFSA, with fewer broken links. The YouTube metadata can be searched more intuitively. The NFSA generally provides more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates. ","",""
"2012","User-Generated Warfare: A Case of Converging Wartime Information Networks and Coproductive Regulation on YouTube","User-generated content-sharing (UGC) platforms, such as YouTube, emerged as venues for competing wartime information and images among military, insurgent, and civilian user groups during the Iraq War. This article introduces user-generated warfare (UGW) as a theoretical concept to articulate this phenomenon and consider its implications for reshaping wartime information networks and flows outside of formal institutions. It is a variant of “netwar” that further locates this generative user activity within the sociotechnical infrastructure of the UGC platform. The present analysis examines an instance of UGW that highlights how user agency is configured through the coproduction of affordance and constraint via the YouTube platform and within a communicative context in which wartime user networks are converging outside formal channels.","",""
"2012","The institutionalization of YouTube: From user-generated content to professionally generated content"," This article explores the institutionalization of YouTube: its transformation from user-generated content (UGC) – oriented as a virtual village – into a professionally generated content (PGC) video site, especially after being purchased by Google. YouTube has influenced the traditional media environment, but at the same time this new medium imitates the rules of the old media, including legally managed distribution of broadcasting content and smooth links between content and commercials. YouTube constitutes an evolution of the present media milieu, rather than a revolution. On the other hand, the dominance of mainstream media is, to a degree, still compromised in UGC culture. The emancipatory dimension of UGC media (e.g. as democratic, creative outlet with high accessibility and online library potential) is discussed in the conclusion, not losing sight of the technological-economic limitations placed on its continuing promise.

"2015","YouTube pranking across cultures","Online pranking videos are common online and popular among middle-school students, teens and young adults. When we examined 200 YouTube examples of the Scary Maze Game prank, we explored the relationship between perpetrator, victim and witness, finding that while American children under age 12 were commonly featured as victims in Scary Maze Game prank videos, only rarely were German children represented as victims. U.S. videos also lingered on the pain of prank victims, even looping the emotional response of the victim to create an instant replay effect and using post-production techniques, including editing, music and title credits. As an expression of the schadenfreude that people experience when both enacting and viewing bad pranks, online pranking is a dimension of the dark side of participatory culture.","",""
"2015","Vlogging about school on YouTube: An exploratory study"," An exploratory mixed-methods study involving a combination of online ethnography and descriptive statistics was conducted to investigate school-related vlogging. Five areas were emphasized: (1) characteristics of school-related vlogs, vloggers, and viewers; (2) vlog context (where recording occurred); (3) vlog content (what was said and shown); (4) vlogger culture (patterns of speech or practice); and (5) motivations for vlogging about school. A purposive sample of 120 personal video blogs (vlogs) was collected through a systematic process on YouTube during a three-month period. Results of the study revealed that vloggers were young, recorded in multiple settings including classrooms, showed and described their school experiences, shared a vocabulary for interacting with an audience, and vlogged for a variety of reasons including the desire to alleviate boredom, for fun, because friends were doing it, to build confidence or improve their speaking skills, document their experiences, share information, or to connect with others.

"2016","Exploring YouTube as a Transformative Tool in the “The Power of MAKEUP!” Movement","IntroductionSince its launch in 2005, YouTube has fast become one of the most popular video sharing sites, one of the largest sources of user generated content, and one of the most frequently visited sites globally (Burgess and Green). As YouTube’s popularity has increased, more and more people have taken up the site’s invitation to “Broadcast Yourself.” Vlogging (video blogging) on YouTube has increased in popularity, creating new genres and communities. Vlogging not only allows individuals to create their own mediated content for mass consumption—making it a site for participatory culture (Burgess and Green; Jenkins) and resembling contemporary forms of entertainment such as reality television—but it also allows individuals to engage in narrative and identity forming practices. Through filming their everyday lives, and presenting themselves on camera, YouTubers are engaging in a process of constructing and presenting their identity online. They often form communities around these identities and continue the practice in dialogue and collaboration with their communities of viewers on YouTube. Because of YouTube’s mass global reach, the ability to create one’s own mediated content and the ability to publicly play with and project different self representations becomes a powerful tool allowing YouTubers to publicly challenge social norms and encourage others to do the same. This paper will explore these features of YouTube using the recent “The Power of MAKEUP!” movement, started by NikkieTutorials, as an example. Through a virtual ethnography of the movement as developed by Christine Hine—following the people, dialogue, connections, and narratives that emerged from Nikkie’s original video—this paper will demonstrate that YouTube is not only a tool for self transformation, but has wider potential to transform norms in society. This is achieved mainly through mobilising communities that form around transformative practices, such as makeup transformations, on YouTube. Vlogging as an Identity Forming Practice Vlogging on YouTube is a contemporary form of autobiography in which individuals engage in a process of documenting their life on a daily or weekly basis and, in doing so, constructing their identity online. Although the aim of beauty vlogs is to teach new makeup techniques, demonstrate and review new products, or circulate beauty-related information, the videos include a large amount of self-disclosure. Beauty vloggers reveal intimate things about themselves and actively engage in the practice of self-representation while filming. Beauty vlogging is unique to other vlogging genres as it almost always involves an immediate transformation of the physical self in each video. The vloggers typically begin with their faces bare and “natural” and throughout the course of the video transform their faces into how they want to be seen, and ultimately, who they want to be that day, using makeup. Thus the process of self-representation is multi-dimensional as not only are they presenting the self, but they are also visually constructing the self on camera. The construction of identity that beauty vloggers engage in on YouTube can be likened to what Robert Ezra Park and later Erving Goffman refer to as the construction and performance of a mask. In his work Race and Culture, Park states that the original meaning of the word person is a mask (249). Goffman responds to this statement in his work The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, saying the mask is “our truer self, the self we would like to be” (30). Beauty vloggers are engaging in the process of constructing their mask—their truer self and the self they would like to be—both through their performance on YouTube, and through the visual transformation that takes place on camera. Their performance on YouTube not only communicates a desired identity, but through their performance they realise this identity. The process of filming and the visual process of constructing or transforming the self on camera through makeup brings the subject into being. Scholarship in the fields of Life Writing and Digital Media including Autobiography, Automedia and Persona Studies has acknowledged and explored the ways narratives and identities—both online and offline—are constructed, created, shaped, chosen, and invented by the individual/author (Garner; Bridger; Eakin; Maguire; Poletti and Rak; Marshall; Smith and Watson). It is widely accepted that all representations of the self are constructed. Crucially, it is the process of documenting or communicating the self that is identity forming (Richardson; Bridger), as the process, including writing, filming, and posting, brings the subject or self into being (Neuman). The individual embodies their performance and realises the self through it. Park and Goffman argue that we all engage in this process of performing and realising the self through the roles we play in society. The significance of the beauty vlogger performance and transformation is the space in which it occurs and the community that it fosters.  YouTube as a Transformative Tool and MirrorThe space in which beauty vloggers play with and transform the self on camera is significant as digital technologies such as YouTube invite exploration of the self. Networked digital media (Meikle and Young) invite multiplicity, heterogeneity, and fragmentation in/of identity performances (Bolter; Gergen; Turkle, """"Parallel Lives""""). These technologies create opportunities for defining and re-defining the self (Bolter 130), as they allow people to present a more multi-mediated self, using both audio-visual components and text (Papacharissi 643).YouTube, in particular, allows the individual to experiment with the self, and document an ongoing transformation, through film (Kavoori). Many scholars have described this ongoing process of identity construction online using the metaphor of “the mirror” (see Kavoori; Raun; and Procter as recent examples). In his research on trans gender vlogging on YouTube, Tobias Raun explores the theme of the mirror. He describes vlogging as a “transformative medium for working on, producing and exploring the self” (366). He argues the vlog acts as a mirror allowing the individual to try out and assume various identities (366). He writes, the mirroring function of the vlog “invites the YouTuber to assume the shape of a desired identity/representation, constantly assuming and evaluating oneself as an attractive image, trying out different ‘styles of the flesh’ (Butler 177), poses and appearances” (367). In reference to trans gender vlogging, Raun writes, “The vlog seems to serve an important function in the transitioning process, and is an important part of a process of self-invention, serving as a testing ground for experimentations with, and manifestations of (new) identities” (367). The mirror (vlog) gives the individual a place/space to construct and perform their mask (identity), and an opportunity to see the reflection and adjust the mask (identity) accordingly. An important feature of the vlog as a mirror is the fact that it is less like a conventional mirror and more like a window with a reflective surface. On YouTube the vlog always involves an audience, who not only watch the performance, but also respond to it. This is in keeping with Goffman’s assertion that there is always an audience involved in any performance of the self. On YouTube, Raun argues, “the need to represent oneself goes hand in hand with the need to connect and communicate” (Raun 369). Networked digital media such as YouTube are inherently social. They invite participation (Smith; Sauter)and community through community building functions such as the ability to like, subscribe, and comment. Michael Strangelove refers to YouTube as a social space, “as a domain of self-expression, community and public confession” (4). The audience and community are important in the process of identity construction and representation as they serve a crucial role in providing feedback and encouragement, legitimising the identity being presented. As Raun writes, the vlog is an opportunity “for seeing one’s own experiences and thoughts reflected in others” (366). Raun identifies that for the trans gender vloggers in his study, simply knowing there is an audience watching their vlogs is enough to affirm their identity. He writes the vlog can be both “an individual act of self validation and . . . a social act of recognition and encouragement” (368). However, in the case of beauty vlogging the audience do more than watch, they form communities embodying and projecting the performance in everyday life and thus collectively challenge social norms, as seen in the “The Power of MAKEUP!” movement. Exploring the “The Power of MAKEUP!” MovementOn 10 May 2015, Nikkie, a well-known beauty vlogger, uploaded a video to her YouTube channel NikkieTutorials titled “The Power of MAKEUP!” Nikkie’s video can be watched here. In her video Nikkie challenges “makeup shaming,” arguing that makeup is not only fun, but can “transform” you into who you want to be. Inspired by an episode of the reality television show RuPaul’s Drag Race, in which the competing drag queens transform half of their face into “glam” (drag), and leave the other half of their face bare (male), Nikkie demonstrates that anyone can use makeup as a transformative tool. In her video Nikkie mirrors the drag queen transformations, transforming half her face into “glam” and leaving the other half of her face bare, as shown in Figure 1. In only transforming half of her face, Nikkie emphasises the scope of the transformation, demonstrating just how much you can change your appearance using only makeup on your face. Nikkie’s video communicates that both a transformed “glam” image and an “unedited” image of the self are perfectly fine, “there are no rules” and neither representations of the self should bring you shame.  Figure 1: thumbnail of Nikkie’s videoNikkie’s video started a movement and spread throughout the beauty community on YouTube as a challenge. Other famous beauty vloggers, and everyday makeup lovers, took on the challenge of creating YouTube videos or posting pictures on Instagram of their faces half bare and half transformed using makeup with the tag #thepowerofmakeupchallenge. Since its release in May 2015, Nikkie’s video has been watched over thirty million times, has been liked over five hundred and thirty thousand times, and has received over twenty three thousand comments, many of which echo Nikkie’s experience of “makeup shaming.” “The power of makeup” video went viral and was picked up not only by the online beauty community but also by mainstream media with articles by Huffington Post, Yahoo.com, Marie Claire, BuzzFeed, DailyLife, POPSUGAR, Enews, Urbanshowbiz, BoredPanda, and kickvick among others. On Instagram, thousands of everyday makeup lovers have recreated the transformation and uploaded their pictures of the finished result. Various hashtags have been created around this movement and can be searched on Instagram including #thepowerofmakeupchallenge, #powerofmakeupchallenge, #powerofmakeup. Nikkie’s Instagram page dedicated to the challenge can be seen here. “The power of makeup” video is a direct reaction against what Nikkie calls “makeup shaming”—the idea that makeup is bad, and the assumption that the leading motivation for using makeup is insecurity. In her video Nikkie also reacts to the idea that the made-up-girl is “not really you,” or worse is “fake.” In the introduction to her video Nikkie says,I’ve been noticing a lot lately that girls have been almost ashamed to say that they love makeup because nowadays when you say you love makeup you either do it because you want to look good for boys, you do it because you’re insecure, or you do it because you don’t love yourself. I feel like in a way lately it’s almost a crime to love doing your makeup. So after last weeks RuPaul’s Drag Race with the half drag half male, I was inspired to show you the power of makeup. I notice a lot that when I don’t wear makeup and I have my hair up in a bun and I meet people and I show them picture of my videos or, or whatever looks I have done, they look at me and straight up tell me “that is not you.” They tell me “that’s funny” because I don’t even look like that girl on the picture. So without any further ado I’m going to do half my face full on glam—I’m truly going to transform one side of my face—and the other side is going to be me, raw, unedited, nothing, me, just me. So let’s do it.In her introduction, Nikkie identifies a social attitude that many of her viewers can relate to, that the made-up face isn’t the “real you.” This idea reveals an interesting contradiction in social attitude. As this issue of Media/Culture highlights, the theme of transformation is increasingly popular in contemporary society. Renovation shows, weight loss shows, and “makeover” shows have increased in number and popularity around the world (Lewis). Tania Lewis attributes this to an international shift towards “the real” on television (447). Accompanying this turn towards “the real,” confession, intimacy, and authenticity are now demanded and consumed as entertainment (Goldthwaite; Dovey; King). Sites such as YouTube are arguably popular because they offer real stories, real lives, and have a core value of authenticity (Strangelove; Wesch; Young; Tolson). The power of makeup transformations are challenging because they juxtapose a transformation against the natural, on the self. By only transforming half their face, the beauty vloggers juxtapose the “makeover” (transformation) with “authenticity” (the natural). The power of makeup movement is therefore caught between two contemporary social values. However, the desire for authenticity, and the lack of acceptance that the transformed image is authentic seems to be the main criticism that the members of this movement receive.  Beauty vloggers identify a strong social value that “natural” is “good” and any attempt to alter the natural is taboo. Even in the commercial world “natural beauty” is celebrated and features heavily in the marketing and advertising campaigns of popular beauty, cosmetic, and skincare brands. Consider Maybelline’s emphasis on “natural beauty” in their byline “Maybe she’s born with it. Maybe it’s Maybelline.” This is not the way the members of “the power of makeup” movement use and celebrate makeup. They use and celebrate makeup as a transformative and identity forming tool, and their use of makeup is most often criticised for not being natural. In her recreation of Nikkie’s video, Evelina Forsell says “people get upset when I’m not natural.” Like Nikkie, Evelina reveals she often receives the criticism that “the person with a full on face with makeup is not you.” Evelina’s video can be watched here.“The power of makeup” movement and its participants challenge this criticism that the made-up self is not the “real” self. Evelina directly responds to this criticism in her video, stating “when I have a full face of makeup . . . that’s still me, but a more . . . creative me, I guess.” The beauty vloggers in this movement use makeup and YouTube as extensions of the self, as tools for self-expression, self-realisation, and ongoing transformation. Beauty vloggers are demonstrating that makeup is a tool and extension of the self that allows them to explore and play with their self-representations. In the same way that technology enables the individual to extend and “reinvent him/herself online” (Papacharissi 645), so does makeup. And in the same way that technology becomes an extension of the self, or even a second self (Turkle, The Second Self; Vaast) so does makeup. Makeup is a tool and technique of the self. Vlogging is about storytelling (Kavoori), but it is also collective—it’s about telling collective stories (Raun 373) which can be seen in various vlogging genres. As Geert Lovink suggests, YouTube is one of the largest databases of global shared experience. YouTube’s global popularity can be attributed to Strangelove’s assertion that “there’s nothing more interesting to real people . . . than authentic stories told about other real people” (65). Individuals are drawn to Nikkie’s experience, seeing themselves reflected in her story. Famous beauty vloggers on YouTube, and everyday beauty lovers, find community in the collective experience of feeling shame for loving makeup and using makeup to transform and communicate their identity. Effectively, the movement forms communities of practice (Wenger) made up of hundreds of people brought together by the shared value and use of makeup as a transformative tool. The online spaces where these activities take place (mainly on YouTube and Instagram) form affinity spaces (Gee) where the community come together, share information, learn and develop their practice. Hundreds of YouTubers from all over the world took up Nikkie’s invitation to demonstrate the power of makeup by transforming themselves on camera. From well-established beauty vloggers with millions of viewers, to amateur beauty lovers with YouTube channels, many people felt moved by Nikkie’s example and embodied the message, adapting the transformation to suit their circumstances. The movement includes both men and women, children and adults. Some transformations are inspirational such as Shalom Blac’s in which she talks about accepting the scars that are all over her face, but also demonstrates how makeup can make them disappear. Shalom has almost five million views on her “POWER OF MAKEUP” video, and has been labelled “inspirational” by the media. Shalom Blac’s video can be watched here and the media article labelling her as “inspirational” can be viewed here. Others, such as PatrickStarrr, send a powerful message that “It’s okay to be yourself.” Unlike a traditional interpretation of that statement, Patrick is communicating that it is okay to be the self that you construct, on any given day. Patrick also has over four million views on his video which can be watched here.  During her transformation, Nikkie points out each feature of her face that she does not like and demonstrates how she can change it using makeup. Nikkie’s video is primarily a tutorial, educating viewers on different makeup techniques that can manipulate the appearance of their natural features into how they would like them to appear. These techniques are also reproduced and embodied through the various contributors to the movement. Thus the tutorial is an educational tool enabling others to use makeup for their own self representations (see Paul A. Soukup for an overview of YouTube as an educational tool). A feminist perspective may deconstruct the empowering, educational intentions of Nikkie’s video, insisting that conceptions of beauty are a social construct (Travis, Meginnis, and Bardari) and should not be re-enforced by encouraging women (and men) to use make-up to feel good. However, this sort of discourse does not appear in the movement, and this paper seeks to analyse the movement as its contributors frame and present it. Rather, “the power of makeup” movement falls within a postfeminist framework celebrating choice, femininity, independence, and the individual construction of modern identity (McRobbie; Butler; Beck, Giddens and Lash). Postfeminism embraces postmodern notions of identity in which individuals are “called up to invent their own structures” (McRobbie 260). Through institutions such as education young women have “become more independent and able,” and “‘dis-embedded’ from communities where gender roles were fixed” (McRobbie 260). Angela McRobbie attributes this to the work of scholars such as Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck and their emphasis on individualisation and reflexive modernisation. These scholars take a Foucauldian approach to identity construction in the modern age, where the individual must choose their own structures “internally and individualistically” (260), engaging in an ongoing process of self-monitoring and self-improvement, and resulting in the current self-help culture (McRobbie). In addition to being an educational and constructive tool, Nikkie’s video is also an exercise in self-branding and self-promotion(see Marwick; Duffy and Hund; and van Nuenen for scholarship on self-branding). Through her ongoing presence on YouTube, presenting this video in conjunction with her other tutorials, Nikkie is establishing herself as a beauty vlogger/guru. Nikkie lists all of the products that she uses in her transformation below her video with links to where people can buy them. She also lists her social media accounts, ways that people can connect with her, and other videos that people might be interested in watching. There are also prompts to subscribe, both during her video and in the description bar below her video. Nikkie’s transformation is both an ongoing endeavour to create her image and public persona as a beauty vlogger, and a physical transformation on camera. There is also a third transformation that takes place because her vlog is in the public sphere and consequently mobilises a movement. The transformation is of the way people talk about and eventually perceive makeup. Nikkie’s video aims to end makeup shaming and promote makeup as an empowering tool. With each recreation of her video, with each Instagram photo featuring the transformation, and with each mainstream media article featuring the movement, #thepowerofmakeup movement community are transforming the image of the made-up girl—transforming the association of makeup with presenting an inauthentic identity—in society. ConclusionThe “The Power of MAKEUP!” movement, started by NikkieTutorials, demonstrates one way in which people are using YouTube as a transformative tool, and mirror, to document, construct, and present their identity online, using makeup. Through their online transformation the members of the movement not only engage in a process of constructing and presenting their identity, but they form communities who share a love of makeup and its transformative potential. By embodying Nikkie’s original message to rid makeup shaming and transform the self into a desired identity, the movement re-enforces the “made-up” image of the self as real and authentic, and challenges conceptions that the “made-up” image is “fake” and inauthentic. Ultimately, this case study explores YouTube as a site that allows individuals to play with, construct, and present their identity. YouTube is a tool with which, and a space in which, people can transform themselves, and in doing so create communities which can work together to publicly challenge social norms.References Beck, Ulrich, Anthony Giddens, and Scott Lash.

"2016","The Tube on YouTube: TV Series, Media Strategies, and User Tactics in a Transmedia Environment","This study analyzes the traffic generated on YouTube around television series. We selected a sample of 314 short YouTube videos about 21 Spanish TV series that premiered in 2013 by Spain’s three most popular mainstream television networks (Telecinco, Antena 3, and La1). These videos, which together received more than 24 million views, were classified according to two key variables: the nature (official or nonofficial) of the YouTube channel on which they were located and the exclusivity of their content (already broadcast on TV or Web exclusive). The analysis allows us to characterize the strategies used by TV networks on YouTube and the activity of fans as well as their efforts in the construction of a transmedia narrative universe around TV series.","",""
"2016","The video bubble"," Multichannel networks (MCNs) are intermediary companies that sell advertising, cross-promote affiliated YouTube channels, and develop video brands. They have often been criticized as driving YouTube’s commercialization, a seemingly recent phenomenon that sees hithertho informal practices of video making and sharing being increasingly formalized. This article challenges such beliefs about YouTube’s sudden makeover, based on archival evidence that allows to reconstruct YouTube’s long commercial history and on fresh field study data relating to one specific MCN and its content providers. Debunking the myth of ‘cocreation’, the article uses simple analogies – market, infrastructure, and franchise – to describe how MCNs contribute to establish asymmetrical relations between users and emergent industry systems online. It demonstrates how MCNs since 2006 have streamlined and standardized production inputs, reorganized cost per mille–based ad sales, and redefined the value of video in line with a more general financialization of media markets. The methodological framework for this empirical inquiry into YouTube’s first decade is based on economic sociology and infrastructure studies, and the argument itself framed by critical research on ‘connected viewing’, a larger trend across the media industries to integrate digital technology and socially networked communication with traditional screen media practices.

"2016","YouTube, multichannel networks and the accelerated evolution of the new screen ecology"," In attempting to break with a ‘fall from grace’ narrative that may structure analysis of the rapid professionalization and monetization of previously amateur online video content on the main global platform, YouTube, this article outlines histories of key institutions in the new screen ecology as outcomes of the increased interpenetration of very different, often clashing industry cultures. Google/YouTube, Apple’s iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Yahoo! and Facebook (‘NoCal’) are largely Internet ‘pure-play’ companies, whilst Hollywood’s incumbents (‘SoCal’) practice time-honoured mass media and premium content strategies. The ‘history of the present’ of the new screen ecology is the history of the clash of these cultures. The less than 10-year history of Google’s YouTube can be written as a history of Google seeking to come to terms with the conditions of possibility for entertainment, content and talent development from its base as an IT company dedicated to scale, automation, permanent beta, rapid prototyping and iteration. These efforts reflect both continuities and contestations with traditional media models, particularly business models. As emerging intermediaries in the middle of the convergent space between NoCal and SoCal, multichannel networks’ (MCNs’) placement sees them needing to innovate on both the NoCal and SoCal side. On the former side, MCNs are attempting to provide value-added services superior to basic YouTube analytics, with programmatics and pioneering attempts at management of scale and volume. On the latter side, they are managing a quite different class of entry- to mid-level talent, who bring successful audience development and clear ideas about the roots of their success with them. The new screen ecology is a space of unimagined scale and scope of flourishing online creativity and culture, which is at the same time turbulent and precarious for creators and MCNs alike. ","",""
"2016","The cultural logic of digital intermediaries"," How has YouTube evolved as a cultural and commercial infrastructure? What institutional forms has it produced? The present article takes up these questions through a discussion of multichannel networks (MCNs) and their role within the digital video system. MCNs are a new breed of intermediary firm that link entrepreneurial YouTubers with the advertising, marketing and screen production industries. This article considers the functions of MCNs vis-à-vis the existing constellation of screen industry professions, including talent agents, managers and media buyers, who perform similar functions offline. Combining structural analysis of the MCN industry with an assessment of its cultural impacts, I show how Google’s decision to open the YouTube back-end to third-party intermediaries is subtly changing the digital video ecology.

The main analytical lens is that of “affordances.” It is used to map how technological features designed into YouTube create a set of probable uses/meanings/practices for users while serving YouTube’s business interests.

We explain how the guru’s successful online persona is based on a performative blend of relatable, down-to-earth values paired with a more aspirational and worthy of emulation side. Being an “ordinary-user-turned-famous” is seemingly an advantage given the high relevance of authenticity when judging online celebrities.

Sensory elements refer to colour, camera usage, video image and sound qualities. Social elements are eye contact, facial expression, conversation and gesture. Past studies have rarely applied “presence” theory to vlogging. As vlogs have become a popular format on the Internet, this study could provide new directions for research into the experiences of vlog viewers. It also offers video bloggers initial understandings of how their content could affect their popularity by altering audiences’ feelings of presence.","",""

This study attempts to provide an overall characterization of YouTube, based on a random sample of channel and video data, by showing how video provision and consumption evolved over the course of the past 10 years. It demonstrates stark contrasts between video genres in terms of channels, uploads and views, and that a vast majority of on average 85% of all views goes to a small minority of 3% of all channels.

"2018","Anxiety, panic and self-optimization"," This article will look to YouTube’s algorithm to assess how such forms of mechanical decision-making can create a discriminatory visibility hierarchy of vloggers, favouring middle class social actors who make highly gendered content aligned with advertisers’ demands and needs. I have selected entrepreneurial beauty vloggers as a case study for this article; beauty vlogging is defined as the demonstration and discussion of cosmetic use, often from a vIoggers’ own bedroom (Banet Weiser, 2017; Nathanson, 2014). This is a deeply entrenched genre on the site; beauty vlogging is a full-time job for some successful participants, and a source of pocket money for many more. Moreover, beauty vlogging is an effective illustration of how the YouTube algorithm causes the polarization of identity markers such as gender. Indeed, for female participants, I hypothesize that YouTube actively promotes hegemonic, feminized cultural outputs, created by beauty vloggers with significant embodied social and cultural capital. That is to say, for women on YouTube, the algorithm privileges and rewards feminized content deeply entwined with consumption, beauty, fashion, baking, friendships and boyfriends in the vein of the historical bedroom culture of the teenage magazine. A secondary hypothesis is that beauty vloggers’ own understandings of YouTube’s algorithmic processes are learned and embodied within their own practices, influencing modes of self-presentation, tone of voice, choice of content covered, words and sentence structures used. I argue that it is essential to situate all beauty vloggers’ experience and content as specific to the platform of YouTube; it is their continued success on the YouTube platform that underwrites the value of their brands. In other words, even highly successful vloggers remain beholden to YouTube’s technologies of visibility, they are not safe from the sovereignty of the algorithm. ","",""
"2018","Exposing convergence: YouTube, fan labour, and anxiety of cultural production in <i>Lonelygirl15</i>"," As one of the first social media franchises, Lonelygirl15 (LG15) played a surprisingly important role in transforming YouTube into a legitimate storytelling platform and a site of cultural production worthy of commercial attention. While LG15 has been hailed as one of the first community-based storytelling initiatives that harnessed the power of participatory culture, the anxiety of creating an economically sustainable story led to the careful management of fan efforts and the strict definition of the boundaries of the LG15 canon. In this article, I argue that LG15 demonstrates one of the most worrisome aspects of YouTube’s monetization strategies, the commodification of labour in which advertisers and media companies exploit users for profit. This exploitation does not necessarily come in the form of loss of monetary value but through the alienation of fans from their productive labour. As such, the production of LG15 presents a powerful critique of convergence culture. It demonstrates that the movement of fans to the centre of cultural production does not necessarily mean empowerment but may also suggest exploitation. ","",""

While these negative affect vlogs work outside of YouTube’s consumer economy, their popularity points to a booming economy of affective labour, where the exchange of tears for sympathetic ears is in consistently high demand.

The platform’s revising and reshaping of television flow theorized by Raymond Williams ((1974) Television. London: Routledge.), which is produced through the combined work of users and algorithms, enables diverse cultural representations to come into contact. This diversity creates relational juxtapositions that become meaningful through human interpretation. The algorithms that are entrenched in YouTube’s business models and designed to monetize the work of users may also circulate divergent versions of a cultural practice. That YouTube flow can produce diverse cultural representations is demonstrated by a case study of the Mevlevi Sema ceremony, a Turkish intangible heritage practice safeguarded by UNESCO; official heritage narratives put forward by the nation-state of Turkey through UNESCO are challenged by other narratives on the platform.

"2018","Researching YouTube","As famously known, YouTube was founded in February 2005 by three PayPal employees. Less than 2 years later, Google acquired YouTube for a fee of $1.65 billion, at a point when the major significance of a raft of new websites based on user-generated content, such as Wikipedia, Myspace and Facebook, was becoming increasingly apparent. The cover of Time magazine duly announced ‘You’ as the winner of their Person of the Year Award for 2006, alongside a reflective mirror within a YouTube style of computer screen interface (Time, 2006). While many social media proved to be ephemeral, YouTube continues to rapidly expand and has become the second most visited website in the world. It has thereby established a unique role as a repository of popular culture, creating a diachronic archive over time as well as synchronically expanding in its scope. In his paper on ‘YouTube Channels, uploads and views’ published in this special issue, Matthias Bärtl estimates that by 2016 the total number of videos hosted on the site was around four billion. Showing how the quantity of content uploaded on YouTube has expanded exponentially over the years, Bärtl also demonstrates the waning probability of being in the top 3% of the most watched videos, which attract 85% of views. Fifty percent of videos uploaded in 2016, attracted 89 views or fewer. Even so, some new channels were able to attract a lot of attention with videos in the Comedy, Entertainment, Gaming, how to and style categories having an above-average chance of reaching the top 3%. But this distribution has changed over time. Entertainment has been the most popular category only since 2013, while the popularity of News and Politics fluctuates, with peaks occurring during the political upheavals of 2008 and 2016 as well as in response to shorter news cycles.

Past research indicates that these influencers are regarded as opinion leaders and cooperate with brands to market products on YouTube through electronic-word-of-mouth mechanisms. However, surprisingly little is known about the magnitude of this phenomenon. In our article, we make a first attempt to quantify product promotion and use an original dataset of 139,475 videos created by German YouTube channels between 2009 and 2017.

"2019","The algorithmic dance: YouTube’s Adpocalypse and the gatekeeping of cultural content on digital platforms",": The March 2017 advertiser revolt on YouTube, popularly known as the adpocalypse, introduced widespread and radical changes on the platform’s policies related to the moderation of content, their ‘monetisability’ and the terms of the relationship between creators and the platform. These changes in turn have caused significant discontent within the creator community while also gradually transforming the predominant nature of content on the platform. This essay analyses this controversy that is yet to be subjected to a scholarly investigation, in order to probe the ways in which algorithmic moderation of content affects their monetisability and consequently the viewership patterns of culture. Through closely studying the new regime of content moderation and analysing user testimonies in the aftermath of the ‘Adpocalypse’, this essay poses critical questions about the public utility like role of digital platforms whose gatekeeping function remains largely outside the purview of public debate and deliberation.","",""

Valuable insight has accumulated about parodies as artifacts, however, little is known about their creators. Drawing on the sociology of culture, this article explores YouTube music video parodies as a field of cultural production. Through interviews with 22 YouTubers recruited from a sample of top-ranked parodies, it examines the relationship between practitioner characteristics and their evaluation of parody. Contrary to other studies of participatory culture, the field was predominantly male in its participation and norms. It presented a divide between ‘strategic’ and ‘passionate’ practitioners who used parody to different ends. Nevertheless, interviewees valued similar attributes of parody, often diverging from scholarly definitions of the genre as critical commentary. This dynamic and the genre’s popularity are explained by the hybrid qualities of the field, which encourage diverse uses of parody. ","",""

Problem-solving in this context means a video, where the theme deals with the problems of modern life experienced by young fans. A mixed methods approach – in this case in-depth interviews, discourse analysis and participant observation at YouTube Creator Day events – is used to better leverage the strengths of each method and triangulate results. Sample size is at least 20 YouTubers at the most culturally significant, artistic end of the spectrum with an average of at least 1mn subscribers, established TV producers and Multi-Channel Network leaders. Preliminary results suggest that leading YouTube creators – including A-listers – use a conscious strategy of identifying the problems fans experience, so establishing trust and building audiences for their videos around their own solutions. Moreover, trust is engendered through two main means say these Australian YouTubers: first, the considerable time creators spend listening to their fans across creators’ YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Patreon channels; and second, via online and analogue interactions with fans that open their lifeworld’s to the creator, and in turn shape the themes of their short video products. This phenomenon of collaborative problem-solving, independent of traditional state, school or family structures, represents an important shift with significant potential for youth agency in an emergent public sphere.","",""
"2019","Social media celebrity and the institutionalization of YouTube","This study explores the industrial underpinning and the cultural logic of social media celebrity. Social media visibility may be considered as an alternative way to fame as it bypasses the gatekeeper role played by the entertainment and mass media industries. However, the institutionalization of social media platforms like YouTube and the professionalization of amateur content creation may lead to social media becoming a new locale for industrialized celebrity manufacturing. Taking YouTube beauty vloggers as an example, this study shows that being a celebrity on social media is economically embedded in an industrial structure constituted by the platform’s business model, technical affordances, the advertising market, and commercial cultural intermediaries. Social media celebrity’s status is achieved not only through a set of affiliative, representational, and celebrification techniques, but also by engaging in meticulous entrepreneurial calculation considering the abovementioned industrial factors. This emerging industrial structure is associated with a new cultural logic of celebrity that distinguishes the fame native to social media from that on the silver screen and television. This study shows that social media celebrity is characterized by staged authenticity, managed connectedness with audience, the abundance of celebrity figures, and the cultural preoccupation with self-sufficient uniqueness.","",""

With their far-reaching influence, through involvement in the public sphere as well as broad marketing concepts, they draw in viewers and gain attention worldwide. It can thus be understood that YouTube users also form a bond with the celebrities featured online, as formulated theoretically in the concept of parasocial relationships. In this study, an exploratory online survey examines quantitatively whether these parasocial relationships are predominantly formed with YouTubers via the platform’s feedback channels. As the results show, however, the strength of these parasocial relationships is not influenced to any great extent by use of the feedback functions. ","",""

Raising questions about the relationship between her past and present, this article examines the link between YouTube and ageing through two concepts, repetitive circularity and the flat archive. These rely and inform each other in a process that prioritizes the presence of youthfulness through the absenting of age, whereby the ageing body is erased from a popular cultural forum. YouTube’s ‘wallpaper of the past’ has a nagging impact on how we might read the body’s progress through time, in particular, how it ages.

Our paper draws on a critical media industries perspective to investigate the relationship between YouTube’s evolving platform strategies on the one side and content creators’ tactical adaptations on the other. This concerns the search for alternative revenue streams as well as content and referencing optimization seeking to grow audiences and algorithmic visibility. Drawing on an exhaustive sample (n=153.770) of “elite” channels (more than 100.000 subscribers) and their full video history (n=138.340.337), we parse links in video descriptions to investigate the appearance and spread of crowdfunding platforms like Patreon, but also of affiliate links, merchandise stores, or e-commerce websites like Etsy. We analyze the evolution of video length and posting frequency in response to platform policy as well as visibility tactics such as metadata and category optimization, keyword stuffing, or title phrasing. Taken together, these elements provide a broad picture of “industrialization” on YouTube, that is, of the ways creators seek to develop their channels into media businesses. While this contribution cannot replace more qualitative, in-depth research into particular channels or channel groups, we hope to provide a representative picture of YouTube’s elite channels and their quest for visibility and success from their beginnings up to early 2020.","",""

As such, certain practices that regulate the flow of information have become normalized across a certain subset of YouTube channels. This paper will look at this practice among YouTubers that are “faceless”—content creators who do not reveal their faces on camera while voluntarily revealing many other aspects of their identity. Specifically, a content analysis is performed on these channels: The Lockpicking Lawyer, AvE, SteadyCraftin, This Old Tony, bigclivedotcom, CGP Grey, and fastASMR. The wide range of categories these channels belong to (DIY, self help, science and technology, home crafting, electrical appliance teardown, and audio therapy) indicates that choosing to remain faceless is not a function of a certain type of material, but rather a salient trend that crosscuts YouTube genres. The channels analyzed suggest that these YouTubers feel empowered through remaining faceless, allowing for increased disclosure about the topic at hand. They also demonstrate that Faceless YouTubers selectively share information depending on a range of motivations, all of which revolve around imparting meaningful content to specific audiences while maintaining a specifically-constructed notion of privacy.

Adopting and morphing the idea of media events established by Dayan and Katz, I argue that Rewinds serve as $2 . Rewinds are moments of coming together around shared rituals, anthems, and cultural leaders. The violation of the formula for this ceremonial event in 2018 upset audiences and generated a mass, organized, and negative response. By tracing the flows of content creation, including the corporate-produced Rewind videos and critical response and reaction videos from YouTube creators, this project identifies competing visions and structuring tensions of platform culture. Focusing on the question of cultural development on YouTube via the social media event of Rewind videos forefronts the larger question of how researchers can talk about online culture on a globalized scale. From viewer-driven virality, to the establishment of microcelebrities, to the role of international cultural leaders on the platform, understandings of what it means to be a YouTuber emerge from more sectors than ever before. Is a singular Rewind possible for a platform that now encompasses over 100 countries and 80 languages?

"2020","MAPPING VALUE(S) IN AI: THE CASE OF YOUTUBE","This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach (media studies, computer science, and legal scholarship) for the analysis of systems that rely on AI components as central components of their design. Taking recommender systems more generally and the one built by YouTube more specifically, we develop a methodology for conceptualizing and studying the broad array of “ideas”, “norms”, or “values” such systems mobilize. Instead of limiting ourselves to a narrow understanding of these terms, we take into account, for example, translations from economic models, social theories, legal requirements, ethical principles, technical knowledge, experiential evaluations, or other constructs used to define and justify design goals and decisions that shape the production of technical objects and, consequently, the object themselves. In this paper we discuss three directions for analysis and present first results. Investigating technical knowledge includes the study of scholarly literature and experimentation with concrete objects such as LensKit for Python to understand the “ambient” knowledge and normativity engineers and designers draw on. Investigating local circumstances involves ethnographic analysis, but also the reconstruction of the business models and legal environment that weigh on YouTube’s design. Analyzing a system in use can draw on technical observation, via scraping or API data, of the actual dynamics of recommendation that emerge when users enter into the equation. Taken together, these three approaches can “encircle” the various moments where value(s) are shaped and put into work in the context of systems where direct access to specifications is improbable.","",""

"2020","TEMPORAL FRAMES FOR PLATFORM PUBLICS: THE PLATFORMIZATION OF   BREADTUBE","In this paper we suggest the notion of $2 to account for the intermingling of socio-technical processes that make online platforms (in this case: YouTube) resistant to stable definitions. It has been over a decade of YouTube studies and yet, a consensus on what precisely YouTube is seems unlikely. Arguably, Burgess and Green began this ontological quest with the first edition of YouTube (2008) in which they set out ‘to work through some of the often-competing ideas about just what YouTube is.” (iv) Snickars and Vondereau (2009) considered the “ontological ambivalence” (2009, p. 28) of YouTube to be an asset since the platform’s success was rooted in its flexibility as a stage for content. Following work attempted to understand YT as a ‘new screen ecology’ (Cunningham 2016); through its platform logics of monetization and viewership (Postigo 2015, Van Es 2020); as a contested space between creators, content and audience (Berryman and Kavka 2018, Bishop 2018; 2019); and as a database, often implementing scraping and other computational techniques to account for its nature as vast graph network of content (Airoldi et al. 2016) with internal algorithmic dynamic - for instance the preference of “YT-native” content over mainstream actors within its search and recommendations (Rieder et al. 2018). We abandon the ontological stability of YT as singular and instead present it from a post-representational (Thrift 2008) and temporally-orientated (Adam 2008) perspective. Using BreadTube as a case study, we refrain from asking what YT is, but rather $2 YT happens.","",""

EXPLORING THE ROLE PROFESSIONAL YOUTUBERS PLAY IN YOUNG PEOPLE’S HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND IDENTITES IN THE UK","In the United Kingdom, there are over 150 individual YouTubers with &gt;1 million subscribers. A significant proportion of their audience are aged between 13-18 years. The content they produce is often: commercially sponsored, unregulated and both purposefully and accidentally touches on a whole range of health topics including: mental health, alcohol, sexual health, body image, healthy eating and physical activity. YouTubers could represent a particularly relatable source of health information for young people as a magnified version of young people’s own searchable and replicable online socially networked lives. The aim of the research is to explore the role that professional YouTubers play in young people health behaviours and identities in the UK. The study was a four stage, sequential mixed methods design. The first stage, a school based questionnaire (n=931, 13-18 years) quantified young people’s YouTuber engagement and provided a sampling frame for the later qualitative stages. An online analysis of 7 UK YouTubers examined the health content they produced. Focus groups (n=7, 85 participants) with 13-18 year olds explored the impact this content had on young people’s health behaviours and interviews with professional YouTubers ( &lt;1 million subscribers, ongoing) explored their perceived role in health promotion. YouTuber produced health content appeared to be a recognized source of health information for young people in this study. Young people appeared able to critique the accuracy and commercial influences on YouTuber content. However, this content still appears to be a relatable way of sharing health experiences, giving advice and communicating social norms.","",""
"2020","Mapping YouTube","Over the past 15 years, YouTube has emerged as a large and dominant social media service, giving rise to a ‘platformed media system’ within its technical and regulatory infrastructures. This paper relies on a large-scale sample of channels (n=36M+) to explore this media system along three main lines. First, we investigate stratification and hierarchization in broadly quantitative terms, connecting to well-known tropes on structural hierarchies emerging in networked systems, where a small number of elite actors often dominate visibility. Second, we inquire into YouTube’s channel categories, their relationships, and their proportions as a means to better understand the topics on offer and their relative importance. Third, we analyze channels according to country affiliation to gain insights into the dynamics and fault lines that align with country and language. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the inductive character of this research, by highlighting the many follow-up questions that emerge from our findings.","",""
"2020","“Rewarding Good Creators”: Corporate Social Media Discourse on Monetization Schemes for Content Creators"," This discourse analytical article deals with the power relations between social media corporations and content creators in the context of monetization schemes of social media businesses, i.e., schemes that allow creators to monetize their social media content. Specifically, this study presents an analysis of discourse material pertaining to YouTube’s monetization scheme (the YouTube Partner Program [YPP]) to shed light on the broader point of how social media corporations position themselves in relation to creators who (seek to) earn money on social media. While some research on social media has focused on their potential to empower users/content creators, less optimistic scholars have addressed social media corporations generating massive profits by exploiting creators, for example, in the form of free digital labor. By comparison, there is a lack of research, especially empirical discourse analytical research, on creators’ paid digital labor and on how social media corporations conceptualize paid creators. This study redresses this gap regarding one of the oldest monetization schemes—the YPP. Using corpus linguistic tools to explore textual data from 46 YouTube sites detailing the YPP, this study homes in on references to content creators, YouTube, and how these players are connected to one another. The findings show that although the name YPP elicits the impression of cooperation on equal terms, YouTube represents itself as legislator, judge, and executive authority. This indicates that despite the ability of partnered content creators to share in the social media businesses’ profits, they do not inhabit a particularly empowered position. ","",""
"2020","Tiered Governance and Demonetization: The Shifting Terms of Labor and Compensation in the Platform Economy"," Social media platforms have profoundly transformed cultural production, in part by restructuring the terms by which culture is distributed and paid for. In this article, we examine the YouTube Partner Program and the controversies around the “demonetization” of videos, to understand these arrangements and what happens when they shift beneath creators’ feet. We use the testimony of YouTubers, provided in their own videos, to understand how creators square the contradiction between YouTube’s increasingly cautious rules regarding “advertiser-friendly” content, its shifting financial and algorithmic incentive structure, and its stated values as an open platform of expression. We examine YouTube’s tiered governance strategy, in which different users are offered different sets of rules, different material resources, and different procedural protections when content is demonetized. And we examine how, especially when the details of that tiered governance are ambiguous or poorly conveyed, creators develop their own theories for why their content has been demonetized—which can provide some creators a tactical opportunity to advance politically motivated accusations of bias against the platform.

"2020","YouTube’s Operational Logic: “The View” as Pervasive Category"," Launched in 2005 as a platform for user-generated content (UGC), YouTube is one of the most popular websites in the world. In this article, I focus on the site’s use of “the view,” which I argue serves as a pervasive category enacted through the platform, in its information regimes and beyond. The view supports a myth of viewer intentionality and satisfaction and serves as the operational logic of the platform as a whole. It is a category in Durkheim’s sense, ordering practices and naturalizing hierarchies and inequalities. These hierarchies concern, and impact on, participation, financial compensation, visibility, and popularity. In making my claims, I demonstrate how the celebratory discourse around YouTube as an empowering tool that levels the media playing field was positively misguided. I make a plea for a critical reading of the view, which can enhance our understanding of the platform and its culture. ","",""

Practices, uses and metaphors of the most popular audio-visual platform","ABSTRACT This article is part of the outcomes of the Transmedia Literacy research project on teens and transmedia collaborative practices carried out in eight countries between 2015 and 2018. A multi-method approach was used in the study (questionnaires, workshops, media diaries, interviews, observation of online communities) to explore what teens are doing with media. This article presents a map of the uses and practices teens make of YouTube. The metaphors of YouTube that emerged when teens put these uses and practices into discourse are also identified. Five YouTube uses were detected: radiophonic, televisual, social, productive and educative. These uses vary according to the practices performed by teens and how they are related to the logics of the YouTube platform. Moreover, the identified metaphors show the ways teens’ uses are related to their everyday routines and the way they integrate the YouTube platform into various dimensions of their social life, such as their media practices, and the way they acquire knowledge and skills.","",""
"2021","Transmedia teens: the creative transmedia skills of Italian students","ABSTRACT The objective of this article is to analyse the extent of creativity and autonomy of Italian teenagers’ digital media practices and to link it to the new transmedia skills developed within their favourite digital environments. The data studied emerged from the Transmedia Literacy project (European Commission-Horizon 2020) which involved eight countries from three continents. Through the analysis of information gathered with multiple methodologies (survey, in-depth interviews, workshops and media diaries), the article explores both the consuming and producing media practices of Italian teenagers and the ways in which they are connected with emerging transmedia skills (Guerrero-Pico, Masanet, & Scolari, 2019; Scolari 2018). The data shows that Italian teenagers may still be considered quite traditional media users: their creative participation is limited and often they merely imitate, or remix others’ works, acting as ‘functional prosumers’ rather than ‘critical prosumers’ (Chen, Wu, & Wang, 2011). The outcome of the research reveals teenagers’ meta-reflexive approach to media, an approach that seems to regulate and restrict their attitude towards creating and, above all, exposing their own creativity online. At the same time, teens demonstrate the acquisition of new and creative skills related, in particular, to the mechanisms of media industry and self-management.","",""
"2021","FROM BUZZFEED CREATOR TO (IN)DEPENDENT YOUTUBER - MANAGING PRECARIOUS         LABOUR THROUGH GOSSIP","Several known Buzzfeed Creators have left the company’s toxic culture         by beginning a career as YouTubers. They hoped that their Buzzfeed audience would migrate to         support their company-independent channel. Often represented as a move towards independence         by creators, cultural production research (Nieborg &amp; Poell, 2018; Burgess et al. 2020)         has shown that creators are platform and audience dependent for viability. Therefore, we are         questioning whether being an (in)dependent YouTuber would be more precarious than being an         employed Buzzfeed creator. How does the migration from Buzzfeed to YouTube creator offer         both independence and a host of new contingencies? Situating a content and discourse         analysis of “Why I left Buzzfeed” YouTube videos and comments within academic and popular         discourse, we understand these videos as sources of ‘gossip’ (Bishop, 2018) defined as         “loose, unmethodological talk that is generative” (2590). Gossip can be beneficial to         ex-Buzzfeed creators building on their Buzzfeed association to boost algorithmic visibility.         Additionally, gossip is a valuable form of knowledge exchange for content creators to stay         informed on discourse, support one another, and communicate their perspective on former         Buzzfeed content. Gossip also allows us as researchers to break through the blackbox of         YouTube content creation to better comprehend precarity as multifaceted. We hypothesize that         creators have to balance different aspects of precarity depending on Buzzfeed as employer or         YouTube as distributor. The imaginary of independence is a false friend as both employed and         self-employed creators are dependent on platform governance and their platform public         (Mniestri &amp; Gekker, 2020) for success.","",""

The current study focuses on “minimalist journey"""" narratives, where people tell their         stories of """"encountering"""" the minimalist lifestyle. I collected “minimalist journey"""" stories         from 40 YouTube videos with their comments and analyzed them using narrative analysis         methods, both thematic and structural (Labov &amp; Waletzky, 1997; Riessman, 2005). By         closely examining these narratives, this study sheds light on how people experience and make         sense of the minimalist lifestyle within the context of anti-consumerism and neoliberalism         in digital space. This study also contributes to digital culture studies by showcasing how         personal life narratives are constructed on video-sharing platforms like YouTube. Two themes         emerged in the analysis. In the “Hoarder to Minimalist” narrative, narrators were once         over-consuming hoarders and now minimalists. Minimalism facilitates discursive rejections         and behavior disruptions of consumerism. The """"transformational"""" stories, however,         reinforcing the neoliberal sense of self that needs constant improvement. In the “Always         been a Minimalist” narrative, narrators have always been frugal due to underprivileged         social status. Minimalism empowers them by providing a set of vocabulary for recreating         meanings. It, however, downplays the class divisions in capitalist society as merely an         issue of “framing”; the struggles of lower social class people just need to be beautified as         “minimalism.”","",""

This case study suggests that online performance capital on YouTube is slightly different than offline performance capital, and benefits from the affordances of networked media, and specifically YouTube. While there is some gender-based homophily in channel linking behaviors, there are also connections between weakly tied individuals with respect to video category, meaning that musicians are linking to others outside of the music community and vice versa. While music video channels tend to link to other music video channels, and non-music channels tend to link to other non-music channels, the most popular videos tend to post from multiple categories including both music and non-music. Findings suggest that being a long-time poster and having a rich and diverse network are likely elements of building performance capital for YouTube musicians. ","",""
"2021","The Drama of Metrics: Status, Spectacle, and Resistance Among YouTube Drama Creators"," How does it feel to have one’s online worth and status be based almost exclusively on metrics? We examine this question through a qualitative study of YouTube “drama” channels. Drama creators cover the conflicts and scandals taking place among top YouTube celebrities. As producers of meta-commentary, they often rely on metrics as indicators of influence and celebrity on YouTube, thus constituting a relevant site to examine the connection between social media metrics and status. Based on interviews with English-speaking drama creators, we report three main findings. First, creators have a double orientation toward YouTube, which they understand as a site of both economic opportunities and tight-knit relationships. Second, the meanings that creators attach to metrics—their own and the ones of top YouTubers—reflect this double orientation: for them, metrics correlate with economic revenue and social status. Due to this central and multifaceted role of metrics, we find that traffic numbers can turn into a spectacle of their own for drama creators. Third, even in a context in which metrics are central, we identify several distancing strategies on the part of creators. We conclude by discussing whether—and why—resistance to metrics can be found everywhere. ","",""

"2022","How-to videos on YouTube: the role of the instructor","ABSTRACT How-to videos on YouTube have become a popular source for procedural learning. An important difference to traditional educational videos is that the instructor is often not a professional educator, but an amateur or peer. Building on work on social learning from models, this paper explores how instructor characteristics such as model-observer similarity, instructor credibility (expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness), and conversational human voice influence choice and evaluation of a how-to video. A survey (n = 401) among active Internet users was conducted. Most respondents had used YouTube and had watched how-to videos on YouTube. Respondents preferred videos with instructors that they perceived as experts and trustworthy, and who talked in a conversational human voice. Instructors of the same gender as the viewer were also preferred, especially by males. The instructor variables explained variance in perceived usefulness and intention to use how-to videos above and beyond the technical and instructional quality of the video. However, only conversational human voice and same gender of the instructor turned out to be significant predictors of perceived usefulness and intention to use.","",""
"2022","Social media engagements of music videos on YouTube’s official artist channels"," As social platforms become essential in promoting songs, many artists create an official channel on YouTube and encourage their fans’ engagements. However, little is known about the effectiveness of official videos in generating fans’ media engagements. We conduct two empirical studies to investigate the relationship between official video attributes, media engagements and channel subscribers. First, we propose a model to explain how music video attributes facilitate the relative social media engagements of a video. Second, we test whether three types of social engagements are associated with an increase in official channel subscribers. To do so, we collect social media engagement data for the 2896 music videos uploaded between May 2016 and April 2019 by 105 artists who own their YouTube official artist channels. The empirical evidence shows that the official videos incorporating visual, performance and storytelling components can generate more positive engagement from the viewers, while audio-only videos exhibit lower overall engagement intensity. Furthermore, we find that active media engagement, such as leaving ‘comments’, contributes to the increase in channel subscribers beyond the effect of the number of registered videos. Our results suggest that highly involved music fans may show the active types of social engagements, such as leaving a comment on live and follow-up videos. In practice, our findings imply that YouTube creators need to incorporate visual-focused platform characteristics to stimulate in-depth social engagement. ","",""

It uses thematic analysis to identify discursive tactics that protect viewers’ face. The article argues that the parasocial nature of the connection that these videos attempt to establish with an audience that content creators know little about makes it important for them to reflexively adapt to these viewers’ needs for fellowship and autonomy. Their disclosures may be intended to create closeness, but at the same time they need to cater for distance and prepare the ground for this content to be received as well as possible. However, just like the connection that the videos seek to establish, the facework they contain is also parasocially situated: the videos speak to an imagined viewer’s need for inclusion and this viewer’s possible objections, as these are perceived by the content creator. The article contributes to a better understanding of the construction of closeness in this genre of mediated discourse. ","",""

The project had two main objectives: to detect what teens are doing with media and to determine how they learn to do it. During the fieldwork, YouTube was identified as one of the platforms that teens use most for learning purposes. Therefore, this article maps teenagers’ main YouTube learning topics and motivations for using the platform. We studied the video formats that teens use and the way they use them to learn a wide variety of topics. Three main areas of interest were identified: formal school curriculum, video games and technology and wellness and culture. In all three areas, teens apply the apprenticeship model of learning as they follow YouTube instructors (teachers, experts and peers) to learn about these areas. Teens highlight different YouTube affordances that motivate them to use the platform, including using it as a search engine to find specific information, using the number of views or subscribers to validate the quality of the content, being able to control the video to learn at their own pace and using it as a repository and archive to find information. Teens use YouTube both to complement their formal school curriculum and to explore their own interests. Therefore, YouTube becomes an important learning space for adolescents to learn in a continuum. This means that it is a space that blurs the boundaries between classic oppositions like formal/informal learning due to how teens use it. ","",""
"2022","Platform drama: “Cancel culture,” celebrity, and the struggle for accountability on YouTube"," Recent years have witnessed debates about so-called “cancel culture” and more broadly about online accountability practices. Here we revisit this topic through a study of YouTube “drama,” a hybrid genre where creators provide commentary on the scandals, scams, and feuds between YouTube celebrities. Drawing on cultural studies scholarship, and based on qualitative interviews and content analysis, we argue that YouTube drama embodies a range of cultural and moral negotiations that take place on social media platforms. We conceptualize accountability practices on YouTube as an ongoing “platform drama” in which creators engage in perpetual and highly visible power struggles with celebrities, audiences, legacy media, other creators, and YouTube itself. Within the context of this “platform drama,” structural issues and interpersonal conflicts become blurred, as do accountability practices and monetized spectacles. We analyze “cancelation” on YouTube as a ritualistic practice in which structural tensions are publicly negotiated and performed, even as accountability itself remains largely elusive. ","",""

We further argue that Pocket Watch’s newly formed advertising division, Clock Work, exploits its child partners through problematic native advertising and host selling practices. The strategies implemented by Pocket Watch and other similar emerging companies may therefore act as a litmus test for how governmental regulation and platform policy changes will impact the evolving landscape of children’s digital media as commercial forces increasingly groom a growing number of young children to shift from YouTube stars to global brands.

Interviews show that they are not only familiar with these videos but have also dealt with them in different ways. Medical analyses combined with the evaluations of the interviews give reason to believe that the videos can be interpreted as triggers for certain groups of people. The evaluation of the data on the media use of the patients traces their subjective use of social media as well as their opinions on central content to get insight on how the use of the videos in question is integrated into their media activities. It becomes apparent that the trigger function of the videos cannot be explained by a consistent mode of reception. Further contextual variables must be taken into account to understand the phenomenon.","",""

Stories of ‘YouTuber burnout’ have circulated, indicating the consequences of trying to keep up with demands. This article demonstrates the existence of increasing pressures to produce fresh content on the platform, the output imperative, and offers tentative explanations. The article draws on analyses of the cultural industries, digital entrepreneurship, and organizational ecology to deliver a longitudinal analysis of the productivity of YouTube channels. Our sample contains data from app. 22,000 channels and their activities from 2008 to 2019. We focus on three productivity parameters, i.e., the number of videos uploaded, average video length, and total output produced. A series of quantitative analyses demonstrate both general and specific tendencies towards increased productivity during this period. Parts of the channel population saw relatively small changes, but some of the more productive strata of the population saw productivity increases above 800% over 10 years. We show that these developments have been driven primarily by new channels joining the platform and that existing channels tend to follow the benchmarks set by newcomers. This indicates the existence of steadily increasing demands for increased output to stay competitive. Our analyses thus demonstrate the existence of considerable production pressures on YouTube and we argue that this has exacerbated the already precarious position of creators on the video platform.","",""

Thus, this study aimed to analyse the content, quality and reliability of YouTube videos focused on clinical trials for paediatric cancer. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used, and YouTube was searched using the phrases ‘clinical trials for children with cancer’ and ‘paediatric cancer clinical trials’. Videos that met inclusion criteria were assessed using the instruments Global Quality Scale and DISCERN. About half of the examined videos were in the GQS excellent-quality group and exhibited a total of 84,804 views. The mean time for videos was 5.7 minutes, they originated from the US or UK, were uploaded after 2016, and had a cancer centre/foundation or children hospital as video source. Half of them were focusing on early experimental trials and had a positive tone. Twenty percent were classified as useful without serious shortcomings, almost 50% as misleading with serious shortcomings, and 30% as inappropriate sources of information. In conclusion, most YouTube videos on paediatric cancer trials are not very informative and fall short of what could ethically be required regarding their facilitation of informed decision-making.","",""

This model has been challenged in recent years due to competitive and political pressures on platforms. In this paper, we use YouTube as a case to understand how processes of commodification are changing on digital platforms. We demonstrate that YouTube furthers the commodification of content, audiences and creative labour by cultivating commercial interactions, standardising exchange mechanisms and constructing systems of trust. The platform enables producers and retailers to sell digital and physical goods to users, advertisers to capture audiences’ interest and brands to establish partnerships with producers. In sum, we show how YouTube not only monetises attention but commodifies all forms of engagement through its marketplaces with consequences for the precarity of users and producers on the platform.

"2023","""""YOUTUBE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT CREATORS"""": HOW YOUTUBERS USE THE PLATFORM TO PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY","Unsatisfied with the black-boxing of algorithmic governance and platform governance on YouTube more generally, creators have begun to seek accountability through other means, deploying their skills, audiences, and situated knowledge to investigate the platform’s operations. This paper examines a phenomenon we term $2 , or the use of publicity via content creation to reveal failures, oversights, or harmful policies on a platform. We analyzed 250 videos featuring issues of platform accountability following a grounded theory approach. Our results revealed that most videos calling out the platform took the form of vlogs that were negative in tone towards YouTube, or a mix of negative and positive. YouTube itself was the actor most targeted for accountability, but automated systems, other creators, YouTube employees, and even former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki were all prominently cited. Most complaints were aimed at YouTube’s policies, lack of communication, or perceived bias against creators of certain demographics or who made undesirable types of content. Claims of censorship were also prominent, as were frustrations with YouTube’s appeals process and the cultural disconnect between YouTube users and YouTube corporate. Publicizing problems with the platform in a way that draws attention from audiences, news media, and fellow creators represents one of the most important ways YouTubers can participate in platform governance. Our study outlines the primary methods they use to do so and the reasons that motivate them to engage in user-generated accountability.","",""
"2023","MAKING A MEDIA CAREER ON AND BEYOND YOUTUBE: DIVERSITY IN PROFESSIONAL IDENTITIES OF YOUTUBE CREATORS","YouTube as part of a growing social media entertainment (SME) industry has taken various steps to professionalise, formalise and regulate the field of user-generated content and successfully integrated self-professionalised YouTube creators into an emerging creative workforce of SME. The industrialisation and professionalisation of YouTubing have created the assumption of a formalisation of professional identity as a YouTuber or a content creator in the SME industry. Contrary to this assumption, I argue that there is a divergence from fixed categories as it is not possible to fix permanently or define conclusively the professional identity as a YouTuber because conditions of content creator labour are precarious. In this paper, drawing upon qualitative data collected for my doctoral research, I investigate how creators who engage in self-governance as risk-bearing creative agents form their professional identities inside or outside YouTube careers and illuminate the diversity and ambivalence in their professional identities due to the precarious nature of their work. Despite being at different career stages and having a wide range of backgrounds, motivations, skills, and experiences, YouTube creators who participated in this project had something in common: They needed to be flexible in shifting between different professional identities and types of employment relations in order to make a media career on and beyond YouTube. This is because it is hard to imagine or maintain a single career path towards being a professional creator due to existing or future uncertainties.","",""
"2023","MANUFACTURING INFLUENCERS: THE REVOLUTIONARY ROLES OF MCNS (MULTI-CHANNEL NETWORKS) IN THE PLATFORM ECONOMY","This study examines how MCNs (Multi-Channel Networks) intervene in the platform economy by manufacturing influencers. Previous studies have explored the emergence of influencers and creators from various perspectives, including platformization, creative labor, and algorithmic power. However, little attention has been paid to another crucial player – MCNs which incubate and train influencers on an industrial scale. MCNs are firms and organizations that collaborate with influencers to facilitate the production, promotion, and monetization of creative content. They serve not only as incubators for micro-entrepreneurs and influencers looking to establish their businesses, but also as a key intermediary between influencers and other stakeholders on platforms. This study combines in-depth interviews with documented lawsuits to explore the role of MCNs in the platform economy, as well as their relationships with influencers. The findings suggest that MCNs significantly shape the platform economy through three strategies: manufacturing influencers, spreading industry lore, and exploiting creativity. On one hand, MCNs help established influencers maintain their success and reduce the risk of creativity while exploiting the labor of aspirants who struggle to enter the platform economy. As such, they constitute a power imbalance by providing business for successful influencers and increasing precarity for ordinary influencers. On the other hand, MCNs continue to expand their business scopes to meet the needs of various stakeholders, mainly platforms, advertisers, and brands. Consequently, MCNs have the ability to facilitate the relationship between these actors, industrialize aspiring influencers, and determine who can participate in creative labor.","",""

Simultaneously, AI technology has been at the center of public debate considering its societal impact. Social Media Platforms (SMPs) play a crucial role in providing a space for public debates but also partake in public discourses on various levels. Understanding social media’s power in informing, shaping, and stirring these debates as stakeholders as well as providing a public arena is crucial, especially in light of their global reach and position. While traditional media’s role is often questioned for framing public debates and resulting imaginaries, this paper is questioning what multiple roles SMPs play in shaping users and, hence, public(s) imaginaries of AI? The research design focuses on YouTube as a case study conceptualizing the platform as a multi-sided stakeholder. The operationalization is based on a mixed-method approach, considering four streams of data to analyze YouTube as an AI innovator, technological implementer, media representative, as well as a political mediator. The mixed-methods approach draws on a combination of document analysis, platform analysis as well as content analysis of YouTube content. This brings forth the ongoing negotiation between platform, creator, and users to question the multifaceted role SMPs play in shaping imaginaries of AI. The analysis showed that YouTube acts as a multisided stakeholder and is shaping users’ imaginaries of AI from various angles depending on the intended audience of the public communication, created content, or applied technology.

"2023","A critical appraisal of diversity in digital knowledge production: Segregated inclusion on YouTube"," Diversity in knowledge production is a core challenge facing science communication. Despite extensive works showing how diversity has been undermined in science communication, little is known about to what extent social media augments or hinders diversity for science communication. This article addresses this gap by examining the profile and network diversities of knowledge producers on a popular social media platform—YouTube. We revealed the pattern of the juxtaposition of inclusiveness and segregation in this digital platform, which we define as “segregated inclusion.” We found that diverse profiles are presented in digital knowledge production. However, the network among these knowledge producers reveals the rich-get-richer effect. At the intersection of profile and network diversities, we found a decrease in the overall profile diversity when we moved toward the center of the core producers. This segregated inclusion phenomenon questions how inequalities in science communication are replicated and amplified in relation to digital platforms. ","",""
"2023","Addressing the “Whys” of UK Children’s YouTube Use: A Purposes Approach"," Despite the widespread use of YouTube by children, there has been limited research undertaken on the “why” questions of their use. Past theoretical approaches have framed these questions in terms of broader individual needs and their relation to media use, though this work has mainly focused on adults and adolescents. This article presents relevant findings from a mixed methods study of children’s (aged 0–16) uses of social media in the United Kingdom to consider instead the “purposes” of children’s YouTube use, drawing on: (1) an online family survey; (2) family case studies; (3) child focus groups; and (4) child telephone interviews. “Purpose” is theorized in the article in relation to the ways children themselves make sense of and articulate the reasons they use YouTube or, in the case of parents and carers, for allowing, facilitating, or encouraging their children to use YouTube. Parents tended to frame the purposes of children’s YouTube use more instrumentally, focusing on perceived educational benefits and their own convenience needs. While sharing a focus on instrumental purposes, children sometimes emphasized broader dimensions of purpose, with an increased focus on humor, sensory, and hedonic dimensions. Children’s responses also emphasized the autotelic nature of play. The study foregrounded the extent to which the purposes of others (such as commercial entities) are served by children’s YouTube use. Seven child-centered, parent-centered, and “other” purposes for children’s YouTube use are discussed: cognitive, corporeal, cultural, collaborative, creative, commercial, and convenience. ","",""
"2023","Making a Living in the Creator Economy: A Large-Scale Study of Linking on YouTube"," This article explores monetization and networking strategies within the consolidating creator economy. Through a large-scale study of linking practices on YouTube, we investigate how creators seek to build their online presence across multiple platforms and widen their income streams. In particular, we build on a near-complete sample of 153,000 “elite” YouTube channels with at least 100,000 subscribers, retrieved at the end of 2019, and investigate the URLs found in 137 million video descriptions to analyze traces of these strategies. We first situate our study within relevant literature around the creator economy, the role of platforms, and issues such as social capital building and economic precarity. We then outline our data and analytical approach, followed by a presentation of our findings. The article finishes with a discussion on how monetization and networking strategies via placing URLs in video descriptions have become more important over time, but also differ substantially between channel sizes, content categories, and geographic locations. Our empirical analysis shows that YouTube, as a highly unequal platformed media system, thrives on the economic pressures it exerts on its creators. ","",""
"2023","Institutional Polymorphism: Diversification of Content and Monetization Strategies on YouTube"," Through guidelines, terms of service and algorithmic curation, digital platforms such as YouTube encourage creators to produce content that fits with the commercial goals of the platform. Scholars have argued that this pressure to conform might lead to uniformity, or isomorphism, in the ways organizations manage their presence on platforms. This article contributes to the debate on isomorphism by taking a bottom-up approach and ask to which extent creators on YouTube pursue similar, or different, strategies for uploading and monetizing content. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses of a sample of YouTube channels, we show how content creators adapt to, negotiate with, and defy institutional pressures. In the end, we find greater support for diversification, that is, polymorphism, than concentration in the ways organizations manage their presence on the platform. This has implications for how we understand platform power and integrate institutional theories in communication research. ","",""
"2024","“THESE VLOGS AREN’T REAL”","Introduction – Family Influencers Family vlogging on YouTube is a practice gaining in popularity and scope. An increasing number of couples are giving up their jobs to become full-time “vloggers” or, in industry terms, “creators”. This involves parents filming their everyday lives with their children and uploading the footage to YouTube in daily or weekly instalments for others to watch and respond to. Vlogging reflects a current Western obsession with documenting and recording the self. The digital practice of recording life on YouTube is part of a “broadcast era” (Garde-Hansen et al.). YouTube is a product of a participatory (Jenkins; Burgess and Green), peer-to-peer (Merrin), “memory boom” (Huyssen), where ordinary people are obsessed with recording and saving their lives (Arthur). YouTube, with its infamous byline “Broadcast Yourself”, allows and encourages everyday individuals to document, edit and share their lives, acting as a “memory bank” (Smith and Watson) and building autobiographical archives that we later use to identify ourselves (Eakin).  The success of family vloggers is in their presentation of “ordinary” life that is both relatable and relational, as it invites connection with others (Kennedy """"Arriving""""; Strangelove). As Michael Strangelove wrote in his seminal work Watching YouTube, the appeal of YouTube “is that it’s authentic and about people” and “there is nothing more interesting to real people … than authentic stories about other real people” (65). It is the sharing of everyday ordinary life by everyday ordinary people that makes vlogging significant. This type of content is raw and intimate, deeply vulnerable, and incredibly popular (Kennedy """"Arriving""""). As ordinary lives gain in popularity, sometimes reaching mass audiences of millions, the practice of vlogging has been professionalised and commercialised culminating in a new industry known as the influencer (Chen et al.; Abidin). Influencers can be understood as microcelebrities (Abidin; Marwick; Turner). Their professionalisation is largely due to their ability to influence the consumer behaviour of their audiences. Brands pay influencers to include their products and experiences in their social media content, in this case, YouTube videos. This form of sponsored content has become the main source of income for many influencers (Chen et al.; Zimmerman). Vlogging, therefore, serves family influencers in multiple ways: as an identity-forming record of family life, and a commercially viable consumable product. These competing functions of the vlog are equally important and must be carefully managed. I argue elsewhere that vlogging is an important identity-forming practice (Kennedy """"Transformative""""). The process of recording and sharing everyday life brings the subject into being (Kennedy Becoming; """"Arriving""""). Vlogging is an example of automedia (Kennedy and Maguire): the convergence of self with networked digital media and all its participants, including platform, technology, viewers, brands, and products (Kennedy Becoming). While this convergence has afforded new narratives and identities, it has also conflated audiences with markets, and intimacy and authenticity with commercial gain. Authenticity is critical to the social success of vlogging identities and narratives, and it is precisely this authenticity that is attractive to brands as a lucrative marketing strategy. Family influencers must therefore carefully manage their authenticity to maintain their relatability with the audience, while also generating an income for their chosen profession.  In this article I explore a particular type of content that one British vlogging family, The Michalaks, have developed for their sponsored content. They call this type of video content “Silkey”. Silkeys are heavily stylised, affective montages of family life. They sit in stark contrast to the normal conventions of family vlogging: “the highly contextualised snapshots of everyday lives” which are “raw, unfiltered, spontaneous, and more intimate” (Abidin 4). Rather, Silkeys are more like cinematic feature films offering beautiful montages of idyllic family life, often shot in holiday destinations, and usually sponsored (paid for by brands). In a social media context built on a value of authenticity (Strangelove; Kennedy Becoming), where audiences are quick to reject anything they deem inauthentic (Baym), I explore how The Michalaks get away with the Silkey—how they maintain their authenticity as a real family while offering their viewers a sponsored product. Ultimately, I demonstrate that The Michalaks succeed with Silkeys in two ways: firstly, by calling out the Silkey as inauthentic, and secondly, by inviting the audience to participate in their construction. Using a method of virtual ethnography (Hine), I draw on sixteen months of footage and social media engagement by The Michalaks to demonstrate the strategies they use to maintain their authenticity as family vloggers. I conclude that in addition to its individual, creative, and commercial functions, the Silkey also performs an important function as a protective strategy for all members of the family, but especially their son, Grayson. Family Video Diaries  Vlogging, like blogging before it, is significant because it allows parents to share the “unexciting, everyday, in between stuff” (Lopez). Like blogging, vlogging is a “radical act” (Lopez) that brings the everyday domestic experience into the public sphere allowing parents to negotiate their roles and identities in real time and in public. While this has been celebrated and extensively explored among mothers (see Lopez; Morrison; Moravec; Kennedy Becoming), the same is true for families who participate in sharing life and finding connections and community online. The resulting content is intimate and diary-like (Kennedy """"Arriving""""), leading vloggers such as The Michalaks to call their videos “family video diaries” (see fig. 1). Many families say they begin vlogging in order to “document life” and “making memories to look back on”, and this expressed motivation continues throughout their presence on YouTube. The Michalaks share this motivation. In a question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) video, in which Stefan and Hannah sit in front of the camera in their living room and answer preselected questions from their viewers, Stefan encourages everyone to vlog:  I think that if you have the opportunity to vlog then you should vlog because you’re creating an archive for you to watch back in years to come. So what if it’s been saturated, it’s a good thing to do it’s a good thing to have to look back on. (IT’S Q&amp;A TIME)  Later in the same video, Hannah says that she uses the videos to revisit their child’s milestones, and she discusses the value of having a record of their younger selves that they can watch back in the future. “I think when we’re like 80 … it’ll be nice to watch the videos back of our younger selves” (IT’S Q&amp;A TIME). The first few seconds of many of The Michalak vlogs begin with the same shot, their channel name “The Michalaks” underlined with “family video diaries” (see fig. 1). Accompanying this opening shot is Grayson’s laugh (see FALLEN IN LOVE), reminiscent of the Nickelodeon laugh. The channel name over “family video diaries” is also the banner on their channel home page.  Fig. 1: Screenshot, THESE VLOGS AREN’T REAL. The use of the word diary is significant as these family diaries are recorded daily and uploaded in weekly instalments comprising Monday through Friday. Family video diaries provide an archive of everyday family life, of children growing older, and of parents developing themselves. In this way, vlogs emulate the diary as an arena for the self: a place for self-negotiation, self-knowledge, and self-improvement (Cardell; Kennedy Becoming). Stefan often has heartfelt conversations with the camera, telling his viewers what he thinks about the issues facing the world and comparing himself to who he used to be. Family vlogs, like diaries and journals, encourage self-reflection and continual development. Even if the content is menial daily activities, the recording of them is significant as an archive of the self. Unlike the private recordings of the diary, or private storing of family objects to which memories are connected, vlogs are public and are heavily influenced by the technologies used to create them and the media through which they are shared. Vlogs, therefore, extend the genre of the published diary online, as explored by scholars such as Kylie Cardell. Importantly, these public family video diaries are shaped and influenced by all participants in the network, including technology, viewers, brands, and products (Kennedy Becoming). The raw, intimate, daily representations of family life are incredibly popular, and this popularity makes them a lucrative marketing opportunity for brands. Vloggers have enjoyed rapid success in recent years, building large communities with millions of followers (Chen et al.). This success has resulted in the professionalisation and commercialisation of vlogging (Abidin; Hou; Chen et al.) and the age of the influencer and microcelebrity (Marwick; Turner). Crystal Abidin writes that “family influencers on social media are a new genre of micro-celebrity … chiefly premised on being ordinary, everyday, and mundane” (4). Unlike the mainstream entertainment industry, their content production is self-directed and shared on social media (Abidin). The professional role of family influencers significantly impacts their family video diaries. “Make It Silkey” Peppered throughout their family video diaries are what The Michalaks call “Silkeys” (fig. 2). Silkeys are heavily produced, aesthetically beautiful, affective montages of family life. They include filters, multiple camera angles, and special effects. They require specialised camera equipment, and rather than narration or background noise, they are often edited with emotive music to enhance their cinematic and affective quality. Silkeys sit in stark contrast to the raw, unfiltered, intimate snapshots of family life and they serve The Michalaks in multiple ways.  Fig. 2: Screenshot, THESE VLOGS AREN’T REAL. Silkeys serve The Michalaks as an opportunity for individual creative expression and development—particularly for Stefan, an aspiring filmmaker. They form a significant part of the family’s success, as they attract both sponsorship and views. Silkeys could be understood as what Abidin describes as “anchor” material, that is material “produced with more care and effort, utilizing higher end equipment such as moving image recorders, audio mixers, lighting, and props” (4). Abidin suggests that anchor material is the primary product of family influencers, generating the most views and success. In contrast, “filler” material features “raw, unfiltered, spontaneous, and more intimate” (4) snapshots of domesticity, which Abidin argues is crucial to maintain an impression of an amateur. Abidin’s discussion of anchor material and filler material outlines two different kinds of videos produced by family influencers, where one (anchor) is the money-making material and the other (filler) is the authenticity-maintenance (or social-survival) material. The Silkey is different, however, because rather than creating separate videos for Silkeys, The Michalaks use Silkeys throughout their video diaries. Silkeys are short montages that feature within the family vlog. Filler material bookends the Silkey, highlighting the contrast between the two. While some researchers argue that filler material is carefully constructed to create an impression of the amateur, and exists entirely for the purpose of maintaining authenticity and relatability (Hamilton; Abidin), I suggest that The Michalaks have alternative, and much more successful, ways of maintaining authenticity (discussed in the last section). And importantly, rather than simply generating an income, the Silkey serves critical functions in addition to sponsored entertainment. One of the most important functions of the Silkey for The Michalaks is as a strategy to protect their son, Grayson. Silkey as Protective Strategy  Fig. 3: Screenshot, FALLEN IN LOVE. The highly stylised, skilfully constructed nature of the Silkey protects The Michalaks because it removes a layer of intimacy, creating distance between the vlogger and the viewer. Silkey representations of family life omit the tantrums, parental frustrations, and logistical mishaps inherent in family life. This is consistent with studies that demonstrate how parents manage the information they share about their children by limiting their posts to depictions of idealised family life (Blum-Ross and Livingstone; Ammari et al.; Chalklen and Anderson; Archer). The selective nature of Silkeys protects all members of The Michalak family, but particularly their son, Grayson. As Stefan suggests, part of the motivation for creating Silkeys is to respect Grayson’s privacy, as the Silkey is designed to offer a representation of Grayson that he can be proud of, rather than embarrassed by in the future.  We respect our privacy, but we respect Grayson’s a lot more than we respect ours. I mean, that’s why we do Silkeys. That’s why we spend so much time and effort on the videos is because, yeah, [Hannah interjects: he doesn’t have a choice] he doesn’t have a choice. We don’t want him growing up and being like ‘why’d you put out this crap?’ (IT’S Q&amp;A TIME)  In a time where children’s privacy is increasingly of concern, as their world is “digital-by-default” (Stoilova et al.) and their digital footprint begins before they are born (Leaver; Leaver and Highfield; Tiidenberg and Baym; Stoilova et al.), families must consider how to navigate their children’s privacy. One of the most concerning aspects of family vlogging is a child’s inability to give informed consent, and it is now becoming clear that parental sharing of children online – or “sharenting” – can cause children embarrassment and distress (Hiniker et al.; Chalkson and Anderson; Ammari et al.). It can also have serious consequences on the child’s sense of self as it denies them the agency of crafting their own digital identity. danah boyd writes, “just because people are adopting tools that radically reshape their relationship to privacy does not mean they are interested in giving up their privacy” (52). Social network sites, such as YouTube, challenge people’s sense of control over their personal information (boyd). As more and more people choose to share their lives online “we need to examine people’s strategies for negotiating control” (52). For The Michalaks, the Silkey is one such method of control. Importantly, The Michalaks recognise that their sharenting and strategies for protecting their son’s privacy will change over time. Consistent with studies that find that the parental right to share shifts over time as children get older (Blum-Ross and Livingstone), The Michalaks recognise that their protective strategies, and content, will change as Grayson gets older, and may one day exclude him altogether.  Hannah: I think we would probably just change the style of how we were vlogging. It would be more about what we were doing, and I think we would just both totally respect that. Once he has a choice, if he didn’t want to do it then of course we’re not going to force him to do it. It’s his life, if he doesn’t want to be on camera then I would never force him to be on camera.Stefan interjects: No way. No way. (IT’S Q&amp;A TIME)  The Silkey not only serves as a strategy to protect their son Grayson, but it also protects Stefan and Hannah, to some degree. Although many of their videos are raw and intimate, the Silkey gives Stefan and Hannah a brief reprieve from being vulnerable. I argue elsewhere that maintaining the level of vulnerability and intimacy that vlogging requires is unsustainable long term, and as a result, many vloggers tend to disappear from the space (Kennedy """"Arriving""""). For the Michalaks, the Silkey extends their longevity as it allows them to present both intimate and heavily stylised representations of everyday life. However, YouTube audiences are renowned for rejecting lives and identities that are inauthentic, and therefore Silkeys must be carefully managed. Managing Authenticity  Maintaining an impression of authenticity is a critical component in all human interactions and this is particularly true online. Erving Goffman called this “performance management” in his seminal work The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Managing the performance of authenticity online is especially important for influencers as their success in the space, with both viewers and brands, is dependent upon it. The Michalaks manage their authenticity through transparency and by inviting participation. The Michalaks use disclosure and transparency throughout their vlogs to signal the inauthenticity of Silkeys. They use titles such as “THESE VLOGS AREN’T REAL” (figs. 1 and 2) which underline the entire video, both during Silkey segments and raw segments. They include “AD” at the end of the title videos that include sponsored content (figs. 1, 2, and 3) to indicate paid advertisements present in the video. They also offer reminders to the viewer during the vlog, as seen in fig. 2 “make it silkey,” signalling that the content is purposefully crafted. Lastly, the name they choose to call this type of content—Silkey—implies a product that is smooth, indulgent, luxurious, expensive, and sexy. All these disclosures suggest a deliberate attempt at transparency, which researchers have found is the most successful method to manage authenticity among influencers. In their study of the sponsored videos of 200 influencers on Bilibili (one of the largest user-generated video-sharing platforms in China), Chen et al. found that sponsorship disclosure resulted in higher audience engagement. Rather than putting viewers off, they found that “sponsorship disclosure (a transparency-based strategy), alone, and in combination with platform-generated disclosure, is associated with higher digital engagement with sponsored influencer videos” (199).  In addition to disclosures, The Michalaks extend their transparency by juxtaposing the “real” with the “Silkey”, constantly reminding the viewer that the two are different. A Silkey montage might be followed by Stefan discussing the difficulties of shooting the Silkey, or the effort that went into it, or the painstaking job of editing it. Within the same vlog, the sleepy idyllic Grayson (as he was presented in the Silkey) may later be referred to as a “savage” or a “penis” (FALLEN IN LOVE). In their Q&amp;A video, Stefan refers to the Silkey version of their lives as “the latte version” (IT’S Q&amp;A TIME). Discussing the conscious crafting of the vlog reminds the viewer of its nature as a product for consumption, and rather than putting the viewer off, it increases viewer engagement as the viewer is invited to view the process of creation as well as the product. Not only do viewers get to view the process of creation, but The Michalaks invite the viewers to participate in the construction of their vlogs by making decisions about their content. For example, in one vlog, Stefan introduced a new character to the family, his brother, Keith (EVERYTHING CHANGED). As evident in the side-by-side images of Stefan and Keith (see Figure 4), Keith is Stefan dressed in a wig, with glasses and using an unidentifiable accent. The segment featuring Keith was an attempt at a new type of content, which Stefan tries often (both for content and his own creative development). Shortly after the vlog featuring Keith, Stefan released a Twitter poll asking viewers whether they would like to see more of Keith (fig. 5). Considering the result of the poll was precisely 50/50 (fig. 5), Stefan decided that Keith was “more divisive than Brexit” and concluded that Keith had “to go” (CAMERA STOLEN?). Although Keith was never a serious addition to the family, the viewers were given ownership over the content they consume.  Fig. 4: Screenshots, EVERYTHING CHANGED.  Fig. 5: Screenshots, Twitter/X @StefMichalak. By openly discussing the editing process and inviting the viewers to make decisions about the vlog, The Michalaks are effectively inviting the viewers “backstage” to participate in the “act” of producing family vlogs. The viewers become collaborators and co-constructors of the family video diaries, which moderates the question of authenticity. While Abidin suggests that “backstage” material is equally constructed and managed, I suggest that all performances of self are carefully constructed and managed, and it is the viewers who work together with the vlogger to shape and maintain authentic narratives online. Conclusion  Silkeys serve important functions for The Michalaks as an avenue for personal creative expression and development, as a commercial product that attracts sponsorship and generates an income, and as a protective strategy. The heavily crafted nature of Silkeys removes a layer of intimacy which is usually demanded in family vlogging, giving Stefan and Hannah a brief reprieve from being raw and vulnerable, and protecting Grayson from future embarrassment. Considering that YouTube is built on a core value of authenticity, and sponsored content directly challenges the authenticity of a vlogger’s content and identity, The Michalaks must strategically manage their authenticity despite their Silkeys. They accomplish this using two key strategies. Firstly, they use their vlog titles, and their diary-like content surrounding Silkey montages, to call out the Silkey as inauthentic. The inclusion of behind-the-scenes footage, discussion about the difficulty in, and labour of, capturing and editing the Silkey, notes within the vlogs, and the inclusion of “AD” in vlog titles, all work together to remind the viewer that Silkeys are constructed. By being transparent, disclosing their sponsorships and juxtaposing sponsored content with raw, unfiltered content, The Michalaks maintain viewer and brand engagement. The second strategy is to invite their viewers to participate in the decision-making about, and construction of, their vlogs. By inviting their audience to participate in decisions about the type of content and characters they like to see, the viewers become co-authors and co-constructors of the family video diaries, moderating the question of authenticity as all participants in the space contribute to creating the vlogs. The consistent use of these two key strategies has allowed The Michalaks to maintain their success on YouTube for over a decade, and they show no signs of stopping.

"2024","‘Kids, these YouTubers are stealing from you’: influencers and online discussions about taxes","ABSTRACT This article's main aim is to analyse public discourses about tax avoidance in Spain by studying the scandal stirred up by the announcement by ElRubius (the most popular YouTuber in Spain, with 40.3 million subscribers) that he was moving to Andorra to pay lower taxes. To fulfil this aim, we use thematic analysis to study the most viewed and commented videos posted on YouTube by both YouTubers and the traditional media, as well as their comments sections, to identify how taxes are defined, how YouTubers and their audiences are portrayed and what forms of identification these stories offer. Our results show that ElRubius’ announcement sparked a polarised debate. On the one hand, traditional media framed the debate as a moral one, attacked ElRubius using a ‘naming and shaming’ strategy and defended redistributive taxes as a means of financing public services and achieving wealth redistribution. On the other hand, YouTubers defended a neoliberal agenda by portraying taxes as a burden, promoting self-interest and denouncing the Spanish state as too big, inefficient and corrupt. The analysis of the comments shows how the traditional media strategy of shaming ElRubius failed, as audiences mostly identified with him and endorsed the discourse of YouTubers who defended him. Thus, although the welfare state is still very much legitimised in Spain, we can see how new hegemonies are being created and promoted in the context of social media.","",""
"2024","Child idols in South Korea and beyond: Manufacturing young stars at the intersection of the K-pop and influencer industries"," This article explores how the influencer and traditional entertainment industries are converging in the “child idol” phenomenon—a celebrity genre and system that had existed prior to the emergence of the influencer industry but has now been remixed with the influencer industry’s convention and refashioned as the stepping stone to lubricate children’s journeys toward professional idol careers in the wake of K-pop culture. We examine the “child idol” phenomenon as a case study wherein children perform as a younger version of K-pop idols under entertainment agencies’ in-house training systems, with calibrated construction of social media personae by influencer agencies and their parents. Despite ongoing attempts to protect children in the industry, undertaken by the Korean government and human rights organizations, the exploitative environment of child stars becomes even more serious as it becomes a template adopted by other countries emulating the success of K-pop.
