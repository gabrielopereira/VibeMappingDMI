"2013","Performance Analysis of OCDMA System with Unipolar Walsh Coding","The success of a radiofrequency in CDMA depends on well designed bipolar codes with good correlation properties. These sequences of (+1, -1) values exist in the RF domain because the phase of the electromagnetic field can be detected directly. The unipolar optical coding is studied as optical system is nonnegative and unipolar in nature and detects and processes the signal intensity. The strict orthogonality of bipolar Walsh codes shows cross correlations to be equal to zero while auto correlations have large magnitudes. Unipolar Walsh coding have been studied and constructed in the previous published papers. In this work, the performance of the proposed codes has been analyzed and it has been observed that performance is better than modified frequency hopping & Hadamard code, Random Diagonal codes. Theoretical results for SNR and BER and Simulation results are shown.","",""

"2014","Throughput, Stability and Fairness of Carrier- Sense Multiple Access with Cooperative Diversity","Cooperative diversity has been identified as a potential candidate for boosting the physical (PHY) layer performance of future wireless networks. However, several issues remain open today in the design of an appropriate medium access control (MAC) layer for this type of system. This paper attempts to partially fill this gap by addressing the MACPHY cross-layer design of a class of carrier-sense multiple access protocols where collision-free transmissions are assisted by the potential cooperative retransmission of the remaining silent terminals in the network. Unlike previous works, the analysis is focused on full asymmetrical settings, where terminals experience different channel and queuing statistics. To achieve this goal, a packet reception model is here proposed for cooperative schemes where the relaying phase is activated only when the reception of previous (re)transmissions has failed. Closed-form expressions of correct reception probability are derived for Rayleigh fading channels assuming that correct reception occurs only when the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds a reception threshold. This reception model allows for a MAC-layer design aware of PHY-layer information, and vice versa, PHY-layer enhancement and activation using MAClayer information. The boundary of the throughput region (i.e., the set of all achievable throughput values) is derived in a parametric closed-form expression using a multi-objective optimization approach. A method for deriving a nonparametric form was further proposed, which allows for a geometric interpretation of the two-user case. Stability features such as backlog user distribution and backlog delay are evaluated by using a novel Markov model for asymmetrical systems. Fairness is evaluated by means of the Gini index, which is a metric commonly used in the field of economics to measure income inequality. The protocol is shown to outperform its non-cooperative counterparts under diverse network conditions that are here discussed.","",""

At first, for different number of relays and transmission rates, the outage probability of five relay selection schemes are compared in two-way Amplify and Forward (AF) relay networks. Simulation results show that the performance of MMS, OS and HS schemes are approximately equal and their performances are higher than two other schemes, MSS and NS. These results show the effect of relay selection scheme on two-way AF case which is not exactly the same as results obtained from Decode and Forward (DF) case. As the second part of this research, different power allocation scenarios are examined.

In this connection, researchers have recently turned up their attention towards chaotic communication systems and golden codes for its attractive benefits. This consequently had motivated us for two new proposals namely: code shiftedquadrature chaos shift keying (CS-QCSK) and modified golden codes with low complex decoder. The Code Shifted-Quadrature Chaos shift Keying (CS-QCSK) modulation technique with its code domain approach has proven to be the best among the conventional chaotic modulation schemes [4].

"2017","Performance improvement in Multistage Multiuser DS-CDMA system over Rayleigh fading channel","Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) system is well known wireless technology. Multiple Access Interference (MAI) is a major problem in DS-CDMA system caused by its users. When the number of users increases the system performance gradually decreases especially in fading environment. In this paper, multistage multiuser detection techniques were introduced to detect the users data in presence of MAI. Multistage Multiuser Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) technique gives good performance but biased decision statistic problem is raised due to imperfect estimation of MAI as number of stages increases. To overcome biased decision statistic problem by Multistage Multiuser Partial Parallel Interference Cancellation (PPIC) technique is used to reduce the MAI partially stage by stage. But the problem is in PIC and PPIC computational complexity is very high when the number of stages increases. The computational complexity is minimized by using Multistage Difference PIC (DPIC) detection technique is based on the convergence nature of interference cancellation. Multistage Multiuser Partial Differencing Parallel Interference Cancellation (PDPIC) Technique is the combination of Difference PIC and Partial PIC.

The Secondary Stations can be simple because all of them can communicate at one frequency. The communication between Primary Station and the Control Unit will be simple as well and it can be either wired or wireless. To cover whole area it is necessary to transmit with relatively high power for both Primary Station and Secondary Station to enable low error rate. Also the transmission speed will be smaller due to greater distances. The other disadvantage of this solution is the danger that the Primary Station can be broken and therefore no possibility of the data delivery to any Secondary Station.
